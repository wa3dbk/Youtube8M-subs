sorry

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:18.110 

Oh

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.809 

so<00:03:19.120> there's<00:03:20.189> it's<00:03:21.189> kind<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.459> like<00:03:21.640> the

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
so there's it's kind of like the

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.520 
so there's it's kind of like the
bluegrass<00:03:22.299> scale<00:03:22.659> really<00:03:22.989> it's<00:03:23.140> like<00:03:23.349> the

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
bluegrass scale really it's like the

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.949 
bluegrass scale really it's like the
major<00:03:23.739> pentatonic<00:03:24.150> with<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.299> Blues<00:03:25.510> note<00:03:25.780> in

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
major pentatonic with the Blues note in

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:33.210 
major pentatonic with the Blues note in
it<00:03:26.079> so<00:03:27.040> when<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.459> goes<00:03:27.549> to<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.760> a<00:03:32.069> you<00:03:33.069> can<00:03:33.190> just

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
it so when it goes to the a you can just

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.100 
it so when it goes to the a you can just
run<00:03:33.640> up<00:03:33.790> that<00:03:33.970> scale<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:34.329> it<00:03:34.599> looks<00:03:34.750> like<00:03:34.810> this

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
run up that scale and it looks like this

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.509 
run up that scale and it looks like this
there's<00:03:35.470> there's<00:03:35.920> two<00:03:36.099> different<00:03:36.280> options

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
there's there's two different options

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.830 
there's there's two different options
one<00:03:37.530> got<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.560> a<00:03:38.709> chord<00:03:39.510> then<00:03:40.510> you're<00:03:40.720> just

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
one got the a chord then you're just

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.780 
one got the a chord then you're just
gonna<00:03:41.049> go<00:03:41.200> right<00:03:41.379> here

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.569 

which<00:03:46.790> would<00:03:46.969> be<00:03:46.999> three<00:03:47.569> four<00:03:47.959> and<00:03:48.680> then

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
which would be three four and then

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:55.900 
which would be three four and then
you're<00:03:49.879> still<00:03:50.060> holding<00:03:50.329> the<00:03:50.420> cord

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.100 

so<00:03:56.910> two<00:03:56.970> for<00:03:57.300> two<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.910> two<00:04:00.150> up<00:04:00.330> top<00:04:00.540> or<00:04:00.840> whole

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
so two for two the two up top or whole

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:10.280 
so two for two the two up top or whole
cord<00:04:03.830> so<00:04:04.830> check<00:04:05.010> it<00:04:05.100> out

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:18.520 

you

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:27.680 

you

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.110 

the<00:04:28.690> other<00:04:28.840> option<00:04:29.290> is<00:04:29.410> to<00:04:29.440> open<00:04:29.680> a<00:04:29.980> and<00:04:30.250> then

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
the other option is to open a and then

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:43.290 
the other option is to open a and then
two<00:04:31.540> three<00:04:32.440> four<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:34.930> four<00:04:35.610> top<00:04:41.910> which<00:04:42.910> I<00:04:43.060> think

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
two three four to four top which I think

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.800 
two three four to four top which I think
I<00:04:44.260> heard<00:04:44.980> Tony<00:04:45.400> rice<00:04:45.760> do<00:04:46.150> it<00:04:46.240> that<00:04:46.420> way

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
I heard Tony rice do it that way

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.740 
I heard Tony rice do it that way
check<00:04:47.770> out<00:04:47.890> Tony<00:04:48.250> rice<00:04:48.610> if<00:04:48.910> your<00:04:49.090> don't<00:04:49.600> know

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
check out Tony rice if your don't know

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.150 
check out Tony rice if your don't know
you<00:04:50.170> know<00:04:50.260> if<00:04:50.410> you<00:04:50.500> don't<00:04:50.620> know<00:04:50.740> bluegrass

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
you know if you don't know bluegrass

00:04:51.160 --> 00:05:03.220 
you know if you don't know bluegrass
that's<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:51.700> guy<00:04:51.820> that<00:04:51.850> to<00:04:52.690> check<00:04:53.230> out<00:04:54.450> so

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.000 

you

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.030 

open<00:05:08.010> G<00:05:08.280> fourth<00:05:09.090> fret<00:05:09.360> on<00:05:09.390> the<00:05:09.510> D<00:05:09.780> D<00:05:10.710> chord

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
open G fourth fret on the D D chord

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:31.760 
open G fourth fret on the D D chord
that's<00:05:11.490> just<00:05:11.790> the<00:05:12.180> vocal<00:05:12.510> melody

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:41.279 

you

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:51.400 

you

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.440 

and<00:05:51.920> then<00:05:52.070> that's<00:05:52.250> the<00:05:52.370> classic<00:05:53.150> little

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
and then that's the classic little

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.200 
and then that's the classic little
turnaround<00:05:53.780> lick<00:05:54.110> there

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.629 

and<00:05:57.960> so<00:05:58.139> it's<00:05:58.289> hammering<00:05:58.710> from<00:05:58.889> three<00:05:59.190> to<00:05:59.340> four

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 
and so it's hammering from three to four

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:04.460 
and so it's hammering from three to four
on<00:06:00.000> the<00:06:00.539> d-string<00:06:02.180> but<00:06:03.180> then<00:06:03.330> we<00:06:03.479> want<00:06:03.750> the

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
on the d-string but then we want the

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.140 
on the d-string but then we want the
index<00:06:04.949> on<00:06:05.160> the<00:06:05.280> 2nd<00:06:05.639> fret<00:06:05.759> of<00:06:05.910> the<00:06:05.940> g<00:06:06.180> planted

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
index on the 2nd fret of the g planted

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.100 
index on the 2nd fret of the g planted
see<00:06:09.150> that<00:06:11.180> so<00:06:12.180> if<00:06:12.300> they<00:06:12.389> bring<00:06:12.539> out<00:06:12.660> together<00:06:13.020> I

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
see that so if they bring out together I

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.570 
see that so if they bring out together I
think<00:06:13.229> that's<00:06:13.470> a<00:06:13.590> little<00:06:13.770> more<00:06:13.979> traditional

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
think that's a little more traditional

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:21.469 
think that's a little more traditional
sound<00:06:16.520> but<00:06:17.520> then<00:06:17.759> what<00:06:18.090> we<00:06:18.180> got<00:06:18.300> to<00:06:18.419> do<00:06:20.479> we're

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
sound but then what we got to do we're

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.390 
sound but then what we got to do we're
going<00:06:21.630> to<00:06:21.690> roll<00:06:22.020> that<00:06:22.380> index<00:06:22.800> back<00:06:23.039> over

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
going to roll that index back over

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.640 
going to roll that index back over
because<00:06:23.610> we're<00:06:23.759> going<00:06:23.850> to<00:06:23.940> do<00:06:24.060> a<00:06:24.090> pull<00:06:24.389> off

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
because we're going to do a pull off

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:31.670 
because we're going to do a pull off
from<00:06:25.650> 3<00:06:26.150> to<00:06:27.150> 0<00:06:27.449> on<00:06:27.960> the<00:06:28.080> D<00:06:28.229> string<00:06:30.199> do<00:06:31.199> a<00:06:31.229> D<00:06:31.440> chord

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
from 3 to 0 on the D string do a D chord

00:06:31.680 --> 00:07:01.660 
from 3 to 0 on the D string do a D chord
so<00:06:31.919> it<00:06:31.979> looks<00:06:32.130> like<00:06:32.190> this<00:06:32.430> oh<00:06:33.800> sorry
