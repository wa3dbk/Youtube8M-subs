niori other server and I would say let's
hop<00:00:18.330> over<00:00:18.600> into<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.900> end<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.550> that's<00:00:20.550> how<00:00:20.699> the

hop over into the end and that's how the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.529 
hop over into the end and that's how the
end<00:00:21.210> looks<00:00:21.539> now<00:00:22.670> before<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.730> was<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:24.119> with<00:00:24.330> n

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
end looks now before it was just with n

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.200 
end looks now before it was just with n
stone<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.230> obsidian<00:00:25.740> now<00:00:26.039> it's<00:00:26.220> like<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
stone and obsidian now it's like the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.589 
stone and obsidian now it's like the
overworld<00:00:27.779> or<00:00:28.109> maybe<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.250> sky<00:00:29.820> world<00:00:30.090> kind<00:00:30.449> of

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
overworld or maybe a sky world kind of

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.359 
overworld or maybe a sky world kind of
because<00:00:30.900> it's<00:00:31.170> everything's<00:00:31.830> floating<00:00:32.130> in

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
because it's everything's floating in

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
dragons flying around and not just one

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.100 
dragons flying around and not just one
but<00:00:39.210> also<00:00:39.750> five<00:00:40.500> or<00:00:40.800> six<00:00:41.160> not<00:00:41.340> quite<00:00:41.520> sure<00:00:41.550> and

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
but also five or six not quite sure and

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.600 
but also five or six not quite sure and
which<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.230> quite<00:00:43.379> cool<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.860> can<00:00:44.129> make<00:00:44.280> your

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
which is quite cool so you can make your

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.330 
which is quite cool so you can make your
ender<00:00:45.059> dragon<00:00:45.420> fight<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.050> softness<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.129> want

ender dragon fight and softness you want
to<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.090> think<00:00:48.120> if<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.989> discover<00:00:49.379> more

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
to and I think if you discover more

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.850 
to and I think if you discover more
chunkier<00:00:50.480> more<00:00:51.480> at<00:00:51.719> an<00:00:51.930> editor<00:00:52.469> Ender<00:00:52.829> Dragon

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
chunkier more at an editor Ender Dragon

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.900 
chunkier more at an editor Ender Dragon
will<00:00:53.309> spawn<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:55.039> sometimes<00:00:56.039> they<00:00:56.280> also<00:00:56.309> drop

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
will spawn and sometimes they also drop

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.229 
will spawn and sometimes they also drop
dragon<00:00:57.360> eggs<00:00:57.600> with<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.410> chance<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.609> one<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.030> ten

portal so you can use it in the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.210 
portal so you can use it in the
overworld<00:01:45.600> which<00:01:45.899> would<00:01:46.530> be<00:01:46.680> kind<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.009> awesome

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
overworld which would be kind of awesome

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.990 
overworld which would be kind of awesome
to<00:01:48.149> travel<00:01:48.750> out<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:49.530> faster<00:01:49.979> than<00:01:50.100> horses

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
to travel out it's faster than horses

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.200 
to travel out it's faster than horses

was the other direction and yeah that's
kind<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.009> everything<00:02:02.490> we<00:02:02.820> found<00:02:03.119> out<00:02:03.450> herbs

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
kind of everything we found out herbs

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.950 
kind of everything we found out herbs
covered<00:02:04.259> by<00:02:04.799> now<00:02:05.100> which<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:06.000> new<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.540> as<00:02:06.810> you

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
covered by now which is new and as you

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.419 
covered by now which is new and as you
can<00:02:07.110> see<00:02:07.140> it's<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.500> little<00:02:07.680> bit<00:02:07.770> buggy<00:02:07.979> with<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
can see it's a little bit buggy with the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.410 
can see it's a little bit buggy with the
flying<00:02:08.759> they<00:02:09.500> hopefully<00:02:10.500> fix<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.430> next

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
flying they hopefully fix it in the next

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.970 
flying they hopefully fix it in the next
snapshot<00:02:12.780> maybe<00:02:12.990> there<00:02:13.230> will<00:02:13.349> be<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.560> beast

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
snapshot maybe there will be a beast

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.640 
snapshot maybe there will be a beast
snapshot<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.580> week<00:02:14.849> because<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:16.110> guess<00:02:16.349> a<00:02:16.380> lot

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
snapshot this week because I guess a lot

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.589 
snapshot this week because I guess a lot
of<00:02:16.680> people<00:02:16.800> will<00:02:17.370> discover<00:02:17.940> this<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.300> if<00:02:18.480> we

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
of people will discover this and if we

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.229 
of people will discover this and if we
go<00:02:18.720> out<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.959> here<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.950> can<00:02:20.190> see<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.550> he<00:02:21.060> will

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
go out of here you can see that he will

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.380 
go out of here you can see that he will
stay<00:02:21.630> in<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.989> position<00:02:22.380> as<00:02:22.770> long<00:02:23.520> as<00:02:23.790> nobody

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
stay in the position as long as nobody

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.150 
stay in the position as long as nobody
will<00:02:24.660> get<00:02:25.170> untie<00:02:25.470> him<00:02:25.590> he<00:02:25.800> will<00:02:25.890> stay<00:02:26.130> here

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.460 
will get untie him he will stay here
even<00:02:26.910> though<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.239> unload<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.870> chunks<00:02:28.319> I

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
even though you unload the chunks I

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.710 
even though you unload the chunks I
think<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.220> if<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:29.940> come<00:02:30.090> back<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.569> end

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
think and if you come back to the end

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.600 
think and if you come back to the end
then<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:31.020> can<00:02:31.200> just<00:02:31.350> write<00:02:31.590> them<00:02:31.800> right<00:02:32.340> click

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
then you can just write them right click

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.910 
then you can just write them right click
