00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 you need to take care of 1 50 cats of your 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.400
 neighbor and sheila has no cat and 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:24.420
 you actually find a portal to 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:25.650
 another world and how to connect godard 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.900
 capitol 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.269
 the novel the author ml vieri we 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.219
 to promote a young woman who 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.770
 during their vacation on the subway to shop 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.620
 Sao Paulo has an unexpected encounter with 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.420
 the figure of his past extremely 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.860
 despite the fact that years of 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.559
 for the last time 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.710
 he immediately recognizes and emanates 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.780
 evil and sinister makes an order 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.980
 I remember that you are a girl with much 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.329
 Appreciation for the animals is necessary to travel 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:59.670
 You can take care of my 50 cats. 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.039
 I particularly would not accept but the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.629
 that the government accepts and when they 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.299
 home to take care of the kittens not 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.210
 I found no cat, I want meeting 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.210
 in fact it is a compendium with hundreds 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.820
 of maps and inscriptions of the glue nothing 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.759
 understands nor does it contact the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.930
 doctor felipe nor is a renowned 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.830
 specialist cartographer documents 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.799
 ancient 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:28.680
 they make a meeting of that more dominate 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.970
 the maps in which he is the son and I 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.590
 half says they are scrolls 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.140
 photographs that can tell stories 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.340
 about the beginning of our 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.619
 civilization 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.049
 he gets very excited and solved 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.570
 perform all the hundreds of old 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.740
 friends that had only there that only he is that 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.579
 the government are not enough to 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.220
 hit all that you do 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.200
 It's easy, it's just the big names of several 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.000
 branches of science that combines the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.259
 doctor felipe joins them people 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.770
 three essence friends go science comes 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.590
 I imagined it happens, everyone will stop at 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.079
 strange and unknown world and from 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.060
 hence the story I will not tell the 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.860
 really here in the videos that will enable 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.750
 We talk about now, I hope we can 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.989
 finding books and characters from the 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.060
 narrative but I will not talk to 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.180
 respect of the edition made by the publisher 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.489
 d'arco which was by far the biggest problem 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.099
 that I had while reading the book is 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:33.060
 very very very very badly revised 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.800
 is not champion that turning is not the thing 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.170
 It is so serious that hinder 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.300
 Book can not really use 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.420
 count a comma absurdity wrong with 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.090
 words exchanged uppercase repetitions 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.629
 corks and even the appreciation of dialogue and 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.750
 narration and this disrupts 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:54.480
 the book is made of paper ends up 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.069
 burning of whole and only feed 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.530
 I can say that he dictated nadal made a 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.900
 great disservice to the author me 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.450
 impression that no publisher has read 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.580
 content and made book published of 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.650
 Anyway, you can not 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.659
 responsibility of the author that the 60 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.970
 words were used in the wrong way 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.709
 in certain contexts but this 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.640
 The least of the problems for us 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:20.190
 all major programs have already been 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.170
 I had a blast, I let it go. 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.980
 all the links of the side edition and speech 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.580
 of history 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.040
 I honestly could not get the 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.319
 recording rate is very strange ball 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.900
 very fast resolution of time and 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:37.470
 Suddenly slower but now use with 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.330
 a description of the details 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.519
 this gives a gothic touch to the work that 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.989
 in a way, it combines with 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.080
 events that the end of the 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.489
 book he wrote a mythology 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.260
 interesting development was short 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.150
 of what I was expecting as the 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.090
 true potential of the work was there 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.939
 on the surface but afraid to show the 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.980
 face and a book end gives a margin 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.110
 for the continuation and not who knows 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.980
 future we see this potential 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.900
 accomplished 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.079
 I also found the characters a bit 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.549
 both real 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.510
 A lie has a dog named dolly. 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.099
 what 's love 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.019
 this is because the games me 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.750
 they seemed mechanical at certain times 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.329
 even forced the globe speaks as if I 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.519
 had 40 magic years writing and 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.350
 scientists gives me cartoon impression 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.229
 Do you know they're questioning? 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.360
 additionally with their theories and 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.490
 skepticism about the maggi world 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.770
 there is not one of the characters to 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.720
 front and if you have more clarity and 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.360
 correction but I can not speak of them 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.419
 because it's spoiler after all it was 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.370
 there is an English term called is 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.470
 strong said victor chan who says that 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.699
 The harder it gets bigger 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.160
 reward we feel when 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.940
 completed since the end has been worth 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.099
 the penalty 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.930
 unfortunately it was not the case this time it is 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:54.389
 important that victory takes the 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.910
 lyon and now I'm going to finish this review 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.080
 heavy heart so if you liked it 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.699

 channel he forgets to share the 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:12.960
 video on facebook she just maciel and mine 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.789
 4912 nests 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.789
 they died
