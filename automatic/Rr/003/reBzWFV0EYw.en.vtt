also want to say that you know you could

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.920 
also want to say that you know you could
call<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.579> theory<00:01:29.939> if<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.060> want<00:01:30.420> because

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
call it a theory if you want because

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.780 
call it a theory if you want because
it's<00:01:31.140> probably<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:32.040> not<00:01:32.220> true<00:01:32.520> I'm<00:01:32.670> just

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
it's probably it's not true I'm just

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.460 
it's probably it's not true I'm just
gonna<00:01:32.939> say<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:33.570> not<00:01:34.049> even<00:01:34.200> gonna<00:01:34.290> say

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
gonna say that but not even gonna say

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.859 
gonna say that but not even gonna say
probably<00:01:34.979> it's<00:01:35.700> not<00:01:35.790> true<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.630> just

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
probably it's not true just I just

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.450 
probably it's not true just I just
thought<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.079> was<00:01:37.170> really<00:01:37.350> cool<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.220> something

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
thought it was really cool and something

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.160 
thought it was really cool and something
to<00:01:38.670> cover<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.119> entertaining<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:39.750> something

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
to cover and entertaining just something

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.350 
to cover and entertaining just something
to<00:01:40.259> think<00:01:40.290> about<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.710> know<00:01:40.860> because<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:42.210> just

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
to think about you know because you just

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.060 
to think about you know because you just
don't<00:01:42.540> hear<00:01:42.869> stuff<00:01:43.200> like<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.500> every<00:01:43.710> day<00:01:44.009> but

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
don't hear stuff like this every day but

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.639 
don't hear stuff like this every day but
um<00:01:45.060> what<00:01:45.990> what<00:01:46.170> kind<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.409> brought<00:01:46.530> this

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
um what what kind of brought this

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.620 
um what what kind of brought this
together<00:01:46.860> was<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.310> was<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.180> reading<00:01:48.329> up<00:01:48.450> some

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
together was I was just reading up some

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.030 
together was I was just reading up some
stuff<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> matrix<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.619> how<00:01:49.710> they<00:01:49.829> may<00:01:49.979> be

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
stuff on the matrix and how they may be

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.399 
stuff on the matrix and how they may be
redoing<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.670> trilogy<00:01:51.119> or<00:01:51.720> adding<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.380> it

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
redoing the trilogy or adding on to it

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.289 
redoing the trilogy or adding on to it
and<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:52.920> thought<00:01:53.280> about<00:01:53.310> GTA<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.210> all

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
and I just thought about GTA and all

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.260 
and I just thought about GTA and all
that<00:01:54.479> stuff<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.950> know<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.460> true<00:01:56.759> if<00:01:57.149> you

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
that stuff and you know it's true if you

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.240 
that stuff and you know it's true if you
look<00:01:57.420> at<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.750> from<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.920> real<00:01:59.100> world

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
look at it from the real world

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.249 
look at it from the real world
standpoint<00:01:59.880> not<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.329> real<00:02:00.509> world<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.960> me

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
standpoint not the real world is me

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.020 
standpoint not the real world is me
talking<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.710> right<00:02:01.890> now<00:02:01.950> we're<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:02.939> the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
play GTA 5 we're entering the matrix now

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.690 
play GTA 5 we're entering the matrix now
the<00:02:08.819> matrix<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.979> like<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> computer-generated

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
the matrix is like a computer-generated

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
everything is is pretty much planned out

everything is is pretty much planned out
you<00:02:16.470> could<00:02:16.650> say<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.970> know<00:02:18.000> we<00:02:18.150> pick<00:02:18.330> up

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
you could say and you know we pick up

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.390 
you could say and you know we pick up
the<00:02:18.510> controller<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.230> we're<00:02:19.380> leaving<00:02:19.560> the

we're taking I guess control of one of

we're taking I guess control of one of

these characters and we're playing

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.160 
these characters and we're playing
around<00:02:27.240> in<00:02:27.480> this<00:02:27.660> scripted

around in this scripted

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
computer-generated universe but there's

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.020 
computer-generated universe but there's
also<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.720> lot<00:02:30.990> of<00:02:31.020> scripted<00:02:31.650> things<00:02:32.030> throughout

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
also a lot of scripted things throughout

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.150 
also a lot of scripted things throughout
GTA<00:02:33.480> 5<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.170> thought<00:02:34.530> kind<00:02:34.740> of<00:02:34.800> backed<00:02:34.980> up

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
GTA 5 that I thought kind of backed up

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.520 
GTA 5 that I thought kind of backed up
this<00:02:35.310> claim<00:02:35.690> there's<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.780> lot<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:37.080> scripted

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
this claim there's a lot of scripted

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.260 
this claim there's a lot of scripted
Easter<00:02:37.860> eggs<00:02:37.980> in<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.220> game<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.850> don't

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
Easter eggs in the game that I don't

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.000 
Easter eggs in the game that I don't
think<00:02:39.480> I've<00:02:39.690> ever<00:02:39.900> seen<00:02:40.170> before<00:02:40.560> but<00:02:40.770> for

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
think I've ever seen before but for

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.360 
think I've ever seen before but for
example<00:02:41.100> there<00:02:41.640> is<00:02:42.319> the<00:02:43.319> UFO<00:02:43.770> on<00:02:43.920> top<00:02:44.100> of<00:02:44.220> Mount

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370

completion<00:02:47.040> you're<00:02:47.280> able<00:02:47.520> to<00:02:47.550> see<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:47.970> but

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
completion you're able to see that but

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.990 
completion you're able to see that but
before<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.780> can't<00:02:49.020> see<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:49.820> that's<00:02:50.820> a

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
before that you can't see it so that's a

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.490 
before that you can't see it so that's a

script of things something that that's

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.800 
script of things something that that's
plausible<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.340> could<00:02:53.820> happen<00:02:54.150> in<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.300> matrix
