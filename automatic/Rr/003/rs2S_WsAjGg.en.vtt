and if you look close you might be able
to<00:00:27.810> see<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.109> just<00:00:28.199> barely<00:00:28.880> sticking<00:00:29.880> out<00:00:30.119> below

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
to see it just barely sticking out below

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
camera right there and so when you're

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.200 
camera right there and so when you're
driving<00:00:51.390> down<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.539> road<00:00:52.879> they<00:00:53.879> actually

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
driving down the road they actually

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.610 
driving down the road they actually
really<00:00:54.390> don't<00:00:54.570> see<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.809> much<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.410> doesn't

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
really don't see that much so it doesn't

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.200 
really don't see that much so it doesn't
really<00:00:55.680> block<00:00:55.980> your<00:00:56.190> view<00:00:56.309> or<00:00:56.550> anything<00:00:59.210> go

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
around to the other side it's easier to

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.840 
around to the other side it's easier to
see<00:01:01.649> how<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:01.980> mounted<00:01:02.190> from<00:01:02.640> over

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
you can see it's got a suction cup mount

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.670 
you can see it's got a suction cup mount
which<00:01:24.159> I<00:01:24.280> have<00:01:25.439> stuck<00:01:26.439> through<00:01:26.619> the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
which I have stuck through the

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.469 
which I have stuck through the
windshield<00:01:27.130> right<00:01:27.250> here<00:01:27.610> just<00:01:27.970> basically

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
windshield right here just basically

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.960 
windshield right here just basically
right<00:01:28.689> where<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:29.670> Ruby<00:01:30.670> mirror<00:01:30.880> mounts<00:01:32.970> and

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
right where the Ruby mirror mounts and

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.770 
right where the Ruby mirror mounts and
then<00:01:34.060> it<00:01:34.180> runs<00:01:34.360> down<00:01:34.600> to<00:01:34.630> right<00:01:34.899> there<00:01:35.140> so<00:01:36.780> from

don't<00:02:54.510> have<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.870> have<00:02:55.019> this<00:02:55.200> little<00:02:56.150> foot<00:02:57.150> down

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
don't have to have this little foot down

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.089 
don't have to have this little foot down
screen<00:02:57.720> open<00:02:58.019> that's<00:02:58.140> basically<00:02:58.590> just<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.040> you

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
screen open that's basically just so you

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.069 
screen open that's basically just so you
can<00:02:59.430> see<00:02:59.700> if<00:02:59.790> it's<00:02:59.940> recording<00:03:00.480> or<00:03:00.660> if<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.900> want

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
can see if it's recording or if you want

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.080 
can see if it's recording or if you want
to<00:03:01.140> maybe<00:03:02.010> go<00:03:02.190> back<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.519> play<00:03:02.700> back<00:03:02.879> some

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
to maybe go back and play back some

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.699 
to maybe go back and play back some
footage<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.599> does<00:03:03.720> have<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:03.959> playback<00:03:04.440> feature

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
footage it does have a playback feature

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.740 
footage it does have a playback feature
on<00:03:04.980> here<00:03:05.190> but<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.640> won't<00:03:06.180> get<00:03:06.359> into<00:03:06.540> all<00:03:06.660> that

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
on here but I won't get into all that

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.940 
on here but I won't get into all that
for<00:03:07.079> this<00:03:07.200> video<00:03:09.290> I'll<00:03:10.290> leave<00:03:10.410> that<00:03:10.590> open<00:03:10.739> so

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
for this video I'll leave that open so

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.099 
for this video I'll leave that open so
you<00:03:11.040> say<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.340> next<00:03:11.519> feature<00:03:11.760> here<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.329> have<00:03:12.989> it

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
you say the next feature here I have it

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.890 
you say the next feature here I have it
wired<00:03:13.290> up<00:03:13.590> so<00:03:13.799> that<00:03:14.299> when<00:03:15.299> you<00:03:15.389> turn<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.720> car

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
wired up so that when you turn the car

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.110 
wired up so that when you turn the car
back<00:03:15.959> off<00:03:16.380> it<00:03:16.620> shuts<00:03:16.889> down<00:03:17.510> automatically<00:03:20.120> so

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
back off it shuts down automatically so

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:42.429 
back off it shuts down automatically so
it'll<00:03:21.329> take<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.750> second<00:03:22.230> but

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:42.439 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.250 

you<00:03:43.439> can<00:03:43.590> see<00:03:43.739> it<00:03:43.859> shuts<00:03:44.129> down<00:03:44.310> automatically

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
you can see it shuts down automatically

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.379 
you can see it shuts down automatically
and<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:46.560> that's<00:03:46.709> great<00:03:47.030> you<00:03:48.030> know<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.209> don't

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
and so that's great you know you don't

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:49.670 
and so that's great you know you don't
have<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.599> do<00:03:48.689> anything<00:03:48.900> just<00:03:49.079> get<00:03:49.379> in<00:03:49.469> the<00:03:49.530> car

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
have to do anything just get in the car

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.199 
have to do anything just get in the car
turn<00:03:49.889> it<00:03:49.980> on<00:03:50.099> and<00:03:50.280> go<00:03:50.400> out<00:03:50.549> you<00:03:50.700> normally<00:03:51.030> would

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
turn it on and go out you normally would

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.119 
turn it on and go out you normally would
to<00:03:51.510> wherever<00:03:51.689> you're<00:03:51.930> going<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.469> it<00:03:53.010> will

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
to wherever you're going and it will

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.819 
to wherever you're going and it will
record<00:03:53.430> automatically<00:03:54.920> so<00:03:55.920> now<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.700> will<00:03:57.329> show

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
record automatically so now I will show

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.229 
record automatically so now I will show
go<00:03:58.829> ahead<00:03:58.859> and<00:03:59.099> turn<00:03:59.219> this<00:03:59.340> back<00:03:59.579> on<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:00.150> it

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
go ahead and turn this back on so it

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.720 
go ahead and turn this back on so it
doesn't<00:04:00.510> get<00:04:00.599> too<00:04:00.780> hot<00:04:00.810> in<00:04:01.170> here<00:04:01.370> about<00:04:02.370> 90

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
doesn't get too hot in here about 90

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.289 
doesn't get too hot in here about 90
degrees<00:04:03.060> today<00:04:03.409> so<00:04:04.609> how<00:04:05.609> have<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:05.879> wired<00:04:06.060> up

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
degrees today so how have it wired up

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.869 
degrees today so how have it wired up
it's<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.629> a<00:04:06.659> wire<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:07.919> the<00:04:08.010> power<00:04:08.280> runs<00:04:08.700> up

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
it's it a wire to the power runs up

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.690 
it's it a wire to the power runs up
there<00:04:09.090> and<00:04:09.209> what<00:04:09.329> I<00:04:09.359> did<00:04:09.599> is<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.340> power<00:04:11.340> wire

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
there and what I did is the power wire

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.819 
there and what I did is the power wire
runs<00:04:12.120> just<00:04:12.480> up<00:04:12.689> here<00:04:12.930> back<00:04:13.379> behind<00:04:13.590> the

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
runs just up here back behind the

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.430 
runs just up here back behind the
headliner<00:04:14.480> runs<00:04:15.480> back<00:04:15.719> there<00:04:15.930> behind<00:04:16.199> the

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
headliner runs back there behind the

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.430 
headliner runs back there behind the
headliner<00:04:16.829> and<00:04:17.449> then<00:04:18.449> you<00:04:18.959> get<00:04:19.049> to<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.259> a

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
headliner and then you get to the a

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.779 
headliner and then you get to the a
pillar<00:04:19.709> right<00:04:19.949> here<00:04:20.099> I<00:04:20.130> pulled<00:04:20.340> this<00:04:20.430> piece<00:04:20.639> of

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
pillar right here I pulled this piece of

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:25.240 
pillar right here I pulled this piece of
trim<00:04:21.000> off<00:04:21.349> ran<00:04:22.349> it<00:04:22.470> down<00:04:22.590> behind<00:04:22.800> here<00:04:23.310> and

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
trim off ran it down behind here and

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.600 
trim off ran it down behind here and
take<00:04:26.250> it<00:04:26.340> out<00:04:26.490> show<00:04:26.729> this<00:04:27.060> one<00:04:28.460> pull<00:04:29.460> this

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
take it out show this one pull this

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.100 
take it out show this one pull this
little<00:04:29.880> piece<00:04:30.000> of<00:04:30.180> trim<00:04:30.389> off<00:04:30.539> and<00:04:30.750> ran<00:04:30.870> it<00:04:30.960> back

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
little piece of trim off and ran it back

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.510 
little piece of trim off and ran it back
behind<00:04:31.259> there<00:04:32.330> event<00:04:33.330> coming<00:04:33.570> down<00:04:33.840> here<00:04:34.520> it

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
behind there event coming down here it

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.060 
behind there event coming down here it
might<00:04:35.669> be<00:04:35.729> kind<00:04:36.030> of<00:04:36.060> hard<00:04:36.240> to<00:04:36.270> see<00:04:36.570> but<00:04:36.889> you<00:04:37.889> can

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
might be kind of hard to see but you can

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.129 
might be kind of hard to see but you can
see<00:04:38.099> I<00:04:38.610> used<00:04:39.210> the<00:04:39.449> a<00:04:40.699> fuse<00:04:41.699> panel<00:04:42.090> tap<00:04:42.389> so<00:04:43.110> I

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
see I used the a fuse panel tap so I

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.650 
see I used the a fuse panel tap so I
could<00:04:43.349> add<00:04:43.530> an<00:04:43.710> extra<00:04:44.009> cigarette<00:04:44.660> 12-volt

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
could add an extra cigarette 12-volt

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.999 
could add an extra cigarette 12-volt
outlet<00:04:46.699> right<00:04:47.699> there<00:04:47.880> up<00:04:48.150> under<00:04:48.419> the

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
outlet right there up under the

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.540 
outlet right there up under the
dashboard

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.579 

because<00:04:52.969> the<00:04:53.119> camera<00:04:53.449> operates<00:04:53.899> off<00:04:54.139> of<00:04:54.169> five

00:04:54.579 --> 00:04:54.589 
because the camera operates off of five

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:57.040 
because the camera operates off of five
volts<00:04:55.099> and<00:04:55.339> the<00:04:55.759> car<00:04:55.939> of<00:04:56.059> course<00:04:56.089> puts<00:04:56.569> out<00:04:56.749> 12

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
volts and the car of course puts out 12

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.909 
volts and the car of course puts out 12
volts<00:04:57.439> I<00:04:57.619> need<00:04:57.800> to<00:04:57.919> have<00:04:58.039> that<00:04:58.189> plug<00:04:58.490> on<00:04:58.699> there

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
volts I need to have that plug on there

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.579 
volts I need to have that plug on there
so<00:05:00.919> just<00:05:01.279> basically<00:05:01.990> tap<00:05:02.990> the<00:05:03.139> fuse<00:05:03.379> panel

00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:03.589 
so just basically tap the fuse panel

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:09.399 
so just basically tap the fuse panel
added<00:05:04.520> a<00:05:05.979> an<00:05:06.979> hour<00:05:07.430> a<00:05:07.669> circuit<00:05:08.419> to<00:05:08.629> the<00:05:08.779> fuse

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
added a an hour a circuit to the fuse

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.820 
added a an hour a circuit to the fuse
panel<00:05:09.559> and<00:05:10.300> did<00:05:11.300> it<00:05:11.389> so<00:05:11.539> that<00:05:11.569> it<00:05:11.899> only<00:05:12.080> is<00:05:12.499> on

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
panel and did it so that it only is on

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.350 
panel and did it so that it only is on
when<00:05:13.279> the<00:05:13.369> car<00:05:13.580> is<00:05:13.610> on<00:05:13.879> so<00:05:14.089> that<00:05:14.210> way<00:05:14.300> it

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
when the car is on so that way it

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.619 
when the car is on so that way it
doesn't<00:05:14.479> run<00:05:14.689> down<00:05:14.869> the<00:05:14.990> battery<00:05:15.169> or<00:05:15.499> anything

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:16.629 
doesn't run down the battery or anything
