on what we ended class with today with
Gentiles<00:00:10.679> taxonomy<00:00:11.870> because<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.960> wanted<00:00:13.230> to

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
Gentiles taxonomy because I wanted to

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.690 
Gentiles taxonomy because I wanted to
give<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.860> little<00:00:14.160> bit<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.460> further

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
give a little bit of a further

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.990 
give a little bit of a further
explanation<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:16.619> as<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:17.250> are<00:00:17.279> hopefully

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
explanation of this as you are hopefully

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.880 
explanation of this as you are hopefully
all<00:00:18.180> looking<00:00:18.600> at<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:18.930> over<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.380> next<00:00:19.410> couple

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
all looking at this over the next couple

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.210 
all looking at this over the next couple
of<00:00:20.100> days<00:00:20.340> as<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:21.510> quick<00:00:21.900> refresher<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.650> use<00:00:22.859> this

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
of days as a quick refresher we use this

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.820 
of days as a quick refresher we use this
Gentiles<00:00:23.939> taxonomy<00:00:24.480> for<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.260> couple<00:00:25.769> of

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
Gentiles taxonomy for a couple of

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.330 
Gentiles taxonomy for a couple of
reasons<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:27.300> two<00:00:27.480> most<00:00:27.660> notable<00:00:27.779> are<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:29.189> give

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
reasons the two most notable are to give

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.669 
reasons the two most notable are to give
us<00:00:29.460> an<00:00:29.580> idea<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.090> progression<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.990> skills

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
us an idea of the progression of skills

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.120 
us an idea of the progression of skills
so<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.610> can<00:00:32.640> identify<00:00:33.440> simpler<00:00:34.440> tasks<00:00:34.950> to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
so we can identify simpler tasks to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.280 
so we can identify simpler tasks to
begin<00:00:35.430> with<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.940> then<00:00:36.120> more<00:00:36.480> difficult<00:00:36.899> tasks

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
begin with and then more difficult tasks

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.889 
begin with and then more difficult tasks
that<00:00:37.380> we<00:00:37.500> can<00:00:37.680> move<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.489> as<00:00:38.899> someone's

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
that we can move on to as someone's

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.920 
that we can move on to as someone's
skill<00:00:40.290> level<00:00:40.590> improves<00:00:41.090> it<00:00:42.090> also<00:00:42.329> gives<00:00:42.719> us<00:00:42.780> an

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
skill level improves it also gives us an

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.790 
skill level improves it also gives us an
idea<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.489> someone's<00:00:44.600> ability<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:46.350> other<00:00:46.559> words

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
idea of someone's ability in other words

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.040 
idea of someone's ability in other words
I<00:00:47.039> can<00:00:47.309> identify<00:00:47.460> if<00:00:48.030> someone<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.450> improving

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
I can identify if someone is improving

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.840 
I can identify if someone is improving
or<00:00:49.230> getting<00:00:49.530> better<00:00:49.739> or<00:00:50.100> are<00:00:50.129> they<00:00:50.640> better

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
or getting better or are they better

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.750 
or getting better or are they better
than<00:00:51.030> someone<00:00:51.390> else<00:00:51.660> based<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.860> their<00:00:53.399> ability

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
than someone else based on their ability

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.479 
than someone else based on their ability
to<00:00:53.940> different<00:00:54.300> tasks<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.170> chart<00:00:55.500> the

to different tasks in this chart the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.090 
to different tasks in this chart the
chart<00:00:56.520> moves<00:00:57.030> from<00:00:57.899> easy<00:00:58.230> skills<00:00:58.680> being<00:00:58.980> in

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the very top left to more difficult

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.619 
the very top left to more difficult
skills<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.039> move<00:01:02.370> both<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> right<00:01:03.270> and

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
skills as you move both to the right and

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.140 
skills as you move both to the right and
down<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.260> if<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.500> picture<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.920> diagonal<00:01:05.670> line

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
down so if you picture a diagonal line

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.990 
down so if you picture a diagonal line
moving<00:01:07.110> from<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.409> top<00:01:07.619> left<00:01:07.979> down<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.520> the

moving from the top left down to the
bottom<00:01:09.299> right<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:10.140> skills<00:01:10.439> get<00:01:10.710> increasingly

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
bottom right the skills get increasingly

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.010 
bottom right the skills get increasingly
difficult<00:01:11.520> as<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.060> move<00:01:12.240> from<00:01:12.360> there<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:12.869> we

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
difficult as we move from there so we

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.750 
difficult as we move from there so we
want<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.290> start<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.770> top<00:01:13.950> left<00:01:14.280> with<00:01:14.549> easy

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
want to start on the top left with easy

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.399 
want to start on the top left with easy
skills<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.540> then<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.840> bottom<00:01:16.110> right<00:01:16.290> would

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
skills and then the bottom right would

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.440 
skills and then the bottom right would
be<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.619> most<00:01:16.770> difficult<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.240> see

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
be the most difficult as you can see

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.350 
be the most difficult as you can see
each<00:01:18.689> cell<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.680> also<00:01:20.009> labeled<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.909> number

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
each cell is also labeled with a number

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.870 
each cell is also labeled with a number
and<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.810> letter

gentles taxonomy breaks skills down into

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.679 
gentles taxonomy breaks skills down into
two<00:01:28.159> broad<00:01:29.159> categories<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.210> hope<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.570> will

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
two broad categories and I hope I will

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.060 
two broad categories and I hope I will
zoom<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:31.350> hopefully<00:01:31.650> we'll<00:01:31.770> be<00:01:31.860> able<00:01:31.890> to

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
zoom in here hopefully we'll be able to

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.200 
zoom in here hopefully we'll be able to
see<00:01:32.310> these<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:33.540> first<00:01:33.869> one<00:01:34.200> are<00:01:35.210> action

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
see these the first one are action

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.350 
see these the first one are action
requirements<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.740> these<00:01:37.979> are<00:01:38.369> specific

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
requirements so these are specific

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.960 
requirements so these are specific
requirements<00:01:39.990> about<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.500> skill<00:01:40.970> those

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
requirements about this skill those

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.850 
requirements about this skill those
action<00:01:42.360> requirements<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.380> come<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.680> two

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
action requirements can come in two

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.730 
action requirements can come in two
categories<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.759> first<00:01:44.790> category<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.990> body

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
categories the first category is body

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.770

you can see these two columns say no

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.150 
you can see these two columns say no
object<00:02:45.840> manipulation<00:02:46.530> or<00:02:46.740> object
