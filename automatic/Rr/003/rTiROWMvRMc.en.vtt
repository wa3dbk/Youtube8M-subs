a<00:00:31.260> 12-volt<00:00:31.949> battery<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:33.239> know<00:00:33.360> at<00:00:33.960> my<00:00:34.200> job<00:00:34.440> I

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
a 12-volt battery you know at my job I

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.139 
a 12-volt battery you know at my job I
was<00:00:34.739> asking<00:00:35.100> people<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.610> know<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> lot<00:00:36.120> of

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
was asking people you know a lot of

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.940 
was asking people you know a lot of
folks<00:00:36.390> who<00:00:36.660> thought<00:00:37.230> they<00:00:37.410> knew<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.770> you

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
folks who thought they knew what you

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.350 
folks who thought they knew what you
know<00:00:38.070> about<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.670> Chevy<00:00:38.879> Volt<00:00:38.940> what<00:00:39.300> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
know about the Chevy Volt what the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.139 
know about the Chevy Volt what the
typical<00:00:39.629> Chevy<00:00:40.350> Volt<00:00:40.559> can<00:00:40.710> do<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.940> Super

typical Chevy Volt can do and the Super
Bowl

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
Bowl

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.900 
Bowl
you<00:00:42.660> know<00:00:42.780> if<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.230> total<00:00:43.410> battery<00:00:43.710> dies<00:00:44.100> you

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
you know if the total battery dies you

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.369 
you know if the total battery dies you
still<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.390> jumpstart<00:00:45.870> even<00:00:46.140> though<00:00:46.230> it

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
still have to jumpstart even though it

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.819 
still have to jumpstart even though it
has<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> 16<00:00:47.250> kilowatt<00:00:47.700> battery<00:00:48.320> you<00:00:49.320> can't<00:00:49.620> use

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
has a 16 kilowatt battery you can't use

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.200 
has a 16 kilowatt battery you can't use
and<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.039> guess<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.280> can't<00:00:50.489> use<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.700> energy<00:00:51.000> to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
and I guess you can't use that energy to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.549 
and I guess you can't use that energy to
jumpstart<00:00:51.690> which<00:00:51.809> would<00:00:51.989> make<00:00:52.140> sense<00:00:52.170> for

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
jumpstart which would make sense for

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.580 
jumpstart which would make sense for
most<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.980> us<00:00:53.070> if<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:54.300> total<00:00:54.660> battery<00:00:54.870> does<00:00:55.320> die

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
most of us if the total battery does die

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.130 
most of us if the total battery does die
out<00:00:55.800> why<00:00:56.070> not<00:00:56.250> use<00:00:56.489> its<00:00:56.760> 16<00:00:57.390> kilowatt<00:00:57.809> battery

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
out why not use its 16 kilowatt battery

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.209 
out why not use its 16 kilowatt battery
to<00:00:58.230> jumpstart<00:00:58.940> I'm<00:00:59.940> not<00:01:00.270> sure<00:01:00.510> why<00:01:00.780> or<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.980> in

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
to jumpstart I'm not sure why or you in

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.380 
to jumpstart I'm not sure why or you in
the<00:01:02.370> systems<00:01:02.730> aren't<00:01:02.879> connected<00:01:03.300> I'm

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
the systems aren't connected I'm

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.359 
the systems aren't connected I'm
assuming<00:01:03.719> because<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.080> total<00:01:04.290> battery<00:01:04.650> is

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
assuming because the total battery is

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.230 
assuming because the total battery is
used<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.880> power<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.720> low-voltage<00:01:08.240> features

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
used to power the low-voltage features

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.370 
used to power the low-voltage features
on<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.510> vehicle<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:09.930> I'm<00:01:09.990> going<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> show<00:01:10.320> you

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
on the vehicle so I'm going to show you

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.260 
on the vehicle so I'm going to show you
what<00:01:10.590> he<00:01:10.650> actually<00:01:10.860> jump-started<00:01:11.790> now<00:01:12.060> let's

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
what he actually jump-started now let's

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:30.440 
what he actually jump-started now let's
go<00:01:12.390> ahead<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.720> pop<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.049> hood<00:01:13.200> here

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.920 

now<00:01:31.450> look<00:01:31.720> in<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.990> underneath<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.800> hood<00:01:33.930> it

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
now look in the underneath the hood it

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.170 
now look in the underneath the hood it
is<00:01:35.230> a<00:01:35.260> mystery<00:01:35.710> as<00:01:35.920> to<00:01:36.160> where<00:01:36.370> the<00:01:36.550> 12-volt

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
is a mystery as to where the 12-volt

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.080 
is a mystery as to where the 12-volt
battery<00:01:37.780> is<00:01:37.960> located<00:01:38.230> I<00:01:38.920> do<00:01:39.550> know<00:01:39.820> that<00:01:39.970> the

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
battery is located I do know that the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.000 
battery is located I do know that the
Chevy<00:01:40.270> Volt<00:01:40.360> has<00:01:40.780> a<00:01:40.810> 12-volt<00:01:41.440> battery<00:01:41.920> I<00:01:44.010> just

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
Chevy Volt has a 12-volt battery I just

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.740 
Chevy Volt has a 12-volt battery I just
don't<00:01:45.220> know<00:01:45.340> where<00:01:45.550> exactly<00:01:45.580> it's<00:01:46.270> located

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
don't know where exactly it's located

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.850 
don't know where exactly it's located
I'm<00:01:46.990> assuming<00:01:47.320> it's<00:01:47.410> located<00:01:47.680> underneath

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
I'm assuming it's located underneath

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.240 
I'm assuming it's located underneath
here<00:01:48.160> somewhere<00:01:48.550> I<00:01:49.390> know<00:01:50.380> well<00:01:50.680> enough<00:01:50.830> that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
here somewhere I know well enough that

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.280 
here somewhere I know well enough that
the<00:01:51.430> color<00:01:51.700> orange<00:01:52.030> represents<00:01:52.780> high<00:01:52.900> voltage

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
the color orange represents high voltage

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.850 
the color orange represents high voltage
and<00:01:53.440> that's<00:01:53.620> a<00:01:53.710> no-no<00:01:53.890> not<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.400> touch<00:01:54.610> so<00:01:55.860> I

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
and that's a no-no not to touch so I

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.700 
and that's a no-no not to touch so I
definitely<00:01:57.900> will<00:01:58.900> be<00:01:58.930> poking<00:01:59.380> and<00:01:59.470> prodding

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
definitely will be poking and prodding

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.480 
definitely will be poking and prodding
in<00:02:00.100> here<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:02.229> whole<00:02:03.100> point<00:02:03.340> of<00:02:03.369> this

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
in here but the whole point of this

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.469 
in here but the whole point of this
video<00:02:03.759> to<00:02:03.910> show<00:02:04.060> you<00:02:04.090> where<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:04.360> actually

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
video to show you where you actually

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.350 
video to show you where you actually
jumpstart<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.170> bolt<00:02:05.350> if<00:02:05.470> you<00:02:05.560> do<00:02:05.680> need<00:02:05.860> to<00:02:06.009> and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
jumpstart the bolt if you do need to and

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.760 
jumpstart the bolt if you do need to and
the<00:02:07.679> ground<00:02:09.270> -<00:02:10.270> plug<00:02:10.540> is<00:02:10.750> actually<00:02:11.200> right<00:02:11.530> over

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
the ground - plug is actually right over

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.610 
the ground - plug is actually right over
here<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.580> plus<00:02:13.000> is<00:02:13.630> actually<00:02:14.440> right

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
here and the plus is actually right

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.140 
here and the plus is actually right
underneath<00:02:14.860> protectant<00:02:15.670> underneath<00:02:15.970> this

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
underneath protectant underneath this

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.310 
killed a cat here to show you where do
you<00:02:41.980> actually<00:02:42.130> jumpstart<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:43.510> Chevy<00:02:43.810> bolt<00:02:43.959> I

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
you actually jumpstart the Chevy bolt I

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.590 
you actually jumpstart the Chevy bolt I
had<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.310> have<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.060> find<00:02:46.269> out

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
had to have to find out

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.280 
had to have to find out
exactly<00:02:47.080> is<00:02:47.320> this<00:02:48.600> 12-volt<00:02:49.600> battery<00:02:49.990> located

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
exactly is this 12-volt battery located

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.310 
exactly is this 12-volt battery located
so<00:02:50.890> yeah<00:02:51.820> it's<00:02:52.540> actually<00:02:52.810> located<00:02:52.930> in<00:02:53.260> the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
so yeah it's actually located in the

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.620 
so yeah it's actually located in the
trunk<00:02:53.620> area<00:02:53.910> right<00:02:54.910> in<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.060> back<00:02:55.240> over<00:02:55.450> here

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.880 

so<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.810> toefl<00:02:59.260> batteries<00:03:00.240> located<00:03:01.240> in<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.890> is

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
so the toefl batteries located in the is

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.350 
so the toefl batteries located in the is
in<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.220> trunk<00:03:03.520> area<00:03:03.760> here<00:03:04.090> pop<00:03:04.990> this<00:03:05.140> open

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
in the trunk area here pop this open

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.920 
in the trunk area here pop this open
magnetically<00:03:07.360> sealed<00:03:07.660> there<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:09.780> from<00:03:10.780> what

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
magnetically sealed there and from what

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.800 
magnetically sealed there and from what
I<00:03:11.050> can<00:03:11.170> gather<00:03:12.150> there's<00:03:13.150> this<00:03:13.300> little<00:03:13.540> battery

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
I can gather there's this little battery

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.560 
I can gather there's this little battery
icons<00:03:14.350> here<00:03:14.740> and<00:03:14.890> here<00:03:15.160> so<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:16.090> if<00:03:16.210> I<00:03:16.330> did

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
icons here and here so that if I did

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.840 
icons here and here so that if I did
need<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:16.810> charge<00:03:17.740> me<00:03:18.070> there<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.960> there<00:03:19.960> you<00:03:19.990> go

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
need to charge me there and there you go

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.150 
need to charge me there and there you go
that's<00:03:21.850> pretty<00:03:22.090> neat<00:03:23.580> so<00:03:24.580> I<00:03:24.880> guess<00:03:25.150> this<00:03:25.540> whole

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
that's pretty neat so I guess this whole

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.370 
that's pretty neat so I guess this whole
compartment<00:03:27.160> here<00:03:27.730> which<00:03:28.570> is<00:03:28.750> I<00:03:28.900> see<00:03:29.200> so

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
compartment here which is I see so

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.290 
compartment here which is I see so
there's<00:03:29.590> some<00:03:29.740> screws<00:03:30.160> in<00:03:30.400> each<00:03:30.760> corner<00:03:31.090> here

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
there's some screws in each corner here

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.360 
there's some screws in each corner here
and<00:03:31.390> I<00:03:31.420> guess<00:03:31.570> this<00:03:31.660> would<00:03:31.810> you<00:03:32.440> would<00:03:32.560> screw

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
and I guess this would you would screw

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.740 
and I guess this would you would screw
this<00:03:33.580> and<00:03:33.850> that's<00:03:34.090> how<00:03:34.150> you<00:03:34.240> would<00:03:34.390> place<00:03:34.600> the

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
this and that's how you would place the

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.670 
this and that's how you would place the
battery<00:03:35.110> there<00:03:35.890> it<00:03:36.010> is<00:03:37.230> well<00:03:38.230> that's<00:03:38.440> pretty

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
battery there it is well that's pretty

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.130 
battery there it is well that's pretty
neat<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:40.030> guys<00:03:40.180> can't<00:03:40.480> see<00:03:40.720> this<00:03:40.840> but<00:03:41.020> it

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
neat you guys can't see this but it

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.220 
neat you guys can't see this but it
looks<00:03:41.560> like<00:03:41.680> there's<00:03:41.890> a<00:03:41.950> little<00:03:42.040> generator<00:03:43.230> no

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
looks like there's a little generator no

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.540 
looks like there's a little generator no
it<00:03:44.350> says<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.560> blower<00:03:44.830> there's<00:03:45.100> a<00:03:45.160> little<00:03:45.340> blower

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
it says a blower there's a little blower

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.430 
it says a blower there's a little blower
icon<00:03:46.000> on<00:03:46.150> here

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.700 

yeah<00:03:51.920> I<00:03:52.750> it's<00:03:53.750> really<00:03:53.810> hard<00:03:54.200> to<00:03:54.290> tell<00:03:54.500> but

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
yeah I it's really hard to tell but

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.890 
yeah I it's really hard to tell but
there's<00:03:55.340> a<00:03:55.400> little<00:03:55.640> sticker<00:03:55.850> that<00:03:56.390> says<00:03:56.690> it's

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
there's a little sticker that says it's

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.920 
there's a little sticker that says it's
a<00:03:56.990> blower<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:58.070> I'm<00:03:58.130> assuming<00:03:58.490> that<00:03:58.700> it<00:03:59.120> blows

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
a blower so I'm assuming that it blows

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.340 
a blower so I'm assuming that it blows
air<00:04:00.320> inside<00:04:00.710> here<00:04:00.950> too<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:05.810> if<00:04:05.990> any<00:04:06.170> of<00:04:06.230> you

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
air inside here too and if any of you

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.930 
air inside here too and if any of you
guys<00:04:06.500> were<00:04:06.740> wondering<00:04:06.920> on<00:04:07.340> the<00:04:07.490> other<00:04:07.640> stuff

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
guys were wondering on the other stuff

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.290 
guys were wondering on the other stuff
that<00:04:08.240> is<00:04:08.450> being<00:04:09.100> underneath<00:04:10.100> this<00:04:10.280> panel<00:04:10.550> it's

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
that is being underneath this panel it's

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.250 
that is being underneath this panel it's
the<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:12.560> other<00:04:12.710> stuff<00:04:12.980> on<00:04:13.160> here<00:04:13.370> is<00:04:13.550> the<00:04:14.260> 120

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
the the other stuff on here is the 120

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.620 
the the other stuff on here is the 120
volt<00:04:15.470> charging<00:04:16.190> station<00:04:16.820> they're<00:04:17.030> all<00:04:17.330> and

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
volt charging station they're all and

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.390 
volt charging station they're all and
that<00:04:18.620> is<00:04:18.890> a<00:04:19.840> fix-a-flat<00:04:20.840> system<00:04:21.620> they're<00:04:21.799> the

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
that is a fix-a-flat system they're the

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.970 
that is a fix-a-flat system they're the
Volt<00:04:22.640> does<00:04:23.090> not<00:04:23.360> have<00:04:23.570> a<00:04:23.600> spare<00:04:23.930> tire<00:04:24.200> so<00:04:24.530> I'm

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
Volt does not have a spare tire so I'm

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.980 
Volt does not have a spare tire so I'm
assuming<00:04:25.220> that<00:04:25.430> if<00:04:25.550> you<00:04:25.640> do<00:04:25.760> encounter<00:04:26.060> a<00:04:26.540> flat

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
assuming that if you do encounter a flat

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
assuming that if you do encounter a flat
tire<00:04:27.460> you<00:04:28.460> will<00:04:28.700> need<00:04:28.910> to<00:04:29.740> get<00:04:30.740> kind<00:04:30.980> of

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
tire you will need to get kind of

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.130 
tire you will need to get kind of
fix-a-flat<00:04:31.340> it<00:04:31.760> which<00:04:32.420> is<00:04:32.570> fine<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:33.050> don't

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
fix-a-flat it which is fine I don't
