there's another very important thing you
have<00:00:11.709> to<00:00:11.830> look<00:00:11.980> that<00:00:12.160> regards<00:00:12.940> to<00:00:13.090> cleaning

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:13.299 
have to look that regards to cleaning

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.180 
have to look that regards to cleaning
I'm<00:00:13.629> trying<00:00:13.930> to<00:00:13.990> take<00:00:14.139> a<00:00:14.170> pic<00:00:14.530> of<00:00:14.559> shaving<00:00:15.039> off

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
I'm trying to take a pic of shaving off

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.430 
I'm trying to take a pic of shaving off
here<00:00:15.459> is<00:00:15.549> like<00:00:15.699> time<00:00:15.940> and<00:00:16.779> what's<00:00:16.990> happening

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 
here is like time and what's happening

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.310 
here is like time and what's happening
is<00:00:17.680> the<00:00:17.830> Saints<00:00:18.310> of<00:00:18.460> the<00:00:18.550> blade<00:00:18.839> are<00:00:19.839> creating

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
is the Saints of the blade are creating

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:27.480 
is the Saints of the blade are creating
tracks<00:00:20.679> in<00:00:20.980> the<00:00:21.070> wood

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.849 

these<00:00:28.029> tracks<00:00:28.390> of<00:00:28.660> course<00:00:28.869> are<00:00:29.439> caused

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
these tracks of course are caused

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.330 
these tracks of course are caused
because<00:00:30.279> we<00:00:30.730> have<00:00:30.910> a<00:00:30.939> square<00:00:31.150> edge<00:00:31.539> clean<00:00:31.960> iron

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
because we have a square edge clean iron

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.610 
because we have a square edge clean iron
we<00:00:33.340> have<00:00:33.520> to<00:00:33.640> put<00:00:33.790> a<00:00:33.820> cup<00:00:34.120> on<00:00:34.410> here's<00:00:35.410> the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
we have to put a cup on here's the

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.360 
we have to put a cup on here's the
technique<00:00:36.010> we're<00:00:36.250> gonna<00:00:36.430> use<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:39.070> I'm<00:00:39.190> going

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
technique we're gonna use so I'm going

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.759 
technique we're gonna use so I'm going
to<00:00:39.399> put<00:00:39.610> a<00:00:39.910> curve<00:00:40.690> on<00:00:40.960> this<00:00:41.199> blade<00:00:41.469> now<00:00:41.649> it's

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
to put a curve on this blade now it's

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.790 
to put a curve on this blade now it's
gonna<00:00:41.860> be<00:00:41.949> a<00:00:42.010> very<00:00:42.250> slight<00:00:42.670> curve<00:00:43.409> the<00:00:44.409> angle

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
gonna be a very slight curve the angle

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.619 
gonna be a very slight curve the angle
that<00:00:45.339> I'm<00:00:45.489> working<00:00:45.909> here<00:00:46.210> again<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:49.210> angle

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
that I'm working here again this angle

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.549 
that I'm working here again this angle
that<00:00:49.720> I'm<00:00:49.839> working<00:00:50.199> on<00:00:50.290> the<00:00:50.440> store<00:00:52.050> mr.<00:00:53.050> this

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
that I'm working on the store mr. this

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.799 
that I'm working on the store mr. this
is<00:00:53.680> angle<00:00:54.040> the<00:00:54.100> blade<00:00:54.220> sit<00:00:54.640> sides<00:00:54.940> as<00:00:55.449> long<00:00:55.659> as

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
is angle the blade sit sides as long as

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.319 
is angle the blade sit sides as long as
I'm<00:00:55.960> sharpening<00:00:56.440> it<00:00:56.680> at<00:00:57.040> a<00:00:57.190> low<00:00:57.399> angle<00:00:57.670> I'm

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
I'm sharpening it at a low angle I'm

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:59.849 
I'm sharpening it at a low angle I'm
going<00:00:58.390> to<00:00:58.600> get<00:00:58.780> a<00:00:58.809> pretty<00:00:59.050> good<00:00:59.140> cut<00:00:59.559> around

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
going to get a pretty good cut around

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.020 
going to get a pretty good cut around
about<00:01:00.340> 30<00:01:00.940> degrees<00:01:01.179> 25<00:01:02.109> or<00:01:02.379> 30<00:01:02.620> degrees<00:01:03.030> this

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
about 30 degrees 25 or 30 degrees this

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.749 
about 30 degrees 25 or 30 degrees this
the<00:01:04.379> recommended<00:01:05.379> angle<00:01:07.890> I'm<00:01:08.890> starting<00:01:09.580> by

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
the recommended angle I'm starting by

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:11.850 
the recommended angle I'm starting by
slowly<00:01:10.119> working<00:01:10.600> over<00:01:11.020> this<00:01:11.170> store<00:01:11.500> now<00:01:11.710> this

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
slowly working over this store now this

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.609 
slowly working over this store now this
is<00:01:12.009> a<00:01:12.280> new<00:01:12.640> store<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.539> softest<00:01:14.020> is<00:01:14.200> out<00:01:14.410> of

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
is a new store the softest is out of

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.680 
is a new store the softest is out of
this<00:01:14.770> flat<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.850> what<00:01:16.030> I'm<00:01:16.119> going<00:01:16.300> to<00:01:16.360> do<00:01:16.539> as

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
this flat and what I'm going to do as

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.660 
this flat and what I'm going to do as
they<00:01:16.810> go<00:01:16.960> is<00:01:17.080> I'm<00:01:17.229> good<00:01:17.440> ultimately<00:01:18.039> to

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
they go is I'm good ultimately to

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.060 
they go is I'm good ultimately to
pressure<00:01:19.030> on<00:01:19.360> one<00:01:19.570> side<00:01:19.929> and<00:01:20.470> then<00:01:20.800> the<00:01:20.830> other

pressure on one side and then the other

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.040 
pressure on one side and then the other
side<00:01:22.440> drop<00:01:23.440> two<00:01:23.740> or<00:01:23.800> three<00:01:24.039> strokes<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.840> then

side drop two or three strokes and then
on<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.710> other<00:01:26.740> side<00:01:27.159> for<00:01:27.369> two<00:01:27.580> or<00:01:27.670> three

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
on the other side for two or three

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.960 
on the other side for two or three
stores<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:29.229> back<00:01:29.440> again<00:01:29.649> and<00:01:30.039> what<00:01:30.250> I'm<00:01:30.399> doing

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.120 

is<00:01:33.970> giving<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.740> slate<00:01:36.159> Korriban

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
is giving the slate Korriban

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.310 
is giving the slate Korriban
and<00:01:38.580> here<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.060> see<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.450> car<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> plane

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
and here we can see the car on the plane

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.160 
and here we can see the car on the plane

this<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.900> a<00:01:45.930> video<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.560> clarification<00:01:47.549> on

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
this is a video for clarification on

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.260 
this is a video for clarification on
this<00:01:48.200> while<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> Ross<00:01:49.590> now<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:50.640> need<00:01:51.030> them

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
this while the Ross now I just need them

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.060 
this while the Ross now I just need them
they<00:01:51.390> were<00:01:51.540> right<00:01:51.930> previously<00:01:52.590> until<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
they were right previously until the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.639 
they were right previously until the
plane<00:01:53.280> hits<00:01:54.270> famine<00:01:54.659> classes<00:01:55.049> over<00:01:55.320> them<00:01:55.470> like

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
plane hits famine classes over them like

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.690 
plane hits famine classes over them like
yeah<00:01:57.619> now<00:01:58.619> I'm<00:01:58.680> going<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.220> clean<00:01:59.460> up<00:01:59.490> this

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
yeah now I'm going to just clean up this

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.180 
yeah now I'm going to just clean up this
surface<00:02:00.180> without<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.799> begin<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.950> show<00:02:02.130> you

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
surface without you begin to show you

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.149 
surface without you begin to show you
some<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.729> techniques<00:02:03.799> they're<00:02:04.799> not<00:02:05.039> to

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
some of the techniques they're not to

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.299 
some of the techniques they're not to
develop<00:02:05.369> or<00:02:05.700> not
