00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
a pretty good job of keeping a bunch of

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.100 
a pretty good job of keeping a bunch of
his<00:01:19.710> different<00:01:20.009> units<00:01:20.250> alive<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.450> sending

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
his different units alive so sending

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.850 
his different units alive so sending
them<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.549> just<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.759> time<00:01:23.970> as<00:01:24.299> he<00:01:24.659> did<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.200> guess

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
them in just in time as he did I guess

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.950 
them in just in time as he did I guess
you<00:01:26.009> could<00:01:26.159> say<00:01:26.189> does<00:01:27.000> allow<00:01:27.240> him<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.630> go

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
you could say does allow him to go

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.660 
you could say does allow him to go
farther<00:01:28.350> than<00:01:28.500> he<00:01:28.710> otherwise<00:01:28.979> would<00:01:29.280> have

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
farther than he otherwise would have

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.800 
farther than he otherwise would have
this<00:01:29.850> would<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.090> been<00:01:30.150> over<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> long<00:01:30.630> time

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
this would have been over a long time

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.499 
this would have been over a long time
ago<00:01:31.490> if<00:01:32.490> he<00:01:32.549> wouldn't<00:01:32.939> have<00:01:33.030> set<00:01:33.150> them<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.390> at

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
ago if he wouldn't have set them in at

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.020 
ago if he wouldn't have set them in at
all<00:01:34.130> obviously<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.340> argue<00:01:35.520> over<00:01:35.880> whether

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
all obviously we can argue over whether

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.149 
all obviously we can argue over whether
or<00:01:36.180> not<00:01:36.329> he<00:01:36.450> sent<00:01:36.630> them<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.200> time<00:01:37.740> though<00:01:38.130> I

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
or not he sent them in in time though I

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.740 
or not he sent them in in time though I
suppose<00:01:38.729> maybe<00:01:38.970> he<00:01:39.180> should<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.450> sent<00:01:39.630> them

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
suppose maybe he should have sent them

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.840 
suppose maybe he should have sent them
in<00:01:39.869> earlier<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.829> course<00:01:40.890> he<00:01:41.340> also<00:01:41.369> should<00:01:41.790> have

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
in earlier of course he also should have

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.190 
in earlier of course he also should have
lured<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.210> clan<00:01:42.360> castle<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.869> multiple

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
lured the clan castle so multiple

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.569 
lured the clan castle so multiple
mistakes<00:01:43.590> made<00:01:43.829> here

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
mistakes made here

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.460 
mistakes made here
finally<00:01:45.299> if<00:01:45.450> they're<00:01:45.600> all<00:01:45.780> trying<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.259> save

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
finally if they're all trying to save

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.010 
finally if they're all trying to save
his<00:01:46.710> last<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.610> know<00:01:47.729> remaining<00:01:48.299> wizard<00:01:48.689> but

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
his last you know remaining wizard but

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.499 
his last you know remaining wizard but
we<00:01:49.979> had<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.430> many<00:01:50.549> defenses<00:01:51.149> hitting<00:01:51.390> that

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
we had so many defenses hitting that

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.240 
we had so many defenses hitting that
wizard<00:01:51.840> at<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> same<00:01:52.259> time<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.950> healers

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
wizard at the same time that the healers

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.100 
wizard at the same time that the healers
couldn't<00:01:53.670> do<00:01:53.820> enough<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.149> keep<00:01:54.299> him<00:01:54.570> alive<00:01:54.659> and

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
couldn't do enough to keep him alive and

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.510 
couldn't do enough to keep him alive and
that's<00:01:55.710> one<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> great<00:01:56.250> things<00:01:56.430> about

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
that's one of the great things about

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.209 
that's one of the great things about
this<00:01:56.820> base<00:01:57.060> all<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.869> defense's<00:01:58.409> have<00:01:59.009> such

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
this base all the defense's have such

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.090 
this base all the defense's have such
great<00:01:59.399> coverage<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.119> base<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.860> even<00:02:01.860> if

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
great coverage in the base that even if

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.280 
great coverage in the base that even if
you<00:02:03.000> know<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> wizard<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.659> getting<00:02:03.930> healed<00:02:04.110> by

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
you know a wizard is getting healed by

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.530 
you know a wizard is getting healed by
three<00:02:04.530> healers<00:02:04.860> at<00:02:05.009> once<00:02:05.219> we're<00:02:05.939> still<00:02:06.210> able

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
three healers at once we're still able

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.810 
three healers at once we're still able
to<00:02:06.689> take<00:02:06.930> him<00:02:07.170> down

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
to take him down

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.359 
to take him down
and<00:02:07.909> that<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:08.810> so<00:02:09.380> we<00:02:09.530> got<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.830> defensive

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
and that and so we got the defensive

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.560 
and that and so we got the defensive
victories<00:02:10.729> so<00:02:10.940> now<00:02:11.090> we're<00:02:11.210> looking<00:02:11.270> at<00:02:11.450> the

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
victories so now we're looking at the

yet<00:03:27.230> another<00:03:27.590> well-placed<00:03:28.190> springboard<00:03:28.820> so

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
yet another well-placed springboard so

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.229 
yet another well-placed springboard so
you<00:03:29.690> know<00:03:29.989> his<00:03:30.440> troops<00:03:30.829> are<00:03:31.040> dwindling<00:03:31.340> quick

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
you know his troops are dwindling quick

this point and at this point it's

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.390 
this point and at this point it's
essentially<00:03:36.980> game<00:03:37.220> over<00:03:38.350> he<00:03:39.350> he's<00:03:40.010> got<00:03:40.190> that

primarily barbarian attack attacking
from<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.530> top<00:04:07.130> right<00:04:07.400> there<00:04:07.690> and<00:04:08.690> he's<00:04:08.930> just

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
from the top right there and he's just

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.860 
from the top right there and he's just
gonna<00:04:09.320> send<00:04:09.920> them<00:04:10.040> in<00:04:10.190> like<00:04:10.430> crazy<00:04:10.870> and

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
gonna send them in like crazy and

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.990

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
remember these are level six barbarians

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.420 
remember these are level six barbarians
so<00:04:14.180> they<00:04:14.269> have<00:04:14.390> a<00:04:14.420> a<00:04:14.690> nice<00:04:15.380> solid<00:04:16.040> chunk<00:04:16.310> of

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
so they have a a nice solid chunk of

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.710 
so they have a a nice solid chunk of
health

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
health

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.640 
health
and<00:04:18.440> they<00:04:18.560> will<00:04:18.739> survive<00:04:19.100> pretty<00:04:19.670> well<00:04:20.030> so<00:04:21.019> if

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
and they will survive pretty well so if

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.440 
and they will survive pretty well so if
you<00:04:21.799> get<00:04:21.980> them<00:04:22.160> all<00:04:22.250> in<00:04:22.400> a<00:04:22.490> group<00:04:22.790> they<00:04:23.000> can<00:04:23.210> eat

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
you get them all in a group they can eat

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.420 
you get them all in a group they can eat
through<00:04:23.810> now<00:04:24.380> they<00:04:24.890> can<00:04:25.040> eat<00:04:25.190> through

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
through now they can eat through

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.740 
through now they can eat through
structures<00:04:25.820> very<00:04:26.120> quickly<00:04:26.420> because<00:04:26.660> they

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
structures very quickly because they

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.570 
structures very quickly because they
also<00:04:26.900> you<00:04:27.110> know<00:04:27.230> do<00:04:27.530> a<00:04:27.740> decent<00:04:28.130> amount<00:04:28.370> of

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
also you know do a decent amount of

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.620 
also you know do a decent amount of
damage<00:04:29.080> and<00:04:30.100> when<00:04:31.100> you<00:04:31.520> enrage<00:04:32.030> them<00:04:32.270> which<00:04:32.480> he

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
damage and when you enrage them which he

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.030 
damage and when you enrage them which he
does<00:04:32.840> here<00:04:33.110> that<00:04:33.820> obviously<00:04:35.800> makes<00:04:36.800> their

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
does here that obviously makes their

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.940 
does here that obviously makes their
damage<00:04:37.460> increased<00:04:37.850> even<00:04:38.030> further<00:04:38.150> so<00:04:38.950> he

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
damage increased even further so he

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.770 
damage increased even further so he
enrages<00:04:40.430> them<00:04:40.640> to<00:04:40.820> get<00:04:40.970> them<00:04:41.150> to<00:04:41.180> you<00:04:41.690> know

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
enrages them to get them to you know

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.330 
enrages them to get them to you know
deal<00:04:42.170> with<00:04:42.200> my<00:04:42.410> clan<00:04:42.620> castle<00:04:42.950> troops<00:04:42.980> really

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
deal with my clan castle troops really

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.360 
deal with my clan castle troops really
quickly<00:04:43.700> and<00:04:44.240> move<00:04:44.450> on<00:04:44.690> to<00:04:45.110> two<00:04:45.830> other<00:04:46.010> things

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
quickly and move on to two other things

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.200 
quickly and move on to two other things
and<00:04:47.050> they<00:04:48.050> do<00:04:48.110> they<00:04:48.980> wipe<00:04:49.190> out<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.490> storages

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
and they do they wipe out the storages

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.270 
and they do they wipe out the storages
that<00:04:50.600> were<00:04:50.750> within<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.410> range<00:04:51.800> of<00:04:51.980> the<00:04:52.100> rage

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
that were within the range of the rage

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.630 
that were within the range of the rage
spell<00:04:52.310> pretty<00:04:52.880> quickly<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:54.280> keep<00:04:55.280> moving

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
spell pretty quickly and keep moving

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.550 
spell pretty quickly and keep moving
along<00:04:55.760> but<00:04:56.390> you<00:04:56.630> know<00:04:57.080> this<00:04:57.200> whole<00:04:57.350> time

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
along but you know this whole time

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.110 
along but you know this whole time
they're<00:04:57.740> getting<00:04:57.830> hammered<00:04:58.130> by<00:04:58.340> mortar<00:04:58.910> fire

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
they're getting hammered by mortar fire

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.040 
they're getting hammered by mortar fire
and<00:04:59.150> whatnot<00:04:59.630> so<00:05:00.700> that<00:05:01.700> obviously<00:05:01.880> is<00:05:02.330> a<00:05:02.660> big

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
and whatnot so that obviously is a big

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.720 
and whatnot so that obviously is a big
problem<00:05:03.440> with<00:05:03.800> having<00:05:03.920> them<00:05:04.220> to<00:05:04.460> group

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
problem with having them to group

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.060 
problem with having them to group
together<00:05:05.230> they're<00:05:06.230> more<00:05:06.260> susceptible<00:05:06.830> to

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
together they're more susceptible to

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.620 
together they're more susceptible to
Splash<00:05:07.460> Damage<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:08.210> they're<00:05:08.300> all<00:05:08.390> getting

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
Splash Damage and they're all getting

Splash Damage and they're all getting
taken<00:05:08.870> out<00:05:09.110> and<00:05:09.910> even<00:05:10.910> though<00:05:11.000> they<00:05:11.120> were<00:05:11.150> able

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
to eat through walls very quickly by

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.430 
to eat through walls very quickly by
being<00:05:13.310> in<00:05:13.460> groups<00:05:13.700> and<00:05:13.880> whatnot<00:05:14.270> and<00:05:14.540> eat

through you know other high hitpoints
structures<00:05:17.720> in<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.590> end<00:05:18.740> it's<00:05:18.920> not<00:05:18.980> gonna

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
structures in the end it's not gonna

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.590 
structures in the end it's not gonna
matter<00:05:19.430> he's<00:05:19.700> not<00:05:19.850> going<00:05:20.000> to<00:05:20.060> be<00:05:20.150> able<00:05:20.270> to<00:05:20.390> get

matter he's not going to be able to get

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.950 
matter he's not going to be able to get
to<00:05:20.750> that<00:05:20.870> 50%<00:05:21.520> so<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:23.030> benefit<00:05:23.510> of<00:05:23.540> grouping

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
to that 50% so the benefit of grouping

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.370 
to that 50% so the benefit of grouping
them<00:05:24.080> together<00:05:24.460> isn't<00:05:25.460> enough<00:05:26.120> to<00:05:26.900> allow<00:05:27.350> him

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
them together isn't enough to allow him

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.280 
them together isn't enough to allow him
to<00:05:27.740> get<00:05:28.040> to<00:05:28.790> that<00:05:29.180> one-star<00:05:29.720> victory<00:05:30.020> and<00:05:30.200> we

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
to get to that one-star victory and we

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.220 
to get to that one-star victory and we
get<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:30.650> victory<00:05:30.950> instead<00:05:31.419> another<00:05:32.419> nice
