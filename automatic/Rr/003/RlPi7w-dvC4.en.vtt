and<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.960> challenge<00:01:09.890> is<00:01:10.159> to<00:01:10.909> say<00:01:11.750> you<00:01:12.110> develop

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
and the challenge is to say you develop

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.910 
and the challenge is to say you develop
a<00:01:13.130> strain<00:01:13.550> through<00:01:14.299> inbreeding<00:01:15.049> so<00:01:15.860> you

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
a strain through inbreeding so you

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.570 
a strain through inbreeding so you
breathe

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
breathe
