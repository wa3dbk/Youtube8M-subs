00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.109
 speaks guys all with you here is 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.370
 the invitations and in the video of 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.070
 trivia games about us 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.139
 we brought street fighter 2 which was one of 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.240
 favorite games of my childhood and 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.490
 responsible for some thick leather in my 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.039
 big tock because of making my glove 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.660
 that I ended up destroying the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.420
 my 2 and almost losing impressions 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.130
 them in my childhood with 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.529
 parallel conversations aside 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.210
 begin our curiosities today to 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.669
 Our first race today is about the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.230
 vega that was also known by many 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.300
 like balogh before capcom decided 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.280
 change the names and everything else but anyway 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.050
 as you can see and in the selection of 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.940
 characters appears the flag of the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.500
 spain since he is from spain 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.320
 Until then, the problem is that nobody 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.899
 in capcom he consulted an atlas a map 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.570
 mundi or something and saw that the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.280
 Spain had already changed its flag 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.370
 flag that appears in the game is the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.629
 spain of the dictator francisco franco 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.520
 governed from 32 to 10 75 and even he 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.140
 was installed in the government by the Nazis 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.229
 Look what an ugly thing, huh? 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.840
 just to remember these fighter 2 191 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.159
 So you have 16 years between 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.570
 change of flag and such that 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.670
 even it is considered unconstitutional 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.350
 In Spain today 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.990
 our next curiosity has to do with 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.180
 the street fighter from a robot road 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.830
 ed chan was a priceless version that 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.420
 They made such that the volume could 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.369
 transform into other characters could 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.350
 cast magic in the air and with this death 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.329
 These things even ended up stopping 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.060
 and street fighter and eventually 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.939
 franchise but at that time was something 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.740
 crazy pirate in china in japan you are 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.079
 where this version 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.500
 by the way, this version of the road show 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.020
 ended up inspiring the rai perdition of the 62 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.880
 when james goddard from capcom resolved 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.470
 take a look at this road fighter 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.380
 and this to see if he was really a 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.610
 threat to their fighter 2 at first them 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.470
 ended up doing a faster version 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.820
 because he felt that after playing 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.290
 this language edition 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.909
 It seemed like I was playing if I had to. 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.750
 in the water when he played version 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.490
 hood 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.930
 our next crusade and has to do with the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.450
 the appearance of the radio that it 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.000
 will have two in the versions 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.500
 the river who sometimes 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.180
 the orange duke and such that 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.770
 in the end it turned out to be an easter 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.600
 Egg that capcom left there just to 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.790
 to shuffle the players so they 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.200
 trying to do it there when they 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.390
 decided to launch the super street fighter 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.000
 of capcom has actually decided to implement 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.700
 fire spells in the characters of the river and 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.280
 who the river won than the fire and what 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.920
 It gave a fire shock but until then it was only 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.330
 sucanagem the fans right away 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.330
 our fourth curiosity has to do with the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.100
 translation error that when you win it 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.200
 I used to say sometimes you have to win the 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.220
 chile name to have some chance of 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.590
 face it 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.110
 in fact shane long is a mall 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.400
 but someone missed the tradition and such and there 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.420
 ended up getting this year for several 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.739
 game versions 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.870
 after that there were a lot of rumors 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.270
 about who would be shane long tall a 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.370
 and even launched an edition with a 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.140
 joker about having to win the game in 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.090
 conditions and tips for it 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.370
 appear and face every fighter 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.790
 but this ultimately inspired capcom in 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.220
 create the character the tub and then to the 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.470
 own character full long at super 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.390
 street fighter 4 arcade edition appears 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.850
 the goal who is the master of can rio 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.370
 and that would be the one of shane long but one 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.190
 troop and accumulation arose because of 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.630
 on April 1 and closed the 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.340
 list of curiosities not only about the 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.440
 street fighter combos 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.540
 in fact they exist from street 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.519
 fighter 2 it actually arose a bug 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.380
 that allowed him to cancel his 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.780
 attacks to fit some more in the 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.580
 The problem is that it's so difficult. 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.560
 do them that actually end up 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.269
 thought the players would be able to 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.280
 and if they really can be a 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.000
 few players who would run without 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.100
 command 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.549
 there just a lot of people here could 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.530
 to do this, and the caco implemented this 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.390
 sequence of attacks and everything else and even 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.530
 give more points until you get more points 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.090
 indeed today for those who makes you 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.680
 in fact a fundamental mechanics of the 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.570
 game 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.130
 Good people, we stayed here like 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.910

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.680
