00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.080
 watson has earned the success that is 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.490
 the question of this week and I think 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.790
 it is not honest a bit community 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.740
 am 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.140
 because success is usually yes 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.540
 always deserved and that's when whatsapp 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.400
 certainly more than 100 million 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.560
 users only under android 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.180
 hey who else has this before 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.739
 So somehow they made it 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.570
 Of course, it certainly deserves because they are for 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.070
 right time with a simple one 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.110
 solution at the right spot but were 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.850
 not with the best solution not with 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.500
 a good me not even not only 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.960
 with not the best but I with 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.640
 a good solution anyway the question 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.820
 which remains for me and this with one 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.460
 success intertwined makes whatsapp 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.680
 actually meaning no I have myself 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.050
 also on my phones I would have now 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.630
 not thought that he also sees it that way 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.340
 but it annoys me colossally I missed 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.170
 keep telling me because of me 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.700
 not really paying attention 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.119
 in the end, somehow, this 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.070
 symbol of whatsup flashing or not 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.990
 a new proprietary news system 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.219
 distracts me completely from my own 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.319
 the actual environment is one 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:21.090
 good point at which I unfortunately with my 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:23.729
 but did not think that argument 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.530
 Of course whatsapp is proprietary 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.389
 whatsapp is imprisoned i can only do it 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.249
 on a single mobile phone 

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:30.600
 I can not do it on my tablet too 

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:32.429
 maybe not on my second the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.079
 used and I can not over 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:39.119
 the computer the news see it 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:41.369
 is stupid stupid and stupid 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.170
 means I finally hang out 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.630
 i have google messages i have google 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.560
 voice bla bla bla bla bla sms imessage 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.709
 I still have everything 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.179
 and I would say that annoys and 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.069
 That's why I believe that whatsapp 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.899
 in the long run it would be a bit 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:02:01.109
 get more difficult and I am once 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:04.560
 very curious if the things to do so 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:07.469
 will say again I would say 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.940
 he is also covered he speaks 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.560
 still in the background though 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.940
 but I do not have shouting 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.040
 two more or less one right 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.330
 Horny punishment 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.460
 who wants to know what a point landing 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.160
 he can once mainz on 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.790
 in the election has nevertheless he has 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.860
 right with what he says it is 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.690
 another additional protocol is and 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.920
 what you have to say there is it 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.480
 indeed not even more particularly safe 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.090
 it is not encrypted there 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.820
 security holes and so on, but good 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.070
 other topic the last sentence you can 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.940
 think so out of necessity but that too should 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.430
 yes already enough 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.990
 I was curious what Daniel says so 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.770
 the hero probably again whatsup 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.770
 grab it right 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:03:02.510
 hello at stage backstage that's good 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.510
 the poor who has the arm broken 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.250
 has has sometimes look a story to tell 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.970
 whatsapp deserves the success very clearly 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.620
 No 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.600
 Nevertheless , a simple messenger is 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.160
 whatsapp was at the right time on 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.470
 right spot namely in the app store 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.940
 but whatsapp has nothing whatever me me 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.950
 I'm not so sure if they are not 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.930
 even started at android 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.070
 it is true of is right it was in 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.750
 app store but he really meant that 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.170
 the only point i could do was me 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.970
 recall 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.910
 I have come over the time 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.780
 Viral video messenger somehow 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.280
 90s as icq could have done 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.220
 Everything else whatsapp does 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.200
 is not really great whatsapp who 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.750
 who is behind it what are they doing 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.080
 with all data that is the point 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.140
 what are they doing with ours? 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.140
 dates 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.580
 Sometimes you do not want it that way 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.680
 actually know or at least 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.049
 The question is getting better ahead 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.299
 in any case whatsapp is not sure about it 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.670
 already had enough problems and 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.010
 Security holes will be address books 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.630
 on whatsapp server loaded million 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.489
 billions of messages 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.140
 private nature will be over watts in the 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.269
 server and no one knows that 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.200
 exactly what does the company do behind it 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.729
 with which earned money next point 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.560
 first free android user can 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.660
 Download it now for free 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.190
 a few cents then press yes 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.040
 once android just for somehow 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.410
 pay a little bit per year 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.870
 touchÃ©, it's really like that 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.979
 that chaos reigns at whatsapp and 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.780
 that annoys me myself kolossa ios user 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.000
 have already bought the now on 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.000
 ios users will also be available from this time on 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.560
 what year pay etc where does that lead to that 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.910
 it can not be that 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.130
 competition definitely comes 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.130
 I hope she makes whatsapp place 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.110
 punktlandung herr rejoiced 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.670
 very very good 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.590
 the question is but you are not one 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.500
 only in the haller to the question 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.870
 received 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.240
 the point was yes whatsapp has his 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.410
 It is now deserved success in no that 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.360
 one can expect that from it 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.940
 that you mean that now but said 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:21.290
 do not have it but otherwise really 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.980
 solid what you are told is really 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.450
 I think that's good 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:31.150
 so thumbs up and that despite the 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:35.750
 broken shoulder horny 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:48.250
 a point landing and what is that 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:48.250
 correct opinion it is the right one at 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:56.240
 Gorgeous so I have to go now 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.750
 stop and continue for a while 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.750
 laugh
