00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.799 
your outlook for March twenty for 2014
and<00:00:11.730> we're<00:00:12.330> going<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:12.480> have<00:00:12.630> high<00:00:12.780> pressure

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
and we're going to have high pressure

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.799 
and we're going to have high pressure
this<00:00:13.349> could<00:00:13.530> be<00:00:13.620> off<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:14.009> our<00:00:14.099> South<00:00:14.340> today

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
this could be off to our South today

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.970 
this could be off to our South today
sitting<00:00:15.809> right<00:00:15.960> over<00:00:15.990> top<00:00:16.320> our<00:00:16.500> area<00:00:16.830> actually

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
sitting right over top our area actually

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.250 
sitting right over top our area actually
for<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.430> most<00:00:17.640> part<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.810> means<00:00:19.140> we're

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
for the most part and that means we're

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.050 
for the most part and that means we're
going<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.410> have<00:00:19.470> mostly<00:00:20.100> sunny<00:00:20.369> skies<00:00:20.670> but

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060

is<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:31.560> getting<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.250> mid<00:00:32.520> 30s<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:33.090> many

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
is just getting to the mid 30s in many

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.150 
is just getting to the mid 30s in many

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
locations mid to upper 30s as you get

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.549 
locations mid to upper 30s as you get
down<00:00:35.280> here<00:00:35.340> towards<00:00:35.670> Philadelphia<00:00:36.559> it's

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
down here towards Philadelphia it's

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.319 
down here towards Philadelphia it's
really<00:00:37.950> going<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.250> be<00:00:38.309> well<00:00:38.610> below<00:00:38.760> normal<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
really going to be well below normal and

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.760 
really going to be well below normal and
you'll<00:00:39.690> definitely<00:00:39.840> feel<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.350> definitely

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
you'll definitely feel it definitely

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.440 
you'll definitely feel it definitely
feel<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.010> winter<00:00:41.250> each<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> next<00:00:42.300> three

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
feel like winter each of the next three

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.420 
feel like winter each of the next three
days<00:00:42.870> we're<00:00:43.860> going<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.070> this

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
days we're going to have this

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.160 
days we're going to have this
high-pressure<00:00:45.000> move<00:00:45.270> off<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.660> east<00:00:45.690> here

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
high-pressure move off to the east here

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.900 
high-pressure move off to the east here
and<00:00:46.350> then<00:00:46.950> we're<00:00:47.309> going<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> go<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.610> little<00:00:47.760> bit

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
and then we're going to go a little bit

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.400 
and then we're going to go a little bit
further<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.390> next<00:00:48.629> storm<00:00:48.870> system<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
further to the next storm system and

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.479 
further to the next storm system and
this<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.829> be<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> one<00:00:50.100> moving<00:00:50.250> off

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
this is going to be the one moving off

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.670 
this is going to be the one moving off
the<00:00:50.520> Carolina<00:00:50.940> coastline<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.750> heading<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.620> in

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
the Carolina coastline and heading to in

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.200 
the Carolina coastline and heading to in
an<00:00:52.800> East<00:00:53.039> northeasterly<00:00:53.430> direction<00:00:54.120> from

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
an East northeasterly direction from

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.110 
an East northeasterly direction from
that<00:00:54.420> point<00:00:55.250> and<00:00:56.250> our<00:00:56.550> system<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:56.969> just

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
that point and our system is just

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.430 
that point and our system is just
entering<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> picture<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.960> frame<00:00:58.230> here

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
entering the picture in this frame here

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.979 
entering the picture in this frame here
just<00:00:58.649> barely<00:00:59.000> down<00:01:00.000> here<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> South<00:01:00.719> here

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
just barely down here to the South here

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.540 
just barely down here to the South here
now<00:01:01.170> there<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.949> going<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.280> be<00:01:02.309> some

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
now there is going to be some

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.770 
now there is going to be some
upper-level<00:01:02.789> energy<00:01:03.059> that's<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.660> move

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
upper-level energy that's going to move

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.240 
upper-level energy that's going to move
in<00:01:03.930> through<00:01:04.110> with<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> system<00:01:04.890> that's<00:01:05.010> going<00:01:05.100> to

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
in through with a system that's going to

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.149 
in through with a system that's going to
be<00:01:05.309> actually<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.720> separate<00:01:07.500> system<00:01:07.650> from<00:01:07.950> this

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
be actually a separate system from this

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.410 
be actually a separate system from this
that<00:01:08.310> will<00:01:08.430> actually<00:01:08.549> merge<00:01:08.939> with<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.240> well

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
that will actually merge with this well

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.719 
that will actually merge with this well
offshore<00:01:09.659> but<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.890> upper-level<00:01:11.220> energy<00:01:11.369> will

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
offshore but the upper-level energy will

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.520 
offshore but the upper-level energy will
move<00:01:11.880> through<00:01:11.909> here<00:01:12.420> around<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> base<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
move through here around the base of the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.410 
move through here around the base of the
trough<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.490> will<00:01:14.640> have<00:01:14.790> some<00:01:15.090> snow

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
trough and you will have some snow

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.640 
trough and you will have some snow
across<00:01:15.689> our<00:01:15.930> area<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.409> going<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.560> be

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
across our area but it's going to be

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.830 
across our area but it's going to be
much<00:01:16.770> lighter<00:01:17.070> no<00:01:17.790> direct<00:01:18.150> impacts<00:01:18.509> from<00:01:18.659> this

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
much lighter no direct impacts from this

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.600 
much lighter no direct impacts from this
coastal<00:01:19.200> system<00:01:19.530> has<00:01:19.619> moves<00:01:19.830> off<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> off

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
coastal system has moves off to the off

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.420 
coastal system has moves off to the off
to<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.820> northeast<00:01:21.270> here<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.189> will<00:01:23.189> be<00:01:23.280> some

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
to the northeast here so will be some

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.880 
to the northeast here so will be some
light<00:01:23.580> snow<00:01:23.850> maybe<00:01:24.450> even<00:01:24.689> an<00:01:24.900> inverted<00:01:25.590> trough

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
light snow maybe even an inverted trough

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.520 
light snow maybe even an inverted trough
that<00:01:26.130> sets<00:01:26.369> up<00:01:26.580> here<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.990> will<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.439> an

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
that sets up here and that will be an

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.050 
that sets up here and that will be an
association<00:01:29.130> with<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> low<00:01:29.400> pressure<00:01:29.670> system

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
association with the low pressure system

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.990 
association with the low pressure system
it<00:01:30.119> gets<00:01:30.360> up<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.960> about<00:01:30.990> right<00:01:31.259> here<00:01:31.820> you<00:01:32.820> may

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
it gets up to about right here you may

for you here this is all your upper

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.900 
for you here this is all your upper
level<00:02:58.710> energy<00:02:58.770> that<00:02:59.160> has<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.430> swing<00:02:59.640> through

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
level energy that has to swing through

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.150 
level energy that has to swing through
here<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.300> as<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.320> does<00:03:01.350> says<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.830> system

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
here and as it does says the system

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.890 
here and as it does says the system
moves<00:03:02.340> off<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.700> northeast<00:03:03.120> here<00:03:03.360> the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
moves off to the northeast here the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.330 
moves off to the northeast here the
system<00:03:04.230> is<00:03:04.290> really<00:03:04.440> going<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.710> bomb<00:03:04.890> out<00:03:05.130> out

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
system is really going to bomb out out

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.980 
system is really going to bomb out out
here<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:06.090> does<00:03:06.240> so<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.480> little<00:03:06.720> quicker

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
here and it does so a little quicker

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.750 
here and it does so a little quicker
here's<00:03:07.650> your<00:03:07.710> inverted<00:03:08.100> trough<00:03:08.430> that<00:03:08.490> start

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
here's your inverted trough that start

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.130 
here's your inverted trough that start
setting<00:03:09.060> up<00:03:09.120> here<00:03:09.330> on<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.480> name<00:03:09.660> here<00:03:09.900> just

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
setting up here on the name here just

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.780 
setting up here on the name here just
like<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.740> it<00:03:10.830> actually<00:03:11.130> is<00:03:11.460> attached<00:03:11.760> to

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
like this and it actually is attached to

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.310 
like this and it actually is attached to
the<00:03:11.970> system<00:03:12.330> here<00:03:12.510> but<00:03:12.660> this<00:03:12.780> is<00:03:12.960> part<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:13.230> the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
the system here but this is part of the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.170 
the system here but this is part of the
upper-level<00:03:13.680> energy<00:03:13.860> that<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:14.820> starting<00:03:14.970> to

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
upper-level energy that is starting to

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.840 
upper-level energy that is starting to
come<00:03:15.390> into<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.630> system<00:03:16.140> here<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.670> allow<00:03:17.670> this

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
come into the system here and allow this

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.390 
come into the system here and allow this
thing<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.090> really<00:03:18.420> blow<00:03:18.630> up<00:03:18.810> out<00:03:18.960> here<00:03:18.990> so<00:03:19.470> but

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
thing to really blow up out here so but

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.620 
thing to really blow up out here so but
that<00:03:20.520> upper-level<00:03:20.790> energy<00:03:21.000> does<00:03:21.390> have<00:03:21.540> to

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
that upper-level energy does have to

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.150 
that upper-level energy does have to
merge<00:03:21.810> through<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.410> it<00:03:22.500> will<00:03:22.680> produce<00:03:22.890> some

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
merge through and it will produce some

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.340 
merge through and it will produce some
snow<00:03:23.430> although<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.090> will<00:03:24.240> be<00:03:24.360> light<00:03:24.630> across

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
snow although it will be light across

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.060 
snow although it will be light across

with<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:39.900> wrote<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.170> trough<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.650> this<00:03:40.770> is<00:03:40.830> just

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
with you wrote a trough and this is just

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.070 
with you wrote a trough and this is just
the<00:03:40.980> leftover<00:03:41.400> precipitation<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.240> then<00:03:42.810> this

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
the leftover precipitation and then this

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.740 
the leftover precipitation and then this
will<00:03:43.650> move<00:03:43.830> offshore<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:44.700> weekend<00:03:45.210> as<00:03:45.480> the

it merges in with our main system here

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.450 
it merges in with our main system here
is<00:03:56.060> you<00:03:57.060> know<00:03:57.180> it's<00:03:57.840> going<00:03:58.080> to<00:03:58.380> you<00:03:59.040> know<00:03:59.130> just

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
is you know it's going to you know just

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.430 
is you know it's going to you know just
produce<00:03:59.790> some<00:04:00.060> light<00:04:00.270> lights<00:04:00.570> knows<00:04:00.870> before

produce some light lights knows before
that<00:04:01.650> does<00:04:02.250> in<00:04:02.460> fact<00:04:02.490> merge<00:04:02.940> so<00:04:03.210> that's<00:04:03.390> what's

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
that does in fact merge so that's what's

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.870 
that does in fact merge so that's what's
really<00:04:03.840> going<00:04:04.080> on<00:04:04.200> with<00:04:04.410> this<00:04:04.500> or<00:04:05.010> whether<00:04:05.640> on

really going on with this or whether on

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.520 
really going on with this or whether on
Tuesday<00:04:06.300> could<00:04:06.540> be<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.780> last<00:04:06.810> snowfall<00:04:07.440> of

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
Tuesday could be the last snowfall of

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.230 
Tuesday could be the last snowfall of
the<00:04:07.560> season<00:04:07.620> really<00:04:08.610> now<00:04:08.700> expected<00:04:09.120> too<00:04:09.210> much

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
the season really now expected too much

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.630 
the season really now expected too much
snow<00:04:09.510> after<00:04:09.930> this<00:04:10.230> point<00:04:10.560> we<00:04:11.340> are<00:04:11.460> getting

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
snow after this point we are getting

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.940 
snow after this point we are getting
close<00:04:11.940> to<00:04:11.970> April<00:04:12.390> now<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:12.870> your<00:04:13.380> chances<00:04:13.830> are

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
close to April now so your chances are

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.099 
close to April now so your chances are
really<00:04:14.100> going<00:04:14.370> downhill<00:04:14.720> going<00:04:15.720> down<00:04:15.900> back<00:04:16.080> to

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
really going downhill going down back to

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.660 
really going downhill going down back to
the<00:04:16.230> GFS<00:04:16.650> here<00:04:16.799> here's<00:04:16.980> our<00:04:17.100> system<00:04:17.400> taking

the GFS here here's our system taking
off<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:18.299> heading<00:04:18.630> up<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:18.900> hitting<00:04:19.049> Nova

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
off and heading up and hitting Nova

off and heading up and hitting Nova
Scotia<00:04:19.620> at<00:04:19.859> this<00:04:19.980> point<00:04:20.280> beyond<00:04:21.150> that<00:04:21.299> we're

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
Scotia at this point beyond that we're

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.760 
Scotia at this point beyond that we're
going<00:04:21.480> to<00:04:21.540> high-pressure<00:04:21.930> move<00:04:22.200> in<00:04:22.350> behind<00:04:22.500> it

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
going to high-pressure move in behind it

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.790 
going to high-pressure move in behind it
so<00:04:22.890> nice<00:04:23.070> day<00:04:23.280> on<00:04:23.430> Thursday<00:04:24.590> but<00:04:25.590> in

so nice day on Thursday but in

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.230 
so nice day on Thursday but in
temperature<00:04:26.160> will<00:04:26.250> start<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.580> warm<00:04:26.790> a<00:04:26.910> little

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
temperature will start to warm a little

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.969

it as we get any day on Thursday and

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.110 
it as we get any day on Thursday and
that's<00:04:29.160> because<00:04:29.280> your<00:04:29.490> winds<00:04:29.729> are<00:04:29.910> going<00:04:29.970> to

ship around to the southwest and that

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.290 
ship around to the southwest and that
means<00:04:32.400> you're<00:04:32.520> going<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.669> warmer

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300

here's Friday morning here's your system

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.219 
here's Friday morning here's your system
up<00:05:05.190> here<00:05:05.520> your<00:05:06.030> cold<00:05:06.300> front<00:05:06.539> with<00:05:06.720> this<00:05:06.900> system

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
up here your cold front with this system

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.350 
up here your cold front with this system
is<00:05:07.319> back<00:05:07.560> here<00:05:07.860> like<00:05:08.039> this<00:05:08.280> and<00:05:08.520> here's<00:05:09.240> your

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
is back here like this and here's your

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.600 
is back here like this and here's your
low<00:05:09.539> pressure<00:05:09.810> of<00:05:10.590> course<00:05:10.830> this<00:05:11.009> is<00:05:11.159> all<00:05:11.280> rain

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
low pressure of course this is all rain

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.830 
low pressure of course this is all rain
here<00:05:11.909> because<00:05:12.120> the<00:05:12.210> temperatures<00:05:12.599> are<00:05:12.659> so

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
here because the temperatures are so

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.290 
here because the temperatures are so
warm<00:05:13.169> and<00:05:13.610> this<00:05:14.610> cold<00:05:14.819> front<00:05:14.940> will<00:05:15.120> push

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
warm and this cold front will push

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.260 
warm and this cold front will push
through<00:05:15.539> later<00:05:16.500> Friday<00:05:16.889> evening<00:05:17.430> but<00:05:17.639> before

as high pressure is moving in so the

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.110 
as high pressure is moving in so the
