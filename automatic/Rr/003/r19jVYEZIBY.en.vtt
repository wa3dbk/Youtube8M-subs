00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.259
 for that reason, but basically there are three hydraulic fluids 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.480
 that is plague 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.739
 main mission that has behind that the pressure then a system of 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:14.549
 this brake of a vehicle 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.400
 is what is going to do is that by affecting the brake pedal to that pressure that is 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.949
 applied on the pedal 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.079
 is transmitted to the wheel a certain way to the vehicle 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.089
 this one has his 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.249
 there are certain basic properties that came a privilege to do the 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.140
 main of all we could call that advertising point 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.000
 this is 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.500
 a parameter that 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.950
 it quickly allows us 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.630
 the quality of the brake fluid that influences the origin point of the fluid 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.630
 buenos aires it is important to know that the brake fluid 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.270
 close in the areas near the wheel 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.000
 alcasa much temperature is the brake lifts temperature high temperature is 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.070
 transmits to the liquid what happens with the 60 near the point good vision is 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.100
 can form 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.700
 steam bubbles 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.270
 if something comes first, the pedal 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.290
 absorbs part of the applied pressure sticker transmits the cross 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.030
 the common user 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.720
 first thing you have to do is turn to recognized brands 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.510
 then observe the container 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.660
 trying to establish certain guidelines you have to have your basis that for 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.630
 curb the inviolability that the requirements of the norm have until 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.920
 the norm that also establishes that the requirements of the text what is called 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.400
 labeled 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.840
 Instructions for use on the back and mainly in what is called hard 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.310
 made that are certified auto parts population 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.490
 what is the same certificate that the law obliges the law to have as an element of 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.040
 vehicle safety 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.610
 and discarded they will go 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.870
 for approved the main inn that has to go 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.290
 far exceeds the norm and half 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.230
 so much that that guy 3 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.210
 as the type 4 confidence guarantee of him 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.710
 The follow-up control that has product quality assurance control 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.929
 that has barral 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.660
 for surprise of the certificates under iso 9000 standards 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.100
 will be the main guarantee that has 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.190
 the user who bought dahl 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.690
 is the assurance that the product you are carrying meets the standard 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:16.679
 that before there was another side of one of the ways of seeing 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:20.529
 zelda warm fluid for brakes and let's just look at the girl point let's go to 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:24.049
 see how football is determined according to the norm 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:29.269
 the deliquium temperature has been placed let's see when you start eo laugh 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.509
 the temperature of the thermometer 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:35.279
 and definitely stabilize its temperature and stabilized 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.279
 I love you, aimed at the victims' vision 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.349
 there we went through the minimum that the norm asks for 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:50.089
 z exceeding the norm the wish mace 105 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.769
 he chose a rivero glory 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.219
 Your Health 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:58.490
 and finally his figure to go out and ear 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.699
 go see we are in two stolen meta encounters 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:04.299
 both the accuracy of the apparatus 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.089
 reported Portuguese gonzalo at that bright point triplets 2 50 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:12.839
 for palau mossad to repeat the same Czech jump that goes with a product that 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.109
 in principle for your pass 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.649
 does not comply with the law and regulations in that sense and with the 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:22.469
 Business management 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.469
 but above all you must grant as before 

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:30.610
 let's wait a little longer to continue raising but hey 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.450
 I do not think it goes over 105 degrees 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.949
 the one he 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:35.449
 the brake fluid 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:38.319
 goes down very abruptly when it is contaminated with water only 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.699
 contaminated 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:43.959
 things and mario and luigi conagua to put for example 50 and 50 bolivia for 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.899
 slow the fall is very marked 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:47.279
 to provide 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:49.929
 olga eta stable 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:51.019
 I feel brought more 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.049
 if we go back to the norm 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.019
 we have trent type 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.049
 minimum 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.429
 205 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:59.079
 There are other 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.429
 we do not have 103 how to do 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:03.479
 yes 100 degrees less 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.819
 what he asks for is minimal 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.709
 i 140 degrees if we compare it with 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.709
 for example endorsement we test 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.129
 for another of the lines 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:31.159
 of additives that are important and that often does not approve recognized that 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:34.169
 until the importance of the line for fuels 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.479
 inside of 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.529
 pineapple and uncle paco gutiérrez decidedly the means for diesel 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:43.429
 tiger to heavy fuels as a feature of ten clubs are the most 

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:47.749
 conflicting from the point of view of quality and uniformity of charity to be 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:52.559
 one can suddenly against gaza and of good quality and in the case of slurry 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:54.779
 poor quality 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:56.309
 the system 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:59.309
 your engine combustion system and it looks pretty 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:03.430
 delicate when doing to the quality of the fuel 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.879
 say suffers a lot the quality of fuels 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:13.610
 much more the case of engines lie or logía and of last generation as the 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.449
 engines with common-rail 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.669
 turbodiesel tdi engines are more susceptible to a 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.569
 a bad quality 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.649
 of nextel at this point the use of additives becomes important 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.990
 are addictive anticorrosive minutes before asked to improve combustion 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:31.699
 decrease consumption 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:36.340
 pardal within this line and goats already talking about gasol has lonely high 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.800
 they say that you have several mule presentations for heavy duty you can line up 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.800
 the classical bises is an additive that improves combustion 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.000
 lubricity improves gas or light is already important for the duration of the 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:50.050
 infection pump 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.560
 frankly do not confuse with low sulfur content that the country 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.300
 goes through health indicated that it will start to become a bit more critical improve 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.300
 combustion punctures consumption as it increases the master power between the number 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.710
 of sects is not this would not come to be something like the octane to 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.940
 adapt sometimes state for the diesel oil managers of proven effectiveness 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:12.189
 in increase state number 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:14.979
 this improves the cold start 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:18.219
 Improves the power the drag force of the colt 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.870
 for that reason it is a very economical treatment because for example the case 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.409
 of art in the presentation the liter pass with a liter is enough to 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:30.969
 600 liters of diesel fuel in the case of the vehicle's hector 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:35.330
 particular use authors guys in every presentation said cubic centimeter 

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:39.799
 that for a gas tank and well this has a preventative defect messi 

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:43.099
 keeps clean and without sectors improve combustion 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:48.919
 and then we have what it is for the purifying effect of Guaraní cleaning 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:52.319
 this would be the case of xerez this line 

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:56.639
 the recent divorce release that is a dirty aspect for 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:00.840
 the cleaning of the circuit symbolizes both the tank and sepulcher 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.369
 come out 

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:03.070
 machines and 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.229
 nelson specific for cleaning and sixth 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:09.080
 has therefore within the line of what is the top and ceded Indian for gasol 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.750
 we also have the antifreeze for gasoil alleged gunman the super 

00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:16.310
 bowl discounted brush with the addition of a 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.000
 as well as the need to go to the end of an ecosystem of companies in the world 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.319
 on the move for those at home 

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:27.839
 this additive what follows is shy go from the freezing point of diesel 

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:30.249
 which comes now that times are coming 

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:35.009
 cold or in the year but in areas where there are temperatures below 

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:39.099
 zero degree conflict because they are formed to finance these tactics 

00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:40.300
 obstructionists 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.050
 o ducts or open door for filters 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:47.509
 which does not win psoe insulza part of the conflict of epc the air before 

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:51.270
 in twiiter that therefore the system does not intimidate next generation adds 

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.409
 it for gasol that we protect very tested of many years ago with some 

00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:56.479
 great and science 

00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:58.460
 both the consumption point of view 

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.969
 as the point of view of 

00:07:59.969 --> 00:08:00.719
 maintenance
