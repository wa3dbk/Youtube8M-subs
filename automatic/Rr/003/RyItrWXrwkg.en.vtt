does<00:00:12.950> so<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.160> reason<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.580> got<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:15.240> because

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
does so the reason I got this is because

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.890 
does so the reason I got this is because
it's<00:00:15.960> all<00:00:16.170> black<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.619> had<00:00:17.340> great<00:00:17.670> reviews<00:00:17.900> and

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
it's all black and had great reviews and

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.439 
it's all black and had great reviews and
it's<00:00:19.529> compatible<00:00:19.980> with<00:00:20.279> our<00:00:20.580> stroller<00:00:21.090> that

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
it's compatible with our stroller that

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.710 
it's compatible with our stroller that
we<00:00:21.600> purchased<00:00:22.580> and<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.789> think<00:00:24.000> we<00:00:24.090> both<00:00:24.119> agreed

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
we purchased and I think we both agreed

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.769 
we purchased and I think we both agreed
that<00:00:24.990> we<00:00:25.439> didn't<00:00:25.830> want<00:00:26.099> many<00:00:26.640> designs<00:00:27.150> on<00:00:27.539> it

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
that we didn't want many designs on it

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.950 
that we didn't want many designs on it
it<00:00:28.410> just<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.800> case<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:29.460> was<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> boy<00:00:30.300> or<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.570> girl<00:00:30.720> I

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
it just in case it was a boy or a girl I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.380 
it just in case it was a boy or a girl I
could<00:00:31.109> work<00:00:31.439> both<00:00:31.679> ways<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.520> if<00:00:32.880> we<00:00:33.059> decide

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
could work both ways and if we decide

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.200 
could work both ways and if we decide
have<00:00:33.660> another<00:00:33.960> baby<00:00:34.219> who<00:00:35.219> knows<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:36.059> can

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
system compatible so that's what you're

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.600 
system compatible so that's what you're
talking<00:01:30.659> about<00:01:30.750> with<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.960> stroller<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:32.460> is

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
talking about with a stroller it is

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.370 
talking about with a stroller it is
color<00:01:32.820> coded<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:33.540> we're<00:01:33.720> at<00:01:33.780> least<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> belt

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
color coded but we're at least the belt

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.560 
color coded but we're at least the belt
is<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.610> route<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> seat

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
is so that you can route it on the seat

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
is so that you can route it on the seat
in<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.960> handle<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:37.619> easy<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.009> figure<00:01:38.250> out

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
in the handle so it's easy to figure out

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.330 
in the handle so it's easy to figure out
how<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> get<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.000> work<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:40.200> something<00:01:40.590> made

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
how to get it to work is something made

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.700 
how to get it to work is something made
out<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.759> fresco<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.240> jersey<00:01:42.689> material<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.560> it

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
out of fresco of jersey material and it

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.160 
out of fresco of jersey material and it
has<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> dual<00:01:44.189> stage<00:01:44.549> cushion<00:01:45.090> system<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.810> is

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
has a dual stage cushion system it is

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.870 
has a dual stage cushion system it is
something<00:01:46.979> where<00:01:47.220> you're<00:01:47.310> supposed<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.729> do

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
something where you're supposed to do

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.160 
something where you're supposed to do
something<00:01:48.240> with<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.450> rear<00:01:48.630> round<00:01:48.840> tank<00:01:49.049> oh

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
something with the rear round tank oh

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.219 
something with the rear round tank oh
yeah<00:01:49.470> rear-facing<00:01:49.979> which<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.030> think<00:01:51.420> means<00:01:51.659> you

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
yeah rear-facing which I think means you

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.410 
yeah rear-facing which I think means you
put<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.530> baby<00:01:52.710> face<00:01:53.009> down<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.939> butts<00:01:54.240> out

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
put the baby face down so the butts out

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.060 
put the baby face down so the butts out
and<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.689> think<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.649> newest

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
and I think that is like the newest

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.620

child<00:01:56.399> safety<00:01:59.000> regulations<00:02:00.000> not<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.420> means

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
child safety regulations not that means

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.540 
child safety regulations not that means
that<00:02:01.110> when<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.680> babies

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
middle like this yeah we didn't believe

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.760 
middle like this yeah we didn't believe
in<00:02:20.160> safety<00:02:20.370> way<00:02:20.700> back<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.120> day<00:02:21.620> so<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:22.740> is

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
in safety way back in the day so this is

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.140 
in safety way back in the day so this is
definitely<00:02:23.040> more<00:02:23.340> than<00:02:23.520> I<00:02:23.550> turned<00:02:24.000> out<00:02:24.090> fine

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
definitely more than I turned out fine

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.850 
definitely more than I turned out fine
you<00:02:25.020> did<00:02:26.150> but<00:02:27.150> they<00:02:27.750> require<00:02:27.990> us<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.470> have<00:02:28.830> a

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
you did but they require us to have a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.010 
you did but they require us to have a
car<00:02:29.220> seat<00:02:29.490> so<00:02:29.700> they<00:02:29.850> won't<00:02:30.030> let<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.540> leave<00:02:30.780> the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
car seat so they won't let you leave the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.580 
car seat so they won't let you leave the
hospital<00:02:31.170> without<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.610> car<00:02:32.820> seat<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:34.050> we<00:02:34.260> had

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
hospital without the car seat so we had

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.980 
hospital without the car seat so we had
to<00:02:34.740> get<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.430> this<00:02:36.030> right<00:02:36.240> here<00:02:36.270> stays<00:02:36.750> in

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
to get this and this right here stays in

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.260 
to get this and this right here stays in
the<00:02:37.320> car<00:02:39.710> so<00:02:40.710> that<00:02:40.770> would<00:02:40.980> be<00:02:41.100> nice<00:02:41.250> because<00:02:42.030> it

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
the car so that would be nice because it

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.290 
the car so that would be nice because it
just<00:02:42.420> clicks<00:02:42.810> in<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.290> out<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:44.220> show<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.610> and
