00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
into doing a little more new stuff with

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.460 
into doing a little more new stuff with
those<00:01:08.610> characters<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:10.049> was<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> no-win

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
those characters but it was a no-win

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.800 
those characters but it was a no-win
situation<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:11.130> DC<00:01:11.430> because<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.030> history<00:01:12.750> of

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
situation in DC because the history of

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.300 
situation in DC because the history of
the<00:01:12.869> Legion<00:01:13.170> had<00:01:13.260> been<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.560> eroded<00:01:13.950> by

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
the Legion had been so eroded by

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.399 
the Legion had been so eroded by
continuity<00:01:14.820> reboots<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.479> stuff<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:16.259> there

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
continuity reboots and stuff but there

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.929 
continuity reboots and stuff but there
was<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.590> no<00:01:16.860> foundation<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.580> build<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
was just no foundation to build the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.399 
was just no foundation to build the
Legion<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.330> anymore<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:18.960> had<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.170> sort<00:01:19.320> of

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
Legion on anymore so we had to sort of

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.920 
Legion on anymore so we had to sort of
start<00:01:19.619> from<00:01:19.740> scratch<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.570> mean<00:01:21.810> it

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
start from scratch so it but I mean it

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.630 
start from scratch so it but I mean it
was<00:01:22.259> very<00:01:22.320> well<00:01:22.680> received<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.340> just

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
was very well received but it just

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.580 
was very well received but it just
didn't<00:01:24.390> feel<00:01:24.479> as<00:01:24.659> good<00:01:24.780> at<00:01:25.290> Legion

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
didn't feel as good at Legion
