have a couple other cool features about
this<00:01:15.520> is<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:16.630> reason<00:01:16.869> I<00:01:17.350> didn't<00:01:17.829> go<00:01:18.070> with<00:01:18.310> the

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
this is the reason I didn't go with the

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.499 
this is the reason I didn't go with the
wired<00:01:19.000> keep<00:01:19.570> or<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.079> wireless<00:01:20.680> keyboard<00:01:21.220> is

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
wired keep or the wireless keyboard is

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.780 
wired keep or the wireless keyboard is
because<00:01:22.509> as<00:01:23.439> you<00:01:23.650> can<00:01:23.710> see<00:01:23.860> this<00:01:24.159> is<00:01:24.400> the<00:01:24.430> wired

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
because as you can see this is the wired

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.020 
because as you can see this is the wired
is<00:01:25.560> because<00:01:26.560> um<00:01:26.829> I<00:01:27.040> don't<00:01:27.159> like<00:01:27.670> how<00:01:27.790> you<00:01:27.850> have

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
is because um I don't like how you have

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.020 
is because um I don't like how you have
to<00:01:28.180> replace<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:28.600> batteries<00:01:29.579> with<00:01:30.579> the<00:01:30.790> wired

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
to replace the batteries with the wired

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.569 
to replace the batteries with the wired
I<00:01:31.390> would<00:01:32.140> rather<00:01:32.259> just<00:01:32.590> put<00:01:32.829> wireless<00:01:33.369> you

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579
