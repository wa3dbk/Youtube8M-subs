 very good to everyone, how are you? 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.840
 mini and good today I bring you another poke 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.560
 analysis and this time it's from the pokemon in 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.810
 boal I will tell how this pokemon evolves 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.730
 which attack would be the best and what 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.210
 nature would be the best for this 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.379
 pokémon on board is a type pokémon 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.600
 fire fight that has the skills 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.559
 sea ​​flames and the hidden skill that 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.559
 it would be bold 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.710
 do not 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.780
 for the best nature for this 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.880
 pokemon I would definitely put the 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.400
 firm nature because this pokemon 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.470
 has a lot of physical attack and what 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.720
 makes us the firm nature is that we 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.590
 increase the physical attack and lower us 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.590
 the special attack 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.130
 the best attacks that we can put 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.049
 to this pokemon I would put strength 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.750
 gross that is an egg movement 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.020
 magnitude is also an egg movement 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:39.340
 instead of magnitude put an earthquake 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.250
 sharp rock emit neo or machada if not 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.039
 we put brute force on him too 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.720
 we can put an electric fist that 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.840
 can learn in the tutor 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.759
 movements 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.329
 how to make this evolution 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:58.049
 pokemon tepic evolve in picnic at 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.569
 level up to level 17 and picnic 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.280
 will evolve in embolar when climbing 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.280
 level at level 36 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.269
 and well, that's all I hope you 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:20.780

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.970
 this pokemon the pokemon in boal and nothing 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.209
