 these railway employees are doing everything 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.900
 possible to movement in 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.390
 the country remained continuous they 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.349
 service alarm devices 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.079
 centralization and blocking and 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.489
 no wonder that the profession 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:34.219
 electrician on the railroad alone 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:35.660
 of the most necessary this 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.610
 railway worker monitors work 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.460
 electrical devices and equipment 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.860
 from time to time or rather once a month on 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.539
 his shoulders falls and another job he 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.789
 regular participant integrated 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.559
 monthly inspection of the track switch 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.569
 translations and scb devices 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.129
 o in the fresh serviceability of technical 

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:54.319
 funds that are needed to 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.909
 ensure safety on the roads and 

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:59.300
 avoid train collision 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:01.829
 or any other accidents 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.870
 first attempts to make the roads more 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.360
 safe undertaken almost 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.040
 since their foundation is not so 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.180
 rarely locomotive spark set on fire 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.460
 wooden bridges 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.509
 but due to the lack of an alert system 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.700
 train approaching 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.649
 often people suffered first 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.899
 road safety provided 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.850
 the man who gave the signals horn and 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.710
 only when it was replaced by a semaphore 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.780
 started talking about having to be in staff 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.700
 employee who would follow 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.299
 light signaling health 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.340
 it happened at the beginning of the 20th century at first 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.970
 he inventor mechanics thought about 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.700
 automatic locking system 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:44.960
 it happened in 1859 in paris and 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.720
 only by 1870 did the first appear 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.470
 successes final for mass 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.080
 implementation 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.799
 project and experience of using chains 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.250
 ac appeared right at the beginning 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.049
 of the last century and later led to a wide 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.450
 automatic distribution 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.550
 lock on electro fixed 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.229
 railways to applicants for this 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.090
 the work presented the highest 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.280
 requirements however extra 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.980
 secured the train and transported on them 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.450
 passengers introducing hitchhiking and instrumentation 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.430
 stopped another train at his 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.530
 following through closed semaphore 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.510
 progress has allowed to improve 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.250
 invention and get system output 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.930
 which works without fail 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.180
 allow a person to guess about 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.000
 malfunctions if this happens but 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.260
 the system requires control 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.890
 electrician and carries this 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.420
 control you 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.350
 there are 8 we break start working 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.060
 electricians on railways 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.610
 have been treated to middle management 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.319
 it was possible to recognize such specialists by 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.540
 insignia on the uniform 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.880
 there were two stars on shoulder straps and 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.880
 hook which is angled from the shoulder 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.830
 but back in the first half 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.060
 twentieth century every year 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.709
 need for such specialists 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.660
 only increased 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.330
 especially invaluable is their contribution to providing 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.550
 the work of the railways during the great 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.640
 patriotic war among the heroes of that 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.050
 time and adele by puro he worked in 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.000
 underground and in 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.040
 sometimes even under enemy shelling 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.620
 climbed on poles to 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.170
 establish an air connection and even stole from 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.080
 under the nose of the enemies train with valuable cargo 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.390
 Work as an electrician and I'm an installer 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.700
 gave him the opportunity to meet 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.170
 many railway professions 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.170
 so lead 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.510
 composition and made a huge labor he 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.090
 coped with his task for all 100 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.360
 percent and courage and bravery helped 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.120
 him to commit an act worthy of heroes 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.430
 steel mains if stb system 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.260
 there was a problem the electrician should 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.790
 in the shortest possible time to diagnose and 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.350
 troubleshoot this problem 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.900
 because it depends on his actions 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.450
 driving safety and when you observe 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.400
 the work of electricians do not understand 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.650
 in vain these people are called spetsnaz stb 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.400
 in order to join the ranks 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.410
 electricians need to finish 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.640
 university specialty automation and 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.960
 telemechanics and communication on the railway 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.370
 transport 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.770
 or get medium technical 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.080
 education in railway college 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.970
 but the main thing is to understand that this profession is not 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.459
 for careerists whatever growth 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.260
 this work was not prophesied for those without 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.040
 railroad your life not 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.040
