00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:19.350
 Oh Well, first and smallest of things towards the size is small very nearly saw 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:24.240
 I do not think it's one of them.

 Write gatguyo it would be very convenient ah good point is one one s 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.660
 The power supply is dwaeseo like a huge big advantage that you do not plug the power off 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.420
 It's the same. 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.800
 If you can not find the code , can you just write a ghost of your computer's operation ? 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.129
 Ah 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.910
 Oh good going gatguyo the front side panels 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.910

 I do not know what it means to say hello. 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.120
 You close it and write it. 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:07.430
 I tried to save the paper for the fact that there was nothing that I deserved 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.430
 I 'll just scan it once in a credit card company. 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:17.300
 When falling 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.300
 Fits what extent is it so quiet but the noise is something nateot 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.729
 I do not think it's bad. 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:24.729
 When you enter some natjyo 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.330
 Meaning system is 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.860
 I did it now as a pdf file . 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:47.090
 I'm a teacher now with a pdf file. 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:52.039
 Yoga is a choice from the option to jpg 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.240
 In the case of pdf, there is ocr function so later 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:58.070

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.790
 I am sad to find a problem with search and one that is going to be such a thing. 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.460

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.780

 If unfortunately a little something anyway. What has come as US gogeo many times Oh Well 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.700

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.360
 Yes 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:18.010
 What are you to choose the options that I later read 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:22.120
 Oh, you can search with any job 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:26.920
 Well, then , this is the end . Let me just do one more thing. 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:30.810
 It 's possible to have a card. 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.810
 I go to New York four times . 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.090
 It is also very neat 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.330
 It's a bit like a lot of color. 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.680
 It comes out neatly. 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:53.079
 Uh 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:59.290
 Scanners are a lot of smartphone applications these days . 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:03:03.819
 Apparently it would be nice to have an application for simple 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:08.019
 If you want this kind of high-quality scanning, 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.920
 Oh, it would be nice to have a dedicated scanner. 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.920
 this 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.909
 I bought it when I went to Japan again 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.690
 I got it, but the price difference is domestic . 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:21.730

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.650
