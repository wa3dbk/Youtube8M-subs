00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
this ring is pretty good this is what it

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.610

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
because I'm not really good with like

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.320 
because I'm not really good with like
saying<00:05:52.710> what<00:05:52.950> type<00:05:53.220> of<00:05:53.250> material<00:05:53.850> things<00:05:54.030> are

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
saying what type of material things are

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.300 
saying what type of material things are
you<00:05:54.540> have<00:05:54.690> a<00:05:54.720> nursery<00:05:55.320> the<00:05:55.710> dress<00:05:55.950> and<00:05:56.250> the

you have a nursery the dress and the
Rings<00:05:56.760> kind<00:05:57.090> of<00:05:57.210> took<00:05:57.390> a<00:05:57.450> long<00:05:57.990> while<00:05:58.320> to<00:05:58.380> get

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
Rings kind of took a long while to get

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.370 
Rings kind of took a long while to get
here<00:05:58.950> but<00:05:59.640> that's<00:06:00.210> kind<00:06:00.570> of<00:06:00.720> like<00:06:00.930> reasonable
