good<00:00:26.240> I've<00:00:27.240> been<00:00:27.420> reading<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.779> reviews<00:00:28.109> and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
stuff and they say it's crappy but if

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.760 
stuff and they say it's crappy but if
you<00:00:30.119> ask<00:00:30.240> me<00:00:30.420> it's<00:00:30.539> good

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.060 

I<00:00:32.970> don't<00:00:33.970> know<00:00:34.060> I<00:00:34.740> don't<00:00:35.740> know<00:00:35.800> what<00:00:35.920> they've

bugs right now but I'm hoping they're

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.390 
bugs right now but I'm hoping they're
fixing<00:00:49.120> it<00:00:49.650> but<00:00:50.650> if<00:00:50.770> you're<00:00:50.950> planning<00:00:51.160> on

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.230 
fixing it but if you're planning on
getting<00:00:51.550> this<00:00:51.790> game<00:00:52.000> it's<00:00:52.240> a<00:00:52.330> very<00:00:52.510> good<00:00:52.690> idea

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
it may not be the exact same thing but

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.310 
it may not be the exact same thing but
it's<00:00:57.580> very<00:00:57.730> similar<00:00:58.140> and<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.840> all<00:01:01.990> around<00:01:02.170> a

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.450 
it's very similar and it's all around a
good<00:01:02.470> game<00:01:02.710> I<00:01:02.980> mean<00:01:03.160> I<00:01:04.320> may<00:01:05.320> not<00:01:05.470> be<00:01:05.830> the<00:01:06.040> exact

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.570 
good game I mean I may not be the exact
same<00:01:06.490> thing<00:01:06.760> but<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:09.400> pretty<00:01:09.670> great<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:12.460> is

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
they're completely different systems

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.969 
they're completely different systems
with<00:04:25.240> completely<00:04:25.660> different<00:04:25.780> processors<00:04:26.620> as

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
with completely different processors as

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.210 
with completely different processors as
well<00:04:27.039> as<00:04:27.520> other<00:04:27.789> stuff<00:04:28.210> on<00:04:28.830> there<00:04:29.830> all<00:04:30.070> the

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.980 

though<00:04:40.190> wherever<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.240> orcs<00:04:41.480> are<00:04:41.570> talking

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
though wherever the orcs are talking
