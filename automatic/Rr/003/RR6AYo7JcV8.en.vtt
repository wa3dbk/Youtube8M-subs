00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.310
Kyousuke-shi, if you don't do anything to calm Kiririn-shi down...

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.350
E-Even if you say that...

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.080
Then it's time for a TWOSHOT Dialogue!

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.210
A TWOSHOT Dialogue? What's that?

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.280
Having one to one conversations with Kiririn-shi!

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.580
React accordingly to the other party's speech and tsukkomi at the appropriate time!

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.750
I-I get it. I'll have a go at it...

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.680
Please be careful. There are times where you need not tsukkomi as well!

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.810
What are you mumbling about? You pervert! Die already!

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.600
■ This is a misunderstanding. ■
What are you mumbling about? You pervert! Die already!

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.970
What are you mumbling about? You pervert! Die already!

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.580
You can't even deny it?

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.480
C-Crap! I missed the chance to...!

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.280
Kyousuke-shi, good luck! Tsukkomi, tsukkomi!

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.380
I understand. Right, for the next one, I'll definitely...

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.910
Then, did you see them?

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:56.980
Huh?

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.480
I'm asking if you saw them!

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.480
W-What are you referring to!?

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.610
I'm talking about that...B-Black fellow's...u-underwear...

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.430
■ Didn't see. ■
I'm talking about that... B-Black fellow's... p-panties...

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.150
I'm talking about that... B-Black fellow's... p-panties...

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.110
...About that...

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.250
N-Not good! I missed the chance to...!

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.250
So you really did see them! Unbelievable!

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.610
...Senpai is really the worst form of garbage.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.850
...That's harsh.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.280
I'll ask you a final question.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.980
*Gulp*

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:24.150
Did you bring my friends over to your room when I wasn't here?

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.060
■ Nope! ■
Did you bring my friends over to your room when I wasn't here?

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.110
Did you bring my friends over to your room when I wasn't here?

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.180
N-Nope...

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.260
Did the tsukkomi succeed?

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.450
Then why did the two of them gather by themselves in your room today?

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.380
The black one said it too, "We have been gathering in this room". What's with that?

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.580
...What's going on? Explain yourself.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.480
Er... Errr...

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.680
N-No, no! Kiririn-shi! Please listen to me!

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.950
Huh?

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.780
When Kiririn-shi wasn't around, Kyousuke-shi was...

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.050
...really really lonely.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:14.680
That is why Kuroneko-shi and I decided to pay him a visit in his room, to raise his spirits!!

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.380
You got it now?

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.510
...In the end, it was Saori who helped me.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.680
Hmm... you... You got lonely when I wasn't around...

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.380
Disgusting. Just how much of a siscon are you?
