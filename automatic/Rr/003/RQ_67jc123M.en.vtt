00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.810 
souvenir shops and these cute little
snow<00:01:01.440> globes<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:01.949> caught<00:01:02.160> my<00:01:02.340> eye<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.730> I

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
snow globes just caught my eye and I

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.009 
snow globes just caught my eye and I
notice<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.300> they<00:01:03.420> made<00:01:03.600> them<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.840> all

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
notice that they made them in all

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.440 
notice that they made them in all
different<00:01:04.049> sizes<00:01:04.909> often<00:01:05.909> people<00:01:06.060> talk<00:01:06.420> about

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
different sizes often people talk about

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.289 
different sizes often people talk about
your<00:01:06.840> comfort<00:01:07.200> zone<00:01:07.439> as<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:08.189> box<00:01:08.490> stepping

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
your comfort zone as a box stepping

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.020 
your comfort zone as a box stepping
outside<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.080> box<00:01:10.260> means<00:01:10.770> try<00:01:11.580> something

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
outside of the box means try something

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.109 
outside of the box means try something
new<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.530> I<00:01:13.530> think<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> snow<00:01:14.700> globe<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.090> a

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
new and I think that a snow globe is a

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.450 
new and I think that a snow globe is a
great<00:01:15.420> analogy<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.380> comfort<00:01:16.860> zone<00:01:16.890> as<00:01:17.250> well

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
great analogy for a comfort zone as well

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.660 
great analogy for a comfort zone as well
so<00:01:18.270> if<00:01:18.600> at<00:01:18.869> week<00:01:19.110> one<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.100> your<00:01:20.250> comfort

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
so if at week one this is your comfort

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.910 
so if at week one this is your comfort
zone<00:01:20.880> with<00:01:20.909> art<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.659> art<00:01:21.810> licensing<00:01:22.020> you're
