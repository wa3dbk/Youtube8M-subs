00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.780
 friends, hello, today we have a full 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.139
 review on such a microphone 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.960
 capacitor b 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.820
 m700 means this microphone came from 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.580
 Site aliexpress I bought it a year 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.430
 back and since I was asked to take off 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.489
 get this video 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.320
 consider the microphone in detail he 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:31.919
 metallic all this is aluminum this 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.050
 also comes bundled with such a spit for 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.489
 so that noises are created when 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.090
 records say rap glasses, etc. 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.820
 spoil everything 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.240
 unscrew and show what's inside because 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.540
 that few people it shows well, let 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.540
 unscrew 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:56.630
 everything is removed just a thread here and here 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.630
 so everything goes 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.940
 we see som fee 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:14.130
 nothing supernatural here code for 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:17.280
 plug see and to remove this one 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.740
 the grid here is two screws 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.200
 but I will not do this there 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.710
 ordinary membrane tidy such 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.750
 centered here on this side but better with and 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:34.250
 read as it will go out 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:38.340
 I'll take two wiring and nothing else 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.190
 there is the same model inserted here 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.429
 battery battery in order to 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.700
 the microphone worked without a preamp for 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.800
 this mic needs a preamp but i 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.110
 I am glad that I came across this particular model 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.800
 since the quality preamp is much 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.069
 better than you have a battery here 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.369
 The battery sits literally I do not know for 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:04.439
 a month even less and unless of course you 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.320
 still actively use if you will 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.509
 actively use I do not know at all for 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.820
 week will sit down so here's such 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.820
 the design of this microphone with 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.880
 the microphone was the floor now i'm all 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.239
 show in detail and of course the plug 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.900
 at the end there is 35 jack see friends 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.530
 means 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.360
 This spider was included in the kit, but 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.579
 I certainly didn't have this stand 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.760
 I bought it separately 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:35.370
 this rack and here it goes 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.750
 mount originally when I bought it 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.670
 drains were not 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.750
 and I used on a tripod through here 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.750
 such an adapter 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.030
 that was not very good now everything 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.850
 comfortable and beautiful face means attached 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.740
 everything is pretty simple here 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:59.000
 angle, see how you want 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:02.940
 wind the mic in here 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.150
 that's the way, and here you do not fly 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.490
 and here it is only attached here 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.400
 springs looks like this and 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.210
 attached simply to the table 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:18.020
 also nothing supernatural 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.910
 further friends insert a pop filter and 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.600
 There is of course one more point. 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.570
 the filter here is such a mesh spit that 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:32.130
 allows you to record your voice even better 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:34.860
 and insert of course the plug here 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.980
 into the socket down so everyone left 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:42.150
 here are friends the cord goes to the preamp 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.910
 Means my preamp tube ultra 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.670
 gunnik 100 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:52.010
 so he looks on 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.989
 aliexpress I of course you did not buy 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.800
 it was already bought my country of course 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:01.890
 same goes get exmor goes here in 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.580
 microphone, that is, this cord is not in 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.550
 complete 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.550
 he goes with a microphone here he shows 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.530
 I think it is clear, yes, daddy mom, that is 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.260
 goes and here it is that in the bundle here it is 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.500
 Friends insert it into the cord 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.470
 same as this cord but idiot he 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:30.410
 3 this at the end of the jack is the cord coming 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:32.540
 sistemnik and here we see yes so here 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.080
 such things are here of course all 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.390
 expose at me like this 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.980
 I could not set up for a very long time 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.910
 here are two buttons in the middle 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:49.690
 it is included here 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:53.260
 phantom power 48 and it turns on 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.260
 conventional power supply 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.560
 if you say something here the scale moves 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.220
 if you are silent 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:07.520
 nothing happens 1 time 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.610
 Reception Reception That is, it works even with 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.720
 computer off but want to say 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:18.550
 Immediately that this microphone is needed 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:22.220
 use with a good sound card and 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.930
 that's all set up well but here 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.930
 remember how I can someone 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:30.260
 useful because I contacted 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:34.040
 one guy and he didn't help connect 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.620
 quite simple and the microphone is very very 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.770
 I like using already repeat 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:44.120
 more than a year everything is fine no hatches 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:48.979
 I did not find any problems with him 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:52.419
 this stand was such a here and such 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:52.419
 here are the microphone mounts 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:02.840
 maybe someone needs the same principle 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.970
 good thing and here is such a 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.340
 thread 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:10.430
 also possible for a tripod for the same 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:13.190
 no matter who is comfortable but 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.230
 I was here a spider I say it 100 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.080
 It is universal and can be used 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.880
 under any microphone, I think it is very convenient 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.330
 so friends are here's a video 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:26.000
 It turned out I think we will explain how 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:30.110
 connect a lot asked questions 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.430
 everything just really track recording 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.150
