inner<00:00:30.070> tunings<00:00:30.579> the<00:00:31.239> first<00:00:31.540> thing<00:00:31.840> I<00:00:31.989> want<00:00:32.200> to

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
inner tunings the first thing I want to

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.040 
inner tunings the first thing I want to
preface<00:00:32.529> this<00:00:32.739> is<00:00:33.420> alternate<00:00:34.420> tunings<00:00:34.630> are

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
preface this is alternate tunings are

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.639 
preface this is alternate tunings are
exactly<00:00:35.860> that<00:00:36.250> they<00:00:36.640> are<00:00:36.850> alternate<00:00:37.649> there's

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
exactly that they are alternate there's

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.799 
exactly that they are alternate there's
not<00:00:38.950> too<00:00:39.250> many<00:00:39.399> alternate<00:00:40.060> tunings<00:00:40.300> that<00:00:40.720> are

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
not too many alternate tunings that are

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.220 
not too many alternate tunings that are
truly<00:00:41.170> standardized<00:00:42.239> you've<00:00:43.239> got<00:00:43.480> 12<00:00:43.899> notes

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
truly standardized you've got 12 notes

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.470 
truly standardized you've got 12 notes
of<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:44.440> scale<00:00:44.680> and<00:00:45.190> six<00:00:45.670> strings<00:00:46.030> to<00:00:46.269> work

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
of the scale and six strings to work

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.930 
of the scale and six strings to work
with<00:00:46.719> so<00:00:47.350> if<00:00:47.500> you<00:00:47.649> think<00:00:47.949> about<00:00:48.070> it<00:00:48.280> and<00:00:48.609> you<00:00:48.670> do

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
with so if you think about it and you do

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.080 
with so if you think about it and you do
the<00:00:49.090> math<00:00:49.329> on<00:00:49.570> that<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.829> possibilities<00:00:51.820> for

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090

the math on that the possibilities for
alternate<00:00:52.690> tunings<00:00:52.929> is<00:00:53.410> just<00:00:53.739> tremendous<00:00:54.010> I

typically<00:01:23.890> refer<00:01:24.280> to<00:01:24.549> the<00:01:25.420> tuning<00:01:25.780> we<00:01:25.900> just

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
typically refer to the tuning we just

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.969 
typically refer to the tuning we just
talked<00:01:26.409> about<00:01:27.149> d<00:01:28.149> tuning<00:01:28.479> is<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:29.170> process<00:01:29.710> of

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
talked about d tuning is the process of

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.460 
talked about d tuning is the process of
simply<00:01:30.759> lowering<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.630> pitch<00:01:31.869> of<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.200> whole

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
simply lowering the pitch of the whole

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.810 
simply lowering the pitch of the whole
guitar<00:01:32.710> all<00:01:33.220> six<00:01:33.850> strings<00:01:34.119> in<00:01:34.600> equal<00:01:35.320> amounts

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
guitar all six strings in equal amounts

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.930 
guitar all six strings in equal amounts
so<00:01:36.820> if<00:01:37.210> I<00:01:37.479> said<00:01:37.810> guitar<00:01:38.470> tuned<00:01:38.799> to<00:01:39.009> E<00:01:39.039> flat<00:01:39.220> or

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
so if I said guitar tuned to E flat or

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.870 
so if I said guitar tuned to E flat or
standard<00:01:40.630> tuning<00:01:40.869> in<00:01:41.259> a<00:01:41.500> flat<00:01:41.860> or<00:01:42.190> e<00:01:42.580> flat

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
standard tuning in a flat or e flat

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.510 
standard tuning in a flat or e flat
tuning<00:01:43.450> that<00:01:44.229> would<00:01:44.470> mean<00:01:44.680> that<00:01:44.740> in<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.250> E

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
tuning that would mean that in the E

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.510 
tuning that would mean that in the E
string<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.569> low<00:01:46.750> E<00:01:46.780> string<00:01:47.100> instead<00:01:48.100> of<00:01:48.280> being

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
string the low E string instead of being

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.109 
string the low E string instead of being
tuned<00:01:48.909> e<00:01:49.179> it's<00:01:49.509> half<00:01:49.990> step<00:01:50.289> lower<00:01:50.319> e<00:01:50.920> flat<00:01:51.250> and

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
tuned e it's half step lower e flat and

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:59.820 
tuned e it's half step lower e flat and
you<00:01:53.190> can<00:01:54.190> detune<00:01:54.909> to<00:01:55.300> D<00:01:55.569> or<00:01:56.020> E<00:01:56.289> flat<00:01:56.890> or<00:01:57.580> see<00:01:58.830> the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
you can detune to D or E flat or see the

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.270 
you can detune to D or E flat or see the
advantage<00:02:00.340> of<00:02:00.580> D<00:02:00.880> tuning<00:02:01.200> well<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.920> guitar

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
advantage of D tuning well the guitar

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.830 
advantage of D tuning well the guitar
might<00:02:03.520> get<00:02:03.729> a<00:02:03.759> little<00:02:03.970> bit<00:02:04.210> easier<00:02:04.509> to<00:02:04.600> play

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
might get a little bit easier to play

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.630 
might get a little bit easier to play
because<00:02:05.200> there's<00:02:05.710> less<00:02:05.890> tension<00:02:06.250> on<00:02:06.520> the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
because there's less tension on the

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.789 
because there's less tension on the
strings<00:02:07.000> therefore<00:02:07.750> they're<00:02:07.960> easier<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.500> push

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
strings therefore they're easier to push

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.670 
strings therefore they're easier to push
down<00:02:08.830> so<00:02:09.549> you<00:02:09.640> can<00:02:09.910> do<00:02:10.060> farther<00:02:10.479> bends<00:02:11.019> the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
down so you can do farther bends the

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.100 
down so you can do farther bends the
other<00:02:11.890> advantage<00:02:12.130> though<00:02:12.700> is<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.239> deeper

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
other advantage though is a deeper

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.050 
other advantage though is a deeper
meaner<00:02:14.410> sound<00:02:16.530> Stevie<00:02:17.530> Ray<00:02:17.709> Vaughn<00:02:17.920> used<00:02:18.700> a

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
meaner sound Stevie Ray Vaughn used a

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.770 
meaner sound Stevie Ray Vaughn used a
flat<00:02:19.630> quite<00:02:20.170> frequently<00:02:20.680> as<00:02:20.890> UD<00:02:21.610> tune<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:22.570> can

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
flat quite frequently as UD tune you can

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.539 
flat quite frequently as UD tune you can
begin<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.140> add<00:02:23.500> thicker<00:02:23.860> gauge<00:02:24.190> strings

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
begin to add thicker gauge strings

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.729 
begin to add thicker gauge strings
because<00:02:25.030> they're<00:02:25.450> not<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.989> tension<00:02:26.380> is<00:02:26.530> is

because they're not the tension is is

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.599 
because they're not the tension is is
looser<00:02:27.299> however<00:02:28.299> for<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:29.290> caution<00:02:29.829> if<00:02:30.010> UD

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609

unless they say otherwise so take the

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.320 
unless they say otherwise so take the

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.100 
and that contributes to this fuller
sound<00:05:12.580> interesting<00:05:13.580> thing<00:05:13.820> is<00:05:14.030> if<00:05:14.210> drop<00:05:14.510> D<00:05:14.810> is

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
sound interesting thing is if drop D is

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.150 
sound interesting thing is if drop D is
that<00:05:15.410> what's<00:05:15.830> dropsy<00:05:16.490> well<00:05:17.860> that's<00:05:18.860> where<00:05:19.100> you

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
that what's dropsy well that's where you

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.010 
that what's dropsy well that's where you
get<00:05:19.340> into<00:05:19.580> this<00:05:19.700> whole<00:05:19.940> alternate<00:05:20.570> thing<00:05:20.810> and

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
get into this whole alternate thing and

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.900 
get into this whole alternate thing and
they're<00:05:21.110> not<00:05:21.260> real<00:05:21.500> standardized<00:05:22.160> because<00:05:22.670> on

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
they're not real standardized because on

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.280 
they're not real standardized because on
the<00:05:23.060> internet<00:05:23.450> there<00:05:23.690> are<00:05:23.720> definitely<00:05:24.170> people

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
the internet there are definitely people

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.770 
the internet there are definitely people
to<00:05:24.680> feel<00:05:24.890> pretty<00:05:25.160> strongly<00:05:25.580> the<00:05:25.940> dropsy<00:05:26.480> is

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
to feel pretty strongly the dropsy is

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.550 
to feel pretty strongly the dropsy is
simply<00:05:27.770> taking<00:05:28.280> the<00:05:28.970> E<00:05:29.000> string<00:05:29.600> and<00:05:29.900> instead

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
simply taking the E string and instead

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.380 
simply taking the E string and instead
of<00:05:30.680> going<00:05:30.920> to<00:05:31.010> d<00:05:31.160> just<00:05:31.400> go<00:05:31.490> all<00:05:31.700> the<00:05:31.820> way<00:05:31.850> to<00:05:32.030> see

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
of going to d just go all the way to see

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.540 
of going to d just go all the way to see
and<00:05:32.630> just<00:05:32.750> leave<00:05:32.930> it<00:05:33.050> at<00:05:33.140> that<00:05:33.170> just<00:05:33.830> down<00:05:34.010> only

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
and just leave it at that just down only

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.180 
and just leave it at that just down only
the<00:05:34.670> E<00:05:34.700> string<00:05:35.180> drop<00:05:35.540> down<00:05:35.840> to<00:05:36.020> see<00:05:36.230> and<00:05:36.500> the

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
the E string drop down to see and the

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.640 
the E string drop down to see and the
remaining<00:05:37.640> five<00:05:37.850> streets<00:05:38.240> the<00:05:38.360> same<00:05:38.620> but<00:05:39.620> I

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
remaining five streets the same but I

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.710 
remaining five streets the same but I
find<00:05:40.040> a<00:05:40.160> stronger<00:05:40.580> presence<00:05:40.880> of<00:05:41.210> people<00:05:41.570> that

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
find a stronger presence of people that

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.260 
find a stronger presence of people that
seem<00:05:41.930> to<00:05:42.080> think<00:05:42.260> dropsy<00:05:43.010> would<00:05:43.640> be<00:05:43.820> drop<00:05:44.090> D

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
seem to think dropsy would be drop D

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.750 
seem to think dropsy would be drop D
tuning<00:05:44.300> and<00:05:44.810> then<00:05:45.650> the<00:05:45.830> entire<00:05:45.980> guitar

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
tuning and then the entire guitar

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.590 
tuning and then the entire guitar
dropped<00:05:47.660> down<00:05:47.900> one<00:05:48.230> additional<00:05:49.240> fulltone<00:05:50.240> to

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
dropped down one additional fulltone to

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.050 
dropped down one additional fulltone to
see<00:05:50.920> I<00:05:52.300> think<00:05:53.300> that<00:05:53.540> a<00:05:53.570> lot<00:05:53.930> of<00:05:54.140> if<00:05:54.440> you<00:05:54.560> have<00:05:54.740> a

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
see I think that a lot of if you have a

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.060 
see I think that a lot of if you have a
st.<00:05:56.060> anger<00:05:56.240> by<00:05:56.600> Metallica<00:05:57.290> you're<00:05:57.890> going<00:05:58.010> to

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
st. anger by Metallica you're going to

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.730 
st. anger by Metallica you're going to
find<00:05:58.310> that<00:05:58.490> tuning

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
find that tuning

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.100 
find that tuning
I<00:05:59.830> would<00:06:00.490> think<00:06:00.669> that<00:06:00.819> that<00:06:01.150> depth<00:06:01.750> later

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
I would think that that depth later

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.409 
I would think that that depth later
definition<00:06:02.830> of<00:06:02.919> dropsy<00:06:03.430> is<00:06:03.610> probably<00:06:04.270> the

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
definition of dropsy is probably the

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.890 
definition of dropsy is probably the
more<00:06:04.539> popular<00:06:05.110> definition<00:06:06.660> let's<00:06:07.660> go<00:06:07.840> to

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
more popular definition let's go to

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.580 
more popular definition let's go to
double<00:06:08.289> drop<00:06:08.530> D<00:06:08.800> take<00:06:09.310> the<00:06:09.520> four<00:06:09.789> string

here's a double drop D song Doobie
Brothers<00:06:28.350> Blackwater

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.860 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.800 

but<00:07:01.860> what<00:07:02.040> we're<00:07:02.280> going<00:07:02.460> to<00:07:02.550> do<00:07:02.700> is<00:07:02.970> a<00:07:03.030> song<00:07:03.540> in

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:03.810 
but what we're going to do is a song in

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.629 
but what we're going to do is a song in
an<00:07:04.110> open<00:07:04.680> tuning<00:07:06.139> ok<00:07:07.139> now<00:07:07.860> what<00:07:08.040> I've<00:07:08.220> done<00:07:08.400> is

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 
an open tuning ok now what I've done is

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:10.970 
an open tuning ok now what I've done is
I've<00:07:08.790> tuned<00:07:09.090> the<00:07:09.300> ovation<00:07:09.840> here<00:07:10.200> in<00:07:10.320> to<00:07:10.710> open

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:10.980 
I've tuned the ovation here in to open

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.480 
I've tuned the ovation here in to open
sea<00:07:11.669> tuning<00:07:12.330> open<00:07:13.290> tunings<00:07:13.740> are<00:07:13.889> called<00:07:14.130> open

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
sea tuning open tunings are called open

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.060 
sea tuning open tunings are called open
tunings<00:07:14.940> because<00:07:15.389> they're<00:07:16.080> made<00:07:16.350> up<00:07:16.560> of<00:07:16.590> the

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.070 
tunings because they're made up of the

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.050 
tunings because they're made up of the
three<00:07:17.340> main<00:07:17.580> notes<00:07:17.880> that<00:07:18.570> make<00:07:18.750> up<00:07:19.020> a<00:07:19.230> chord

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.060 
three main notes that make up a chord

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.840 
three main notes that make up a chord
almost<00:07:21.169> exclusively<00:07:22.169> a<00:07:22.290> major<00:07:23.160> chord<00:07:23.580> but<00:07:23.730> it

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:23.850 
almost exclusively a major chord but it

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.260 
almost exclusively a major chord but it
could<00:07:24.000> be<00:07:24.120> other<00:07:24.270> chords<00:07:24.660> so<00:07:25.530> C<00:07:25.919> is<00:07:26.160> made<00:07:26.880> up<00:07:27.060> of

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:27.270 
could be other chords so C is made up of

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.070 
could be other chords so C is made up of
a<00:07:27.750> c-note<00:07:28.290> in<00:07:28.500> e<00:07:28.680> note<00:07:28.889> in<00:07:29.040> a<00:07:29.190> genome<00:07:29.550> so<00:07:30.330> my

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 
a c-note in e note in a genome so my

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.700 
a c-note in e note in a genome so my
open<00:07:31.889> strings<00:07:32.280> are<00:07:33.169> consistent<00:07:34.169> consists<00:07:34.620> of

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:34.710 
open strings are consistent consists of

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.260 
open strings are consistent consists of
those<00:07:34.889> three<00:07:35.130> notes<00:07:35.280> now<00:07:35.639> there's<00:07:35.880> only<00:07:36.000> three

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:36.270 
those three notes now there's only three

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.760 
those three notes now there's only three
notes<00:07:36.450> we<00:07:36.630> have<00:07:36.750> six<00:07:36.990> strings<00:07:37.229> to<00:07:37.380> work<00:07:37.560> with

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:37.770 
notes we have six strings to work with

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.129 
notes we have six strings to work with
so<00:07:38.160> some<00:07:38.580> strings<00:07:38.970> will<00:07:39.240> will<00:07:39.570> double<00:07:39.870> up<00:07:39.960> on

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:40.139 
so some strings will will double up on

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:43.490 
so some strings will will double up on
the<00:07:40.260> notes<00:07:40.700> I've<00:07:41.700> dropped<00:07:42.270> my<00:07:42.750> E<00:07:42.780> string<00:07:43.290> down

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:43.500 
the notes I've dropped my E string down

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.650 
the notes I've dropped my E string down
to<00:07:43.710> a<00:07:43.740> C<00:07:44.660> really<00:07:45.660> low<00:07:46.910> the<00:07:47.910> fifth<00:07:48.180> string<00:07:48.450> is

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:48.660 
to a C really low the fifth string is

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.519 
to a C really low the fifth string is
now<00:07:48.840> a<00:07:48.870> G

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:50.529 
now a G

00:07:50.529 --> 00:07:55.769 
now a G
the<00:07:50.889> fourth<00:07:51.189> string<00:07:51.579> is<00:07:51.959> also<00:07:52.959> a<00:07:52.989> see<00:07:54.779> the

00:07:55.769 --> 00:07:55.779 
the fourth string is also a see the

00:07:55.779 --> 00:07:58.589 
the fourth string is also a see the
third<00:07:56.229> string
