on one side of her head I'm going to

I'm going to cross it over now for this

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.090 
I'm going to cross it over now for this
one<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.780> don't<00:01:36.869> necessarily<00:01:37.049> have<00:01:37.709> to<00:01:37.740> use<00:01:38.069> a

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
one you don't necessarily have to use a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.669 
one you don't necessarily have to use a
bungee<00:01:38.399> I<00:01:38.780> like<00:01:39.780> using<00:01:40.049> them<00:01:40.319> because<00:01:40.439> it

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
bungee I like using them because it

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.980 
bungee I like using them because it
gives<00:01:40.709> me<00:01:40.859> more<00:01:40.950> control<00:01:41.450> but<00:01:42.450> because<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:42.899> a

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
gives me more control but because it's a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.410 
gives me more control but because it's a
messy<00:01:43.289> ponytail<00:01:43.909> doesn't<00:01:44.909> have<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.149> be<00:01:45.240> super

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
messy ponytail doesn't have to be super

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.949 
messy ponytail doesn't have to be super
polished<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.200> okay<00:01:47.509> so<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.599> have<00:01:48.810> two

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
polished it's okay so you have two

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.050 
polished it's okay so you have two
options<00:01:48.990> with<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.709> you<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.579> tease<00:01:50.849> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
options with this you can tease the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.690 
options with this you can tease the
bottom<00:01:51.590> giving<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.740> little<00:01:52.920> bit<00:01:53.099> more<00:01:53.159> undone

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
bottom giving a little bit more undone

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.399 
bottom giving a little bit more undone
look<00:01:55.340> you<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.520> call<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.849> quits<00:01:57.060> there<00:01:57.450> or<00:01:57.810> you

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
look you can call it quits there or you

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.580 
look you can call it quits there or you
