00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.910
 Hong Kong 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.329
 one goal 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:10.749
 uu 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:11.979
 one 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:14.129
 according 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.410
 4 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:23.029
 in the afternoon 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.369
 I can think how you're confused 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.210
 for the first time venezuela entity 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.569
 Not by chance 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:33.569
 next danced first let's see what people think 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.820
 adapt to life 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.070
 place between them 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.320
 the bird species 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.320
 an example the chameleon 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.760
 if you were reiterated that not many people know what adaptation is 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.760
 do not worry is that those years in the polytechnic 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.010
 but to know the ones that came out of the sling that does know 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:18.999
 3rd 4th 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:22.879
 14 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.879
 the training will be exceeded bursts 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.850
 adaptation is a capacity that all living beings have 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.049
 to better perform the situation the ecosystems 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.329
 the term pesos does 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.829
 in darwin's natural selection theory in which the actress and better 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:47.989
 adapted 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.989
 Syria more opportunities to survive than others that do not 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.889
 the adaptation 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.410
 is the capacity that has 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.260
 living beings 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.619
 to decide what zarrías 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:04.149
 if they throw you out but to make it clearer, let's see in the big book 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:14.889
 to press that process of changes of living systems 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:18.879
 that is operated as a result of population genetic processes 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:23.569
 and that the interaction of organisms with the environment can result 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.769
 favorable background 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.069
 those changes that favor survival are fixed and inherited 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:32.319
 populations 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.299
 either as functional structural features can 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.469
 behavior 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.969
 quick a clear example in the shape of the beaks of the birds 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:45.479
 for example it would be 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:49.519
 the rich that his typical pekín and I believe that it helps him with sevilla 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:52.529
 delgadillo haro 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:54.559
 the idea on the ground 

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:57.239
 poncela her the idea is to win 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.929
 the flesh of their prey 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:01.929
 very well said 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.159
 dv 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.109
 the evolutionary process 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.549
 some physiological versions can be given 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.339
 to allow for example bayo resistance to certain conditions 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:27.559
 environmental 

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.869
 an example could be the usurbil and villabona the start of it 

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:34.469
 species their different ways adapt have made them unique 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:35.710
 luis alberto lacalle 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.690
 we play survival that hinder their role is more dense 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.640
 to withstand the three polar winters 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.409
 all the animals in the genetic base 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:49.489
 but environmental conditions also influence the possibilities of 

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:52.110
 learning 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.449
 for example the way to get them because caring for the offspring are 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.410
 sedated behaviors in atlas 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.410
 selected throughout evolution because they favor the 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.009
 survival of the species them the right 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.949
 chili thanks 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.949
 every time I come, I hope our friends 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:13.889
 yes during peak hours 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:41.879
 valmor 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:45.110
 they will come
