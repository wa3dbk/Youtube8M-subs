breaks<00:01:26.070> there<00:01:26.610> was<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> lot<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.000> bikes<00:01:27.420> around

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
breaks there was a lot of bikes around

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.420 
breaks there was a lot of bikes around
but<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.530> mean<00:01:28.799> that's<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.100> way<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.280> was

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
but the I mean that's the way it was

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.950 
but the I mean that's the way it was
around<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.820> whole<00:01:29.970> track<00:01:30.240> there<00:01:30.450> was<00:01:30.540> no<00:01:30.720> real

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
around the whole track there was no real

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.499 
around the whole track there was no real
clear<00:01:31.290> track<00:01:31.619> anywhere<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.759> think<00:01:33.299> he<00:01:33.360> did

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
clear track anywhere so I think he did

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.330 
clear track anywhere so I think he did
the<00:01:33.630> best<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.140> made<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> best<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.100> what<00:01:35.280> he

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
the best that made the best of what he

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.399 
the best that made the best of what he
could<00:01:35.549> with<00:01:35.759> what<00:01:35.970> he<00:01:36.030> had<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.810> think<00:01:37.140> he'll

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
could with what he had so I think he'll

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.109 
could with what he had so I think he'll
be<00:01:37.439> alright

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
be alright

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.430 
be alright
obviously<00:01:39.119> not<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.420> talk<00:01:39.630> time<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.200> last

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
obviously not the talk time like last

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.920 
obviously not the talk time like last
year<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.940> what<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:44.520> next<00:01:44.789> thing

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.930 
but what we got I think is good enough
to<00:03:33.730> get<00:03:33.849> in<00:03:34.030> so<00:03:34.769> you<00:03:35.769> know<00:03:35.920> we'll<00:03:36.519> just<00:03:36.549> have<00:03:36.790> to

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
to get in so you know we'll just have to

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.910 
to get in so you know we'll just have to
put<00:03:37.180> it<00:03:37.269> together<00:03:37.390> in<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.750> Moto<00:03:37.959> so<00:03:38.410> if<00:03:38.500> we<00:03:38.650> can

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
put it together in the Moto so if we can

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.339 
put it together in the Moto so if we can
do<00:03:39.069> that<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:39.640> we'll<00:03:40.420> see<00:03:40.599> what<00:03:40.720> happens<00:03:41.140> just

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349
