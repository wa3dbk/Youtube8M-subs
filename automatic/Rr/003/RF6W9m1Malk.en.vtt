sick Triceratops hi this is Shannon Shea

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.140 
sick Triceratops hi this is Shannon Shea
I<00:00:17.260> was<00:00:17.740> fortunate<00:00:18.040> enough<00:00:18.460> to<00:00:18.640> be<00:00:18.730> part<00:00:19.000> of

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
I was fortunate enough to be part of

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.390 
I was fortunate enough to be part of
Stan<00:00:19.420> Winston's<00:00:19.990> Triceratops<00:00:20.770> crew<00:00:21.040> for<00:00:21.310> the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
Stan Winston's Triceratops crew for the

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:30.310 
Stan Winston's Triceratops crew for the
first<00:00:21.730> Jurassic<00:00:22.510> Park<00:00:22.810> movie

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.869 

Here<00:00:31.130> I<00:00:31.160> am<00:00:32.419> many<00:00:32.809> years<00:00:33.020> ago<00:00:33.879> demonstrating

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
Here I am many years ago demonstrating

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.200 
Here I am many years ago demonstrating
the<00:00:35.000> breathing<00:00:35.360> mechanism<00:00:35.510> on<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:37.210> small

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
the breathing mechanism on the small

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.180 
the breathing mechanism on the small
scale<00:00:38.480> model<00:00:38.930> we<00:00:39.230> built<00:00:39.559> a<00:00:39.680> small<00:00:39.800> scale

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
scale model we built a small scale

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.310 
scale model we built a small scale
version<00:00:40.610> of<00:00:40.699> the<00:00:40.910> character<00:00:41.570> before<00:00:41.780> the<00:00:42.140> full

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
version of the character before the full

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.680 
version of the character before the full
scale<00:00:42.649> so<00:00:43.190> I<00:00:43.219> could<00:00:43.399> show<00:00:43.640> Stan<00:00:44.390> how

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
scale so I could show Stan how

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.150 
scale so I could show Stan how
everything<00:00:45.170> was<00:00:45.320> going<00:00:45.559> to<00:00:45.589> work<00:00:45.680> and

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
everything was going to work and

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.389 
everything was going to work and
basically<00:00:47.089> built<00:00:48.019> a<00:00:48.290> bigger<00:00:48.649> scale<00:00:48.949> version

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
basically built a bigger scale version

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.180 
basically built a bigger scale version
of<00:00:49.430> everything<00:00:50.390> of<00:00:51.170> all<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:51.470> mechanisms<00:00:52.040> and

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
of everything of all the mechanisms and

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.759 
of everything of all the mechanisms and
controllers<00:00:52.790> when<00:00:53.479> we<00:00:53.600> went<00:00:54.050> to<00:00:54.320> the

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
controllers when we went to the

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.619 
controllers when we went to the
full-scale<00:00:55.190> version<00:00:55.239> that<00:00:56.239> breathing

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
full-scale version that breathing

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.930 
full-scale version that breathing
mechanism<00:00:57.140> was<00:00:57.320> basically<00:00:57.769> just<00:00:58.129> a<00:00:58.220> post

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
mechanism was basically just a post

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.750 
mechanism was basically just a post
underneath<00:00:59.780> that<00:01:00.440> just<00:01:00.680> pushed<00:01:00.949> a<00:01:01.280> lever

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
underneath that just pushed a lever

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.060 
underneath that just pushed a lever
pushed<00:01:02.149> it<00:01:02.299> up<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:02.600> down<00:01:02.689> and<00:01:02.930> moved<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:03.439> skin

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
pushed it up and down and moved the skin

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.609 
pushed it up and down and moved the skin
up<00:01:04.220> and<00:01:04.309> down<00:01:04.750> there<00:01:05.750> I<00:01:05.780> am<00:01:05.900> demonstrating<00:01:06.140> the

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
up and down there I am demonstrating the

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.550 
up and down there I am demonstrating the
tail<00:01:06.830> mechanism<00:01:07.490> which<00:01:08.240> was<00:01:08.509> had<00:01:09.290> movement

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
tail mechanism which was had movement

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.420 
tail mechanism which was had movement
from<00:01:09.890> side<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:10.220> side<00:01:10.369> and<00:01:10.939> also<00:01:12.009> up<00:01:13.009> and<00:01:13.280> down

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
from side to side and also up and down

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.450 
from side to side and also up and down
as<00:01:13.670> well<00:01:14.500> there<00:01:15.500> were<00:01:15.619> no<00:01:15.650> hydraulics<00:01:16.310> and

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
as well there were no hydraulics and

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.330 
as well there were no hydraulics and
this<00:01:16.610> character<00:01:17.030> was<00:01:17.240> all<00:01:17.450> just<00:01:18.340> mechanical

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
this character was all just mechanical

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.039 
this character was all just mechanical
you<00:01:19.549> know<00:01:19.640> a<00:01:19.670> lot<00:01:19.790> of<00:01:19.820> cables<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.360> pulleys<00:01:20.570> and

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
you know a lot of cables and pulleys and

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.990 
you know a lot of cables and pulleys and
the<00:01:21.530> tail<00:01:21.770> was<00:01:21.950> like<00:01:22.130> a<00:01:22.159> direct<00:01:22.579> linkage

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
the tail was like a direct linkage

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
the tail was like a direct linkage
mechanism

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.899 

Joey<00:01:27.020> Orosco<00:01:27.560> is<00:01:27.710> here<00:01:27.890> painting<00:01:28.189> the

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
Joey Orosco is here painting the

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.789 
Joey Orosco is here painting the
Triceratops<00:01:29.570> he<00:01:29.720> started<00:01:30.079> the<00:01:30.140> paint<00:01:30.350> job<00:01:30.560> in

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
Triceratops he started the paint job in

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.340 
Triceratops he started the paint job in
Los<00:01:31.009> Angeles<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:31.759> you<00:01:32.450> can<00:01:32.600> see<00:01:32.750> how<00:01:32.899> detailed

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
Los Angeles and you can see how detailed

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.740 
Los Angeles and you can see how detailed
and<00:01:33.740> beautiful<00:01:33.770> a<00:01:34.430> job<00:01:35.030> he<00:01:35.240> did<00:01:35.450> but

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
and beautiful a job he did but

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.560 
and beautiful a job he did but
unfortunately<00:01:36.500> things<00:01:37.220> were<00:01:37.430> so<00:01:37.670> so<00:01:38.240> tight

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
unfortunately things were so so tight

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.960 
unfortunately things were so so tight
that<00:01:38.870> we<00:01:39.170> had<00:01:39.380> to<00:01:39.700> ship<00:01:40.700> it<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:41.080> Hawaii<00:01:42.080> and

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
that we had to ship it to Hawaii and

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.420 
that we had to ship it to Hawaii and
Joey<00:01:43.970> actually<00:01:44.450> finished<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.020> paint<00:01:45.260> on<00:01:45.710> set

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
Joey actually finished the paint on set

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.039 
Joey actually finished the paint on set
here<00:01:46.940> he<00:01:47.030> is<00:01:47.120> working<00:01:47.360> on<00:01:47.600> this<00:01:47.780> very

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
here he is working on this very

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.870 
here he is working on this very
intricate<00:01:48.350> paint<00:01:48.590> job<00:01:48.830> so<00:01:49.430> this<00:01:49.580> is<00:01:49.700> when

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
intricate paint job so this is when

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.090 
intricate paint job so this is when
Steven<00:01:50.390> came<00:01:50.540> by<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:50.720> shop<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.530> this<00:01:51.860> is<00:01:51.979> us

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
Steven came by the shop and this is us

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.120 
Steven came by the shop and this is us
demonstrating<00:01:52.670> again<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.420> concept<00:01:54.260> of<00:01:54.530> how<00:01:55.070> we

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
demonstrating again a concept of how we

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.219 
demonstrating again a concept of how we
were<00:01:55.400> going<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.640> puppeteer<00:01:56.060> it<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:57.020> got

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
were going to puppeteer it and it got

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.350 
were going to puppeteer it and it got
loaded<00:01:57.500> into<00:01:57.920> as<00:01:58.159> you<00:01:58.490> can<00:01:58.790> see<00:01:58.940> it<00:01:59.060> wasn't

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
loaded into as you can see it wasn't

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.510 
loaded into as you can see it wasn't
finished<00:01:59.540> all<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.320> legs<00:02:00.500> were<00:02:00.680> apart<00:02:00.710> because

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
finished all the legs were apart because

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.690 
finished all the legs were apart because
we<00:02:02.119> could<00:02:02.659> only<00:02:02.690> ship<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.830> certain<00:02:04.369> container

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
we could only ship a certain container

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.580 
we could only ship a certain container
to<00:02:05.030> Hawaii<00:02:05.420> so<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:05.810> legs<00:02:05.990> had<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.170> be<00:02:06.229> put<00:02:06.470> on

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
to Hawaii so the legs had to be put on

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.660 
to Hawaii so the legs had to be put on
in<00:02:06.830> Hawaii<00:02:07.030> we<00:02:08.030> had<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.420> be<00:02:08.720> ready<00:02:09.489> with<00:02:10.489> the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
in Hawaii we had to be ready with the

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.460 
in Hawaii we had to be ready with the
character<00:02:11.629> because<00:02:11.870> it<00:02:11.989> was<00:02:12.080> going<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.290> take

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
character because it was going to take

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.050 
character because it was going to take
like<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.680> month<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.280> ship<00:02:13.459> it<00:02:13.610> there<00:02:13.790> on<00:02:13.909> the

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
like a month to ship it there on the

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
container they on the boat so we had to

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.280 
container they on the boat so we had to
have<00:02:16.549> it<00:02:16.819> ready<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.120> month<00:02:17.480> before<00:02:17.870> they<00:02:18.019> wanted

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.380 
have it ready a month before they wanted
to<00:02:18.379> shoot<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:19.159> give<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.489> time<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:19.909> then

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
to shoot it to give it time and then

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.780 
to shoot it to give it time and then
this<00:02:20.930> is<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.379> big<00:02:21.920> hole<00:02:22.159> they<00:02:22.340> dug<00:02:22.519> in<00:02:22.700> the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
this is a big hole they dug in the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.940 
this is a big hole they dug in the
ground<00:02:22.819> with<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.239> platform<00:02:23.810> over<00:02:24.049> the<00:02:24.170> top<00:02:24.409> so

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
ground with a platform over the top so

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.170 
ground with a platform over the top so
that<00:02:24.980> all<00:02:25.189> the<00:02:25.280> puppeteers<00:02:25.790> could<00:02:26.060> be

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
that all the puppeteers could be

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.410 
that all the puppeteers could be
underneath<00:02:26.480> there<00:02:27.290> were<00:02:27.640> one<00:02:28.640> or<00:02:28.670> two<00:02:28.790> inside

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
underneath there were one or two inside

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.649 
underneath there were one or two inside
the<00:02:30.319> character<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:31.069> then<00:02:31.549> the<00:02:32.209> only<00:02:32.330> one<00:02:32.510> that

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:32.659 
the character and then the only one that

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.160 
the character and then the only one that
was<00:02:32.780> outside<00:02:32.959> was<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.920> guy<00:02:34.280> doing<00:02:34.939> the<00:02:35.239> eyes

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
was outside was the guy doing the eyes

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.649 
was outside was the guy doing the eyes
with<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.220> remote<00:02:37.489> control<00:02:37.519> with<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.359> radio

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
with the remote control with the radio

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.099 
with the remote control with the radio
everyone<00:02:39.409> else<00:02:39.620> all<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.219> cables<00:02:40.639> and<00:02:40.819> all<00:02:40.939> the

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
everyone else all the cables and all the

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.539 
everyone else all the cables and all the
controllers<00:02:42.109> were<00:02:42.230> down<00:02:42.560> underneath<00:02:43.279> that

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
controllers were down underneath that

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:44.110 
controllers were down underneath that
platform

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
platform

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.259 
platform
and<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:45.140> think<00:02:45.319> there<00:02:45.620> was<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:46.099> one<00:02:46.340> guy<00:02:46.580> was

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
and I think there was the one guy was

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.030 
and I think there was the one guy was
inside<00:02:47.660> that<00:02:47.989> was<00:02:48.110> working<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.560> tail<00:02:48.800> and

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
inside that was working the tail and

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.290 
inside that was working the tail and
then<00:02:49.959> everyone<00:02:50.959> else<00:02:51.140> was<00:02:51.680> underground

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
then everyone else was underground

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.940 
then everyone else was underground
working<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.390> breathing<00:02:53.720> mechanism<00:02:53.950> working

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
working the breathing mechanism working

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.670 
working the breathing mechanism working
the<00:02:55.280> mouth<00:02:55.489> and<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.030> tongue<00:02:56.239> working<00:02:57.170> the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.369 

forearms<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:01.160> legs

forearms and the legs

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.960

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
movements first one at a time so he

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.970 
movements first one at a time so he
could<00:03:56.209> look<00:03:56.359> at<00:03:56.569> each<00:03:56.810> one<00:03:57.049> one<00:03:57.319> at<00:03:57.350> a<00:03:57.500> time<00:03:57.709> and
