I<00:00:37.860> understand<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.670> Squaresoft<00:00:39.120> want<00:00:39.329> to

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
I understand that Squaresoft want to

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.580

make<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> most<00:00:39.809> out<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.020> what<00:00:40.110> they<00:00:40.260> had<00:00:40.440> and

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
make the most out of what they had and

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.869 
make the most out of what they had and
to<00:00:40.680> show<00:00:40.860> off<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.040> best<00:00:41.070> overall<00:00:41.610> appearance

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
to show off the best overall appearance

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.020 
to show off the best overall appearance
but<00:00:42.239> going<00:00:42.540> from<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.190> really

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
but going from this to this is really

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.479 
but going from this to this is really
jarring<00:00:45.329> for<00:00:45.480> me<00:00:45.719> Limit<00:00:46.379> Breaks<00:00:46.649> are<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.950> great

game<00:00:47.789> mechanic<00:00:48.360> but<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> thing<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.050> totally

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
game mechanic but the thing that totally

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.680 
game mechanic but the thing that totally
ruins<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.039> experience<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.030> super<00:00:51.449> long

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690
