00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
say you know this is this is going to

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.209 
say you know this is this is going to
change<00:00:08.130> everything<00:00:09.050> well<00:00:10.050> one<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.559> dreams

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
change everything well one of the dreams

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.320 
change everything well one of the dreams
has<00:00:11.969> always<00:00:12.269> been<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.900> have<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.080> computer<00:00:13.830> that

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
has always been to have a computer that

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.660 
has always been to have a computer that
understood<00:00:15.330> what<00:00:15.570> was<00:00:15.660> going<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:17.460> key

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
understood what was going on and a key

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.990 
understood what was going on and a key
part<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.390> vision<00:00:19.730> microsoft<00:00:20.730> made<00:00:20.970> a

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
part of that is vision microsoft made a

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000 
part of that is vision microsoft made a
breakthrough<00:00:21.300> about<00:00:22.260> three<00:00:22.529> years<00:00:22.590> ago<00:00:22.740> and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
breakthrough about three years ago and

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.040 
breakthrough about three years ago and
something<00:00:23.369> called<00:00:23.519> deep<00:00:23.760> learning<00:00:24.050> that's

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
something called deep learning that's

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.810 
something called deep learning that's
being<00:00:25.320> applied<00:00:25.470> by<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:26.039> lot<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.580> tech<00:00:26.789> companies

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
being applied by a lot of tech companies

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.230 
being applied by a lot of tech companies
now<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.990> vision<00:00:28.470> software<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.039> improved<00:00:29.519> very

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
now so vision software is improved very

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.139 
now so vision software is improved very
dramatically<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.800> ability<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:33.059> know

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
dramatically so the ability of you know

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.440 
dramatically so the ability of you know
say<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.770> device<00:00:34.770> that's<00:00:34.800> picking<00:00:35.640> fruit<00:00:36.059> or

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
say a device that's picking fruit or

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.380 
say a device that's picking fruit or
something<00:00:36.750> that's<00:00:37.020> trying<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.380> figure<00:00:37.680> out

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
something that's trying to figure out

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.360 
something that's trying to figure out
who<00:00:39.390> somebody<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.200> or<00:00:40.440> looking<00:00:40.800> at<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.040> field

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
who somebody is or looking at a field

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.729 
who somebody is or looking at a field
either<00:00:41.879> from<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.300> satellite<00:00:42.540> or<00:00:43.050> down<00:00:43.260> locally

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
either from a satellite or down locally

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.470 
either from a satellite or down locally
and<00:00:43.860> see<00:00:44.070> what<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> disease<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.789> see<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and see what the disease is see what the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.100 
and see what the disease is see what the
productivity<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.430> getting<00:00:47.430> vision<00:00:48.000> into<00:00:48.930> this

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
productivity is getting vision into this

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.450 
productivity is getting vision into this
cloud-based<00:00:49.890> data<00:00:50.700> rich<00:00:51.300> world<00:00:52.010> is<00:00:53.010> going<00:00:53.340> to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
cloud-based data rich world is going to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.990 
cloud-based data rich world is going to
enable<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.149> lot<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.510> new<00:00:54.629> applications<00:00:55.340> and<00:00:56.340> so

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
enable a lot of new applications and so

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.830 
enable a lot of new applications and so
you<00:00:57.899> know<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.079> see<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.680> acceleration<00:00:59.840> and

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
you know I see this acceleration and

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.039 
you know I see this acceleration and
that's<00:01:01.079> pretty<00:01:01.289> exciting<00:01:02.180> sensors<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.960> know

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
that's pretty exciting sensors you know

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.870 
that's pretty exciting sensors you know
are<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.830> find<00:01:05.159> their<00:01:05.309> way<00:01:05.430> into<00:01:05.610> health

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
are going to find their way into health

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.899 
are going to find their way into health
and<00:01:06.090> agriculture<00:01:06.510> which<00:01:06.869> are<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.909> foundation

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
and agriculture which are the foundation

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.060 
and agriculture which are the foundation
issues<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.510> use<00:01:09.840> talking<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.320> see<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.770> trend

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
issues I use talking to see a trend

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.440 
issues I use talking to see a trend
which<00:01:11.310> some<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.820> seemed<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.330> know

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
which some of it seemed that you know

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.539 
which some of it seemed that you know
tablets<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.439> laptops<00:01:13.680> are<00:01:14.189> going<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.400> start

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
tablets and laptops are going to start

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.490 
tablets and laptops are going to start
merging<00:01:14.850> together<00:01:15.180> form<00:01:15.780> factors<00:01:16.259> are<00:01:16.380> going

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
merging together form factors are going

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.109 
merging together form factors are going
to<00:01:16.590> change<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.520> see<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> lot<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:17.939> that

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
to change and you see a lot of that

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.789 
to change and you see a lot of that
happening<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.509> next<00:01:18.630> year<00:01:18.900> some<00:01:19.170> exciting

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
boundaries between devices has always

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.660 
boundaries between devices has always
been<00:01:26.509> fluid<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.990> know<00:01:28.140> how<00:01:29.009> big<00:01:29.369> does<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
been fluid you know how big does the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.340 
been fluid you know how big does the
screen<00:01:29.939> have<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.360> be<00:01:30.509> before<00:01:30.720> it's<00:01:31.110> not<00:01:31.320> a

screen have to be before it's not a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.490 
screen have to be before it's not a
phone<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.009> tablet<00:01:32.549> if<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.500> thing

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
phone it's a tablet if you have a thing

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.590 
phone it's a tablet if you have a thing
where<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.890> detach<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.430> keyboard<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.119> that

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
where you can detach a keyboard is that

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.440 
where you can detach a keyboard is that
a<00:01:36.630> tablet<00:01:37.259> or<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.680> PC<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.759> users<00:01:39.180> don't

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
a tablet or is that a PC and users don't

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.330 
a tablet or is that a PC and users don't
want<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.780> carry<00:01:39.990> too<00:01:40.170> many<00:01:40.320> things<00:01:40.530> around<00:01:40.890> and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
want to carry too many things around and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.030 
want to carry too many things around and
set<00:01:41.579> them<00:01:41.759> up<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.180> buy<00:01:42.329> them<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.380> we<00:01:43.890> have

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
set them up and buy them and so we have

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.639 
set them up and buy them and so we have
really<00:01:44.759> great<00:01:45.000> pc<00:01:45.780> things<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.290> are<00:01:46.380> moving

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
really great pc things that are moving

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.139 
really great pc things that are moving
into<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.009> tablet<00:01:47.430> space<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.880> then<00:01:47.939> some

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
into the tablet space and then some

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.789 
into the tablet space and then some
people<00:01:48.240> adding<00:01:48.720> stuff<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> tablet<00:01:49.680> so

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
people adding stuff on the tablet so

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.060 
people adding stuff on the tablet so
that's<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.070> pretty<00:01:51.259> flexible<00:01:52.259> boundary<00:01:52.890> I

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
that's a pretty flexible boundary I

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.859 
that's a pretty flexible boundary I
think<00:01:53.700> one<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.939> biggest<00:01:54.119> things<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.659> going

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
think one of the biggest things is going

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.630 
think one of the biggest things is going
to<00:01:54.960> be<00:01:55.079> applications<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.070> are<00:01:56.100> running<00:01:56.189> on

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
to be applications that are running on

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.450 
to be applications that are running on
multiple<00:01:57.450> devices<00:01:57.590> so<00:01:58.590> when<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.740> walk<00:01:59.040> into<00:01:59.250> my

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
multiple devices so when I walk into my

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.130 
multiple devices so when I walk into my
office<00:01:59.490> and<00:02:00.090> there's<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.329> big<00:02:00.570> screen<00:02:00.840> on<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
office and there's a big screen on the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.260 
office and there's a big screen on the
wall<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.979> know<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.130> can<00:02:02.250> take<00:02:02.399> an<00:02:02.549> application

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
wall you know I can take an application

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.149 
wall you know I can take an application
and<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.960> kind<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.409> flick<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:04.950> running

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
and just kind of flick and it's running

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.969 
and just kind of flick and it's running
up<00:02:05.399> there<00:02:05.640> it's<00:02:05.850> touch<00:02:06.329> its<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:07.500> can<00:02:07.740> see<00:02:07.950> a

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
up there it's touch its you can see a

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.029 
up there it's touch its you can see a
lot<00:02:08.220> more<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.910> even<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.929> still<00:02:10.200> use<00:02:10.800> my

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
lot more and even I can still use my

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.490 
lot more and even I can still use my

a little bit with your TV at home where

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.870 
a little bit with your TV at home where
you're<00:02:15.510> interacting<00:02:15.870> on<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> touch<00:02:17.340> maybe<00:02:17.790> a

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
you're interacting on a touch maybe a

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.510 
you're interacting on a touch maybe a
phone<00:02:18.150> or<00:02:18.750> tablet<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:20.070> screen<00:02:20.340> there

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
phone or tablet and the the screen there

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.010 
phone or tablet and the the screen there
so<00:02:21.000> with<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.300> cloud<00:02:21.600> now<00:02:22.160> multi-device

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
so with the cloud now multi-device

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.780 
so with the cloud now multi-device
applications<00:02:25.020> will<00:02:25.230> become<00:02:25.560> far<00:02:26.100> more<00:02:26.130> common

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
applications will become far more common

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.120 
applications will become far more common
and<00:02:26.880> building<00:02:27.240> up<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.900> software<00:02:28.140> tools<00:02:28.680> and

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
and building up the software tools and

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.310 
and building up the software tools and
platform<00:02:29.580> for<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:30.020> Microsoft<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.230> others

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
platform for that Microsoft and others

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.350 
platform for that Microsoft and others
are<00:02:31.560> investing<00:02:32.370> heavily<00:02:32.580> in<00:02:32.820> making<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.330> a

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
are investing heavily in making that a

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.240 
are investing heavily in making that a
reality<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.740> think<00:02:34.830> we're<00:02:34.980> going<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.160> hit

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
reality so I think we're going to hit

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.209 
reality so I think we're going to hit
fig<00:02:35.430> exciting<00:02:35.820> times<00:02:36.060> ahead
