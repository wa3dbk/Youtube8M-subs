well<00:01:12.560> whatever<00:01:13.159> the<00:01:13.340> case<00:01:13.369> may<00:01:13.670> be<00:01:13.700> is

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
well whatever the case may be is

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.109 
well whatever the case may be is
happening<00:01:14.390> now<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:15.430> my<00:01:16.430> feelings<00:01:16.939> on<00:01:17.030> the

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
fight haven't changed I think he Fuhrman

beats<00:01:18.950> rubber<00:01:19.189> Guerrero<00:01:19.520> I<00:01:19.820> think<00:01:20.210> he<00:01:20.270> beats

beats rubber Guerrero I think he beats

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.630 
beats rubber Guerrero I think he beats
him<00:01:20.659> convincingly<00:01:21.229> and<00:01:21.530> he<00:01:21.950> might<00:01:22.130> even<00:01:22.280> stop

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
him convincingly and he might even stop

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.170 
him convincingly and he might even stop
him<00:01:22.820> because<00:01:23.689> Robert<00:01:24.469> Guerrero<00:01:24.590> is<00:01:25.159> not<00:01:26.149> a
