00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.670
 Y 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.580
 fumÃ© de prawns 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:27.040
 the ingredients are water oil 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.200
 brandy and olive prawns first 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.620
 we give heads to shrimp and 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.620
 we peel 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.850
 ah 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.720
 we heat oil in a pot 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.780
 we put the skins and 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.370
 heads with a spatula crush the 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.640
 heads of prawns 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:07.220
 we cook for 5 minutes 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.220
 we add the brandy and continue cooking 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.909
 then pour the water and 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.219
 We heat up to a boil 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.950
 when it breaks to boil, we cook for 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:23.350
 15 minutes 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.550
 during cooking we are removing the 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.800
 foam that forms on the surface 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.570
 after 15 minutes we put the 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.600
 content of the pot in the glass of the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.600
 mixer 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.250
 we crush lightly 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.590
 put back in the pot and cook 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.590
 5 more minutes 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.719
 we remove from the fire and we pass our 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.719
 broth through a colander 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.770
 Y 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.440
 so that it is even finer we can 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.710
 make it pass through a filter 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.710
 coffee 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.770
 one 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.620
 Y 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.680
 once filtered we have ready 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.630
 our smoked or shrimp broth can 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.000
 use it immediately as a fund to 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.700
 other dishes store it in the fridge or 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.530
 freeze it we hope that this recipe will 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.330
