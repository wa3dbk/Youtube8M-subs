is basically like a bullet in case they

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.490 
is basically like a bullet in case they
get<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.210> consult<00:01:36.570> or<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.900> can<00:01:37.020> find<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.380> or

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
get a consult or you can find one or

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.200 
get a consult or you can find one or
something<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:38.040> desire<00:01:38.400> your<00:01:38.640> hold<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.970> cup

something you can desire your hold a cup

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.749 
something you can desire your hold a cup
eventually<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:40.310> get<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> chain<00:01:41.610> of

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
eventually and just get the chain of

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.789 
eventually and just get the chain of
vapor<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.240> then<00:01:42.750> we'll<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.079> play<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.290> sulfur

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
vapor and then we'll just play a sulfur

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.730 
vapor and then we'll just play a sulfur
vent<00:01:44.009> still<00:01:44.970> then<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.240> our<00:01:45.360> next<00:01:45.659> turn<00:01:45.869> draw

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
vent still then on our next turn draw

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.690 
vent still then on our next turn draw
this<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.970> dress<00:01:48.540> them<00:01:48.840> now<00:01:49.130> take<00:01:50.130> take

resistance yeah yeah I like the
counterspell<00:01:56.369> maybe<00:01:56.759> like<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.939> nice<00:01:57.270> concept

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
counterspell maybe like a nice concept

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.840

and also I guess if you flip up us into

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.940 
and also I guess if you flip up us into
the<00:02:15.150> past<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.480> minds<00:02:15.690> desire<00:02:16.019> you<00:02:16.560> can<00:02:16.709> use<00:02:16.830> it

and even though we hit a bunch of lands

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.709 
and even though we hit a bunch of lands
we<00:03:40.269> just<00:03:40.450> go<00:03:40.629> this<00:03:41.439> like<00:03:42.129> chromatic<00:03:42.730> star<00:03:43.030> in

against this deck and angels grace is

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.450 
against this deck and angels grace is
also<00:04:22.630> pretty<00:04:22.840> good<00:04:23.110> but<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:23.830> then<00:04:23.949> with<00:04:24.130> empty

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
also pretty good but and then with empty

also pretty good but and then with empty
the<00:04:24.580> Warrens<00:04:24.849> plan<00:04:25.090> you<00:04:25.180> can<00:04:25.330> just<00:04:25.479> end<00:04:25.630> with<00:04:25.690> a

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840

to that's going to give it you know a

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.460 
to that's going to give it you know a
little<00:04:36.759> bit<00:04:36.880> of<00:04:37.000> trouble<00:04:37.240> this<00:04:37.810> we<00:04:38.050> basically

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
little bit of trouble this we basically

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.110 
little bit of trouble this we basically
designed<00:04:38.800> this<00:04:39.009> to<00:04:39.280> beat<00:04:39.490> because<00:04:39.910> we

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
designed this to beat because we

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.879 
designed this to beat because we
expected<00:04:40.720> a<00:04:40.750> lot<00:04:40.900> of<00:04:41.020> Boros<00:04:41.349> and<00:04:41.590> be<00:04:41.680> down
