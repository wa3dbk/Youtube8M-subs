00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
UK time there are three balls down so

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.359 
UK time there are three balls down so
that's<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.899> legal<00:01:04.110> break<00:01:04.530> even<00:01:04.890> though<00:01:05.010> nothing

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
that's a legal break even though nothing

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:13.160 
that's a legal break even though nothing
went<00:01:05.549> past<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.970> head<00:01:06.180> string

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.890 

see<00:01:13.890> if<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.189> three<00:01:14.490> ball<00:01:14.670> even<00:01:14.970> broke<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
see if that three ball even broke the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.350 
see if that three ball even broke the
head<00:01:16.110> string<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.830> would<00:01:17.189> be<00:01:17.369> legal<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:18.000> just

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
head string it would be legal it just

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.390 
head string it would be legal it just
has<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.570> touch<00:01:18.960> go<00:01:19.320> across<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.890> head<00:01:20.070> string

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
has to touch go across the head string

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.910 
has to touch go across the head string
just<00:01:20.610> part<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.000> ball<00:01:21.350> well<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.530> base<00:01:22.710> of

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
just part of the ball well the base of

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.499 
just part of the ball well the base of
the<00:01:22.979> ball<00:01:23.159> was<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.580> go<00:01:23.700> across<00:01:23.880> no<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.390> think

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the ball was to go across no I think

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.179 
the ball was to go across no I think
it's<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.110> way<00:01:25.290> they<00:01:25.500> made<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> rule<00:01:25.979> this

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
it's the way they made the rule this

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.700 
it's the way they made the rule this
year<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.460> think<00:01:26.549> they<00:01:26.880> said<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.149> if<00:01:27.659> any<00:01:28.380> part

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
year I think they said just if any part

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.010 
year I think they said just if any part
of<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> ball<00:01:29.100> crosses<00:01:29.369> ahead<00:01:29.880> string<00:01:30.240> it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
of the ball crosses ahead string it

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.139 
of the ball crosses ahead string it
counts<00:01:31.500> oh<00:01:32.810> that's<00:01:33.810> different<00:01:34.789> yeah<00:01:35.789> in<00:01:35.909> years

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
counts oh that's different yeah in years

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:37.999 
counts oh that's different yeah in years
past<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.720> was<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.990> base<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.530> ball<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
past it was the base of the ball the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:45.320 
past it was the base of the ball the
whole<00:01:38.189> ball<00:01:43.729> careful<00:01:44.729> here<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.119> was<00:01:45.300> a

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
whole ball careful here this was a

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.840 
whole ball careful here this was a
pretty<00:01:45.509> good<00:01:45.750> shot<00:01:45.990> nice<00:01:46.979> speed<00:01:47.340> control

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
pretty good shot nice speed control

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.930 
pretty good shot nice speed control
there<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.420> draw<00:01:49.340> it's<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.399> little<00:01:50.670> harder

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
there on that draw it's a little harder

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.160 
there on that draw it's a little harder
to<00:01:51.060> control<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.539> cue<00:01:51.720> ball<00:01:51.780> when<00:01:52.049> you're

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
to control the cue ball when you're

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.419 
to control the cue ball when you're
drawing<00:01:52.440> it<00:01:52.740> then<00:01:52.890> when<00:01:53.009> you're<00:01:53.130> going

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
drawing it then when you're going

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:59.539 
drawing it then when you're going
forward<00:01:57.619> he<00:01:58.619> can<00:01:58.770> hit<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.069> with<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.310> nice

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
forward he can hit this with a nice

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:12.490 
forward he can hit this with a nice
comfortable<00:02:00.330> confident<00:02:01.140> stroke<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:03.390> he<00:02:03.479> did

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.370 

certainly<00:02:13.500> doesn't<00:02:13.860> take<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.130> lot<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.400> time<00:02:14.519> I

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
certainly doesn't take a lot of time I

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.319 
certainly doesn't take a lot of time I
liked<00:02:16.380> his<00:02:16.620> pace<00:02:16.890> neither<00:02:17.850> one<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.120> these<00:02:18.269> guys

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
liked his pace neither one of these guys

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.460 
liked his pace neither one of these guys
takes<00:02:18.870> much<00:02:19.109> time<00:02:20.720> we're<00:02:21.720> probably<00:02:22.200> going<00:02:22.380> to
