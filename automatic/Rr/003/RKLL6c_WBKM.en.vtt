and track what they ate to determine if

their disease and other brain
development<00:01:05.339> diagnoses<00:01:06.150> are<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.570> some<00:01:06.930> way

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
development diagnoses are in some way

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.100 
development diagnoses are in some way
associated<00:01:07.560> that's<00:01:08.520> next<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.030> impossible<00:01:09.110> so

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
associated that's next to impossible so

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.170 
associated that's next to impossible so
let's<00:01:10.290> start<00:01:10.530> with<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.710> basics<00:01:11.070> then<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:11.970> do

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
let's start with the basics then we do

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.330 
let's start with the basics then we do
know<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.750> thousands<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.409> chemicals<00:01:13.619> used<00:01:14.159> in

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
know the thousands of chemicals used in

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.179 
know the thousands of chemicals used in
farming<00:01:14.790> today<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.689> some<00:01:16.080> degree<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.890> water

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
farming today have some degree of water

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.429 
farming today have some degree of water
solubility<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.180> their<00:01:18.330> molecular<00:01:18.479> structures

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
solubility to their molecular structures

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.219 
solubility to their molecular structures
therefore<00:01:20.340> water<00:01:20.520> alone<00:01:20.939> will<00:01:21.240> wash<00:01:21.509> off<00:01:21.840> some

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
therefore water alone will wash off some

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.440 
therefore water alone will wash off some
of<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.409> residues<00:01:22.860> what<00:01:23.759> I'm<00:01:23.909> concerned<00:01:24.330> about

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
of the residues what I'm concerned about

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.480 
of the residues what I'm concerned about
is<00:01:24.750> what<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.049> not<00:01:25.350> being<00:01:25.650> washed<00:01:25.979> off<00:01:26.250> with

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
is what is not being washed off with

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.510 
is what is not being washed off with
water<00:01:26.729> alone<00:01:27.119> over<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.140> past<00:01:28.350> 14<00:01:28.950> years<00:01:29.250> I

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
water alone over the past 14 years I

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.100 
water alone over the past 14 years I
