the<00:00:17.279> three<00:00:18.000> times<00:00:18.359> video<00:00:19.020> zoom<00:00:19.289> so<00:00:20.250> I'll<00:00:20.400> also

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
the three times video zoom so I'll also

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.290 
the three times video zoom so I'll also
cover<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.359> in<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.230> video

take a picture just like that and then

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.760 
take a picture just like that and then
finally<00:01:24.470> you<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.250> recording<00:01:27.180> quality

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
finally you have the recording quality

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.469 
finally you have the recording quality
where<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.100> set<00:01:29.430> their<00:01:29.640> frame<00:01:29.880> rate<00:01:30.180> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
where you can set their frame rate and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.560 
where you can set their frame rate and
zoom<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.049> all<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.640> last<00:01:32.880> option<00:01:33.150> in

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
zoom and all that and the last option in

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.190 
zoom and all that and the last option in
the<00:01:33.869> bottom<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:35.369> create<00:01:35.820> short<00:01:36.240> movies<00:01:36.630> by

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the bottom is to create short movies by

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.560 
the bottom is to create short movies by
combining<00:01:37.770> several<00:01:38.369> clips<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.970> few<00:01:39.180> seconds

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
combining several clips of a few seconds

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.620 
combining several clips of a few seconds
each<00:01:39.799> so<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:41.100> set<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.700> camera<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.360> stop

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
each so you can set the camera to stop

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.899 
each so you can set the camera to stop
recording<00:01:43.229> after<00:01:43.649> let's<00:01:43.920> say<00:01:44.009> four<00:01:44.369> seconds

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
recording after let's say four seconds

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.530 
recording after let's say four seconds
and<00:01:45.450> then<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.259> can<00:01:46.290> keep<00:01:47.090> making<00:01:48.090> multiple

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
and then you can keep making multiple

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.630 
and then you can keep making multiple
clips<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> camera<00:01:49.649> will<00:01:49.799> assemble<00:01:50.310> all

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
clips and the camera will assemble all

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.520 
clips and the camera will assemble all
of<00:01:50.820> them<00:01:51.000> together<00:01:51.630> for<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.930> option

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
of them together for you so the option

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.160 
of them together for you so the option
that<00:01:55.560> will<00:01:56.100> interest<00:01:56.549> us<00:01:56.820> right<00:01:57.030> now<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.509> their

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
that will interest us right now is their

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.130 
that will interest us right now is their
resolution<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.420> the<00:02:00.420> frame<00:02:00.659> rate<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
resolution and the frame rate and

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.249 
resolution and the frame rate and
digital<00:02:01.829> zoom<00:02:02.149> so<00:02:03.149> if<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.600> take<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.130> 1920<00:02:05.130> and

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.729 

so<00:02:08.379> their<00:02:08.560> first<00:02:08.799> number<00:02:09.129> 1920<00:02:09.939> that's<00:02:10.179> their

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
so their first number 1920 that's their

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.819 
so their first number 1920 that's their
resolution<00:02:11.909> the<00:02:12.909> second<00:02:13.540> number<00:02:14.019> is<00:02:14.290> the

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
resolution the second number is the

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:21.750 
resolution the second number is the
frame<00:02:15.579> rate<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:17.260> third<00:02:17.709> number<00:02:18.010> is<00:02:20.760> if

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
frame rate and the third number is if

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.179 
frame rate and the third number is if
the<00:02:22.060> zoom<00:02:22.329> is<00:02:22.540> on<00:02:22.750> or<00:02:22.989> off<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.980> last

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
the zoom is on or off and the last

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:30.240 
the zoom is on or off and the last
number<00:02:24.579> is<00:02:24.610> how<00:02:24.790> long<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:26.310> let<00:02:27.310> me<00:02:29.040> all<00:02:30.040> right

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
number is how long and let me all right

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.440 
number is how long and let me all right
so<00:02:31.170> right<00:02:32.170> now<00:02:32.319> I'm<00:02:32.680> at<00:02:32.920> 1920<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:34.000> that's<00:02:34.180> for

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
so right now I'm at 1920 so that's for

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.470 
so right now I'm at 1920 so that's for
one<00:02:34.690> a<00:02:34.720> DP<00:02:35.170> mode<00:02:35.379> and<00:02:36.220> if<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:36.549> use<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.819> wheel<00:02:37.209> I

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
one a DP mode and if I use the wheel I

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.180 
one a DP mode and if I use the wheel I
can<00:02:38.079> go<00:02:38.560> in<00:02:38.829> 24<00:02:39.430> frames<00:02:39.730> per<00:02:39.849> second<00:02:40.390> or<00:02:40.659> I<00:02:41.190> can

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
can go in 24 frames per second or I can

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.610 
can go in 24 frames per second or I can
go<00:02:42.459> in<00:02:43.049> 720p<00:02:44.049> mode<00:02:44.440> 60<00:02:45.190> frames<00:02:45.430> per<00:02:45.579> second<00:02:46.090> I

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
go in 720p mode 60 frames per second I

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:54.089 
go in 720p mode 60 frames per second I
can<00:02:47.620> go<00:02:47.889> in<00:02:50.549> 640<00:02:51.549> so<00:02:52.510> that's<00:02:52.780> for<00:02:53.379> a<00:02:53.560> DP<00:02:53.859> mode

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
can go in 640 so that's for a DP mode

00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:00.210 
can go in 640 so that's for a DP mode
and<00:02:54.540> have<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.750> 30<00:02:56.109> frames<00:02:56.379> per<00:02:56.500> second<00:02:59.220> and

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
and have the 30 frames per second and

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.190 
and have the 30 frames per second and
then<00:03:00.790> if<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.090> keep<00:03:01.269> rolling<00:03:01.720> that's<00:03:01.989> where

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
then if you keep rolling that's where

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.050 
then if you keep rolling that's where
you<00:03:02.319> get<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.620> interesting<00:03:02.829> stuff<00:03:03.489> so<00:03:03.549> now<00:03:04.030> I

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
you get the interesting stuff so now I

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.530 
you get the interesting stuff so now I
have<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.750> full<00:03:05.019> 180<00:03:05.440> P<00:03:05.829> mode<00:03:06.069> 30<00:03:07.060> frames<00:03:07.389> per

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
have the full 180 P mode 30 frames per

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.910 
have the full 180 P mode 30 frames per
second<00:03:08.079> and<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:10.000> have<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.989> zoom<00:03:11.319> three<00:03:11.769> two

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
second and I have the zoom three two

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.949 
second and I have the zoom three two
time<00:03:12.190> X<00:03:13.440> so<00:03:14.440> in<00:03:14.889> the<00:03:15.549> default<00:03:16.150> like<00:03:16.510> I'm<00:03:16.720> right

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
time X so in the default like I'm right

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.699 
time X so in the default like I'm right
now<00:03:17.280> it's<00:03:18.280> zoomed<00:03:19.000> in<00:03:19.209> three<00:03:19.599> times<00:03:19.870> so<00:03:20.530> I<00:03:20.560> have

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
now it's zoomed in three times so I have

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.479 
now it's zoomed in three times so I have
the<00:03:21.099> 70<00:03:21.669> to<00:03:21.819> 300<00:03:22.359> millimeter<00:03:22.780> lens<00:03:23.109> here<00:03:23.489> so

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
the 70 to 300 millimeter lens here so

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.069 
the 70 to 300 millimeter lens here so
that's<00:03:26.160> three<00:03:27.160> times<00:03:27.370> 300<00:03:28.060> millimetres<00:03:28.629> times

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
that's three times 300 millimetres times

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.599 
that's three times 300 millimetres times
the<00:03:29.260> 1.6<00:03:30.040> X<00:03:30.370> crop<00:03:31.060> factor<00:03:31.299> so<00:03:32.069> that's<00:03:33.069> a<00:03:33.250> really

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
the 1.6 X crop factor so that's a really

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.319 
the 1.6 X crop factor so that's a really
big<00:03:33.819> zoom<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:34.680> then<00:03:35.680> if<00:03:35.949> I<00:03:36.160> press<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.519> Display

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
big zoom and then if I press the Display

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.720 
big zoom and then if I press the Display
button<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:38.680> you're<00:03:38.889> gonna<00:03:39.040> see<00:03:39.310> it's<00:03:39.459> really

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
button and you're gonna see it's really

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.900 
button and you're gonna see it's really
wobbly<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.870> use<00:03:41.410> just<00:03:41.709> a<00:03:41.829> cheap<00:03:42.069> tripod<00:03:42.489> for

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
wobbly I use just a cheap tripod for

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.619 
wobbly I use just a cheap tripod for
this<00:03:43.060> demonstration<00:03:43.629> so<00:03:44.669> but<00:03:45.669> you<00:03:46.090> can<00:03:46.299> zoom

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
this demonstration so but you can zoom

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.970 
this demonstration so but you can zoom
it<00:03:46.780> in<00:03:47.019> more<00:03:48.299> so<00:03:49.299> I<00:03:49.690> find<00:03:50.230> that<00:03:50.349> zooming

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
it in more so I find that zooming

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.360 
it in more so I find that zooming
between<00:03:51.370> 3x<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.480> 5x<00:03:52.870> as<00:03:53.409> you<00:03:53.560> can<00:03:53.739> see<00:03:54.010> here

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
between 3x and 5x as you can see here

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.800 
between 3x and 5x as you can see here
the<00:03:55.150> image<00:03:55.510> quality<00:03:55.690> is<00:03:56.260> still<00:03:56.620> very<00:03:57.040> good<00:03:57.310> and

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
the image quality is still very good and

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.629 
the image quality is still very good and
their<00:03:58.810> vibrations<00:03:59.440> are<00:03:59.769> normally<00:04:00.370> not<00:04:00.579> that

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
their vibrations are normally not that

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.469 
their vibrations are normally not that
bad<00:04:01.949> right<00:04:02.949> now<00:04:03.190> it's<00:04:03.430> actually<00:04:03.909> the<00:04:04.150> wind

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:04.479 
bad right now it's actually the wind

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:06.930 
bad right now it's actually the wind
that's<00:04:04.780> blowing<00:04:05.049> the<00:04:05.500> thing<00:04:05.769> left<00:04:06.579> and<00:04:06.729> right

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
that's blowing the thing left and right

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.199 
that's blowing the thing left and right
that's<00:04:07.209> not<00:04:07.419> that<00:04:07.659> camera<00:04:08.049> shaking<00:04:08.879> so<00:04:09.879> then

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
that's not that camera shaking so then

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.800 
that's not that camera shaking so then
if<00:04:10.510> I<00:04:10.720> press<00:04:10.959> this<00:04:11.319> plate<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:12.010> I<00:04:12.970> zoom<00:04:13.599> in

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
if I press this plate and I zoom in

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.080 
if I press this plate and I zoom in
again<00:04:13.959> I<00:04:14.440> can<00:04:14.949> go<00:04:15.159> all<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.459> way<00:04:15.669> to<00:04:15.870> 10x<00:04:16.870> zoom

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
again I can go all the way to 10x zoom

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.390 
again I can go all the way to 10x zoom
so<00:04:19.090> that's<00:04:19.419> my<00:04:19.599> bird<00:04:19.900> feeder<00:04:20.139> it's

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
so that's my bird feeder it's

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.080 
so that's my bird feeder it's
according<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:25.070> AAF<00:04:26.070> on<00:04:26.280> my<00:04:26.460> lens<00:04:26.730> it's

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
according to the AAF on my lens it's

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.950 
according to the AAF on my lens it's
about<00:04:27.630> 30-something<00:04:28.500> feet<00:04:28.920> away<00:04:29.100> so<00:04:30.000> about<00:04:30.300> 10

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
about 30-something feet away so about 10

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.100 
about 30-something feet away so about 10
meters<00:04:31.320> away<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:32.480> that's<00:04:33.480> how<00:04:33.690> much<00:04:33.900> I<00:04:34.050> can

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
meters away and that's how much I can

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.750 
meters away and that's how much I can
zoom<00:04:34.500> into<00:04:34.740> my<00:04:35.100> bird<00:04:35.430> feeder<00:04:36.830> so<00:04:37.830> yeah<00:04:38.430> that's

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
zoom into my bird feeder so yeah that's

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.790 
zoom into my bird feeder so yeah that's
pretty<00:04:38.910> amazing<00:04:39.630> and<00:04:39.810> again<00:04:39.930> you<00:04:40.410> press<00:04:40.620> the

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
zoom out or zoom back in so that's how

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.120 
example I have one I did to show that
different<00:05:14.910> zooms<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.600> find<00:05:15.900> a<00:05:16.050> tree<00:05:16.290> X<00:05:16.470> -<00:05:16.650> 5<00:05:16.830> X

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
different zooms I find a tree X - 5 X

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.540 
different zooms I find a tree X - 5 X
you<00:05:17.370> still<00:05:17.640> get<00:05:17.850> super<00:05:18.680> image<00:05:19.680> quality<00:05:19.950> and<00:05:20.400> it

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
you still get super image quality and it

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.300 
you still get super image quality and it
works<00:05:20.970> really<00:05:21.270> well<00:05:21.540> if<00:05:21.840> you<00:05:22.800> go<00:05:22.950> all<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.280> way

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
works really well if you go all the way

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.030 
works really well if you go all the way
to<00:05:23.460> 10x<00:05:24.030> till<00:05:24.390> then<00:05:24.900> I<00:05:25.110> find<00:05:25.440> it's<00:05:25.620> a<00:05:25.740> little

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
to 10x till then I find it's a little

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.270 
to 10x till then I find it's a little
bit<00:05:26.190> lacking<00:05:26.540> so<00:05:27.540> this<00:05:27.900> is<00:05:28.170> at<00:05:28.500> 300

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
bit lacking so this is at 300

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.240 
bit lacking so this is at 300
millimeters<00:05:29.850> with<00:05:30.180> the<00:05:30.330> three<00:05:30.630> times<00:05:30.900> zoom

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
millimeters with the three times zoom

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.490 
millimeters with the three times zoom
you<00:05:32.250> can<00:05:32.280> see<00:05:32.730> that<00:05:32.970> the<00:05:33.360> image<00:05:33.870> quality<00:05:34.020> is

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
you can see that the image quality is

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.270 
you can see that the image quality is
still<00:05:34.770> very<00:05:35.190> good<00:05:36.410> next<00:05:37.410> up<00:05:37.770> I'm<00:05:37.980> going<00:05:38.010> to

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
still very good next up I'm going to

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.060 
still very good next up I'm going to
zoom<00:05:38.460> at<00:05:38.730> five<00:05:39.060> times<00:05:39.330> zoom<00:05:39.660> and<00:05:39.990> again<00:05:40.830> this

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
zoom at five times zoom and again this

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.880 
zoom at five times zoom and again this
is<00:05:41.310> quite<00:05:41.700> acceptable<00:05:42.210> you're<00:05:43.200> starting<00:05:43.770> to

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
is quite acceptable you're starting to

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.000 
is quite acceptable you're starting to
lose<00:05:44.070> a<00:05:44.130> little<00:05:44.550> bit<00:05:44.850> of<00:05:45.090> resolution<00:05:45.770> but<00:05:46.770> now

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
lose a little bit of resolution but now

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.450 
lose a little bit of resolution but now
this<00:05:47.340> is<00:05:47.490> at<00:05:47.670> 10<00:05:48.000> times<00:05:48.240> zoom<00:05:48.570> and<00:05:48.900> I<00:05:49.530> find<00:05:50.280> this

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
this is at 10 times zoom and I find this

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.510 
this is at 10 times zoom and I find this
is<00:05:50.520> starting<00:05:51.000> to<00:05:51.120> be<00:05:51.270> too<00:05:51.300> grainy<00:05:51.900> and<00:05:52.520> it

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
is starting to be too grainy and it

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.390 
is starting to be too grainy and it
looks<00:05:53.820> too<00:05:54.060> much<00:05:54.090> like<00:05:55.070> something<00:05:56.070> that<00:05:56.220> has

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
looks too much like something that has

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.730 
looks too much like something that has
been<00:05:56.670> zoomed<00:05:56.970> way<00:05:57.240> further<00:05:57.990> than<00:05:58.170> it<00:05:58.440> should

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
been zoomed way further than it should

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.220 
been zoomed way further than it should
