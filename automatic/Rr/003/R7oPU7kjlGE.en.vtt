I<00:01:32.500> soon<00:01:33.500> got<00:01:33.650> the<00:01:33.710> hang<00:01:33.800> of<00:01:34.040> this<00:01:34.220> just<00:01:35.090> press

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
I soon got the hang of this just press

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.680 
I soon got the hang of this just press
it<00:01:35.510> in<00:01:37.780> as<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:38.870> can<00:01:39.020> see<00:01:40.300> that's<00:01:41.300> where<00:01:41.600> we

start<00:01:41.900> to<00:01:42.080> stitch<00:01:42.320> there<00:01:42.640> so<00:01:43.640> we<00:01:43.820> always<00:01:43.970> go

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
start to stitch there so we always go

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:52.750 
start to stitch there so we always go
back<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:45.170> tightest<00:01:45.650> stitch<00:01:47.740> which<00:01:48.740> is<00:01:51.760> not

don't have to prise it Arabs heart cut
it<00:03:03.709> off<00:03:03.890> wasn't<00:03:04.280> very<00:03:04.850> tear<00:03:05.090> about<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.600> holes

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
it off wasn't very tear about the holes

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.630 
it off wasn't very tear about the holes
cleared<00:03:06.310> just<00:03:07.780> pull<00:03:08.780> them<00:03:08.930> back<00:03:09.400> because<00:03:10.400> they

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
cleared just pull them back because they

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.130 
cleared just pull them back because they
said<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.060> part<00:03:11.270> of<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.540> original<00:03:11.660> stitching

said the part of the original stitching

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.360 
said the part of the original stitching
and<00:03:12.650> they<00:03:13.130> won't<00:03:13.340> go<00:03:13.489> anywhere<00:03:14.950> then<00:03:15.950> we<00:03:16.100> start

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
and they won't go anywhere then we start

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.350 
and they won't go anywhere then we start
to<00:03:16.519> stitch<00:03:17.830> exactly<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.730> same<00:03:19.970> as<00:03:20.209> the

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
to stitch exactly the same as the

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:28.520 
to stitch exactly the same as the
football

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.830 

left<00:03:29.530> right<00:03:29.770> all<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.760> time<00:03:33.540> now<00:03:34.540> whole<00:03:34.810> world

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
left right all the time now whole world

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.860 
left right all the time now whole world
all<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.530> way<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.370> top<00:03:36.580> I'll<00:03:37.300> just<00:03:37.510> do<00:03:37.660> one

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
all the way to the top I'll just do one

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.940 
all the way to the top I'll just do one
more<00:03:38.580> because<00:03:39.580> I<00:03:39.819> can<00:03:40.090> finish<00:03:40.300> off<00:03:40.569> there<00:03:40.950> even

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
more because I can finish off there even

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.050 
more because I can finish off there even
though<00:03:42.040> it's<00:03:42.160> at<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.370> end<00:03:42.489> there's<00:03:42.910> no

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
though it's at the end there's no

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.680 
though it's at the end there's no
problem<00:03:44.069> so<00:03:45.069> once<00:03:45.310> you've<00:03:45.489> got<00:03:45.700> halfway<00:03:46.569> up

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
problem so once you've got halfway up

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:56.630 
problem so once you've got halfway up
the<00:03:46.840> ball<00:03:47.620> just<00:03:48.610> a<00:03:48.819> double<00:03:49.270> knot<00:03:53.069> tight<00:03:54.209> and

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
the ball just a double knot tight and

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.420 
the ball just a double knot tight and
cut<00:03:57.640> it<00:03:57.819> off<00:03:57.970> right<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:02.650> once<00:04:03.069> you've<00:04:03.280> done

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
cut it off right so once you've done

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.550 
cut it off right so once you've done
that<00:04:03.489> you've<00:04:03.790> tied<00:04:04.030> it<00:04:04.180> off<00:04:04.330> we<00:04:05.049> then<00:04:05.230> start

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
that you've tied it off we then start

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.729 
that you've tied it off we then start
from<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:06.100> other<00:04:06.160> end<00:04:06.280> so<00:04:07.239> I'll<00:04:07.330> just<00:04:07.739> maneuver

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
from the other end so I'll just maneuver

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:15.270 
from the other end so I'll just maneuver
the<00:04:08.830> ball<00:04:13.230> obviously<00:04:14.230> a<00:04:14.560> rugby<00:04:15.040> balls

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
the ball obviously a rugby balls

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.759 
the ball obviously a rugby balls
slightly<00:04:15.910> more<00:04:16.269> difficult<00:04:16.450> to<00:04:16.930> maneuver<00:04:17.650> than

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
slightly more difficult to maneuver than

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.219 
slightly more difficult to maneuver than
a<00:04:18.100> football<00:04:18.400> but<00:04:19.180> once<00:04:19.359> you've<00:04:19.570> got<00:04:20.079> that

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
a football but once you've got that

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.570 
a football but once you've got that
first<00:04:20.500> half<00:04:20.680> done<00:04:21.040> just<00:04:22.000> press<00:04:22.270> it<00:04:22.450> in<00:04:22.630> ya

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
first half done just press it in ya

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:34.070 
first half done just press it in ya
scuse<00:04:24.580> me<00:04:25.260> so<00:04:26.260> just<00:04:26.590> press<00:04:28.740> squeeze<00:04:29.740> it<00:04:29.890> there

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.690 

so<00:04:35.080> you've<00:04:35.229> got<00:04:35.410> access<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:36.190> inside<00:04:36.580> of

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
so you've got access to the inside of

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.430 
so you've got access to the inside of
that<00:04:36.729> football<00:04:37.150> and<00:04:37.600> you<00:04:37.990> start<00:04:38.289> again

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
that football and you start again

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.260 
that football and you start again
exactly<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.310> same<00:04:39.520> as<00:04:39.669> before

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
exactly the same as before

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.630 
exactly the same as before
you<00:04:40.750> go<00:04:40.930> back<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.640> tightest<00:04:43.060> stitch

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
you go back to the tightest stitch

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.290 
you go back to the tightest stitch
needle<00:04:45.640> through<00:04:45.990> tie<00:04:46.990> one<00:04:47.229> loop<00:04:47.970> prior<00:04:48.970> to<00:04:49.090> the

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
needle through tie one loop prior to the

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.480 
needle through tie one loop prior to the
loose<00:04:49.479> ones<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:50.110> then<00:04:50.650> you<00:04:50.770> start<00:04:51.070> to<00:04:51.220> stitch

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
loose ones and then you start to stitch

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.960 
loose ones and then you start to stitch
and<00:04:52.419> to<00:04:52.570> say<00:04:52.720> you<00:04:52.780> can<00:04:52.990> go<00:04:53.110> as<00:04:53.200> far<00:04:53.440> as<00:04:53.590> you<00:04:53.710> want

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
and to say you can go as far as you want

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.640 
and to say you can go as far as you want
maneuvering<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:55.090> ball<00:04:55.270> and<00:04:56.169> then<00:04:56.320> you<00:04:56.350> can<00:04:56.560> do

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
maneuvering the ball and then you can do

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.490 
maneuvering the ball and then you can do
the<00:04:56.800> loop<00:04:56.979> system<00:04:57.360> so<00:04:58.360> as<00:04:58.450> the<00:04:58.539> same<00:04:58.750> from

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
the loop system so as the same from

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.060 
the loop system so as the same from
there<00:04:59.710> long

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
there long

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.010 
there long
it's<00:05:00.190> exactly<00:05:00.760> the<00:05:00.910> same<00:05:01.090> of<00:05:01.300> repairing<00:05:01.960> a

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
it's exactly the same of repairing a

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.830 
it's exactly the same of repairing a
football<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:03.130> stitching<00:05:03.490> a<00:05:03.550> football<00:05:03.940> ball

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
football and stitching a football ball

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.540 
football and stitching a football ball
obviously<00:05:05.380> salty<00:05:05.590> if<00:05:06.010> it<00:05:06.130> is<00:05:06.250> a<00:05:06.280> straight

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
obviously salty if it is a straight

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.360 
obviously salty if it is a straight
panel<00:05:07.110> so<00:05:08.110> it's<00:05:08.289> just<00:05:08.410> maneuverability<00:05:09.220> all

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
panel so it's just maneuverability all

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.210 
panel so it's just maneuverability all
the<00:05:09.460> time<00:05:09.640> just<00:05:09.970> pull<00:05:10.690> it<00:05:10.810> out<00:05:10.960> slightly<00:05:11.289> from

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
the time just pull it out slightly from

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.880 
the time just pull it out slightly from
the<00:05:12.340> sides<00:05:12.580> and<00:05:13.680> press<00:05:14.680> down<00:05:15.240> on<00:05:16.240> both<00:05:16.419> sides

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
the sides and press down on both sides

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.490 
the sides and press down on both sides
as<00:05:17.890> you<00:05:17.950> can<00:05:18.250> see<00:05:18.430> access<00:05:19.210> to<00:05:19.330> the<00:05:19.419> ball<00:05:19.600> doing

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500
