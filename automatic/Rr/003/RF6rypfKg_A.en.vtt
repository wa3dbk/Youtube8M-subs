00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.990
 2 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.650
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.529
 new tutorial today we're going 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.140
 learn to record our screen from 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:28.009
 android phone under lollipop 5.0 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.630
 then without administrator access so 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.460
 without you having a road phone 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.530
 so be aware that this tutorial does 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.840
 will only work on the funds that the 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.550
 android versions 5.0 lollipops 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.160
 simply that there is this new 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.629
 version actually allows to film his 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.149
 screen without having prime ministers 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.140
 at her so the road rights so 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.749
 for other users 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.969
 you will have to refer to others 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:51.920
 so videos that will surely require 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.629
 the road of your phone 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.760
 so here is in any case here for this 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.699
 tutorial so let's learn how to 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.109
 filming our screen through several 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.749
 applications that have been developed so 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.430
 on lollipop 5 on applications that 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:06.020
 will allow you to register codes 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.909
 your screen as I do here for the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.440
 tutorial and so then to share it 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.510
 for example on youtube for to 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.550
 tutorials or even to your friends so 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.770
 so here first we will make a 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.659
 search in the paint horse for 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.520
 search an application 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.500
 screen recording so very new 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.000
 order in English we see we have 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.040
 several possibilities so that all 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.680
 these applications that guarantee access 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.060
 to movies without road requires to have 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.610
 a version 5.0 or lolly pop of android 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.159
 so what is obligatory we can see 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.890
 we have the famous and know the src 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.950
 null body zero screen here that is a very 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.969
 good captures the screenshots and who 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.350
 so lets make recordings 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.630
 professional is really my 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.399
 perfect but know that for this 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.990
 that you want to do for example me 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:02:00.140
 for my tutorial I no longer use src 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:03.799
 I used it before for my 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.429
 old tutorial but I find that for 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.929
 what it offers 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:08.780
 it's really not worth the price they 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.220
 go for 4.50 and we can find 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.050
 applications a lot of guys badly than that 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.240
 if you still serve I you 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.050
 advise to use the applications 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.720
 lollipops that a him when there I have 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.930
 found from the shores of the studio what you 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.190
 come and go install me and see 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.470
 we do not need the rhÃ´ne au brut 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.720
 and we can easily catch 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.390
 of screen so I'm going so you 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.310
 the open center game recorded so and 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.960
 it's going to be a bit complicated but I'm going 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.730
 still open the application what 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.710
 him sticks that looks like this you 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.650
 see that I am in full 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.920
 recording as shown at the top at 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.720
 right the little button that flash the 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.920
 only downside that we would have 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.270
 with this application it may be 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.510
 a little bit of advertising that there is in 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.280
 below 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.050
 see the advertising that can easily 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.370
 without lifting if you are road but otherwise 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.960
 you will have to have a small 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.760
 advertising but in return 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.750
 the application is free and it's 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.330
 really very good job 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.930
 you can choose the resolution here 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.750
 360 by 640 up to maximum 1080i hd and 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.130
 1080p 1920 and so to launch vallerand 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.330

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.450
