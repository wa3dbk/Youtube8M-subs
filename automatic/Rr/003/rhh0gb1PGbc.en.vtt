00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.189
 hello I am a valÃ©rie 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.719
 picture 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.269
 today gentlemen we will see 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.670
 how to avoid mistakes of taste with 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.710
 the colors so I'm going to give you 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.170
 some rules about association 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.060
 of clothing colors but before 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.710
 everything we checked together if 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.210
 you have the basic colors in 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.470
 your male wardrobe 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:33.590
 you must be able and find gray from 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:37.260
 black from navy blue from brown from blue 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.149
 can be a blue jean denim blue and 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.090
 then of course light colors like 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.730
 white and pej all its colors 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.010
 you use them on parts that 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.860
 are pretty classic the gray for the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.989
 costume one can be for a coat the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.510
 brown often more for belts 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.449
 for shoes and black the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.960
 universal color gentlemen so that's 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.949
 either for pants and a sweater or 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.400
 suit jacket 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.170
 all these colors wanted to marry 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.110
 easily without the essential it is 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.000
 to have in your wardrobe it's five 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.869
 or six basic colors to be able to 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.330
 play with 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.939
 then we use light colors to 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.400
 the interior and the dark colors 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.220
 on the outside the light colors he 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.549
 is the whites of the beige blues 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.670
 sky 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.759
 for example here we do not have a t-shirt 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.500
 white under a khaki shirt 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.490
 there we consider that the dark color 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.740
 broke loose 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.740
 this case which is the other color are 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.689
 it's the mind so how do you avoid 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.880
 faults of taste, many of you 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.920
 ask the question there are some rules 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.560
 to respect 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:51.030
 first we try to buy maximum 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.310
 of clothes in solid color then 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.009
 avoids mixing shelves with 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.049
 other scratches or so we avoid 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.869
 mix the stripes with the tiles 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.520
 and most importantly remember do not wear 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.549
 more than three colors 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.280
 a last little rule gentlemen 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.679
 think about matching the color of your 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.440
 socks with your shoes there you 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.540
 be sure to make no mistake of taste 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.000
 that's it then you have a few 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.739
 rules to avoid tastings and 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.060
 to be able to associate the colors of 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.860
 clothes now he stays longer 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.069
 that one thing is also a little 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.069
 now
