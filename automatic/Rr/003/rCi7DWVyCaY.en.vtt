game minecraft Xbox edition or minecraft
PlayStation<00:01:39.180> Edition<00:01:39.570> doesn't<00:01:40.439> actually

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
PlayStation Edition doesn't actually

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.859 
PlayStation Edition doesn't actually
have<00:01:41.100> command<00:01:41.520> blocks<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.180> would<00:01:42.360> kind<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.750> be

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
have command blocks it would kind of be

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.380 
have command blocks it would kind of be
something<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.439> contradicts<00:01:44.310> itself<00:01:44.700> now

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
something that contradicts itself now

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.800 
something that contradicts itself now
this<00:01:46.049> brings<00:01:46.560> me<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> point<00:01:47.340> that

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
this brings me to the point that

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.469 
this brings me to the point that
Microsoft<00:01:48.810> owns<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.680> game<00:01:49.979> now<00:01:50.250> keep<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.939> mind

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
Microsoft owns the game now keep in mind

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.760 
Microsoft owns the game now keep in mind
Microsoft<00:01:52.110> also<00:01:52.770> owns<00:01:53.070> Xbox<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:54.119> their<00:01:54.479> own

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
Microsoft also owns Xbox it's their own

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.800 
Microsoft also owns Xbox it's their own
personal<00:01:55.770> console<00:01:56.430> now<00:01:56.729> if<00:01:56.790> Mojang<00:01:57.329> was<00:01:57.539> still

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
personal console now if Mojang was still

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.600 
personal console now if Mojang was still
their<00:01:57.990> own<00:01:58.140> thing<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.590> was<00:01:58.799> not<00:01:59.039> actually

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
their own thing and was not actually

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.120 
their own thing and was not actually
controlled<00:02:00.000> by<00:02:00.090> Microsoft<00:02:00.840> now<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.350> probably

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
controlled by Microsoft now I probably

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.160 
controlled by Microsoft now I probably
wouldn't<00:02:02.579> make<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.909> video<00:02:03.240> because<00:02:03.479> Mojang

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
wouldn't make this video because Mojang

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.109 
wouldn't make this video because Mojang
has<00:02:04.350> really<00:02:04.799> never<00:02:05.070> been<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> part<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.000> the

has really never been a part of the
console<00:02:06.600> scene<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.320> if<00:02:07.469> Mojang<00:02:08.009> by<00:02:08.310> themselves

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
console scene so if Mojang by themselves

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.300 
console scene so if Mojang by themselves

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.080 
minecraft story mode
this<00:02:12.939> wouldn't<00:02:13.299> throw<00:02:13.510> up<00:02:13.689> any<00:02:13.930> red<00:02:14.170> flags<00:02:14.560> but

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
this wouldn't throw up any red flags but

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.660 
this wouldn't throw up any red flags but
the<00:02:16.090> fact<00:02:16.569> that<00:02:16.719> Microsoft<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:18.099> owners<00:02:18.639> of

the fact that Microsoft the owners of

the fact that Microsoft the owners of

Xbox are going to be releasing this game
I<00:02:21.999> would<00:02:22.599> imagine<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.290> they<00:02:23.499> would<00:02:23.680> make

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
I would imagine that they would make

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.030 
I would imagine that they would make
sure<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.579> minecraft<00:02:25.299> story<00:02:25.599> mode<00:02:25.780> lined<00:02:26.739> up

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
sure the minecraft story mode lined up

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.670 
sure the minecraft story mode lined up
with<00:02:27.310> their<00:02:27.609> consoles<00:02:28.299> version<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.319> game

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
with their consoles version of the game

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.520 
with their consoles version of the game
now<00:02:30.189> while<00:02:30.400> they<00:02:30.609> may<00:02:30.969> not<00:02:31.299> take<00:02:31.599> this<00:02:31.870> route<00:02:32.200> I

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
now while they may not take this route I

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.220 
now while they may not take this route I
do<00:02:32.709> know<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.400> Microsoft<00:02:34.239> definitely<00:02:34.959> like

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
do know that Microsoft definitely like

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.319 
do know that Microsoft definitely like
to<00:02:35.469> have<00:02:35.680> their<00:02:36.099> versions<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:36.790> things<00:02:37.030> the

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
to have their versions of things the

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.959 
to have their versions of things the
best<00:02:37.719> out<00:02:37.989> there<00:02:38.049> hence<00:02:38.739> why<00:02:38.950> for<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.310> lot<00:02:39.760> of

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:39.969 
best out there hence why for a lot of

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.239 
best out there hence why for a lot of
games<00:02:40.299> they<00:02:40.510> give<00:02:40.689> you<00:02:40.810> exclusive<00:02:41.650> content

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:42.249 
games they give you exclusive content

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:44.849 
games they give you exclusive content
for<00:02:42.430> having<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.849> on<00:02:43.030> Xbox<00:02:43.659> edition<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.469> in<00:02:44.650> my

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
for having it on Xbox edition so in my

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.759 
for having it on Xbox edition so in my
opinion<00:02:45.489> it<00:02:45.669> only<00:02:45.939> makes<00:02:46.540> sense<00:02:46.959> for<00:02:47.260> them<00:02:47.500> to

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
opinion it only makes sense for them to

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.679 
opinion it only makes sense for them to
make<00:02:47.980> sure<00:02:48.159> the<00:02:48.370> console<00:02:48.969> addition<00:02:49.480> at<00:02:49.659> least

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
make sure the console addition at least

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.319 
make sure the console addition at least
matches<00:02:50.650> up<00:02:50.859> to<00:02:50.889> story<00:02:51.430> mode<00:02:51.730> but<00:02:52.000> anyways

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
matches up to story mode but anyways

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.809 
matches up to story mode but anyways
