00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
shiny and so soft there's no breakage

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.389

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
like no flyaways or whatever you want to

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.029 
like no flyaways or whatever you want to
call<00:00:59.489> them<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.930> actually<00:01:01.289> holds<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.829> curl

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
call them and it actually holds the curl

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.219 
call them and it actually holds the curl
pretty<00:01:02.370> well<00:01:02.609> as<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.719> see<00:01:03.780> like<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
pretty well as you can see like in the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.490 
pretty well as you can see like in the
front<00:01:04.379> pieces<00:01:04.650> um<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:06.659> front<00:01:07.020> pieces<00:01:07.350> are

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
front pieces um the front pieces are

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.649 
front pieces um the front pieces are
longer<00:01:07.950> than<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> back<00:01:08.340> pieces<00:01:08.610> as<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.390> will

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
longer than the back pieces as you will

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.370 
longer than the back pieces as you will
see<00:01:10.080> right<00:01:10.380> now<00:01:11.420> they're<00:01:12.420> lot<00:01:12.750> shorter<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
see right now they're lot shorter in the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.609 
see right now they're lot shorter in the
back<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.530> think<00:01:14.689> like<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.900> back<00:01:16.080> pieces<00:01:16.470> don't

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
back I think like the back pieces don't

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.710 
back I think like the back pieces don't
curl<00:01:16.860> as<00:01:17.009> well<00:01:17.189> either<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:18.060> as<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.509> see

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
curl as well either like as you can see

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.980 
curl as well either like as you can see
there<00:01:18.960> they<00:01:19.830> don't<00:01:19.950> curl<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.460> well<00:01:20.810> but<00:01:21.810> if<00:01:21.930> you

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
there they don't curl as well but if you

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.469 
there they don't curl as well but if you
don't<00:01:22.170> care<00:01:22.320> about<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.560> curl<00:01:22.770> then<00:01:23.210> it's<00:01:24.210> fine

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
don't care about the curl then it's fine

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.690 
don't care about the curl then it's fine
you<00:01:24.990> will<00:01:25.380> not<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.799> able<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.009> tell<00:01:26.250> whether<00:01:26.549> or

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
you will not be able to tell whether or

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.340 
you will not be able to tell whether or
not<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.090> back<00:01:27.240> pieces<00:01:27.600> are<00:01:27.750> longer<00:01:28.110> than<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
not the back pieces are longer than the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.520 
not the back pieces are longer than the
front<00:01:28.500> pieces<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.820> brush<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.060> out

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
front pieces if you just brush it out

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.950 
front pieces if you just brush it out
but<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.520> curly<00:01:32.850> style<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.689> it

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
but I like it in the curly style so it

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.170 
but I like it in the curly style so it
is<00:01:34.200> fairly<00:01:34.920> curly<00:01:35.579> um<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:37.640> mean<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:38.850> meant<00:01:39.150> to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
is fairly curly um I mean it's meant to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.999 
is fairly curly um I mean it's meant to
be<00:01:39.329> wavy<00:01:39.689> not<00:01:39.810> curly<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.350> like<00:01:40.590> being<00:01:40.920> able

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009

personality like I just can't picture
her<00:03:51.120> without<00:03:51.359> without<00:03:52.019> freckles<00:03:52.560> like<00:03:52.769> I

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
her without without freckles like I

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.420 
her without without freckles like I
think<00:03:53.009> she'd<00:03:53.340> be<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.519> lot<00:03:53.669> more<00:03:53.849> boring<00:03:54.120> without

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
think she'd be a lot more boring without

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.849 
think she'd be a lot more boring without
so<00:03:56.430> I<00:03:57.299> think<00:03:57.569> she'd<00:03:57.900> be<00:03:58.079> a<00:03:58.109> lot<00:03:58.259> more<00:03:58.500> boring

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
so I think she'd be a lot more boring

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.069 
so I think she'd be a lot more boring
like<00:03:59.069> too<00:03:59.219> much<00:03:59.400> like<00:03:59.669> I'm<00:04:00.299> American<00:04:00.900> girl

number<00:04:01.259> 41<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:02.489> I<00:04:02.519> think<00:04:02.669> the<00:04:02.939> freckles<00:04:03.329> really

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
number 41 so I think the freckles really

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.990 
number 41 so I think the freckles really
define<00:04:04.500> her<00:04:04.769> like<00:04:05.159> set<00:04:05.370> her<00:04:05.459> apart<00:04:05.549> from<00:04:05.879> the
