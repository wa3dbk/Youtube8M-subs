00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.440 
them through here really really easily
you<00:01:05.010> don't<00:01:05.189> lose<00:01:05.369> any<00:01:05.640> bullet<00:01:05.970> damage<00:01:06.090> and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
this actually goes both ways so if

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.200 
this actually goes both ways so if

you can see right here you can see I can
just<00:02:40.970> barely<00:02:41.209> see<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.690> one<00:02:41.840> boom<00:02:42.079> through

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
just barely see the one boom through

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.259 
just barely see the one boom through
here<00:02:42.530> as<00:02:42.650> I<00:02:42.799> jump<00:02:43.069> up<00:02:43.220> you<00:02:43.730> can<00:02:43.879> see<00:02:44.030> them<00:02:44.150> in

here as I jump up you can see them in

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.360 
here as I jump up you can see them in
that<00:02:44.420> room<00:02:44.629> there<00:02:44.659> so<00:02:45.349> it<00:02:45.500> could<00:02:45.739> be<00:02:45.920> used<00:02:46.129> as<00:02:46.340> a

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
that room there so it could be used as a

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.100 
that room there so it could be used as a
check<00:02:46.640> spot<00:02:46.970> maybe<00:02:47.360> in<00:02:47.569> like<00:02:47.599> search<00:02:47.959> or

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
check spot maybe in like search or

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.600 
check spot maybe in like search or
destroy<00:02:48.349> or<00:02:48.500> something<00:02:48.829> but<00:02:49.040> honestly<00:02:49.430> it's

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
destroy or something but honestly it's

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.490 
destroy or something but honestly it's
probably<00:02:49.849> not<00:02:50.000> too<00:02:50.030> practical<00:02:50.360> this<00:02:51.260> is<00:02:51.410> the

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
probably not too practical this is the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.690 
probably not too practical this is the
window<00:02:51.769> you're<00:02:51.890> looking<00:02:52.190> through<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:52.459> you<00:02:52.519> can

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.789 
very little bullet damage it takes a ton
of<00:03:56.329> bullets<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.870> kill<00:03:56.900> so<00:03:57.260> it's<00:03:57.379> really<00:03:57.650> not<00:03:57.739> a

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
of bullets to kill so it's really not a

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.379 
of bullets to kill so it's really not a
practical<00:03:58.220> spot<00:03:58.519> unless<00:03:58.849> maybe<00:03:58.910> you're<00:03:59.239> just

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
practical spot unless maybe you're just

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:00.580 
practical spot unless maybe you're just
using<00:03:59.629> it<00:03:59.870> to<00:04:00.019> see<00:04:00.169> if<00:04:00.200> you<00:04:00.319> can<00:04:00.440> get<00:04:00.560> a

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
using it to see if you can get a

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.050 
using it to see if you can get a
hitmarker<00:04:00.769> just<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.489> see<00:04:01.669> if<00:04:01.760> somebody

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
hitmarker just to see if somebody

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.509 
hitmarker just to see if somebody
happens<00:04:02.329> to<00:04:02.629> be<00:04:02.870> there<00:04:03.109> now<00:04:03.980> this<00:04:04.129> next<00:04:04.280> spot

happens to be there now this next spot

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:05.830 
happens to be there now this next spot
might<00:04:04.819> be<00:04:04.940> a<00:04:04.970> good<00:04:05.150> spot<00:04:05.269> for<00:04:05.419> search<00:04:05.750> and

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
might be a good spot for search and

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.300 
might be a good spot for search and
destroy<00:04:06.019> or<00:04:06.410> some<00:04:06.829> other<00:04:06.950> game<00:04:07.190> modes

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
you can maybe try to launch an aid like

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.940 
you can maybe try to launch an aid like
from<00:04:37.880> here<00:04:38.120> on<00:04:38.360> to<00:04:38.510> the<00:04:38.600> a<00:04:38.630> flag<00:04:39.140> or<00:04:39.440> from<00:04:39.740> here

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
from here on to the a flag or from here

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.100 
from here on to the a flag or from here
on<00:04:40.100> to<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.340> sea<00:04:40.520> flag<00:04:40.790> I<00:04:41.030> didn't<00:04:41.660> actually<00:04:41.780> go

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
on to the sea flag I didn't actually go

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.840 
on to the sea flag I didn't actually go
out<00:04:42.230> and<00:04:42.410> find<00:04:42.560> like<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.890> perfect<00:04:43.130> nade<00:04:43.490> spot

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
out and find like the perfect nade spot

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.580 
out and find like the perfect nade spot
or<00:04:44.000> anything<00:04:44.270> like<00:04:44.300> that<00:04:44.450> honestly<00:04:44.900> because<00:04:45.410> I

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
or anything like that honestly because I

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.530 
or anything like that honestly because I
just<00:04:45.950> feel<00:04:46.100> nades<00:04:46.370> aren't<00:04:46.760> as<00:04:46.880> useful<00:04:47.150> as<00:04:47.360> they

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
just feel nades aren't as useful as they

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.850 
just feel nades aren't as useful as they
were<00:04:47.600> in<00:04:47.870> previous<00:04:48.200> Cod's<00:04:48.410> because<00:04:48.680> of<00:04:48.800> the

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
were in previous Cod's because of the

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.220 
were in previous Cod's because of the
movement<00:04:49.070> but<00:04:49.760> just<00:04:50.120> know<00:04:50.270> that<00:04:50.300> you<00:04:50.570> can<00:04:50.870> try

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
movement but just know that you can try

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.450 
movement but just know that you can try
and<00:04:51.290> launch<00:04:51.470> names<00:04:51.770> through<00:04:51.980> there<00:04:52.100> if<00:04:52.280> you

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
and launch names through there if you

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.980 
and launch names through there if you
want<00:04:52.610> to<00:04:52.700> try<00:04:52.850> for<00:04:53.030> a<00:04:53.060> cool<00:04:53.240> shot<00:04:53.510> with<00:04:53.750> an<00:04:53.840> aid
