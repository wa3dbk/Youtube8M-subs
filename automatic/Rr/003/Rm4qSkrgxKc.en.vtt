00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
and a half and so what I've done is I've

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.679 
and a half and so what I've done is I've
taken<00:02:25.629> a<00:02:26.109> really<00:02:26.499> heavy<00:02:26.709> topic<00:02:27.340> but<00:02:27.849> we've

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:28.689 
taken a really heavy topic but we've

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:31.110 
taken a really heavy topic but we've
made<00:02:28.989> it<00:02:29.109> into<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.319> comedy<00:02:29.920> story<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:30.879> it's<00:02:31.030> the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
made it into a comedy story so it's the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.819 
made it into a comedy story so it's the
story<00:02:31.389> of<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.599> very<00:02:31.930> dysfunctional<00:02:32.230> workplace

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
story of a very dysfunctional workplace

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.280 
story of a very dysfunctional workplace
so<00:02:33.280> toxic<00:02:33.879> they<00:02:34.030> call<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.359> a<00:02:34.389> toxic<00:02:34.900> work<00:02:35.049> yes

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
so toxic they call it a toxic work yes

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.619 
so toxic they call it a toxic work yes
so<00:02:35.469> we've<00:02:35.790> exaggerated<00:02:36.790> all<00:02:37.030> these<00:02:37.209> problems

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
so we've exaggerated all these problems

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.509 
so we've exaggerated all these problems
but<00:02:38.139> what<00:02:38.290> makes<00:02:38.500> this<00:02:38.590> company<00:02:39.040> unique<00:02:39.340> is

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
but what makes this company unique is

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.369 
but what makes this company unique is
the<00:02:39.730> baggage<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.180> people<00:02:40.689> bring<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:41.019> work<00:02:41.139> is

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
the baggage that people bring to work is

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.410 
the baggage that people bring to work is
actually<00:02:41.620> visible<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.609> so<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.180> book<00:02:43.329> is

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
actually visible and so the book is

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.940 
actually visible and so the book is
illustrated<00:02:44.019> there<00:02:44.139> were<00:02:44.200> actually<00:02:44.469> cartoons

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
illustrated there were actually cartoons

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.459 
illustrated there were actually cartoons
in<00:02:45.129> it<00:02:45.250> of<00:02:45.370> people<00:02:46.000> dragging<00:02:46.419> their<00:02:46.810> bags<00:02:47.169> into

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:47.469 
in it of people dragging their bags into

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:49.170 
in it of people dragging their bags into
the<00:02:47.709> office<00:02:48.069> or<00:02:48.219> getting<00:02:48.730> caught<00:02:48.969> in<00:02:49.150> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
the office or getting caught in the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.489 
the office or getting caught in the
revolving<00:02:49.719> door<00:02:49.930> at<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.139> front<00:02:50.349> of<00:02:50.409> the

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:50.499 
revolving door at the front of the

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:52.170 
revolving door at the front of the
building<00:02:50.919> and<00:02:51.099> they're<00:02:51.430> always<00:02:51.609> colliding

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
building and they're always colliding

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.879 
building and they're always colliding
and<00:02:52.299> so<00:02:52.659> it's<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.959> show<00:02:52.989> how<00:02:53.319> baggage

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
and so it's to show how baggage

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.440 
and so it's to show how baggage
interferes<00:02:54.370> with<00:02:54.609> their<00:02:54.730> functioning<00:02:55.329> at

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
interferes with their functioning at

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.539 
interferes with their functioning at
work<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.049> so<00:02:56.439> the<00:02:56.560> whole<00:02:56.709> company<00:02:57.099> is<00:02:57.129> falling

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
work and so the whole company is falling

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.490 
work and so the whole company is falling
apart<00:02:57.669> because<00:02:58.659> they<00:02:59.079> have<00:02:59.169> all<00:02:59.379> these

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
apart because they have all these

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.199 
apart because they have all these
dysfunctional<00:02:59.680> people<00:03:00.189> now<00:03:00.879> this<00:03:01.060> is<00:03:01.180> a

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
dysfunctional people now this is a

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.939 
dysfunctional people now this is a
concept<00:03:01.480> I've<00:03:01.840> been<00:03:02.019> seeing<00:03:02.260> highlighted<00:03:02.829> in

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:02.949 
concept I've been seeing highlighted in

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.740 
concept I've been seeing highlighted in
the<00:03:03.069> media<00:03:03.340> believe<00:03:03.849> it<00:03:03.969> or<00:03:04.030> not<00:03:04.150> in<00:03:04.389> certain

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
the media believe it or not in certain

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.649 
the media believe it or not in certain
articles<00:03:05.349> that<00:03:05.590> cover<00:03:05.799> mental<00:03:06.699> health<00:03:07.000> in<00:03:07.299> the

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
articles that cover mental health in the

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.990 
articles that cover mental health in the
workplace<00:03:07.689> but<00:03:08.379> some<00:03:08.739> workplaces<00:03:09.189> recognize

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
workplace but some workplaces recognize

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.119 
workplace but some workplaces recognize
it<00:03:10.239> and<00:03:10.449> they<00:03:11.049> do<00:03:11.109> the<00:03:11.319> best<00:03:11.349> they<00:03:11.560> can<00:03:11.680> in

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
it and they do the best they can in

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.129 
it and they do the best they can in

assisting the employees and frankly

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.199 
assisting the employees and frankly
others<00:03:14.379> don't<00:03:14.650> I'd<00:03:14.949> like<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.430> hear<00:03:15.730> you<00:03:16.060> have

I'd like to hear an overview of what

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.429 
I'd like to hear an overview of what
that<00:03:18.909> might<00:03:19.090> be<00:03:19.150> before<00:03:19.629> we<00:03:19.750> move<00:03:19.900> on<00:03:20.049> well

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:20.439 
that might be before we move on well

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.530 
that might be before we move on well
these<00:03:20.799> are<00:03:21.010> very<00:03:21.310> shocking<00:03:21.699> statistics<00:03:22.359> we

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
these are very shocking statistics we

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.000 
these are very shocking statistics we
know<00:03:22.750> that<00:03:22.930> ten<00:03:23.230> percent<00:03:23.590> of<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.769> population

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
know that ten percent of the population

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.729 
know that ten percent of the population
in<00:03:24.609> general<00:03:24.639> has<00:03:25.419> a<00:03:25.449> mood<00:03:25.720> disorder<00:03:25.840> eighty

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
in general has a mood disorder eighty

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.830 
in general has a mood disorder eighty
percent<00:03:26.889> are<00:03:27.280> undiagnosed<00:03:27.519> though<00:03:28.419> and<00:03:28.689> those

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
percent are undiagnosed though and those

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.499 
percent are undiagnosed though and those
are<00:03:29.019> I<00:03:29.199> think<00:03:29.680> small<00:03:30.189> conservative<00:03:30.790> estimates

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:31.509 
are I think small conservative estimates

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:34.080 
are I think small conservative estimates
but<00:03:31.959> in<00:03:32.139> the<00:03:32.290> workforce<00:03:32.859> amongst<00:03:33.519> employed

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
but in the workforce amongst employed
