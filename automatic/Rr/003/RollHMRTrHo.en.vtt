00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
it's it's very similar to like like

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.139 
it's it's very similar to like like
having<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.080> clean<00:00:31.349> room<00:00:31.590> like<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:32.759> don't<00:00:32.940> have

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
having a clean room like you don't have

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.850 
having a clean room like you don't have
to<00:00:33.300> have<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> clean<00:00:33.690> room<00:00:33.840> but<00:00:34.230> it's<00:00:34.590> definitely

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
to have a clean room but it's definitely

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.260 
to have a clean room but it's definitely
a<00:00:35.100> lot<00:00:35.579> nicer<00:00:36.210> looking<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.230> lot<00:00:37.469> more<00:00:38.270> fat

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
a lot nicer looking and a lot more fat

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.150 
a lot nicer looking and a lot more fat
more<00:00:39.300> functional<00:00:39.989> when<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.320> clean<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.129> you

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
more functional when it's clean so you

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.860 
more functional when it's clean so you
can<00:00:41.399> get<00:00:41.550> around<00:00:41.790> easier<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.420> look<00:00:42.629> for

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
can get around easier and look for

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.160 
can get around easier and look for
things<00:00:42.960> easier<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:44.100> that's<00:00:44.370> pretty<00:00:44.550> much<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
things easier so that's pretty much the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.569 
things easier so that's pretty much the
logic<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.410> an<00:00:47.160> organized<00:00:47.579> backpack<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:49.579> let's

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
logic in an organized backpack so let's

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.240 
logic in an organized backpack so let's
get<00:00:50.700> into<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:50.940> um<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> first<00:00:52.129> first<00:00:53.129> thing

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
get into it um so the first first thing

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
get into it um so the first first thing

primary weapons and secondary weapons

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:20.580 
primary weapons and secondary weapons
and<00:02:12.910> yeah<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:17.340> yeah<00:02:19.019> this<00:02:20.019> is<00:02:20.170> another<00:02:20.349> way<00:02:20.560> of

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
and yeah so yeah this is another way of

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.880 
and yeah so yeah this is another way of
I<00:02:20.860> like<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.190> I've<00:02:21.730> seen<00:02:21.790> people<00:02:22.629> use<00:02:22.660> um<00:02:23.110> just

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
I like to I've seen people use um just

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.339 
I like to I've seen people use um just
pretend<00:02:24.220> this<00:02:24.370> is<00:02:24.489> a<00:02:25.410> soldier<00:02:26.410> class<00:02:27.010> token<00:02:27.489> um

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
pretend this is a soldier class token um

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.830 
pretend this is a soldier class token um
so<00:02:29.349> you<00:02:29.410> just<00:02:29.890> have<00:02:30.010> your<00:02:30.040> your<00:02:30.730> hats<00:02:31.209> here<00:02:31.599> and

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
so you just have your your hats here and

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.990 
so you just have your your hats here and
then<00:02:31.959> your<00:02:32.110> mix<00:02:32.319> here<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:32.860> then<00:02:32.980> this<00:02:33.340> is<00:02:33.549> the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
then your mix here and then this is the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.539 
then your mix here and then this is the
weapons<00:02:34.720> are<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:34.930> same<00:02:35.170> as<00:02:35.379> scout<00:02:36.160> ones<00:02:36.340> so<00:02:36.900> um

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
weapons are the same as scout ones so um

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.979 
weapons are the same as scout ones so um
another<00:02:39.549> way<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:39.879> organizing<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.599> backpack

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
another way of organizing the backpack

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.350 
another way of organizing the backpack
and<00:02:41.290> by<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:41.980> way<00:02:42.129> don't<00:02:42.310> just<00:02:42.730> organize<00:02:43.120> these

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
and by the way don't just organize these

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.750 
and by the way don't just organize these
all<00:02:43.599> differently<00:02:44.260> just<00:02:44.680> this<00:02:45.160> is<00:02:45.310> just<00:02:45.340> these

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
all differently just this is just these

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.420 
all differently just this is just these
a<00:02:45.790> few<00:02:46.180> examples<00:02:47.019> so<00:02:47.379> um<00:02:48.390> here's<00:02:49.390> some<00:02:50.430> is

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
a few examples so um here's some is

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.710 
a few examples so um here's some is
another<00:02:52.360> way

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
another way

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.259 
another way
so<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.769> slot<00:02:54.099> taken<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.640> class<00:02:54.819> token<00:02:55.090> there

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
so the slot taken the class token there

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.800 
so the slot taken the class token there
and<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:56.260> hats<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:57.040> whisks<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.549> then<00:02:57.849> um<00:02:58.090> the

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
and the hats and whisks and then um the

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.170 
and the hats and whisks and then um the
weapons<00:02:59.170> in<00:02:59.440> this<00:02:59.560> section<00:02:59.799> so<00:03:00.519> that's

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
weapons in this section so that's

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.970 
weapons in this section so that's
another<00:03:01.420> way<00:03:01.599> it's<00:03:02.230> pretty<00:03:02.530> much<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.680> similar

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
another way it's pretty much a similar

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.550 
another way it's pretty much a similar
similar<00:03:03.340> way<00:03:03.579> of<00:03:03.609> this<00:03:03.910> but<00:03:04.329> in<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:04.959> horizontal

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
similar way of this but in a horizontal

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.069 
similar way of this but in a horizontal
fashion

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
fashion

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.780 
fashion
I<00:03:08.079> really<00:03:08.590> don't<00:03:08.680> really<00:03:09.010> like<00:03:09.160> this<00:03:09.310> way<00:03:09.519> but

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
I really don't really like this way but

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.539 
I really don't really like this way but
you<00:03:10.180> know<00:03:10.299> it's<00:03:10.629> up<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:10.840> you<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.310> again<00:03:12.310> this

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
you know it's up to you and again this

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.759 
you know it's up to you and again this
is<00:03:12.849> another<00:03:13.269> way<00:03:13.389> but<00:03:13.450> without<00:03:14.049> class<00:03:14.410> tokens

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
is another way but without class tokens

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.170 
is another way but without class tokens
so<00:03:14.950> you<00:03:15.010> don't<00:03:15.160> really<00:03:15.400> you<00:03:15.760> really<00:03:15.790> don't

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
so you don't really you really don't

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.030 
so you don't really you really don't
need<00:03:16.420> them<00:03:16.630> I<00:03:16.840> find<00:03:17.349> that<00:03:17.440> it<00:03:17.590> just<00:03:17.620> takes<00:03:17.859> up

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
need them I find that it just takes up

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.890 
need them I find that it just takes up
another<00:03:18.370> slot<00:03:18.609> in<00:03:18.760> your<00:03:18.790> backpack<00:03:19.239> see<00:03:19.630> here

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
another slot in your backpack see here

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.140 
another slot in your backpack see here
like<00:03:20.139> usually<00:03:21.099> I<00:03:21.130> have<00:03:21.220> my<00:03:21.280> slot<00:03:21.639> tag<00:03:21.819> in<00:03:21.970> there

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
like usually I have my slot tag in there

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.089 
like usually I have my slot tag in there
and<00:03:22.389> then<00:03:22.540> my<00:03:23.049> items<00:03:23.380> there<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:23.709> I<00:03:23.739> can<00:03:23.919> fit

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
and then my items there so I can fit

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.979 
and then my items there so I can fit
another<00:03:24.190> hat<00:03:24.519> in<00:03:24.669> you<00:03:25.030> can<00:03:25.329> you<00:03:25.540> can<00:03:25.690> have<00:03:25.810> more

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
another hat in you can you can have more

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
hats you don't have to limit yourself to

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.620 
hats you don't have to limit yourself to
nine<00:03:28.959> hats<00:03:29.919> but<00:03:30.250> then<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.180> rest<00:03:31.359> are<00:03:31.540> all

using the same one and for engineer I

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.819 
using the same one and for engineer I
put<00:03:33.970> this<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.419> PDA<00:03:34.810> token<00:03:35.260> in<00:03:35.349> case<00:03:35.530> I<00:03:35.680> get<00:03:35.769> a

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
backpack I have my crates and this one

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.240 
backpack I have my crates and this one
is<00:03:56.820> that<00:03:57.270> in<00:03:58.080> between<00:03:58.260> is<00:03:58.530> just<00:03:58.680> an<00:03:58.980> empty

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
is that in between is just an empty

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.140 
is that in between is just an empty
empty<00:03:59.490> page<00:03:59.850> so<00:04:01.310> yeah<00:04:02.310> that's<00:04:02.850> pretty<00:04:02.940> much

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
empty page so yeah that's pretty much

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.380 
empty page so yeah that's pretty much
how<00:04:03.240> a<00:04:03.870> few<00:04:04.530> ways<00:04:04.710> in<00:04:04.740> which<00:04:05.670> you<00:04:05.880> can<00:04:06.000> organize

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
how a few ways in which you can organize

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.820 
how a few ways in which you can organize
it<00:04:06.660> um<00:04:06.960> I<00:04:07.530> recommend<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:09.030> must<00:04:09.480> get<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:09.990> some

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
it um I recommend you must get a some

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.650 
it um I recommend you must get a some
backpack<00:04:11.220> expanders<00:04:11.730> in<00:04:11.850> order<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.150> do<00:04:12.270> this<00:04:12.420> I

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
backpack expanders in order to do this I

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.120 
backpack expanders in order to do this I
think<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.700> default<00:04:14.700> is<00:04:14.880> six<00:04:15.620> so<00:04:16.620> you<00:04:16.710> can't

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
think the default is six so you can't

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.630 
think the default is six so you can't
really<00:04:17.310> do<00:04:17.550> some<00:04:18.650> intricate<00:04:19.650> organization

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
really do some intricate organization

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.979 
really do some intricate organization
but<00:04:20.790> you<00:04:20.850> can<00:04:20.970> still<00:04:21.120> organize<00:04:21.540> your<00:04:21.660> backpack

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
but you can still organize your backpack

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.350 
but you can still organize your backpack
so<00:04:22.530> I<00:04:22.770> reckon<00:04:23.070> these<00:04:23.220> two<00:04:23.580> pages<00:04:23.910> are<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.240> most

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
so I reckon these two pages are the most

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.910 
so I reckon these two pages are the most
important<00:04:24.930> you<00:04:25.410> don't<00:04:25.500> really<00:04:25.650> have<00:04:25.800> to

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
important you don't really have to

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.490 
important you don't really have to
follow<00:04:26.040> the<00:04:26.250> rest<00:04:26.460> arm<00:04:26.780> it's<00:04:27.780> up<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.050> you<00:04:28.170> but

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
follow the rest arm it's up to you but

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.320 
follow the rest arm it's up to you but
um<00:04:29.100> so<00:04:29.810> yeah<00:04:30.810> um<00:04:31.520> back<00:04:32.520> expanders<00:04:33.120> are<00:04:33.210> only

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
um so yeah um back expanders are only

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.600 
um so yeah um back expanders are only
two<00:04:33.540> Rev<00:04:33.720> so<00:04:33.960> that's<00:04:34.170> that's<00:04:34.500> why<00:04:34.650> I<00:04:34.680> had<00:04:34.920> okay

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
two Rev so that's that's why I had okay

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.120 
two Rev so that's that's why I had okay
um<00:04:35.820> if<00:04:36.390> you<00:04:36.810> want<00:04:37.020> to<00:04:37.080> look<00:04:37.200> at<00:04:37.350> inspiration

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
um if you want to look at inspiration

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.460 
um if you want to look at inspiration
and<00:04:38.340> to<00:04:38.940> see<00:04:39.300> like<00:04:39.540> how<00:04:39.960> other<00:04:40.140> people

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
and to see like how other people

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.080 
and to see like how other people
organize<00:04:40.830> their<00:04:41.010> backpack<00:04:41.310> I<00:04:41.490> recommend

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
organize their backpack I recommend

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.120 
organize their backpack I recommend
going<00:04:42.240> into<00:04:42.510> this<00:04:42.720> top<00:04:43.140> lists<00:04:43.620> area

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
going into this top lists area

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.080 
going into this top lists area
and<00:04:44.220> then<00:04:44.790> just<00:04:45.000> go<00:04:45.120> backpack<00:04:45.630> backpack<00:04:46.350> see

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
and then just go backpack backpack see

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.770 
and then just go backpack backpack see
so<00:04:48.090> whoops<00:04:49.880> sometimes<00:04:50.880> it<00:04:51.030> happens<00:04:51.330> it's<00:04:51.570> just

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
so whoops sometimes it happens it's just

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.180 
so whoops sometimes it happens it's just
be<00:04:51.930> weird<00:04:52.080> so<00:04:52.530> here<00:04:52.710> you<00:04:52.770> can<00:04:52.890> see<00:04:53.040> they're
