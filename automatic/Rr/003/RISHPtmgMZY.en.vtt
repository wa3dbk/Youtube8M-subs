that get few views and i'll put my one

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.509 
that get few views and i'll put my one
up<00:00:12.450> because<00:00:13.170> my<00:00:13.679> experience<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.429> is

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
up because my experience of it is

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.470 
up because my experience of it is
completely<00:00:15.210> different<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.949> Ultimo's<00:00:17.240> so<00:00:18.240> this

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
completely different to Ultimo's so this

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.240
