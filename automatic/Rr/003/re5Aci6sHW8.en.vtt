00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.720 
we were all talking about before
probably<00:06:19.590> had<00:06:19.740> a<00:06:19.770> little<00:06:20.010> bit<00:06:20.160> of<00:06:20.190> dirty<00:06:20.490> air

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
somebody got sideways it's a little hard

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.440 
somebody got sideways it's a little hard
to<00:06:22.860> tell<00:06:23.040> from<00:06:23.130> our<00:06:23.250> picture<00:06:23.639> which<00:06:24.120> came

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
to tell from our picture which came

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.240 
to tell from our picture which came
first<00:06:24.780> as<00:06:25.020> far<00:06:25.290> as<00:06:25.320> the<00:06:25.470> cars<00:06:25.680> going<00:06:25.889> sideways

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
first as far as the cars going sideways

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.890 
first as far as the cars going sideways
there<00:06:26.760> but<00:06:26.940> they<00:06:27.060> obviously<00:06:27.180> had<00:06:27.690> some

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
there but they obviously had some

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.320 
there but they obviously had some
contact<00:06:28.169> it's<00:06:28.860> called<00:06:29.040> a<00:06:29.160> panel<00:06:29.760> Danny's<00:06:30.090> car

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
contact it's called a panel Danny's car

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.590 
contact it's called a panel Danny's car
Pancho's<00:06:31.260> car<00:06:31.560> it's<00:06:32.040> a<00:06:32.280> shame<00:06:32.580> to<00:06:33.000> to<00:06:33.419> have

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
Pancho's car it's a shame to to have

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.240 
Pancho's car it's a shame to to have
something<00:06:33.960> happen<00:06:34.110> this<00:06:34.410> early<00:06:34.620> but<00:06:34.800> I<00:06:34.950> think

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
something happen this early but I think

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.650 
something happen this early but I think
all<00:06:35.400> the<00:06:35.550> drivers<00:06:35.790> were<00:06:36.060> aware<00:06:36.330> of<00:06:36.389> it

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
all the drivers were aware of it

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.240 
all the drivers were aware of it
originally<00:06:37.169> so<00:06:37.530> I<00:06:37.590> think<00:06:37.860> they<00:06:37.979> were<00:06:38.040> trying

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250 
originally so I think they were trying

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.510 
originally so I think they were trying
to<00:06:38.490> be<00:06:38.610> careful<00:06:39.000> in<00:06:39.060> spite<00:06:39.300> of<00:06:39.330> what<00:06:39.570> we<00:06:39.720> saw<00:06:40.520> we

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
to be careful in spite of what we saw we

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.640 
to be careful in spite of what we saw we
will<00:06:41.729> be<00:06:41.880> back<00:06:41.910> to<00:06:42.600> sum<00:06:42.900> this<00:06:43.110> up<00:06:43.169> and

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
will be back to sum this up and

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.070 
will be back to sum this up and
hopefully<00:06:43.889> start<00:06:44.400> the<00:06:44.550> race<00:06:44.700> again<00:06:45.180> right

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
hopefully start the race again right

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.140 
hopefully start the race again right
