00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.720
 the more foam our pasta generates 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.029
 of the best teeth will be that is 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.129
 true or not and also depends on what 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.900
 let's call good we have repeated many 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.730
 times what will clean our 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.799
 mouth is the toothbrush that was 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.900
 like a broom I really would not have 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.120
 why putting toothpaste is what 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.840
 I will clean the brush they have 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.190
 a sow a little bit this will clean if 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.800
 I want to give some kind of product 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.160
 add in hygiene I can do it and that's 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.110
 the pasta the pasta is a boat that 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.430
 normally the stuffing and then when 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.050
 the manufacturer wants you to foam 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.110
 like other detergents adds certain 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.310
 products is the cheapest thing so that 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.480
 when I want to fill it with something 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.790
 cheap I put a lot of product that makes 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.200
 foam but it's not true and another thing that 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.239
 they cheat us a little food is 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.010
 better to make less foam is that 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.010
 it is better to have a good paste with fluoride 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.750
 what it is that those who are watching do not 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.060
 You should know that with this pasta 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.770
 I have enough in the ad they make me 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.960
 put side by side for me to squeeze 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.040
 and spend that yes that is expensive then 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.040
 let's see how much more 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:10.220
 exactly like a pea 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.660
 that is the size probably a 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.180
 pea with this well yes to a patient 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.800
 I want to give fluorine because I add fluorine 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.030
 For example, this is a paste that 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.860
 I have taken from the clinic because it is for 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.780
 have a certain sensation of freshness 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.570
 perfect if I what I look for the patient 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.520
 there is specific pasta nowadays that 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.990
 take many medications the gum or the 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.850
 dry mouth a lot because you're putting a 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.980
 paste for dry mouth just like 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.260
 You can use a moisturizer because 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.280
 when the product for the medicine at 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.770
 beginning need to talk before 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.330
 of certain mouth breaths that 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.400
 they make me breathe for something that dries 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.350
 mouth that pasta will help me as 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.300
 will use is a moisturizer there are pastes 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.190
 for bad breath there are pastes for 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.350
 combat some dental sensitivity is 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.150
 say the dentist in this case uses 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.580
 the paste to apply to the patient something 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.550
 then what exactly foams 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.840
 the only thing that will bring us benefits 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.970
 We used things done 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.470
 I can seem clean more exactly from 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.929
 done this that is not a paste is a gel 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.550
 this makes very little foam but it is more 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.830
 adhesive is going to stick better 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.050
 when I also want the pasta 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.700
 be long in the mouth and stick 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.620
 it's good to use a pretty single gel 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.620
 then very little foam in this case
