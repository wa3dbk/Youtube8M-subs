00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
books i think it's really effective and

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.190 
books i think it's really effective and
way<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.000> communicates<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.540> kids<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.930> think<00:01:31.110> it's

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
way it communicates of kids I think it's

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.469 
way it communicates of kids I think it's
really<00:01:31.500> clear<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.189> core<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.700> book<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
really clear the core of the book the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.929 
really clear the core of the book the
idea<00:01:33.900> really<00:01:34.110> comes<00:01:34.409> from<00:01:34.670> discovering<00:01:35.670> where

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
idea really comes from discovering where

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.270 
idea really comes from discovering where
food<00:01:36.240> comes<00:01:36.270> from<00:01:36.720> through<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> eyes<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.189> a

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
food comes from through the eyes of a

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.550 
food comes from through the eyes of a
six-year-old<00:01:38.579> right<00:01:39.299> who<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.509> think<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
six-year-old right who I think is is the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.810 
six-year-old right who I think is is the
audience<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:40.979> should<00:01:41.189> be<00:01:41.310> talking<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.790> you

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
audience we should be talking to you

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.730 
audience we should be talking to you
right<00:01:41.880> now<00:01:42.060> about<00:01:42.390> where<00:01:43.170> food<00:01:43.439> comes<00:01:43.470> from

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
right now about where food comes from

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.499 
right now about where food comes from
three<00:01:43.950> recipes<00:01:44.130> right<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> more<00:01:45.180> he<00:01:45.299> cooks

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
three recipes right so the more he cooks

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.450 
three recipes right so the more he cooks
the<00:01:45.659> more<00:01:45.810> he<00:01:45.869> discovers<00:01:46.259> about<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.100> roots<00:01:47.310> of

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
the more he discovers about the roots of

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.190 
the more he discovers about the roots of
food<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:47.970> things<00:01:48.299> don't<00:01:48.540> just<00:01:48.659> come<00:01:48.990> from<00:01:49.049> a

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
food so things don't just come from a

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.260 
food so things don't just come from a
grocery<00:01:49.409> store<00:01:49.740> things<00:01:50.250> come<00:01:50.579> from<00:01:50.759> farms

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
grocery store things come from farms

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.300 
grocery store things come from farms
things<00:01:51.540> come<00:01:51.720> from<00:01:51.840> orchards<00:01:52.380> things<00:01:53.130> come

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
things come from orchards things come

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.069 
things come from orchards things come
out<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.490> water<00:01:53.759> things<00:01:54.210> come<00:01:54.420> from<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.960> know

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
out of water things come from you know

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.469 
out of water things come from you know
eggs<00:01:55.799> come<00:01:56.100> from<00:01:56.130> chickens<00:01:56.700> not<00:01:56.969> just<00:01:57.240> sort<00:01:57.390> of

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
eggs come from chickens not just sort of

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.840 
eggs come from chickens not just sort of
a<00:01:57.630> styrofoam<00:01:58.469> carton<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.790> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
a styrofoam carton in the in the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.210 
a styrofoam carton in the in the
refrigerator<00:02:00.360> section<00:02:00.479> at<00:02:00.719> grocery

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
refrigerator section at grocery

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.830 
refrigerator section at grocery
so<00:02:01.430> it<00:02:01.490> was<00:02:01.580> very<00:02:01.640> important<00:02:02.360> for<00:02:02.510> us<00:02:02.810> to

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
so it was very important for us to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.170 
so it was very important for us to
create<00:02:03.140> a<00:02:03.230> book<00:02:03.440> that<00:02:03.920> I<00:02:04.310> think<00:02:04.640> really<00:02:04.670> spoke

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
create a book that I think really spoke

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.460 
create a book that I think really spoke
to<00:02:05.210> children<00:02:05.600> spoke<00:02:05.900> to<00:02:06.020> parents<00:02:06.260> as<00:02:06.440> well

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
to children spoke to parents as well

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.889 
to children spoke to parents as well
something<00:02:07.220> that<00:02:07.340> was<00:02:07.430> funny<00:02:07.720> something<00:02:08.720> that

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
something that was funny something that

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.570 
something that was funny something that
made<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.440> point<00:02:09.740> it<00:02:09.950> something<00:02:10.130> that<00:02:10.160> kids

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
made a point it something that kids

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.820 
made a point it something that kids
could<00:02:10.729> really<00:02:11.240> really<00:02:11.390> relate<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.110> my

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
could really really relate to and my

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.580 
could really really relate to and my
children<00:02:13.400> asked<00:02:13.820> for<00:02:14.270> this<00:02:14.480> book<00:02:14.810> every
