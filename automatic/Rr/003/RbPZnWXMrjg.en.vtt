of<00:03:53.540> so<00:03:53.810> they<00:03:53.959> can<00:03:54.680> walk<00:03:54.920> in<00:03:55.209> get<00:03:56.290> close<00:03:57.290> upon<00:03:57.560> it

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
of so they can walk in get close upon it

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.680 
of so they can walk in get close upon it
so<00:03:59.530> that<00:04:00.530> was<00:04:00.680> pretty<00:04:00.950> mangled<00:04:01.310> unboxing<00:04:02.150> but

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
so that was pretty mangled unboxing but

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.680 
so that was pretty mangled unboxing but
as<00:04:03.680> I'm<00:04:03.890> sure<00:04:03.920> you<00:04:04.220> can<00:04:04.370> understand<00:04:04.940> so<00:04:05.510> but

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
as I'm sure you can understand so but

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.170 
as I'm sure you can understand so but

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
difficult for me so that was the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.599 
difficult for me so that was the
unboxing<00:04:08.299> of<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:08.810> apple<00:04:09.140> time<00:04:09.680> capsule<00:04:09.739> I'm

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609
