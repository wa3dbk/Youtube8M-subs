only gonna pick one but I have picked
two<00:01:46.770> out<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.220> many<00:01:47.460> many<00:01:47.759> sloth<00:01:48.149> shots

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
two out of the many many sloth shots

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.609 
two out of the many many sloth shots
that<00:01:48.630> people<00:01:48.899> ended<00:01:49.140> up<00:01:49.229> hitting<00:01:49.380> and

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that people ended up hitting and

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.410 
that people ended up hitting and
submitting<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.130> decided<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.729> pick<00:01:50.880> two<00:01:51.180> winners

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
submitting I decided to pick two winners

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.450 
submitting I decided to pick two winners
because<00:01:52.110> these<00:01:52.409> two<00:01:52.649> winners<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> two

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
because these two winners have the two

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.069

crazy<00:01:53.850> shots<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.570> my<00:01:54.630> opinion<00:01:54.720> they're

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
crazy shots and in my opinion they're

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.149 
crazy shots and in my opinion they're
equally<00:01:55.530> as<00:01:55.710> crazy

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159
