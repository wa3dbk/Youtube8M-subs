00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.620
 hello my name is their glory 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.490
 bergamot and with you a video on gagadget.com 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.480
 and today we have in the review here such 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.930
 still sevan flagship smartphone and sisi 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.090
 year 2013 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.660
 Now let's talk about his appearance 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.369
 worth saying that he has 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.249
 aluminum body is very thin 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.619
 Corps I really liked and si si van 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:34.829
 and your so this body 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.149
 even thinner very cool stuff here 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.420
 if you look closer if you look closer 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.440
 that's it even edging with light all the same 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.359
 floods heavily 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.910
 here it is edging it is made of very 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:52.079
 good matte plastic from which 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.390
 Sevan x flagship 2012 was made 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.210
 here is this part of aluminum naturally 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.750
 a cover is not removable and here you can 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.910
 even try and see the screen looks 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:09.780
 concave like in a nexus itself even 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:13.170
 volume key it is done so with 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.810
 swept here you see yes reminds something 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.610
 and nipples and dan rolls that is such 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.540
 metal texture on her nice 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.570
 very push besides move pretty 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.130
 large given the size and 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.360
 the keys for the move seem to be here 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.410
 literally half a millimeter 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.170
 same small power button but with 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.180
 This despite the fact that this does not seem that 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.300
 it actually merges with the body on 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.940
 small press, and it has built-in 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.340
 how much do I understand the infrared sensor 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.020
 thanks to which the device can 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.420
 turn remote 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.760
 control for the technology is true and he already 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.030
 learn a little bit here you see 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.980
 headphone jack and on it too 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.080
 see how thin the body is that its 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:04.890
 I had to shift the edge here like this 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.190
 we have a table for a retractable card 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.629
 microsim and pin hole to 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.280
 push it out there is a micro usb connector 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.420
 which is somehow flipped and 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.299
 shifted to the side 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.230
 it is usually centered and turned 180 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.989
 degrees potash 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.330
 to the current situation there is a microphone by the way 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:28.530
 here is the second microphone for clipping 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:32.030
 external noise and actually speaking 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.980
 this appearance probably ends 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.080
 there is naturally a camera here 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.480
 Ultrapixel 4 technology is used 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.230
 megapixel sensor has an LED 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.540
 backlight 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.720
 very neat machine is very cool 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.480
 Looks in hand very bright screen on 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.480
 video of course not see this but fouls 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.470
 wait of course works in all its glory 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.470
 just great
