00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:03.140
 greet you dear friends 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.880
 sorry for so long 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.270
 no hits this is due to the identification 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.490
 and eliminating a large number 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.940
 baku and omissions 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.129
 introduced new version of the game 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.349
 unfortunately say specifically for new 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.130
 the game module had nothing 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.140
 since it has long been needed specifics on 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.089
 their implementation but repeats 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:22.969
 that both rhythm and things like that long ago 

00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:24.759
 done and waiting for completion 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.509
 it would be foolish 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.669
 I was really looking forward to the moment when I could 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:30.769
 name exact dates and sequence 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.010
 the emergence of new gaming modules 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.010
 and today and finally can do it 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.590
 so today finished 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.740
 is already above aston server 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.030
 game modules hunting and fairs 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.670
 the hunt is the following 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.140
 she will be held 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.040
 in the territories of the principalities 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.850
 for this book must acquire 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.130
 hunting grounds 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.350
 they can be purchased 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.840
 unlimited gold 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.080
 coins and gems 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.020
 I want to emphasize that for gems 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.270
 their acquisition will be much more 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.680
 profitable 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.940
 princes will be able to evict their forests 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.619
 the beast 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.709
 buying here gold coins for everyone 

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:15.480

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.920
 for this we will use charges 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.600
 type of tranquilizers 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.820

 what kind of bribe 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.940
 I remember the example of a bunch of berries 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.940
 bear keg of honey 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.690
 these forest gifts hunters will be able to 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.310
 serve at the fair i would feed my

 eating it and picking up the right amount 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.530
 units 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.230

 game site after launching this 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.190
 game module 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.609
 for each beast 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:13.939
 will be his kind of gun from behind 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.089

 we expect two days 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.609
 now I want to tell the curb 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.669
 promising interesting modules 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:41.899
 town planning 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:43.449
 as you notice valuable editions 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:45.260
 principality grew strongly 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.570
 it's caused by the soon appearance of it 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.909
 game module 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.980
 today and with programmers already 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.980
 started work 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.260
 on programming all logic and think up 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.700
 the end of the week we will finish it laid out on 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.540
 search engine and cat yan 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.199
 identify tank defects 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:02.129
 after that he will appear in combat 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.159
 server 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.359
 this module 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.689
 gives a strong development 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.689
 opportunity for players to build on the territory 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.419
 principalities of settlement 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.249
 develop their village force cities 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:16.939
 build on site 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:18.609
 different settlements 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.259
 manufacturing enterprise 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:22.159
 By the way I want to say that the amount 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:24.359
 enterprises will grow along the way 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.590
 development of this 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.569
 played module 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.819
 recruit their businesses 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:30.860
 workers 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.389
 which will produce a resource 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.659
 only resident in that or 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:37.010
 other settlement 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.819
 will be able to work in enterprises 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.079
 of this settlement 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.699
 accordingly we will strongly affect 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.669
 real estate division 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:45.169
 property owner will be able to 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.339
 rent out your life 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:49.319

 we get smooth gaming attachments 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.139
 parts such as robbery theft 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.260
 secret police 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.999
 prison 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:58.010
 building gifts reproaches the walls 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.659
 and many many others 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:01.749
 all these new buildings will be built 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:03.269
 princes in each 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.369
 princedoms 

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.239
 well, residents will be able to use 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.579
 services of these buildings 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.650
 in town planning maize and will appear 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.709
 their securities of the principality 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.139
 they will be able to regulate the issue 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.189
 dividends will depend on the building 

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:21.239
 principality cities today 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.449
 villages 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.740
 settlements and other buildings 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.280
 dear friends, I beg you after that 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.720
 the output of this game module unsubscribe and 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.090
 please your thoughts and ideas for its development 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.340
 in different directions 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.800
 we all build and create 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.889
 without your ideas will be very difficult 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.629
 next what I would like 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:45.110
 stop this is an ordinary application 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.139
 gold 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.509
 the era of the principality 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.039
 this application is social 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.180
 directivity 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.900
 it will be possible to create princedoms 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.520
 create clones 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.940
 build businesses 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.249

 and fight with other principalities 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:08.409
 this application must be finished on the 17th 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:09.189
 numbers 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:11.099
 we, by analogy, rolled him over 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.099
 Aston server and vkontakte posted 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.500
 modulo war as i said earlier long ago 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.280
 all is ready 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.510
 both in terms of layout and in terms of algorithms 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.470
 only amended to reflect 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.410

 there will be common enemies and princes will be able 

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:31.270
 exchange not only war except each 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.240
 friend but also against common enemy 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.129
 war of battle led honor anya 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:37.839
 begin after work is finished with 

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:39.249
 hunting and fair 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:40.979
 that is, in free hands 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.979
 we will give enter we go military 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.330
 The following is what I want to tell who 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.060
 that very soon 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.639
 we see the entertainment section 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.610
 sporty way about the golden fund 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.849
 in it you can bet on 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:57.460
 defense number of real sports 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.860
 tournaments and matches 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.539

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:02.169
 coins 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.639
 I think it will be very thin flattering for 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:05.749
 all of us 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:08.580

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.250
 oblige some technical points 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.620
 I think within a week and a half we 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.789
 we can finish all the work therefore 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:18.770

 Now I will lay out 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.909
 appeal before each new game 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:30.110

 what we finally 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.880
 finished fighting the bases remained 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.830
 of course, some small courses 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.559
 washington and omissions 

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:41.999
 which we felt 

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:44.129
 completed but by and large
