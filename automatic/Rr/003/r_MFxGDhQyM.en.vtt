00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.940
 I am completely populated by jesus he came back to life to my house 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.280
 but when you return to the house everything will remain the same 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:14.199
 the difficulties will be the same as the family at work in the neighborhood 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.439
 the intriguers will continue to deliver and the gossipers mumbling everything will follow 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.259
 same 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.650
 the only ones that have to be different solutions 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.829
 and the only difference is that you are no longer you, you, Jesus. 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.159
 His eyes are the eyes of Jesus 

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.820
 his thought is the thought of Jesus 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.010
 Your feelings are the feelings of Jesus and attention brothers 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.010
 here we turn the sheet of prayer and life workshop 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.350
 in the workshop is divided into two parts until now and from this moment 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.110
 from this session 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.670
 everything we said and will say we will reduce it to a little question 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.640
 would Jesus be in my place 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.659
 if we did not do anything other than take this question into the mind and into 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.730
 the heart as a sacred obsession 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.430
 and formulate it and any circumstance emergency eventuality situation or 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.320
 conflict 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.470
 would Jesus be in my place 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.910
 we would be before a program of accelerated sanctification cristicchi 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:31.170
 sing the secret is this the effectiveness of a pedagogy is in its simplicity and 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.880
 this question and tabarca the whole life from now until death 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.079
 how would Jesus look at this unpleasant person 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.020
 how would Jesus react to this terrible news kent and day jesus and 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.369
 Say what they told me Jesus would do and do what they did to me 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.290
 how jesus would behave and the conflict in which bishop would be seen and have me 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.690
 how would you visit this troubled family what words would you say to this 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.780
 downcast person 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.150
 so from today they did nothing but apply this question at every moment of 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.090
 his life 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.490
 I guarantee that at the end of two years they would not know themselves 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.199
 they would have changed so much 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:20.149
 they would also have the maximum satisfaction that can be had in this 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:21.359
 world 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.939
 to overcome their own limits 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.279
 the one of surpassing also joseph
