00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello everyone we are today 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.950
 for a new tutorial that you 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.980
 explain how to solve the problem 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.830
 of this black screen actually that you have 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.420
 had followed one of my videos or so 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.980
 when you tried to change to 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.809
 touch a little to the eagle point exhibitors 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.730
 and that you made a false 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.029
 manipulation between them and that this screen 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.359
 black 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.230
 so that's pretty problematic and for 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.430
 solve this problem 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.689
 sir him in the same conditions 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.890
 that you and I will show you this 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.359
 what to do to solve this 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.529
 problem 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.480
 so the first thing to do is to 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.760
 start the task manager a 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.469
 small control alt delete and you start 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.170
 the first thing really is to go 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:45.629
 in the registry you type files 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.399
 again executed regis said here he was 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.870
 enter 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.980
 it's the first thing to really do 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.980
 mettewie and you will go in 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:04.549
 which local machine software microsoft 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.340
 go down windows nt skull towards sean 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.840
 quinn logo click win logo 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.340
 you go in shell see halak 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.140
 the scale you click on it and you 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.060
 look who well exploit point there there 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.619
 explore it's not going we want a 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.390
 point exploit are you done right click 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.520
 modified explore ace points and you 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.640
 put ok here the value is changed 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.400
 you can close that it's set it's 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.290
 then does the second thing you 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.650
 go do it's start internet 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.439
 explore you type explore point 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.270
 hayes man was ok and then I'm going 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.630
 look for the right explore point this is 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.049
 very simple so there you wait for that 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.049
 opens 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.290
 unfortunately we have 4 net to explore and 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.530
 I'm really sorry not really the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.979
 choice 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.770
 so we will go get my video 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.770
 could take the links and risk of 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.770
 exchange 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:14.160
 hop to send it on youtube directly 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:19.590
 here are some worries of letters up and we're going 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:22.110
 recover the links very important then 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.880
 this is the pub we do not care we want 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.680
 just the links so here I put 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.330
 several links and I notice that 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.790
 does some people find it wrong in 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.700
 the links simply take the 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.920
 bad link so what to do and 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.810
 it is simply to take the good 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.680
 if you have a 32- bit version 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.830
 Cevennes 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.380
 then you take a feat for 32 8 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.180
 cm versus 4 8 for a rare feat for 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.709
 a conduct of the sp1 version the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.450
 version pass father I do not know if that 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.750
 actually changes but I preferred 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.459
 to put 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.520
 I preferred to explore not know 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.800
 hope to install it or not I never 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.610
 tested me i know that the c1 explore 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.790
 blood and sperm I will take this link 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:06.630
 nevertheless before or emotional task I 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.519
 I'll check if the version is 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.580
 so maybe you'll get yourself 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.380
 you will not have it I know that the 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.100
 jelly and I'll be able to go in the 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.549
 task Manager 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.780
 that's it works so it's for 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.769
 some do not work for others 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.299
 walk it works 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.190
 so it's not a big deal if it works 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.570
 not at home it's just for those who 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.540
 do not know at all that we have stamped their 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.580
 version you have of a system and you 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.640
 look at the age a windows 7 first 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.940
 without sp 1 since it is not marked in 32 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.489
 bit 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.900
 that's all you need to know 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.190
 you have passage I hope you 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.450
 know a little bit your andy otherwise you 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.160
 all can be tested is no 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.450
 worry so I take the link 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.430
 directly open him and I was charged 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.780
 the ex power point 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:54.180
 I am given launay director of aude 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.830
 there they give me queues at and on 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.500
 start again because it will be called 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.100
 internet explorer so here is to put you 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.730
 save you are going to dance windows 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.560
 you will go down or not 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.810
 esportsfrance you do 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:17.660
 ic right property security you have 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:21.030
 clicked on advanced owner said 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:26.820
 yes and in fact you clicked on 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:29.450
 administration or but you're ok ok ok 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.970
 you remake it right property 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.570
 security you clicked on 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:39.030
 directors because me if he has 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:40.110
 already chosen said ok she had in 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.990
 a stratum hours you check that everything 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.850
 is checked crowd control here once 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.680
 that everything is checked it's good you 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.910
 can simply click on save 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.800
 is this so it did not work it's 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.139
 normal is wait for rare text that does not 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.340
 never walk the first time there must 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.830
 not to worry or just 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.770
 we just start the manipulation but 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.540
 said yes and then it works so still a 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.580
 little bug that I advise you 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.410
 to use chrome with the extension with 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:12.210
 the block eyes plugin 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:14.640
 she will put you in continuous yes and 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.680
 that's it's copy you can close 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.630
 you can close you can close 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.110
 in five new you put explore point 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:27.840
 ends 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:31.860
 you type magic hockey happened here 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.070
 simply so if you do not know 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.870
 at all if it's a spa or instinct 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.500
 1.3224 beach what does it cost you 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.810
 to test them 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.370
 what are there four links test 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.449
 every link you will fall 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.250
 normally you know right away 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.080
 it's a 32 24 goals i think you 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.220
 know and if you've made any updates to 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.820
 day or not if you're not sure it's 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.380
 not important 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.940
 first try the sp1 I advise 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.919
 because that's the same thing 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.110
 more prevalent and if you 6 it works 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.710
 not you try the other one here that's it 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.940
 the method to repair your windows 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.070
 me that's what I used is this 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.510
 that I use in my videos so for 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.229
 this black screen tale that's how it 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.370
 must solve it 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:07.290
 then nothing and said I was not 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.850
 very clear about explanations 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.040
 I hope I have been a little clearer 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.650
 for those for whom it did not work 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.120
 here on this I wish you a good 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.150
 day do not hesitate a good afternoon 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.139
 rather feel free to comment 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.700
 it's thanks to the comments that I could 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.200
 make this new video that will 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:26.430
 help several people I think 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.300
 do not hesitate to comment and like this 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.130
 6th video 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.889
 Finally, I would not like to postpone 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:34.289
 never commented to share for those 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.090
 who have the same problem as you because 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:38.880
 that if you like and you share 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.380
 videos it will have been will be more referenced 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.760
 in fact as long as it will make me more of a view 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.349
 but it's not the gain it's just that 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.830
 it will help more people this is it 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:49.050
 for that so I wish you a good 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.740
 afternoon I say hi to all and 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.740
 take care of yourself
