00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.450 
develop and I created the first leak
Buster<00:02:31.780> which<00:02:32.020> equated<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.560> roughly<00:02:33.130> what<00:02:33.340> is

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
Buster which equated to roughly what is

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.020 
Buster which equated to roughly what is
now<00:02:33.730> steps<00:02:34.300> two<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.870> three<00:02:34.990> and<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:36.760> current

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
now steps two and three and this current

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.780 
now steps two and three and this current
version<00:02:37.240> of<00:02:37.420> leak<00:02:37.570> Buster<00:02:37.930> this<00:02:38.770> is<00:02:38.920> why<00:02:39.100> some

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
version of leak Buster this is why some

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.130 
version of leak Buster this is why some
of<00:02:39.820> you<00:02:39.970> may<00:02:40.120> have<00:02:40.210> heard<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.450> leak<00:02:40.720> Buster

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
of you may have heard that leak Buster

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.730 
of you may have heard that leak Buster
is<00:02:41.320> just<00:02:41.770> stat<00:02:42.490> range<00:02:42.730> analysis<00:02:43.300> which<00:02:43.840> is<00:02:44.290> not

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
is just stat range analysis which is not

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.790 
is just stat range analysis which is not
true<00:02:44.950> at<00:02:45.010> all<00:02:45.330> they<00:02:46.330> either<00:02:46.540> are<00:02:46.800> talking

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
true at all they either are talking

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.110 
true at all they either are talking
about<00:02:47.890> some<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.310> first<00:02:48.580> generation<00:02:49.060> of

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
about some of the first generation of

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.880 
about some of the first generation of
leak<00:02:49.300> Buster<00:02:49.750> or<00:02:49.960> haven't<00:02:50.440> really<00:02:50.740> looked

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
leak Buster or haven't really looked

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.590 
leak Buster or haven't really looked
beyond<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.490> trial<00:02:51.760> of<00:02:51.850> leak<00:02:52.030> buster

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
beyond the trial of leak buster

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.140 
beyond the trial of leak buster
so<00:02:53.230> League<00:02:53.890> Buster<00:02:54.070> can<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.430> continue<00:02:55.030> to

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
so League Buster can you continue to

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.170 
so League Buster can you continue to
involve<00:02:55.680> let's<00:02:56.680> now<00:02:56.860> become<00:02:57.220> an<00:02:57.580> incredible

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
involve let's now become an incredible

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.210 
involve let's now become an incredible
engine<00:02:58.600> of<00:02:58.720> automated<00:02:59.260> database<00:02:59.380> analysis

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
engine of automated database analysis

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.460 
engine of automated database analysis
and<00:03:00.550> I'd<00:03:00.730> say<00:03:00.940> it<00:03:01.090> would<00:03:01.270> rival<00:03:01.480> most<00:03:02.170> poker

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
and I'd say it would rival most poker

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.250 
and I'd say it would rival most poker
coaches<00:03:02.950> on<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.160> market<00:03:03.459> today<00:03:04.230> ideally<00:03:05.230> I

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
coaches on the market today ideally I

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.350 
coaches on the market today ideally I
think<00:03:05.350> poker<00:03:05.739> coaching<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.430> leak<00:03:06.970> buster

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
think poker coaching and leak buster

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.199 
think poker coaching and leak buster
make<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:08.140> deadliest<00:03:08.620> combination<00:03:09.310> however

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
make the deadliest combination however

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.300 
make the deadliest combination however
for<00:03:10.480> some<00:03:10.600> players<00:03:10.870> leak<00:03:11.290> Buster<00:03:11.650> may<00:03:11.920> be<00:03:11.980> all

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
for some players leak Buster may be all
