00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
so before we want in the robot butt size

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.509 
so before we want in the robot butt size
comparison<00:00:28.170> then<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:28.890> he<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.099> next<00:00:29.340> to

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
comparison then here he is next to

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.170 
comparison then here he is next to
bumblebee<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.119> course<00:00:31.460> movie<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.579> bigger

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
bumblebee of course movie is a bigger

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.420 
bumblebee of course movie is a bigger
car<00:00:35.719> or<00:00:36.719> just<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.380> car<00:00:37.649> but<00:00:38.840> all<00:00:39.840> ingles

car or just that car but all ingles
bumblebee<00:00:41.430> that's<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:42.030> little<00:00:42.450> better<00:00:42.540> but

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
bumblebee that's a little better but

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.360 
bumblebee that's a little better but
that's<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.510> my<00:00:45.539> opinion<00:00:45.980> depends<00:00:46.980> what<00:00:47.129> type

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
that's in my opinion depends what type

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.810 
that's in my opinion depends what type
of<00:00:47.399> are<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.570> slim<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.350> light

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
of are you like you like slim and light

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.029 
of are you like you like slim and light
battery<00:00:50.820> like<00:00:51.120> big<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:51.780> bulky<00:00:52.410> muscle

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
battery like big in like bulky muscle

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.660 
battery like big in like bulky muscle
cars<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.239> time<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:56.129> then<00:00:56.370> it's<00:00:56.520> about

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
cars like the time and then it's about

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.510 
cars like the time and then it's about
it<00:00:57.600> for<00:00:57.989> size<00:00:58.199> comparisons<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.430> mode

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
it for size comparisons in this mode

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.070 
it for size comparisons in this mode
transform<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:03.300> want<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.739> release<00:01:04.739> his<00:01:06.080> face

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
transform you want to release his face

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.330 
transform you want to release his face
and<00:01:07.439> angle<00:01:08.119> is<00:01:09.119> windows<00:01:09.659> up

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
and angle is windows up

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.709 
and angle is windows up
so<00:01:13.340> you<00:01:14.340> want<00:01:14.549> up<00:01:14.700> flip<00:01:15.299> around<00:01:16.490> these<00:01:17.509> is<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
so you want up flip around these is the

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.249 
so you want up flip around these is the
legs<00:01:18.929> will<00:01:19.710> become<00:01:20.189> these<00:01:20.340> legs<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.259> then

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
legs will become these legs and then

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.469 
legs will become these legs and then
that<00:01:23.009> fun<00:01:23.280> will<00:01:23.399> be<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> only<00:01:23.729> piece<00:01:24.119> yet<00:01:24.359> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
that fun will be the only piece yet the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.080 
that fun will be the only piece yet the
move<00:01:24.659> take<00:01:25.289> off<00:01:25.469> his<00:01:25.859> feet<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.819> you<00:01:26.909> have<00:01:27.000> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
move take off his feet and you have to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.319 
move take off his feet and you have to
face<00:01:27.240> them<00:01:27.420> forward<00:01:28.939> so<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:29.969> can<00:01:30.060> actually

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
face them forward so we can actually

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.380 
face them forward so we can actually
stand<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:33.360> then<00:01:33.780> Angela's<00:01:35.149> pieces<00:01:36.149> like<00:01:36.359> that

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
stand and then Angela's pieces like that

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:46.350 
stand and then Angela's pieces like that
out<00:01:39.109> and<00:01:41.539> there<00:01:42.539> you<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:42.780> it

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.650 

straighten<00:01:47.170> out<00:01:47.290> everything<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:48.360> there<00:01:49.360> is

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
straighten out everything and there is

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:57.240 
straighten out everything and there is
knockout<00:01:52.380> now<00:01:53.380> you<00:01:53.470> can<00:01:53.920> fold<00:01:54.490> back<00:01:56.250> these

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
knockout now you can fold back these

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.420 
knockout now you can fold back these
things<00:01:57.640> but<00:01:57.970> his<00:01:58.690> whole<00:01:59.020> head<00:01:59.470> like

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
things but his whole head like

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.510 
things but his whole head like
arrangement<00:02:01.090> just<00:02:01.270> wants<00:02:01.480> to<00:02:01.570> pop<00:02:01.780> off<00:02:02.520> you

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
arrangement just wants to pop off you

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.910 
arrangement just wants to pop off you
can<00:02:03.729> push<00:02:04.150> those<00:02:04.420> back<00:02:04.690> and<00:02:04.990> like<00:02:05.140> angle<00:02:05.740> these

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
can push those back and like angle these

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.980 
can push those back and like angle these
up<00:02:06.330> like<00:02:07.330> that<00:02:07.600> just<00:02:09.300> because<00:02:10.300> i<00:02:10.390> did<00:02:10.600> i'm<00:02:10.780> just

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
up like that just because i did i'm just

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.510 
up like that just because i did i'm just
going<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.170> leave<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.410> like<00:02:11.710> that<00:02:11.740> so<00:02:14.400> then<00:02:15.400> you

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
going to leave it like that so then you

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.400 
going to leave it like that so then you
could<00:02:15.700> like<00:02:15.820> angle<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.420> back<00:02:16.600> behind<00:02:17.140> his

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
could like angle and back behind his

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.920 
could like angle and back behind his
head<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:18.550> that<00:02:18.580> what's<00:02:18.910> neat<00:02:19.300> i<00:02:19.510> would<00:02:19.750> say

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
head so that what's neat i would say

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.570 
head so that what's neat i would say
very<00:02:21.270> slim<00:02:22.270> in<00:02:22.540> here<00:02:22.780> he<00:02:22.930> is<00:02:23.130> next<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.370> RC<00:02:26.580> very

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
very slim in here he is next to RC very

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.810 
very slim in here he is next to RC very
nice<00:02:27.820> he's<00:02:28.660> very<00:02:28.900> tall<00:02:29.550> compared<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.670> like

just because his the way is like pull
out<00:02:35.410> another<00:02:36.190> size<00:02:36.640> comparison<00:02:37.239> here<00:02:37.480> he<00:02:37.570> is

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
out another size comparison here he is

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:45.479 
out another size comparison here he is
with<00:02:41.070> what's-his-name<00:02:42.090> break<00:02:43.090> them<00:02:44.370> are<00:02:45.370> we

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
with what's-his-name break them are we

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.900 
with what's-his-name break them are we
doing<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.760> video<00:02:45.910> of<00:02:46.330> him<00:02:46.360> soon<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:48.430> well<00:02:48.670> I

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
doing a video of him soon so well I

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.220 
doing a video of him soon so well I
think<00:02:48.970> that<00:02:49.300> they're<00:02:49.450> brought<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.750> same<00:02:49.930> size

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
think that they're brought the same size

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.830 
think that they're brought the same size
in<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.500> show<00:02:52.739> so<00:02:53.970> this<00:02:54.970> has<00:02:55.209> been<00:02:55.420> around

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
in the show so this has been around
