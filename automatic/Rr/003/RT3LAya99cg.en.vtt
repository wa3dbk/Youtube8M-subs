00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:02.329
 smartphones and press the connect button 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.329
 off the screen vibrate 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:15.200
 continue pressing until the little hand 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:20.260
 notification started to flash 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:24.470
 You can drop this handset back. 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:27.170
 known as that joined swr 3 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.500
 you click on it 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.520
 will start to evaluate the smart well mode 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.009
 of urn is almost without battery just click 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.030
 here and there some information connects 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:43.190
 she's running out the usb and it asks 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.409
 download the application life report that is for 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.649
 bracelet can record activities of the 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.990
 day to day how to walk calories spent 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:53.990
 It's all she really knows, everything wins. 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.850
 but the most interesting functions none 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.610
 I do not think it's going to be a game 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.530
 interesting and consumes a lot of battery I 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.500
 I find this a university 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.140
 another thing that the names better use 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.269
 of the alarm function you have here 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.630
 few the smart viewer 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:13.910
 I think in those 10 6 affines and 15 and she 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.799
 always wake me up is an extra function 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.910
 Ordinary I think that's why she 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.040
 really worth it 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.380
 without counting the connections by the friend 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.540
 notifications it also vibrates warning 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.299
 when you distance yourself very device 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.730
 and it loses the bluetooth connection with the 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.470
 it also vibrates by telling you that 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.769
 this pressure was lost 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.470
 she is super discreet super little girl 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.810
 in a giant job the arm she has 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.010
 So if you hit her, do not 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.920
 it will ruin 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.140
 she has many interesting but I think 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.590
 that what you're really going to use is 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.829
 alarm is the vibration to receive 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.140
 call notifications because the life log is 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.540
 the first month after the 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.790
 first month you begin to realize that 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.620
 It's not so interesting to be that you 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.329
 do gym wants to stay inside 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.700
 How are your losses? 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.209
 then it will be much more useful for 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.620
 you 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.420
 This is what I wanted to bring to you. 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.180
 today I wanted to show how it is possible 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.480
 connect it to devices that you do not have 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.220
 nf therefore joins many trillions internet 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.590
 inside it is possible to connect the 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.170
 device does not have an FC port is a 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.330
 tremendous path of lies and also the 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.910
 my phone 61 he has bluetooth 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.250
 4.0 but is not that the same energie 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.720
 so she connected perfectly 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.730
 This is what I wanted to show you. 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.130
