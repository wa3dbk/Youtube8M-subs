00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.900
 Hi everyone, the leonardo mercon but the 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.460
 institute photographer last refuges 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.800
 We are here today to follow the 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.000
 court staff ride is the club of 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.089
 bird watchers 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.620
 here in the holy spirit is the 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:42.030
 Let's see if we get lucky. 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.030
 We 're definitely going to the fight. 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.460
 Viper goes on the tracks listening 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.220
 pay attention to what has to okay 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.739
 freaking out and we try to play the sound 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.720
 of these birds go there 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.129
 usually people already know more or 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.110
 less what you have in the region 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.059
 then you know that the sound is put 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.070
 even if you are not listening 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.019
 You know if you have that such a step has 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.019
 step kitoko sometimes comes 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.310
 hum touching a beak planting layback 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.409
 and has two types of sounds that the 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.240
 and send out what we do 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.530
 usually fill two corners of each 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:34.520
 kind of bird, right? 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:38.030
 one parent sing and one to call now 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.740
 is put there was there he did not realize that 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.470
 I was missing inside of me 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.729
 we get more interested with the sound 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.729
 further from the human being 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:00.630
 the name by which they are worldwide 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.100
 known known bloodshot practice in the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.750
 bird watching 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.960
 here among friends, people 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.550
 Portuguese, that plays for nothing, right? 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.230
 contrary to what one has the first 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.630
 print is not a bird stew 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.000
 it is not a day of observation and the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.730
 cool thing is that the people come here to spend 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.800
 The day with friends talking does not have 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.420
 stress and also passes a day that passes 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.740
 the day in beautiful places but I do not usually 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.720
 to do well in the looting that's cool 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.740
 personal makes the images each one stays 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.950
 Seeing how it got on the other side. 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.590
 Claudio and that's why the people like 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.440
 and is an opportunity to get out of the 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.540
 running from day to day is not to practice 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.790
 an activity that is healthy that is 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.610
 ecologically sound approach to 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.770
 agrotourism is very strong here in the state 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.580
 then it is an activity that has been done 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.580
 everything to do with sustainability
