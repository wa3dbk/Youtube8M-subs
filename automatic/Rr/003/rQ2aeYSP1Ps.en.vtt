you can see the stand the charger the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.630 
you can see the stand the charger the
arc<00:01:04.470> reactor<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.159> was<00:01:05.309> where<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
arc reactor and that was where the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.660 
arc reactor and that was where the
battery<00:01:05.939> was<00:01:06.920> about<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.070> for<00:01:08.250> about<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.460> year

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
battery was about this for about a year

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.789 
battery was about this for about a year
now<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.060> I've<00:01:09.180> never<00:01:09.299> had<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.570> charge<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.110> but

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
now and I've never had to charge it but

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.469 
now and I've never had to charge it but
I<00:01:10.830> guess<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.189> don't<00:01:11.340> really<00:01:11.520> use<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.850> often<00:01:12.090> as

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
I guess I don't really use it often as

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.770 
I guess I don't really use it often as
it's<00:01:13.380> mainly<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:13.860> show<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.850> turn<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.299> to

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
it's mainly for show and I turn it on to

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.800 
it's mainly for show and I turn it on to
demo<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.470> people<00:01:17.000> so<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.030> really<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.600> no<00:01:18.780> idea

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
demo for people so I really have no idea

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.780 
demo for people so I really have no idea
how<00:01:19.320> long<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.680> lasts<00:01:20.130> from<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.400> full<00:01:20.580> charge

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
how long this lasts from a full charge

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:29.149 
how long this lasts from a full charge
or<00:01:21.030> how<00:01:21.180> long<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.479> takes<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.869> charge<00:01:22.020> okay<00:01:28.159> so

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
or how long it takes to charge okay so

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:45.850 
or how long it takes to charge okay so
this<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.670> stand<00:01:30.979> it's<00:01:31.979> made<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.280> plastic

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:58.179 

charger<00:01:50.540> USB<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.899> put<00:01:52.259> battery<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:53.689> challenges

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:04.959 

charging<00:01:59.189> block<00:01:59.429> a<00:02:01.039> charge<00:02:02.039> cable

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.370 

okay<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.030> I've<00:02:06.240> taken<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.630> battery<00:02:06.869> out<00:02:07.079> just

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
okay so I've taken the battery out just

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.669 
okay so I've taken the battery out just
to<00:02:07.469> demo<00:02:07.679> how<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.099> goes<00:02:08.280> together<00:02:09.590> unscrew<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
to demo how it goes together unscrew the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:18.650 
to demo how it goes together unscrew the
bottom<00:02:15.019> insert<00:02:16.019> the<00:02:16.140> battery<00:02:17.390> fits<00:02:18.390> in<00:02:18.569> a

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
bottom insert the battery fits in a

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.509 
bottom insert the battery fits in a
specific<00:02:19.200> angle<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:21.000> then<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.900> turn<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.519> to

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
specific angle and then you turn it to

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:36.080 
specific angle and then you turn it to
light<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:29.510> which<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:30.660> pretty<00:02:30.870> bright<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.910> then

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
light it which is pretty bright and then

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:50.780 
light it which is pretty bright and then
it's<00:02:36.239> on<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.780> display<00:02:48.860> okay<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.370> turn<00:02:50.670> it

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
it's on the display okay so to turn it

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.970 
it's on the display okay so to turn it
off<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:51.269> don't<00:02:51.989> leave<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.200> on<00:02:52.380> for<00:02:52.440> display<00:02:52.950> I

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
off I don't leave it on for display I

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.100 
off I don't leave it on for display I
always<00:02:53.430> switch<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.760> off<00:02:53.879> I<00:02:54.090> turn<00:02:54.959> this

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
always switch it off I turn this

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.350 
always switch it off I turn this
slightly<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:56.579> make<00:02:56.610> sure<00:02:56.849> that<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.150> doesn't

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
slightly to make sure that it doesn't

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:05.500 
slightly to make sure that it doesn't
fall<00:02:57.660> out<00:02:59.299> just<00:03:00.299> enough<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.660> turn<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.989> off

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.930 

place<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.540> back<00:03:06.780> in<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.019> start<00:03:10.670> we've<00:03:11.670> taken

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
place it back in the start we've taken

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.430 
place it back in the start we've taken
the<00:03:12.150> battery<00:03:12.329> out<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.600> putting<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.049> back<00:03:13.109> in

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
the battery out and putting it back in

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.370 
the battery out and putting it back in
see<00:03:13.940> too<00:03:14.940> much<00:03:15.090> hassle<00:03:15.359> every<00:03:15.810> time<00:03:15.989> I<00:03:16.139> wanted

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
see too much hassle every time I wanted

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.340 
see too much hassle every time I wanted
to<00:03:16.530> turn<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.709> on<00:03:16.950> or<00:03:17.489> off<00:03:20.120> okay<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.139> is<00:03:22.319> a

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
to turn it on or off okay so this is a
