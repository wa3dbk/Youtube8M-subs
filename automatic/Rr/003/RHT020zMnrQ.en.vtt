feet away from its body kind of buried a

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.900 
feet away from its body kind of buried a
little<00:00:18.119> dip<00:00:18.300> under<00:00:18.510> concerns<00:00:19.320> was<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.430> shiny

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910

picked it up almost like a pop cast
silver<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.529> color<00:00:28.560> about<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.550> same<00:00:29.789> size<00:00:30.150> and

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
silver in color about the same size and

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.709 
silver in color about the same size and
as<00:00:31.230> soon<00:00:31.410> as<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.650> got<00:00:31.980> within<00:00:32.730> about<00:00:32.910> two<00:00:33.570> or

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
as soon as I got within about two or

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.720 
as soon as I got within about two or
three<00:00:33.989> inches<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.800> realized<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.520> wasn't

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
three inches of it I realized it wasn't

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.900 
three inches of it I realized it wasn't
pop<00:00:36.210> him<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.590> picked<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.040> up<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.790> know

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
pop him and I picked it up you know

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.950 
pop him and I picked it up you know
probably<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:40.050> real<00:00:40.890> stupid<00:00:41.550> thing<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.000> do<00:00:42.180> not

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
probably a real stupid thing to do not

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.470 
probably a real stupid thing to do not
knowing<00:00:43.200> what<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.649> was<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:44.250> was<00:00:44.820> not<00:00:45.090> thinking

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
knowing what it was I was not thinking

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.410 
knowing what it was I was not thinking
clearly<00:00:45.950> and<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.280> picked<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.700> up<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.149> looked

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
clearly and I picked it up and I looked

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.290 
clearly and I picked it up and I looked
at<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.020> thought<00:00:49.230> okay<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.670> just<00:00:50.820> threw

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
at it and I thought okay so I just threw

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.660 
at it and I thought okay so I just threw
it<00:00:51.390> right<00:00:51.420> inside<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.250> thermal<00:00:53.250> blanket

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
it right inside the thermal blanket

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.400 
it right inside the thermal blanket
wrapped<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.510> took<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.690> all<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.289> we

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
wrapped it up and took it all so we

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.529 
wrapped it up and took it all so we
previously<00:00:55.860> didn't<00:00:56.460> mention<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.030> was

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
previously didn't mention this was

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.799 
previously didn't mention this was
because<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.260> don't<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.190> object<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.969> had

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
because I don't have that object I had

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.709 
because I don't have that object I had
sent<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.410> away<00:01:01.879> it's<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:03.090> something<00:01:03.539> that

sent this away it's with something that
I<00:01:03.840> had<00:01:04.140> literally<00:01:05.330> nailed<00:01:06.330> away<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.049> myself

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
I had literally nailed away to myself

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.670 
I had literally nailed away to myself
somewhere<00:01:08.400> else<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:09.000> needed<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.170> get<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.470> looked

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
somewhere else I needed to get it looked

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.969 
somewhere else I needed to get it looked
at<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.250> get<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.700> verified<00:01:12.150> scores<00:01:13.080> which<00:01:13.799> I

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979

what appear to be hieroglyphics on it
has<00:02:39.750> anybody<00:02:40.050> analyzed<00:02:40.980> what<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.450> could

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
has anybody analyzed what that could

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.410 
has anybody analyzed what that could
possibly<00:02:43.290> mean<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.710> looks<00:02:43.890> very<00:02:44.070> much<00:02:44.310> like

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
possibly mean it looks very much like

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.300 
possibly mean it looks very much like
some<00:02:45.420> objects<00:02:46.020> purported<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.710> be<00:02:46.740> from<00:02:46.920> the

you have sure that there are actually

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.430 
you have sure that there are actually
four<00:03:16.050> symbol<00:03:16.620> just<00:03:17.460> one<00:03:17.880> one<00:03:18.630> small<00:03:19.110> one<00:03:19.380> that

four symbol just one one small one that
sits<00:03:19.860> alone<00:03:20.340> by<00:03:20.670> itself<00:03:20.700> is<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.660> very<00:03:22.020> similar

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
sits alone by itself is a very similar

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.920 
sits alone by itself is a very similar
shape<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.640> obelisk<00:03:23.960> craft<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:26.280> Simba

China<00:03:34.160> that<00:03:35.160> symbol<00:03:35.670> is<00:03:35.790> very<00:03:35.850> similar<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.810> the

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
China that symbol is very similar to the

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.590 
China that symbol is very similar to the
Ross<00:03:37.320> symbol<00:03:37.950> in<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.520> Egyptian<00:03:39.090> hieroglyph

Ross symbol in the Egyptian hieroglyph

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.760 
Ross symbol in the Egyptian hieroglyph
we<00:03:40.110> do<00:03:40.320> know<00:03:40.530> one<00:03:40.770> thing<00:03:41.070> when<00:03:41.520> that<00:03:42.000> symbol

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
we do know one thing when that symbol

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.910 
we do know one thing when that symbol
which<00:03:43.770> is<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.340> button<00:03:45.020> this<00:03:46.020> thing<00:03:46.080> is<00:03:46.770> a

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
which is a button this thing is a

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.210 
which is a button this thing is a
controller<00:03:47.640> of<00:03:48.030> sort<00:03:48.600> of<00:03:48.930> sometimes<00:03:49.260> yes<00:03:49.740> when

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
controller of sort of sometimes yes when

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.660 
controller of sort of sometimes yes when
that<00:03:50.490> symbol<00:03:51.060> is<00:03:51.270> pressed<00:03:52.160> in<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.370> right

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
that symbol is pressed in the right

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.830 
that symbol is pressed in the right
sequence<00:03:54.410> that<00:03:55.410> piece<00:03:56.130> of<00:03:56.400> material<00:03:56.840> that

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
sequence that piece of material that

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.800 
sequence that piece of material that
structure<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:58.860> looks<00:03:59.220> silver<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.120> it's

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
structure that looks silver and it's

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.310 
structure that looks silver and it's
hard<00:04:01.080> like<00:04:01.530> metal<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.130> mean<00:04:02.160> like<00:04:02.490> iron<00:04:02.880> just<00:04:03.330> it

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
hard like metal I mean like iron just it

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.250 
hard like metal I mean like iron just it
closes<00:04:05.160> it<00:04:05.940> becomes<00:04:06.510> very<00:04:07.350> very<00:04:07.860> pliable

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
closes it becomes very very pliable

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.770 
closes it becomes very very pliable
closes<00:04:10.260> with<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.530> memory<00:04:11.130> as<00:04:11.880> if<00:04:12.180> it's<00:04:12.420> going<00:04:12.690> to

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
closes with a memory as if it's going to

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.620 
closes with a memory as if it's going to
close<00:04:13.200> on<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.920> a<00:04:13.950> surface<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.760> like<00:04:15.060> your<00:04:15.300> arm

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
close on to a surface of like your arm

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.289 
close on to a surface of like your arm
and<00:04:16.020> then<00:04:16.650> you<00:04:16.770> push<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.370> again<00:04:17.609> and<00:04:18.180> it

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
and then you push that again and it

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.830 
and then you push that again and it
opens<00:04:18.780> back<00:04:19.049> up<00:04:19.109> with<00:04:19.890> the<00:04:20.100> same<00:04:20.430> memory<00:04:20.940> so

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
opens back up with the same memory so

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.130 
opens back up with the same memory so
that<00:04:21.989> you<00:04:22.109> could<00:04:22.350> remove<00:04:22.740> it<00:04:22.979> so<00:04:23.550> then

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
that you could remove it so then

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.470 
that you could remove it so then
speculation<00:04:25.140> would<00:04:25.290> be<00:04:25.470> this<00:04:25.710> was

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
speculation would be this was

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.480 
speculation would be this was
something<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:27.080> alien<00:04:27.710> had<00:04:27.890> been<00:04:28.070> wearing

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
something the alien had been wearing

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.690 
something the alien had been wearing
yeah<00:04:29.240> why<00:04:29.930> do<00:04:29.990> you<00:04:30.200> not<00:04:30.470> any<00:04:30.860> longer<00:04:31.100> have<00:04:31.490> this

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
yeah why do you not any longer have this

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.330 
yeah why do you not any longer have this
what<00:04:31.970> happened<00:04:32.300> to<00:04:32.390> it<00:04:32.510> well<00:04:33.260> I<00:04:33.560> was<00:04:33.800> told<00:04:34.130> that

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
what happened to it well I was told that

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.860 
what happened to it well I was told that
as<00:04:34.490> all<00:04:34.640> wrong<00:04:34.880> as<00:04:35.060> I<00:04:35.180> had<00:04:35.420> this<00:04:35.630> in<00:04:35.840> my

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
as all wrong as I had this in my
