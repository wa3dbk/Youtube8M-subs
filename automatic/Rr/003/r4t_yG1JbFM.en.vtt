 what's the matter, today I bring you a recipe 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:07.910
 very simple for valentine so 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.910
 if you want to stay and watch the video 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.650
 to make this recipe simply 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.750
 we will need cheese spread butter 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.090
 gelatin strawberry gelatin neutral 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.829
 water and cookies and of course a 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.380
 container for the cake and a bowl for 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.939
 the mix will start making the base 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.710
 that as you know is made with cookies 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.809
 crushed and a little bit of butter 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.120
 previously melted so that then 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.829
 we lose the mixture by the container 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.539
 next we mix an envelope 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.460
 neutral gelatin with a glass of water 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.530
 boiling and stir well so you do not 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.660
 hit us after doing this 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.970
 we take about 250 grams of cheese 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.770
 anoint and remove again justly 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.050
 then we throw two tablespoons 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.300
 of sugar when everything is completely 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.970
 integrated we throw a whole glass of water 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.920
 cold we stir well and we throw it over 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.300
 from the base and then we put everything 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.250
 inside the refrigerator about two hours 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.899
 When the two hours have passed, it will be 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.060
 the time to make strawberry jelly 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.250
 we will follow the steps of before an envelope 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.619
 of strawberry jelly a glass of water 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.689
 boiling and a glass of cold water and what 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.759
 we will remove everything well when everything is 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.890
 fully integrated we will throw it on top 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.990
 of the rest of the mixture with a spoon 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.100
 upside down tilt it a little so that it does not 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.960
 fall as has happened 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.729
 and once everything is completely 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.650
 integrated we will put them in the fridge 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.780
 another three hours and when we take them out 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.610
