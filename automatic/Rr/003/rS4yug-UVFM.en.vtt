00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello everyone here you go home cure with 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.080
 my first video in this video I will give my 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.769
 opinion about one of the games 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.769
 for wii presented at the e3 2013 super 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.839
 mario 3d world was more than obvious that 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.760
 Mario would have to present a new 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.770
 game for wii console and many 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.560
 We were expecting a completely new game 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.230
 as it was Super Mario 64 or the super 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.779
 Mario Galaxy Both Games Masterpieces 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.910
 but nintendo has presented us with super 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.250
 mario 3d body that has many 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.430
 similarities with super mario 3d land de 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.530
 for 3ds the game for many has been 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.750
 a disappointment I must admit that at 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.329
 begin to see the trailer did not call 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.129
 my attention I even thought maybe 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.070
 they think that that will increase the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.260
 wii sales is true the game lacks 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.329
 of the spectacularity and emotion that we 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.730
 transmitted in his time the super mario 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.300
 galaxy but perhaps this makes it a bad 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.910
 game the answer is not the reason is 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.250
 simple four players in a three world 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.589
 dimensions and with super mario quality 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.120
 Bros can definitely be a 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.070
 excellent game 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.290
 the option of cooperative multiplayer 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.290
 will give a great help to the players 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.970
 beginners I think we have all 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.860
 played with someone who spends 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.470
 falling on it to the amount or 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.020
 several times and losing all lives 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.570
 that it's hard for us to get 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.710
 now one of the most players 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.630
 experienced will be able to charge 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.640
 beginners and help him pass a 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.220
 part that is difficult to him as it is a 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.620
 cliff the characters that 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.280
 will star in this game are the same 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.460
 cast of the legendary super mario bros 2 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.340
 mario the balanced character luigi the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.530
 that gives a higher jump than others the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.330
 princess peach who can rub on the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.240
 air a good option for 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.300
 beginners and tohÃ¡ that is the character 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.700
 faster 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.470
 one of the novelties of this game is the 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.780
 mario cat that transforms the 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.760
 characters in adorable cats and the 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.800
 speed or catwoman cat it 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.020
 allows to perform new actions as 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.150
 they can scratch scalar enemies 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.400
 walls and even climb to the top of 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:13.430
 pennant at the end of each level something 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.500
 impossible in previous titles other 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.360
 important detail is that we can rotate 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.150
 the camera freely through the 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.950
 gyro technology of the gamepad as well 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.860
 we can contemplate in detail the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.200
 colorful kingdom mushroom and one of the 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.510
 new elements added in this game 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.850
 are the transparent pipes that we 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.890
 will give a new way to play the game 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.470
 can be enjoyed so much with the gamepad 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.420
 the user who will have more 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.580
 responsibilities in the game the will 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.680
 you pro controller that will surely be 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.990
 the most comfortable way to play or with the 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.450
 wiimote I feel that this will be the way 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.420
 more uncomfortable to play so in my 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.640
 opinion this game combines the designs 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.530
 of the super mario 3d land and fun 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.770
 that offered the multiplayer the new 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.020
 super mario bros both excellent games 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.240
 they merge into a video game that promises 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.210
 quite possibly the best 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.520
 mario games good that 's all for 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.710
 now I would like to know your opinion 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.470
 about this game so leave your 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.470
 comment until the next video
