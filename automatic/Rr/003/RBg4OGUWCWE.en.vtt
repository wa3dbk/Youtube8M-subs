00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
but i'm gonna play a little bit of

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.540 
but i'm gonna play a little bit of
minesweeper<00:00:09.870> here<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.469> start<00:00:10.710> this<00:00:10.830> kinky<00:00:11.370> I

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
minesweeper here to start this kinky I

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.520 
minesweeper here to start this kinky I
don't<00:00:12.509> roll<00:00:12.660> in<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.870> tank<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.200> whole<00:00:13.320> time

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
don't roll in the tank the whole time

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.890 
don't roll in the tank the whole time
but<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.740> did<00:00:13.889> start<00:00:14.070> out<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.370> round<00:00:14.639> of

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
but I did start out this round of

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.660 
but I did start out this round of
conquest<00:00:15.900> on<00:00:16.139> strike<00:00:16.830> at<00:00:16.949> Karkand<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
conquest on strike at Karkand in the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.730 
conquest on strike at Karkand in the
tank<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.119> just<00:00:18.300> kind<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.449> rolled<00:00:18.630> around

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
tank and I just kind of rolled around

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.170 
tank and I just kind of rolled around
initially<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.830> caps<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.279> flags<00:00:20.520> pretty<00:00:21.060> much

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
initially in caps and flags pretty much

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.490 
initially in caps and flags pretty much
uncontested<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.250> use<00:00:23.250> my<00:00:23.519> my<00:00:24.240> thermal<00:00:25.199> vision

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
uncontested and use my my thermal vision

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.920 
uncontested and use my my thermal vision
thermal<00:00:26.460> optics<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:27.180> spot<00:00:27.420> these<00:00:27.599> mines

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
thermal optics to spot these mines

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.599 
thermal optics to spot these mines
another<00:00:28.650> show<00:00:28.800> up<00:00:28.890> on<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.070> minimap<00:00:29.189> but

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
another show up on the minimap but

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.650 
another show up on the minimap but
they're<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> whole<00:00:29.849> lot<00:00:29.970> easier<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.269> see<00:00:30.480> once

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
they're a whole lot easier to see once

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.299 
they're a whole lot easier to see once
you<00:00:30.720> go<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.929> thermal<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.470> every<00:00:31.980> time<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.189> like

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
you go to thermal and every time I like

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.979 
you go to thermal and every time I like
come<00:00:32.520> around<00:00:32.700> corners<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.360> straightaways

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
come around corners and straightaways

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.750 
come around corners and straightaways
and<00:00:34.140> whatnot<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.620> don't<00:00:35.010> always<00:00:35.219> look<00:00:35.399> right<00:00:35.640> at

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
and whatnot I don't always look right at

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.910 
and whatnot I don't always look right at
the<00:00:35.820> mini-map<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:37.380> know<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.500> just<00:00:37.770> turn<00:00:37.890> on

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the mini-map so you know I just turn on

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.010 
the mini-map so you know I just turn on
the<00:00:38.160> thermal<00:00:38.489> vision<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.030> that's<00:00:39.660> what<00:00:39.840> I'm<00:00:39.930> up

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
the thermal vision so that's what I'm up

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.810 
the thermal vision so that's what I'm up
to<00:00:40.050> anyway<00:00:41.010> thought<00:00:41.340> I'd<00:00:41.430> put<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.670> another

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
to anyway thought I'd put in another

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.680 
to anyway thought I'd put in another

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
reaction so it was not me being no a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.440 
reaction so it was not me being no a
self<00:01:18.900> diagnosing<00:01:19.590> parent<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.729> know<00:01:21.030> when

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
self diagnosing parent I I know when

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.789 
self diagnosing parent I I know when
something's<00:01:21.869> wrong<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.259> my<00:01:22.380> kids<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.770> know

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
something's wrong with my kids I know

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.399 
something's wrong with my kids I know
enough<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.580> know<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:24.240> when<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.900> comes<00:01:25.110> to

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
enough to know that but when it comes to

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.320 
enough to know that but when it comes to
medical<00:01:26.009> decisions<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.670> do<00:01:26.729> trust<00:01:27.060> my<00:01:27.270> doctor

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
medical decisions I do trust my doctor

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.569 
medical decisions I do trust my doctor
so<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:28.890> good<00:01:28.979> family<00:01:29.130> doctor

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
so we have a really good family doctor

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.609 
so we have a really good family doctor
were<00:01:29.670> fortunate<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.299> way<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:31.140> she<00:01:31.170> suggested

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
were fortunate that way so she suggested

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.350 
were fortunate that way so she suggested
we<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.520> hopefully<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:33.030> helps<00:01:33.270> her

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
we do that and hopefully that helps her

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.539 
we do that and hopefully that helps her
get<00:01:33.479> her<00:01:33.570> appetite<00:01:34.079> back<00:01:34.320> which<00:01:35.189> will<00:01:35.430> help

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
get her appetite back which will help

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.370 
get her appetite back which will help
her<00:01:35.759> sleep<00:01:36.000> more<00:01:36.270> which<00:01:36.479> will<00:01:36.659> generally<00:01:37.229> put

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
her sleep more which will generally put

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.380 
her sleep more which will generally put
her<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.619> better<00:01:37.770> mood<00:01:37.920> because<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:39.119> drugs

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
her in a better mood because the drugs

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.569 
her in a better mood because the drugs
that<00:01:39.509> she<00:01:39.780> was<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.619> any<00:01:40.860> was<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> drug<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.430> she

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
that she was on any was a drug that she

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.800

with a tank but then I'm getting shot
not<00:07:06.690> quite<00:07:06.900> sure<00:07:06.930> where<00:07:07.199> from<00:07:07.440> it<00:07:07.620> turns<00:07:07.770> out

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 
not quite sure where from it turns out

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:09.560 
not quite sure where from it turns out
it's<00:07:08.070> from<00:07:08.220> the<00:07:08.280> left<00:07:08.520> so<00:07:08.789> at<00:07:09.030> that<00:07:09.150> point<00:07:09.210> I'm

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:09.570 
it's from the left so at that point I'm

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.180 
it's from the left so at that point I'm
taking<00:07:09.870> myself<00:07:10.020> out<00:07:10.289> of<00:07:10.350> any<00:07:10.650> chance<00:07:10.949> again

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:11.190 
taking myself out of any chance again

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.100 
taking myself out of any chance again
the<00:07:11.280> cover<00:07:11.520> i'm<00:07:11.699> going<00:07:11.820> to<00:07:11.880> get<00:07:11.970> wiped<00:07:12.120> out<00:07:12.330> no

the cover i'm going to get wiped out no
big<00:07:13.320> deal<00:07:13.350> though<00:07:13.800> and<00:07:14.039> i<00:07:14.760> think<00:07:14.910> this<00:07:15.210> is

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.330 
big deal though and i think this is

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.740 
big deal though and i think this is
actually<00:07:15.479> wrapping<00:07:16.020> up<00:07:16.139> so<00:07:17.060> holy<00:07:18.060> yeah<00:07:18.449> that's

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:18.750 
actually wrapping up so holy yeah that's

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.230 
actually wrapping up so holy yeah that's
the<00:07:18.900> game<00:07:19.289> so<00:07:20.039> that<00:07:20.130> commentary<00:07:20.580> went<00:07:20.820> by<00:07:20.940> fast

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 
the game so that commentary went by fast

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.790 
the game so that commentary went by fast
and<00:07:21.479> I<00:07:21.510> probably<00:07:21.690> said<00:07:21.900> nothing<00:07:22.320> interesting

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 
and I probably said nothing interesting

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.580 
and I probably said nothing interesting
for<00:07:23.280> you<00:07:23.370> guys<00:07:23.580> but<00:07:23.880> it<00:07:24.000> was<00:07:24.139> good<00:07:25.139> talking<00:07:25.350> to
