00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.480
 hi to all and balsan case i hope that 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.840
 you're fine anyway I'm fine 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.220
 nickel 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.350
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.810
 new information video on gta 5 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.700
 online about dlc robberies 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.110
 just before talking about this novelty 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.150
 I wanted to make a little parenthesis 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.800
 explanations on the video I have 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.880
 released just now a lot of 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.070
 people did not understand why 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.480
 I put official in the title 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.940
 yet just after the official word 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.440
 I had scored read the description is 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.590
 in fact in the description there was 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.090
 one there was a link url that had us 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.650
 been given sometimes even to rent two on 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.700
 twitter and if you click on it 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.770
 look i'm going to put you a little 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.170
 screen on the screen we were actually arriving on 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.550
 down on the cloud of rockstar games and 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.140
 so we came to the mages of 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.450
 the helicopter that I had put in 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.130
 is in the video so here is 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.200
 look if we dissect a little 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.980
 the url we can see prod cloud rockstar 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.689
 games title gta ps4 and schedule steering 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.189
 so final and then a little code 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:09.159
 in my opinion this code should represent 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.360
 the helicopter so it's these images 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.900
 are not facts in my opinion it 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.570
 found them 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.250
 I do not know how about on the 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.869
 cloud servers rockstar so on 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.609
 internet and that's how it has 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.679
 successful blow to find all these 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:22.450
 images that are really images of 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:24.820
 good quality of the images we had 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.560
 not seen anywhere yet and even 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.060
 still unpublished images so as you 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.640
 could see the second part with the 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.960
 equipment so that's why 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.909
 that I could put official in the 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.859
 video it was not to attract and make 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.569
 views it's because even fan mw2 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:38.950
 said he was asked where did you 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.869
 found these pictures he said this is 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.909
 official I found them on the cloud 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.310
 of rockstar games so I allowed myself 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.689
 to put official in the title and 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.639
 So that was it for the little girl 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.350
 parenthesis so the explanation of the 

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:51.520
 video that I left at noon if ever 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.960
 you have not seen frankly I you 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.639
 invite to go watch her he had 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.990
 really a lot of information from 

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:57.490
 new screen is not bad 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.990
 information with screens 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.869
 at the level of equipment that could 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.100
 have for these robberies and so all of 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.689
 next we will go to the second 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.729
 information that has been given us such 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.359
 sometimes even to lift 2 a little later 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.520
 on Twitter 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:10.720
 so in the previous video appears 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.410
 so really for those who have not seen 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.790
 go see her 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.770
 otherwise maybe you're not going 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.000
 understand the rest so in the video 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.040
 just now I showed you five 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.620
 first screen that were the screen 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.239
 dvi 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.790
 hull and then the second part of 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.920
 equipment screen so in fact every 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.140
 equipment in my opinion will go with a 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.330
 mission number one equipment with 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.340
 mission number one equipment number two 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.860
 with a mission number two and then 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.079
 so he published a sixth mission and 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.640
 this one he says she's that for ps3 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.040
 and xbox 360 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.629
 so there then he asks the question there 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.180
 would he have extra hold-ups 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.019
 for la's jane so for ps3 and xbox 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.120
 360 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.739
 so maybe to fill in a little bit the 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.290
 lack of novelties that comes on the 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.359
 jane compare with jane so all that 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.400
 is seen in the first person a little 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.569
 more vehicles a little more weapons the 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.129
 collector pack that is for all the 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.560
 world now so maybe they 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.049
 wanted to counter that with a mission 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.799
 additional robberies in the dlc 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.269
 who will arrive 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.010
 so for the moment it's not 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.959
 official but I think if that 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.209
 becomes official that will be it will be really 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.530
 pleasure to a lot of people so you 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.329
 tell us in comments what you 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.250
 think about it after look i'm going 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.750
 try to justify that a little to my 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.239
 notice to infer what comes from 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.799
 to say he had to find the same stand as 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.400
 I showed you so with the helicopter 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.019
 but this time with a code two 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.150
 missions that it's available only on 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.440
 ps3 or xbox 360 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.780
 maybe that's how he was able to 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.859
 discover this information as I 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.450
 wanted said do not hesitate to tell us what 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.129
 that you think in comment it will be 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.489
 really enjoy seeing the life of everything 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:38.870
 the world 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.700
 positive comments and 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.410
 negative comments if they will know 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.849
 if they are justified 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.230
 tell us what you think 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.099
 see a little bit about everyone's life 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.989
 as I said it's really 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.769
 interesting that it allows us d x 2 10 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.660
 see a little clearer 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.879
 and now I have stolen it is on these 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.209
 pictures tell you all good game and you have 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.209
 everyone
