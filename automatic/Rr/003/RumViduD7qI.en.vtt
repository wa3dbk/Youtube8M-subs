extruder to star phone farm and yeah I
mean<00:02:08.330> coming<00:02:08.690> like<00:02:08.899> straight<00:02:09.380> hard<00:02:09.710> off<00:02:09.979> the

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
mean coming like straight hard off the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.430 
mean coming like straight hard off the
bottom<00:02:10.610> straight<00:02:11.000> up<00:02:11.240> is<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.660> not<00:02:11.840> digging<00:02:12.320> or

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
bottom straight up is it not digging or

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.900 
bottom straight up is it not digging or
grabbing<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.890> rail<00:02:13.070> off<00:02:13.370> because<00:02:13.550> of<00:02:13.820> the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
grabbing a rail off because of the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.600 
grabbing a rail off because of the
squareness<00:02:14.270> of<00:02:14.600> this<00:02:14.720> MACT<00:02:15.460> because<00:02:16.460> it's

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
squareness of this MACT because it's

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.220 
squareness of this MACT because it's
still<00:02:16.820> got<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.090> same<00:02:17.240> rocker<00:02:17.600> as<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:17.840> normal

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
still got the same rocker as a normal

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.400 
still got the same rocker as a normal
board<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:19.090> it's<00:02:20.090> still<00:02:20.570> used<00:02:20.900> every<00:02:21.230> bit<00:02:21.380> of

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
board and it's still used every bit of

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.610 
board and it's still used every bit of
rail<00:02:21.860> line<00:02:22.160> through<00:02:22.400> your<00:02:22.610> hacks<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.620> bottom

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
rail line through your hacks and bottom

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.280 
rail line through your hacks and bottom
turns<00:02:24.860> but<00:02:25.820> this<00:02:26.330> one's<00:02:26.570> pretty<00:02:26.840> much<00:02:27.080> the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
turns but this one's pretty much the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.430
