00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.190
 do you want to cut just as much a photo hairstyle as a daisy here on medium length 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:14.749
 then I admit I have my power myself tips 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.659
 hi my name is quite what i am now not an expert lost jeopardy 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.760
 today i'm going to show you by the short hair of may not how you 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.940
 can create a cool look with a lot of structure and a volume 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.900
 achieved through the use of styling and finish 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.920
 there is a difference between the use of these two products but tell it 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.780
 I'll tell you later 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.790
 the first thing we are going to do is divide the stones over it 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.249
 her 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:51.059
 and then let it dry nice and casual by means of a fact inside 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.560
 olen 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.560
 the 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:05.570
 do so with it 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.249
 the 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.799
 the council members are going to make the extra structure through a curling iron because 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.080
 This clock of a church could therefore be an important part of it 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.630
 the plan to resign 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.350
 so that you keep a good overview of what you are doing 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.090
 if the team of a mac users in the hair, the cooling process is bad 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.020
 important to this determines to a large extent the shelf life of a curl 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.020
 if you take out the curling iron, she always takes the clocks with a 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.020
 execution 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.849
 anp 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.309
 the difference between my style and finish at the exhibition 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:31.219
 misuse immediately after washing the year 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.339
 I give him your hair a certain shape say the memory making it 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:36.279
 stays in shape throughout the day 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:39.629
 after using the rise product the moment your hair is dry such as 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.939
 for example, with daisy, you get to work with the finish, which makes it a year 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:47.149
 A certain luster structure or a different look gives go in this case 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:50.529
 discharge at the small amount max 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:54.209
 Common mistake when using maxis is taking too small a quantity 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.709
 And it will be another one at the Cliff season, such as that you said 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.349
 see yourself in the mirror 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.849
 nur at the back actually no product is visible anymore and that is why 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.079
 a large amount of product in hands freed it warm 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.919
 bring it all over the year and then it was a beautiful picture that was 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:12.919
 you want that 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:14.969
 in front of
