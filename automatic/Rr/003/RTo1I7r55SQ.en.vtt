00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:08.219
 I'm glad to be back here again with 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:12.820
 another video to show you the 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:15.519
 that the place where the railway station 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:19.620
 We are arriving at the one where the 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:23.360
 report from the previous day to the end of 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:26.830
 right there in front of the train station 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:32.220
 and governor valadares 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:37.090
 along with the square plays very well and 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:41.590
 lots of pretty tree 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:45.760
 in some restaurants around here where 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:52.559
 Can you lunch have a show? 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:01:03.059
 a little bit here from the square a little dirty 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:06.780
 and it 's due to Sunday in January it's 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.780
 can do the cleaning 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.720
 just up ahead 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:19.150
 the average replica of a locomotive for the 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:24.900
 children play people take 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.900
 cool photos 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:35.310
 the square is very pretty and well wooded 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:35.310
 nor legally 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.010
 right there in front of the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.520
 blue tree 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:52.070
 and he ahead 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:57.170
 there landing area 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.650
 where we left the station some 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:06.220
 previous videos 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.220
 So I'll see if I can get in there. 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.470
 If I got behind I'm going from any 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.120
 so I go to the video in a minute 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:22.360
 to see if I can get the support of 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.360
 starving 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.700
 O 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:40.180
 I think we can get in. 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.180
 the king your passage then I hit here 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.080
 it might have enough image 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.080
 older 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.680
 allowed to enter 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.209
 Why announcing there? 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.200
 It's going to the beautiful horizon. 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.040
 usually people who can not 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.390
 the passing 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:08.050
 but I'm going to look private 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.940
 I honestly can not because you 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.290
 It has no security right 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.290
 it's a clandestine transport 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.360
 if you want to take the risk 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.870
 I did not move on 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.850
 Let's get in here, we can. 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.710

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.150
 We can enter the account of 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.280

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.400

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.400
 railway 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.790
 [Music] 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.760
 the arm 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.750
 place 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.770
 Good afternoon features seem 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.770

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.780
 We present passage here. 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.340
 What do I think I 'm going to have to present? 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.940
 I also do not know 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.940
 the identity 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.840
 good afternoon afternoon 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.230
 Belo Horizonte and seventh behind not only 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:42.010
 Not yet, not how you look at me. 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:45.070
 I'm alone here on the island of good people. 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:48.370
 got into the station 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:52.990
 here are some locomotives if 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:57.300
 compared and possibly 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:59.659
 pretty cool maintenance 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:04.050
 I will not pull very new here because 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:09.050
 the picture gets very bad pm the camera is 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:12.620
 very good but you can see the people 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:17.300
 How is the station here? 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.300
 Search by photos: 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:25.530
 here we are a little behind where the 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.250
 wagon where I'm going to stay 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:34.170
 This is where I'm going to stop. 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.460
 video here and as soon as the train arrives I 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.120
 I do the filming 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.120
 that's right 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.389
 That's cool, right? 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.050
 [Music] 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:11.050
