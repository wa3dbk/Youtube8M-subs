00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:28.020
 and well hi to all and dirt magna then 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.750
 today we find ourselves not for 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.400
 a video on black ops of may for a 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.780
 sending attempt is fooled aude on 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.870
 two community channels that are the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.780
 peace vctv and the community code that you 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.089
 could have seen in intro at the beginning then 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.530
 for today's topic that is not 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.350
 not on black ops the puts in relation 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.760
 with black ops of view that this game is 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.150
 already a connection to the game that is already 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.610
 quite common already since black ops 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.080
 first name and it's already several 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.720
 years that we are a little tired of everything 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.070
 that and there is not necessarily all the 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.360
 world who wants to afford to have a 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.420
 skin lections drinking then we're going 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.600
 try to remedy that by trying to 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.119
 help you a lot with this tutorial then 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.899
 already you go go to settings and 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.299
 network settings then you go 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.460
 go to connection settings 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.530
 Internet 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.859
 so then it'll disconnect you from 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.670
 psn or at home xbl xbox live 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:37.619
 for those who are on xbox xbox name 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.350
 it should not be a problem otherwise 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.670
 it's not very different then 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.049
 you're not going to face it and you 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.149
 will do customize customize 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.030
 make a wireless connection or by 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.609
 cable according to your thing 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.679
 so me it's wireless then you 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:55.720
 go grab manual after you 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.700
 continue continue continue you continue 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.400
 there you do automatic for 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.920
 the ip address and then you do not do 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.730
 not define by cons configuration 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.880
 from the dns you do manual and you go 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.430
 introduce the following numbers into the 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.060
 primary dns and secondary dns 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.370
 so the primary dns you put 8 8 8 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.510
 8 and in the secondary dns you put 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.670
 8 8 4 and 4 so no it should you 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.060
 increase the connection for some 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.750
 so you will continue the mt had to 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.650
 automatic proxy you do not do it 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.420
 use upnp makes you activated after 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.090
 you finished that makes you validate and 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.100
 you test your connection 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.690
 so for those who do not know 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.280
 this technique where who do not have 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.110
 obviously seen from tutorial on youtube 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.300
 I hope it will help you because 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.000
 good after I looked anyway 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.380
 some tutorial about the collection 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.360
 on the two community channels to 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.980
 who I send this story of anyway 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.209
 see if there is something already there 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.860
 already had a tutorial only one of the two 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.370
 chains did not really appreciate 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.750
 it was rather the guy he has here 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.060
 did not know too much so I thought 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.019
 we will do it again I have nothing to lose 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:15.130
 and so here I turn to 7.9 megabit 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.320
 per second and 682 kilobits per second 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.830
 so it's a pretty cool collection 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.170
 I recommend it you will see that it 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.540
 would make that it will still be a 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.000
 quite a good difference at the level of 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.360
 multiplayer you'll see that that 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.430
 returns 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.860
 you will feel that it fits a 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.190
 little better but hey if you had already had 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.130
 a collection already better than that which 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.200
 would still surprise me ballet that's 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.280
 as you have before anyway me I 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.340
 let this panic that because 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.200
 when I have the basic collection got 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.299
 not so good and more savary once 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.739
 that's it's going down serious that has a 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.739
 collection of merle and sometimes it goes up 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.470
 oh it's drinkable and that's not all 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:00.670
 the super chic time to play when one is 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.290
 in the multi because actually it's 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.910
 not all the nice time to go back 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.840
 in one game and four barred finish 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.849
 with stockings 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.269
 so here I hope you will be silent 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.890
 please do not forget to click the video 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.819
 I also thank both channels 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:19.690
 Community in case of OLP and fashion 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:21.340
 I also hope that the tutorial will provide you 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.990
 a good collection reach or that's it 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.990
 so chao and receive the next
