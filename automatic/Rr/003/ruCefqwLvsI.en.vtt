00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.600
 I'll get pine and moved to quitá 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.190
 because it is a thing that has few colors 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 and then we'll see how it is 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.180
 difference of an image with a few 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.190
 things to more good colors here will go 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.320

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.149
 here will only adjust our things 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.860
 Clicking here will give us this 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.890
 image a little more red right because 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.560
 loses good quality and here it is as if 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.360

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.200
 if you want to change this by default 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.960
 you have to see that in configuration 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.600
 standard it comes little to the color scheme 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.700
 1.7 okay but I did not see much much 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.540
 change so you can change the actor 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.880
