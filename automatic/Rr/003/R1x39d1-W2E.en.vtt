00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.550 
today's topic is Klaus to solve problems
and<00:00:18.420> Klaus<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.900> need<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.140> understand<00:00:19.500> the

and Klaus you need to understand the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.350 
and Klaus you need to understand the
fundamentals<00:00:20.070> for<00:00:20.220> watch<00:00:20.340> let's<00:00:21.060> start<00:00:21.270> with

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
fundamentals for watch let's start with

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.480 
fundamentals for watch let's start with
the<00:00:21.419> basics<00:00:21.890> alright<00:00:22.890> now<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.220> know<00:00:23.369> what

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
the basics alright now I know what

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.620 
the basics alright now I know what
you're<00:00:23.580> thinking<00:00:23.849> which<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.029> assume<00:00:24.450> that

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
you're thinking which is assume that

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.470 
you're thinking which is assume that
this<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.869> block<00:00:25.140> alright<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.829> know<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.520> have

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
this is a block alright I know I have

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.880 
this is a block alright I know I have
two<00:00:27.660> hands<00:00:27.810> basically<00:00:28.079> this<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.619> known<00:00:28.769> as<00:00:28.859> a

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
two hands basically this is known as a

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.040 
two hands basically this is known as a
dial<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.369> clock<00:00:29.550> right<00:00:30.510> now<00:00:30.900> you've<00:00:31.019> got

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
dial of the clock right now you've got

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.359 
dial of the clock right now you've got
the<00:00:31.289> our<00:00:31.439> head<00:00:31.679> or<00:00:31.920> that's<00:00:32.129> known<00:00:32.340> as

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
the our head or that's known as

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.070 
the our head or that's known as
shorthand<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.300> put<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> minute<00:00:33.750> hand<00:00:33.870> or

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080 
shorthand and you put the minute hand or

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.930 
shorthand and you put the minute hand or
the<00:00:34.260> long<00:00:34.410> gap<00:00:34.590> now<00:00:35.309> what<00:00:35.519> you<00:00:35.610> need<00:00:35.699> to<00:00:35.820> know

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
the long gap now what you need to know

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.549 
the long gap now what you need to know
is<00:00:36.330> that<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.629> our<00:00:36.750> hand<00:00:37.050> which<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.410> its

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
is that the our hand which is its

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.410 
is that the our hand which is its
initial<00:00:37.920> position<00:00:38.070> after<00:00:38.489> every<00:00:38.699> 12<00:00:39.030> hours

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
initial position after every 12 hours

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.290 
initial position after every 12 hours
so<00:00:40.019> basically<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.470> traverses<00:00:40.920> 360<00:00:41.460> degrees<00:00:41.730> in

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
so basically it traverses 360 degrees in

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.900 
so basically it traverses 360 degrees in
12<00:00:42.600> hours<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.589> minute<00:00:43.860> hand<00:00:44.010> however<00:00:44.339> it

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
12 hours the minute hand however it

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.760 
12 hours the minute hand however it
reaches<00:00:45.239> initial<00:00:45.719> position<00:00:46.020> after<00:00:46.170> every<00:00:46.320> 60

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
reaches initial position after every 60

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.700 
reaches initial position after every 60
minutes<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.789> reverses<00:00:48.270> 360<00:00:48.780> degrees<00:00:49.050> every

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
minutes so it reverses 360 degrees every

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.420 
minutes so it reverses 360 degrees every
60<00:00:50.010> minutes

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
60 minutes

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.380 
60 minutes
now<00:00:51.270> consider<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.350> what<00:00:52.829> if<00:00:53.010> your<00:00:53.520> minute

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
now consider this what if your minute

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.799 
now consider this what if your minute
hand<00:00:54.600> was<00:00:55.559> here<00:00:55.860> all<00:00:56.550> right<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:56.910> two<00:00:57.359> twelve

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
hand was here all right so two twelve

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.229 
hand was here all right so two twelve
o'clock<00:00:58.050> right<00:00:58.170> now<00:00:58.350> after<00:00:59.160> an<00:00:59.250> hour<00:00:59.399> this

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
o'clock right now after an hour this

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.930 
o'clock right now after an hour this
will<00:01:00.420> be<00:01:00.570> at<00:01:00.809> one<00:01:01.289> o'clock<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.760> will

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
will be at one o'clock and this will

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.779 
will be at one o'clock and this will
again<00:01:03.270> traverse<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.170> whole<00:01:04.199> thing<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.789> come

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:05.789 
again traverse the whole thing and come

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:07.580 
again traverse the whole thing and come
back<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.060> initial<00:01:06.119> position<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.380> can

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
back to the initial position so you can

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.279 
back to the initial position so you can
say<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.399> after<00:01:08.520> every<00:01:08.910> are<00:01:09.149> the<00:01:09.780> minute<00:01:10.110> hand

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
say that after every are the minute hand

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:14.630 
say that after every are the minute hand
right<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.460> gains<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.720> much<00:01:13.160> over<00:01:14.160> the<00:01:14.520> our

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
right it gains this much over the our

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.580 
right it gains this much over the our
hand<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.149> the<00:01:15.600> our<00:01:15.750> hand<00:01:15.990> would<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.110> one<00:01:16.410> and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
hand so the our hand would be one and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.560 
hand so the our hand would be one and
three<00:01:16.680> twelve<00:01:17.490> suit<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.850> gained<00:01:18.030> fifty<00:01:18.420> five

much this minute hand gained over an

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.020 
much this minute hand gained over an
hour<00:01:25.290> hand<00:01:25.530> after<00:01:26.100> every<00:01:26.280> are<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.700> now<00:01:26.820> let's

hour hand after every are and now let's

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.880 
hour hand after every are and now let's
see<00:01:27.180> how<00:01:27.450> much<00:01:27.479> each<00:01:27.869> hand<00:01:28.259> traverses<00:01:28.770> in

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
see how much each hand traverses in

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.819 
see how much each hand traverses in
every<00:01:29.130> minute<00:01:29.280> or<00:01:29.430> every<00:01:29.520> are<00:01:29.790> now<00:01:30.360> consider

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
every minute or every are now consider

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.319 
every minute or every are now consider
the<00:01:31.829> our<00:01:31.920> hand<00:01:32.159> alright<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.700> starts<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.119> well

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
the our hand alright it starts it well

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.450 
the our hand alright it starts it well
now<00:01:33.930> after<00:01:34.079> twelve<00:01:34.380> hours<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:35.009> will<00:01:35.130> traverse

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
now after twelve hours it will traverse

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.249 
now after twelve hours it will traverse
the<00:01:35.640> entire<00:01:36.060> surface<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.600> clock<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:36.960> 360

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the entire surface of the clock so 360

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.050 
the entire surface of the clock so 360
degrees<00:01:37.619> heavy<00:01:37.799> 12<00:01:38.009> us<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.610> every<00:01:38.820> hour<00:01:38.850> will

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
degrees heavy 12 us so every hour will

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.060 
degrees heavy 12 us so every hour will
be<00:01:39.180> please<00:01:39.390> City<00:01:39.600> degrees<00:01:39.810> divided<00:01:40.049> by<00:01:40.140> 12<00:01:40.380> so

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
be please City degrees divided by 12 so

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.499 
be please City degrees divided by 12 so
if<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.310> compute<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.090> comes<00:01:42.270> out<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.479> be

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
if you compute this it comes out to be

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.050 
if you compute this it comes out to be
30<00:01:42.780> degrees<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> our<00:01:43.979> hand<00:01:44.220> traverses<00:01:44.790> 30

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
30 degrees so the our hand traverses 30

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.510 
30 degrees so the our hand traverses 30
degrees<00:01:45.450> every<00:01:45.930> hour<00:01:46.130> now<00:01:47.130> consider<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
degrees every hour now consider the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.649 
degrees every hour now consider the
minute<00:01:47.729> hand<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.090> right<00:01:48.210> hand<00:01:48.240> suppose

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
minute hand the right hand suppose

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.249 
minute hand the right hand suppose
softly<00:01:49.200> lay<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.250> take<00:01:50.899> 60<00:01:51.899> minutes<00:01:52.140> to

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
softly lay it is take 60 minutes to

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.450 
softly lay it is take 60 minutes to
traverse<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> whole<00:01:52.829> thing<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.159> come<00:01:53.310> back

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
traverse the whole thing and come back

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.480 
traverse the whole thing and come back
to<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.610> original<00:01:53.909> position

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
to the original position

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.250 
to the original position
so<00:01:54.729> every<00:01:54.970> minute<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.450> can<00:01:55.540> be<00:01:55.630> 360<00:01:56.020> degrees

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
so every minute it can be 360 degrees

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.580 
so every minute it can be 360 degrees
divided<00:01:56.500> by<00:01:56.530> 60<00:01:57.010> that<00:01:57.580> will<00:01:57.729> be<00:01:57.790> six<00:01:58.590> six

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
divided by 60 that will be six six

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.250 
divided by 60 that will be six six
degrees<00:01:59.830> 330<00:02:00.430> so<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:00.880> minute<00:02:01.119> hand<00:02:01.270> every

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
degrees 330 so the minute hand every

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.230 
degrees 330 so the minute hand every
minute<00:02:02.530> moves<00:02:02.950> by<00:02:03.130> six<00:02:03.369> degrees<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.090> our

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
minute moves by six degrees and the our

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.719 
minute moves by six degrees and the our
hand<00:02:04.510> every<00:02:04.750> R<00:02:04.930> moves<00:02:05.470> by<00:02:05.590> 30<00:02:05.800> degrees<00:02:05.920> all

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
hand every R moves by 30 degrees all

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.400 
hand every R moves by 30 degrees all
right<00:02:06.880> that<00:02:07.210> seems<00:02:07.390> simple<00:02:07.600> let's<00:02:08.170> start<00:02:08.319> with

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
right that seems simple let's start with

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.270 
right that seems simple let's start with
the<00:02:08.470> basic<00:02:08.709> problem<00:02:10.110> problem<00:02:11.110> one<00:02:11.290> find<00:02:12.160> the

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
the basic problem problem one find the

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.530 
the basic problem problem one find the
angle<00:02:12.550> between<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.880> our<00:02:13.030> hand<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:13.480> the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
angle between the our hand and the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.180 
angle between the our hand and the
minute<00:02:13.750> hand<00:02:13.900> of<00:02:14.110> a<00:02:14.230> clock<00:02:14.350> when<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.920> time<00:02:15.160> is

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
minute hand of a clock when the time is

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.940 
minute hand of a clock when the time is
325<00:02:15.910> right<00:02:16.510> for<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.959> first<00:02:17.170> problem<00:02:17.530> they

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
325 right for the first problem they

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.320 
325 right for the first problem they
said<00:02:18.160> they<00:02:18.250> find<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.610> angle<00:02:18.910> between<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.180> our

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
said they find the angle between the our

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.320 
said they find the angle between the our
hand<00:02:19.540> in<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.690> minute<00:02:19.900> hand<00:02:20.020> at<00:02:20.200> 325<00:02:20.800> now<00:02:21.640> this

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
hand in the minute hand at 325 now this

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.500 
hand in the minute hand at 325 now this
is<00:02:22.480> our<00:02:22.750> first<00:02:22.989> you<00:02:23.470> find<00:02:24.069> our<00:02:24.310> angles<00:02:25.090> that

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
is our first you find our angles that

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.820 
is our first you find our angles that
are<00:02:25.569> travels<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.020> each<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.319> ends<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.680> then

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
are travels to each of the ends and then

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.250 
are travels to each of the ends and then
subtract<00:02:27.160> them<00:02:27.310> for<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:27.940> our<00:02:28.090> hand<00:02:28.300> convert

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
subtract them for the our hand convert

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.780 
subtract them for the our hand convert
this<00:02:29.410> into<00:02:29.680> odds<00:02:29.920> completely<00:02:30.340> versus<00:02:30.640> three

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
this into odds completely versus three

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.210 
this into odds completely versus three
hours<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:31.060> 25<00:02:31.390> minutes<00:02:31.540> 25<00:02:32.320> minutes<00:02:32.350> is<00:02:32.680> 25<00:02:33.070> by

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
hours of 25 minutes 25 minutes is 25 by

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.430 
hours of 25 minutes 25 minutes is 25 by
60<00:02:33.550> hours<00:02:33.700> right<00:02:34.269> so<00:02:34.600> basically<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:35.350> number

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
60 hours right so basically the number

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.590 
60 hours right so basically the number
of<00:02:35.560> us<00:02:35.769> we<00:02:35.950> are<00:02:36.010> living<00:02:36.070> at<00:02:36.310> is<00:02:36.400> 3<00:02:36.610> plus<00:02:36.940> 25<00:02:37.360> by

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
of us we are living at is 3 plus 25 by

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.620 
of us we are living at is 3 plus 25 by
60<00:02:37.989> hours<00:02:38.250> right<00:02:39.250> if<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.820> multiply<00:02:40.150> this<00:02:40.209> 16

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
60 hours right if you multiply this 16

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.550 
60 hours right if you multiply this 16
degrees<00:02:40.840> 180<00:02:41.019> 180<00:02:41.920> plus<00:02:42.760> 25<00:02:43.150> divided<00:02:44.050> by<00:02:44.170> 60

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
degrees 180 180 plus 25 divided by 60

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.500 
degrees 180 180 plus 25 divided by 60
right<00:02:45.070> 180<00:02:45.670> plus<00:02:45.790> 25<00:02:46.090> is<00:02:46.180> 205<00:02:46.690> so<00:02:47.410> this<00:02:47.500> is<00:02:47.590> 205

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
right 180 plus 25 is 205 so this is 205

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.540 
right 180 plus 25 is 205 so this is 205
divided<00:02:49.510> by<00:02:49.600> 60<00:02:49.930> hours<00:02:50.170> right<00:02:51.100> if<00:02:51.250> you<00:02:51.340> further

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
divided by 60 hours right if you further

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.740 
divided by 60 hours right if you further
cancel<00:02:51.970> or<00:02:52.239> this<00:02:52.420> is<00:02:52.540> five<00:02:52.750> Elsa<00:02:53.910> 541<00:02:54.910> so

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
cancel or this is five Elsa 541 so

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.800 
cancel or this is five Elsa 541 so
basically<00:02:56.050> it<00:02:56.200> is<00:02:56.290> 41<00:02:56.970> by<00:02:57.970> 12<00:02:58.269> us<00:03:00.060> 325<00:03:01.060> is<00:03:01.269> 41<00:03:01.720> by

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
basically it is 41 by 12 us 325 is 41 by

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.840 
basically it is 41 by 12 us 325 is 41 by
12<00:03:01.989> hours<00:03:02.200> now<00:03:02.799> we<00:03:02.829> know<00:03:03.160> that<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.430> our<00:03:03.579> hand

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
12 hours now we know that the our hand

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.900 
12 hours now we know that the our hand
traverses<00:03:05.040> 360<00:03:06.040> degrees<00:03:06.780> every<00:03:07.780> 12<00:03:08.019> hours<00:03:08.910> so

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
traverses 360 degrees every 12 hours so

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.640 
traverses 360 degrees every 12 hours so
how<00:03:10.150> much<00:03:10.269> is<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:10.510> travels<00:03:10.870> in<00:03:11.799> 41<00:03:12.459> by<00:03:12.579> 12<00:03:12.760> oz

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
how much is it travels in 41 by 12 oz

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.530 
how much is it travels in 41 by 12 oz
right<00:03:14.650> all<00:03:15.489> right<00:03:15.610> nother<00:03:15.790> let's<00:03:16.299> just<00:03:16.420> keep

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
right all right nother let's just keep

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.539 
right all right nother let's just keep
it<00:03:16.660> at<00:03:16.750> that

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
it at that

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.460 
it at that
now<00:03:18.549> let's<00:03:18.730> see<00:03:18.820> for<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.000> minute<00:03:19.209> hand<00:03:19.470> minute

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
now let's see for the minute hand minute

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.170 
now let's see for the minute hand minute
hand<00:03:20.650> this<00:03:20.799> is<00:03:20.950> 3<00:03:21.130> as<00:03:21.250> in<00:03:21.370> 35<00:03:21.760> minutes<00:03:22.000> let's

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
hand this is 3 as in 35 minutes let's

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.970 
hand this is 3 as in 35 minutes let's
convert<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.540> 3<00:03:22.720> has<00:03:22.870> 90<00:03:23.170> minutes<00:03:23.380> three<00:03:23.769> hours

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
convert the 3 has 90 minutes three hours

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.039 
convert the 3 has 90 minutes three hours
of<00:03:24.250> each<00:03:24.670> other<00:03:24.850> is<00:03:24.970> 60<00:03:25.209> minutes<00:03:25.299> three<00:03:25.750> axes

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
of each other is 60 minutes three axes

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.600 
of each other is 60 minutes three axes
360s<00:03:27.010> 180<00:03:27.340> minutes<00:03:27.459> plus<00:03:28.120> 25<00:03:28.510> so<00:03:28.660> 180<00:03:29.100> plus<00:03:30.100> 25

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
360s 180 minutes plus 25 so 180 plus 25

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.300 
360s 180 minutes plus 25 so 180 plus 25
again<00:03:30.880> it<00:03:31.060> is<00:03:31.120> 205<00:03:31.959> minutes<00:03:33.870> right<00:03:34.870> now<00:03:35.310> every

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
again it is 205 minutes right now every

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.530 
again it is 205 minutes right now every
60<00:03:37.030> minutes<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:38.290> reverses<00:03:39.060> 360<00:03:40.060> degrees<00:03:40.329> so

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
60 minutes it reverses 360 degrees so

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.849 
60 minutes it reverses 360 degrees so
now<00:03:41.350> you<00:03:41.410> have<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.620> find<00:03:41.739> out<00:03:41.799> for<00:03:41.920> 205<00:03:42.579> minutes

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
now you have to find out for 205 minutes

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.370 
now you have to find out for 205 minutes
right<00:03:44.890> how<00:03:45.340> much<00:03:45.540> now<00:03:46.540> this<00:03:46.959> is<00:03:47.140> where

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
right how much now this is where

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.199 
right how much now this is where
students<00:03:47.709> make<00:03:47.890> a<00:03:47.950> mistake<00:03:47.980> they<00:03:48.820> go<00:03:48.940> on<00:03:49.090> to

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
students make a mistake they go on to

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.259 
students make a mistake they go on to
multiply<00:03:49.630> 205<00:03:50.230> into<00:03:50.470> 360<00:03:50.950> and<00:03:51.190> then<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.090> comes

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
multiply 205 into 360 and then it comes

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.580 
multiply 205 into 360 and then it comes
a<00:03:52.359> huge<00:03:52.540> number<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:52.930> then<00:03:53.079> and<00:03:53.290> then<00:03:53.500> they

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
a huge number and then and then they

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.289 
a huge number and then and then they
don't<00:03:53.680> know<00:03:53.799> what<00:03:53.950> else<00:03:54.070> to<00:03:54.190> do<00:03:54.310> now<00:03:55.239> the

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
don't know what else to do now the

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.849 
don't know what else to do now the
simplest<00:03:55.750> way<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:55.900> do<00:03:56.079> is<00:03:56.200> is<00:03:56.380> that<00:03:56.440> you<00:03:56.709> know

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
simplest way to do is is that you know

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.819 
simplest way to do is is that you know
that<00:03:56.980> a<00:03:57.040> minute<00:03:57.340> hand<00:03:57.549> write<00:03:58.380> it<00:03:59.380> comes<00:03:59.680> back

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
that a minute hand write it comes back

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:00.449 
that a minute hand write it comes back
to<00:03:59.890> its<00:03:59.980> initial

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
to its initial

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.789 
to its initial
after<00:04:00.939> every<00:04:01.209> art<00:04:01.420> so<00:04:02.290> it<00:04:02.379> doesn't<00:04:02.680> matter

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
after every art so it doesn't matter

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.729 
after every art so it doesn't matter
even<00:04:03.069> if<00:04:03.250> it<00:04:03.340> was<00:04:03.430> 325<00:04:04.299> or<00:04:04.480> 1225<00:04:05.109> it<00:04:05.590> would

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
even if it was 325 or 1225 it would

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.830 
even if it was 325 or 1225 it would
still<00:04:05.950> start<00:04:06.400> from<00:04:06.879> this<00:04:07.060> position<00:04:07.269> every<00:04:07.689> our

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
still start from this position every our

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.410 
still start from this position every our
so<00:04:08.469> what<00:04:08.620> can<00:04:08.829> basically<00:04:09.010> do<00:04:09.370> is<00:04:09.549> ignore<00:04:10.180> this

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
so what can basically do is ignore this

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.110 
so what can basically do is ignore this
three<00:04:10.689> us<00:04:10.810> because<00:04:11.739> see<00:04:12.219> charted<00:04:12.640> 12<00:04:12.849> all

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
three us because see charted 12 all

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.759 
three us because see charted 12 all
right<00:04:13.299> now<00:04:13.840> after<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.170> first<00:04:14.379> art<00:04:14.560> it<00:04:14.709> would

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
right now after the first art it would

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.319 
right now after the first art it would
come<00:04:15.010> back<00:04:15.129> with<00:04:15.189> wealth<00:04:15.430> on<00:04:15.909> the<00:04:16.000> second<00:04:16.239> had

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
come back with wealth on the second had

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.969 
come back with wealth on the second had
to<00:04:16.389> come<00:04:16.539> back<00:04:16.660> here<00:04:16.840> turn<00:04:17.500> and<00:04:17.739> come<00:04:17.889> back

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
to come back here turn and come back

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.430 
to come back here turn and come back
here<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:18.340> then<00:04:18.519> 25<00:04:19.000> minutes<00:04:19.299> somewhere<00:04:20.289> here

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
here and then 25 minutes somewhere here

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.560 
here and then 25 minutes somewhere here
so<00:04:21.220> you<00:04:21.310> only<00:04:21.519> need<00:04:21.639> to<00:04:21.820> consider<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.180> 25

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
so you only need to consider the 25

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.950 
so you only need to consider the 25
minutes

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
minutes

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.939 
minutes
alright<00:04:23.320> so<00:04:23.830> now<00:04:23.979> if<00:04:24.160> you<00:04:24.630> start<00:04:25.630> over<00:04:25.810> right

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.499 

you<00:04:29.949> can<00:04:30.100> just<00:04:30.280> consider<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.729> 25<00:04:31.090> minutes<00:04:31.360> so

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
you can just consider the 25 minutes so

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.339 
you can just consider the 25 minutes so
now<00:04:32.110> we<00:04:32.289> know<00:04:32.530> that<00:04:33.190> for<00:04:34.030> every<00:04:34.270> 60<00:04:34.750> minutes<00:04:34.780> it

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
now we know that for every 60 minutes it

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:39.050 
now we know that for every 60 minutes it
reverses<00:04:35.860> 360<00:04:36.400> degrees<00:04:36.639> so<00:04:37.050> for<00:04:38.050> 25<00:04:38.440> minutes

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
reverses 360 degrees so for 25 minutes

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.320 
reverses 360 degrees so for 25 minutes
how<00:04:40.060> much<00:04:40.210> right<00:04:41.139> so<00:04:41.349> our<00:04:41.470> X<00:04:41.680> will<00:04:41.889> be<00:04:42.039> our<00:04:42.820> 25

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
how much right so our X will be our 25

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.469 
how much right so our X will be our 25
into<00:04:43.990> 360<00:04:44.470> s<00:04:44.530> or<00:04:44.740> cross<00:04:45.130> multiplication

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
into 360 s or cross multiplication

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.350 
into 360 s or cross multiplication
divided<00:04:46.479> by<00:04:46.630> 60<00:04:46.930> this<00:04:47.139> is<00:04:47.199> once<00:04:47.710> a<00:04:47.919> sixer<00:04:48.460> so<00:04:48.970> 25

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
divided by 60 this is once a sixer so 25

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.439 
divided by 60 this is once a sixer so 25
into<00:04:49.570> 6<00:04:49.750> is<00:04:49.900> 150<00:04:50.580> so<00:04:51.580> basically<00:04:51.849> this<00:04:51.970> is<00:04:52.030> 150

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
into 6 is 150 so basically this is 150

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.060 
into 6 is 150 so basically this is 150
degrees<00:04:52.690> I<00:04:52.930> will<00:04:53.289> just<00:04:53.410> compute<00:04:53.740> this<00:04:53.830> here

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
degrees I will just compute this here

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.540 
degrees I will just compute this here
all<00:04:54.759> right<00:04:55.080> so<00:04:56.080> now<00:04:56.229> this<00:04:56.500> is<00:04:56.620> 4112<00:04:57.070> so<00:04:57.490> we

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
all right so now this is 4112 so we

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.350 
all right so now this is 4112 so we
cross<00:04:57.789> multiply<00:04:57.820> this<00:04:58.180> all<00:04:59.050> right<00:04:59.229> so<00:04:59.410> 360

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
cross multiply this all right so 360

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:07.200 
cross multiply this all right so 360
into<00:05:01.360> 41<00:05:01.990> by<00:05:02.169> 12<00:05:02.880> is<00:05:03.880> equal<00:05:04.120> to<00:05:04.300> 12<00:05:04.599> into<00:05:05.320> X<00:05:05.909> so<00:05:06.909> X

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
into 41 by 12 is equal to 12 into X so X

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.010 
into 41 by 12 is equal to 12 into X so X
will<00:05:07.389> be<00:05:07.570> you<00:05:07.930> get<00:05:08.050> 12<00:05:08.380> down<00:05:08.560> here<00:05:08.770> so<00:05:09.639> 360<00:05:10.240> into

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
will be you get 12 down here so 360 into

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.839 
will be you get 12 down here so 360 into
41<00:05:11.849> divided<00:05:12.849> by<00:05:12.970> 12<00:05:13.510> into<00:05:14.020> 12<00:05:14.340> right<00:05:15.340> now<00:05:15.370> 12

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
41 divided by 12 into 12 right now 12

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.439 
41 divided by 12 into 12 right now 12
ones<00:05:16.120> are<00:05:16.300> 12<00:05:17.050> 30<00:05:17.500> is<00:05:17.650> a<00:05:17.740> perfect<00:05:18.190> oh<00:05:18.370> this<00:05:19.330> will

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
ones are 12 30 is a perfect oh this will

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.899 
ones are 12 30 is a perfect oh this will
be<00:05:19.599> 12<00:05:20.139> or<00:05:21.030> 6<00:05:22.030> -<00:05:22.210> 0<00:05:22.240> 6<00:05:22.960> 5<00:05:23.229> sir<00:05:23.409> right<00:05:24.310> this<00:05:24.550> is<00:05:24.699> 5

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
be 12 or 6 - 0 6 5 sir right this is 5

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:30.180 
be 12 or 6 - 0 6 5 sir right this is 5
into<00:05:25.360> 4<00:05:25.720> T<00:05:25.840> 1<00:05:25.870> this<00:05:26.169> is<00:05:26.289> 210<00:05:26.889> 210<00:05:27.729> by<00:05:28.090> 2<00:05:29.009> so<00:05:30.009> this

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
into 4 T 1 this is 210 210 by 2 so this

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.270 
into 4 T 1 this is 210 210 by 2 so this
is<00:05:30.370> 105<00:05:31.120> and<00:05:31.330> a<00:05:31.650> half<00:05:32.849> right<00:05:33.849> so<00:05:34.570> now<00:05:34.690> this<00:05:34.840> is<00:05:35.020> a

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
is 105 and a half right so now this is a

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.430 
is 105 and a half right so now this is a
150<00:05:36.280> degrees<00:05:36.550> 105<00:05:37.389> 0.5<00:05:38.169> so<00:05:38.949> if<00:05:39.220> you<00:05:39.520> -<00:05:39.940> it<00:05:40.440> I'm

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
150 degrees 105 0.5 so if you - it I'm

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.029 
150 degrees 105 0.5 so if you - it I'm
sorry<00:05:41.650> this<00:05:41.770> is<00:05:41.889> 205<00:05:42.669> to<00:05:43.570> go<00:05:43.720> a<00:05:43.750> 5<00:05:44.409> into<00:05:44.590> 41<00:05:44.949> is

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
sorry this is 205 to go a 5 into 41 is

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.230 
sorry this is 205 to go a 5 into 41 is
205<00:05:45.610> so<00:05:46.419> this<00:05:46.570> comes<00:05:46.750> out<00:05:46.840> to<00:05:46.900> be<00:05:46.990> 102<00:05:47.970> and<00:05:48.970> a

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
205 so this comes out to be 102 and a

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.210 
205 so this comes out to be 102 and a
half<00:05:49.360> so<00:05:50.169> if<00:05:50.289> you<00:05:50.380> calculate<00:05:50.830> the<00:05:50.919> difference

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
half so if you calculate the difference

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.660 
half so if you calculate the difference
it<00:05:51.370> is<00:05:51.430> 150<00:05:52.090> -<00:05:53.580> 102.5<00:05:54.580> the

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
it is 150 - 102.5 the

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.960 
it is 150 - 102.5 the
so<00:05:56.150> it<00:05:56.240> comes<00:05:56.420> out<00:05:56.570> to<00:05:56.660> be<00:05:56.720> forty<00:05:57.350> seven<00:05:57.970> point

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
so it comes out to be forty seven point

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.280 
so it comes out to be forty seven point
