00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 we are in minecraft 1.7 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.290
 dot days let's see a bot a mode 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.170
 that I find super cool and super useful 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:16.949
 for frames like me because it adds like 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.720
 improvements if improvements to the inventory and 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.970
 is super cool we are very good 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.130
 especially because I for example I suppose 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.680
 that someone else will also wait 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.900
 go out to chop or whatever a mine or 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.699
 wherever and always I forget 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.040
 emptying the inventory the question is 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.530
 that now if we press the r we have this 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.200
 from here and as you see we have as a 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.899
 extra inventories only that can not be 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.070
 use let's put earth for example 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.020
 when we can leave it here or anything 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.899
 we have to do as you see here there is a 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.260
 gap we have to make some improvements not 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.820
 they stay for this will be here inventor 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.810
 and upgrade one 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.490
 well that is with a chest 4 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.050
 four pots of these that are made 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.050
 with another chest 4 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.510
 wooden storage unit but 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.700
 it is very long 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.070
 four pots four pots of 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.990
 these and a chest and we do the first 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.880
 improvement we give the air to open the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.970
 inventory this and I have to put it 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.430
 here and as you see up here it has been 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.860
 illuminated 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.890
 you see that it lights up actually comes out in the 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.360
 drawing the one in green is the 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.120
 bit of extra inventory that we 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.070
 we block let's beat him with is 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.370
 stable is very well need reston 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.870
 yes then wait for the r then not 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.810
 you can do them from the beginning 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.850
 principle but almost because the subtraction the 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.840
 that kills quickly and get 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.280
 you have there a little extra 9 that is 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.979
 super cool but good let's do the 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.670
 next improvements the stone that comes out 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.410
 with the wooden level 1 let's say and 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.990
 then you do with this here that with 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:01.250
 good stone I call it good stone and the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.009
 postman is the same but instead of wood 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.710
 with good stone that will be blessed 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.080
 stones and tracks and well then she and 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.230
 we do four of these and the level 1 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.760
 and this as you will understand opens the two 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.700
 from above those who are enlightened there 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.489
 in green it 's very very good then we have 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.880
 the iron that is with the level 2 and 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.710
 4 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.810
 iron storage units 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.320
 expect it is that traffic as I say 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:32.400
 It is the same but with iron and it opens 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.770
 this east and east here the gold that 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.130
 is with the level 3 with this from here of 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.870
 gold exactly the same as diamond 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.820
 is with the gold one and here already this 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.460
 It starts to hurt a little more but 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.830
 good and the one of emerald that is with the one of 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.770
 diamond and these emeralds this hurts 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.689
 but hey even the matter is that 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.980
 it illuminates everything 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.409
 set the amount of space that 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.790
 we win is great and apart we have 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.219
 these little gadgets here that are 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.280
 super cool the object filter we're going to 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:04.780
 see them little by little the era nadal to the air 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.730
 worth the filter objects the question is 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.780
 that to take off if we click on 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:13.510
 frame you see here to the aquino frame inside 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.540
 but to the frame you see that it stays like 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.120
 selected 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.209
 in red and this I have here 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.400
 I should have him doing tests we're going to 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.840
 try this one with the first and here 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.030
 we can put 3 little things that 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.549
 we have a few here we have the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.890
 filter of objects that is done with a 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.980
 diamond one eye sell a paper two 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.700
 comparator and four iron for 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.400
 tell you gold 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.349
 let's see it here this is the filter 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.650
 objects and here we can put what 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.440
 We want to see 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.350
 confident 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.910
 for example we can stone and the question 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.320
 is that now for example the stone itself 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.930
 that we can put here all by in 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.930
 all around here but the wood by 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.570
 example is not to say the filter this serves 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.910
 to choose which objects we can place 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:05.930
 here in case you want to just go here 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.340
 the smells for example then here not 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.840
 you can enter anything else which 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.830
 it can be pretty good we do not have the 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.070
 collector that this one is very cool of 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.070
 these 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:25.610
 four and what's cool about this that this one 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.610
 love we are going to put stones for 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.470
 example you see the collector what it does is 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.960
 that I automatically cover objects 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.210
 here then it's cool a lot because this 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.760
 has the stone filter we can put 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.420
 in the one of orÃ©s for example and according 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.420
 let's go getting 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.069
 for example , we are going to remove it here 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.300
 this takes a lot 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:50.060
 as we go getting little things 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.100
 you see 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.750
 if we get some man will see it 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.930
 automatically here as this one has the 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.610
 filter can not get more stuff with this 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.200
 superchulo is that if it does not have a filter 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.130
 let's put for example way if not 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.450
 he has the filter he puts everything he sees 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.970
 any object starts here goes 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.710
 picking up then out there then it's 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.129
 important to have the filter clear this what 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.889
 we remove now we can not place it 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:16.779
 but as you can see it's very very good 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:20.969
 here the promise this is with a 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:20.969
 diamond one piston four gold 

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:27.009
 just change the position of the diamond and 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.589
 of the piston and this what it does apart from 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:33.540
 that we can not combine it with the 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:35.610
 collector this what are we going to put 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.320
 because this is complicated if we have a 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.950
 object because before it is that the subject has 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.270
 worked on the fifth or sixth attempt not 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.920
 I know why 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.020
 I do not understand why sometimes 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.210
 it works sometimes not a bit weird because 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.700
 I have it here, it does not work, but I 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.780
 I have the action bar if the question 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.940
 is that this object is the proper of what 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.320
 is to put with objects from here to the bar 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.050
 of action for what I see because the rest 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.580
 of sites does not let me 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.889
 the young man is putting it 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.830
 and you see that now I can not if I put 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.970
 another is storing it is quite 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.050
 same as here we have if we want 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:13.539
 that with your discomfort or not that it reaches 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:16.870
 16 and there it stays you can not be useful 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:18.819
 also that yes it is worth a little bit 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.409
 rare that only the action bars 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:22.060
 and finally we have the crafter item 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:22.990
 let's put here we can put in 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.449
 any side 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.580
 I am using this in the example he is 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:30.360
 you can put anywhere and here what 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.330
 what do we do for example one of wood 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.220
 give us beige buttons and if we have 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.260
 the object here inside 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.590
 We can give you here directly without 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.930
 have to use a table the graph 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.930
 if we left click it gives us 1 if 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.820
 we right click a whole stack 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:49.060
 he is very very cool 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:53.170
 especially so I say we're going to 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.170
 sticks for example 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.650
 and it's very good because it saves us having 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:07:01.100
 have a baseball casting out there 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:06.190
 he's pretty cool especially for 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:12.220
 people always full of things but good 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:12.220
 the one of 1.7 point 10 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.670
 bye
