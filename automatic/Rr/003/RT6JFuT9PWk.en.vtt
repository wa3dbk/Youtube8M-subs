a sudden John Higgins options are well

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.889 
a sudden John Higgins options are well
he's<00:01:44.369> got<00:01:44.549> two<00:01:44.700> options<00:01:44.880> as<00:01:45.299> either<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.720> play

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
he's got two options as either to play

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.230 
he's got two options as either to play
himself<00:01:46.380> from<00:01:46.619> where<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.950> balls<00:01:47.490> are<00:01:47.670> or<00:01:48.000> to

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
himself from where the balls are or to

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.210 
himself from where the balls are or to
let<00:01:48.390> Ronnie<00:01:48.600> play<00:01:49.320> from<00:01:49.590> where<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.829> balls<00:01:50.009> are

let Ronnie play from where the balls are

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.620 
let Ronnie play from where the balls are
which<00:01:50.460> means<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.939> Ronnie's<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> read

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
which means that Ronnie's on a read

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.039 
which means that Ronnie's on a read
again

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
again

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.510 
again
of<00:01:52.200> course<00:01:52.439> John<00:01:52.710> Higgins<00:01:52.860> would<00:01:53.159> have<00:01:53.310> felt

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
of course John Higgins would have felt

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.569 
of course John Higgins would have felt
disadvantaged<00:01:54.479> well<00:01:55.229> yes<00:01:55.560> he<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.399> he

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
disadvantaged well yes he and he

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.399 
disadvantaged well yes he and he
probably<00:01:56.939> was<00:01:57.240> disadvantaged<00:01:57.990> without<00:01:58.380> a

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
probably was disadvantaged without a

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.560 
probably was disadvantaged without a
doubt<00:01:58.680> but<00:01:59.460> it's<00:01:59.640> an<00:01:59.759> anomaly<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.329> rule

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
doubt but it's an anomaly in the rule

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.929 
doubt but it's an anomaly in the rule
that<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.649> needs<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.219> redressed

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
that that needs to be redressed

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.999 
that that needs to be redressed
obviously<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.840> occurs<00:02:04.200> when<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.680> player<00:02:04.979> is

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
obviously this occurs when a player is

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.800 
obviously this occurs when a player is
on<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.280> collar<00:02:05.610> trying<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.210> escape<00:02:06.420> after

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
on a collar trying to escape after

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.690 
on a collar trying to escape after
potting<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.380> read<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:08.160> other<00:02:08.280> way<00:02:08.459> round

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
potting a read the other way round

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.339 
potting a read the other way round
wouldn't<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.270> problem<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:10.020> guy<00:02:10.140> would<00:02:10.319> just

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
wouldn't be a problem the guy would just

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.589 
wouldn't be a problem the guy would just
say<00:02:10.590> play<00:02:10.830> again<00:02:11.160> but<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.000> situation<00:02:12.569> that

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
say play again but in the situation that

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.080 
say play again but in the situation that
John

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
John

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.750 
John
to<00:02:13.300> find<00:02:13.480> himself<00:02:13.629> coming<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.319> table<00:02:14.800> if

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
to find himself coming to the table if

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.580 
to find himself coming to the table if
he<00:02:15.910> put<00:02:16.150> Ronnie<00:02:16.390> O'Sullivan<00:02:16.540> back<00:02:17.140> into<00:02:17.410> play

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
he put Ronnie O'Sullivan back into play

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.680 
he put Ronnie O'Sullivan back into play
again<00:02:17.709> it<00:02:18.550> wouldn't<00:02:18.879> be<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.090> play<00:02:19.269> again<00:02:19.540> on

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
again it wouldn't be to play again on

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.350 
again it wouldn't be to play again on
the<00:02:20.170> color<00:02:20.550> Rio<00:02:21.550> Southern<00:02:21.940> would<00:02:22.090> be<00:02:22.180> playing

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
the color Rio Southern would be playing

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.699 
the color Rio Southern would be playing
on<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.540> ring<00:02:22.720> would<00:02:22.930> be<00:02:22.959> playing<00:02:23.260> on<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.470> race

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
on the ring would be playing on a race

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.440 
on the ring would be playing on a race
yes<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:24.430> would<00:02:24.580> it<00:02:24.670> be<00:02:24.730> fair<00:02:24.879> to<00:02:24.940> say<00:02:25.209> that<00:02:25.239> the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
yes so would it be fair to say that the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.059 
yes so would it be fair to say that the
rule<00:02:25.660> needs<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:26.050> be<00:02:26.170> changed<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:26.800> the

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
rule needs to be changed so that the

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.650 
rule needs to be changed so that the
player<00:02:27.280> would<00:02:27.459> definitely<00:02:28.209> be<00:02:28.300> having<00:02:28.569> to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
player would definitely be having to

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.140 
player would definitely be having to
play<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.870> color<00:02:29.170> still<00:02:29.590> definitely<00:02:30.069> I<00:02:30.549> mean

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
play a color still definitely I mean

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.880 
play a color still definitely I mean
there<00:02:31.299> is<00:02:31.330> a<00:02:31.450> section<00:02:31.959> section<00:02:32.379> five<00:02:32.590> in<00:02:32.830> the

rulebook which covers the officials

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
there is a section which which says that

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.039 
there is a section which which says that

the referee is free to make a decision

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.710 
the referee is free to make a decision
or<00:02:38.349> fair<00:02:38.590> play<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.099> in<00:02:39.790> hindsight<00:02:40.150> maybe<00:02:40.540> I

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
or fair play and in hindsight maybe I

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.369 
or fair play and in hindsight maybe I
should<00:02:40.959> have<00:02:41.049> used<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:41.410> rule<00:02:41.650> but<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:43.379> didn't

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
should have used that rule but I didn't

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:45.809 
should have used that rule but I didn't
I<00:02:44.500> stopped<00:02:44.739> by<00:02:44.890> there<00:02:44.950> by<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.400> letter<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:45.790> the

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
I stopped by there by the letter of the

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.190 
I stopped by there by the letter of the
law<00:02:45.940> basically<00:02:46.480> but<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.900> would<00:02:46.989> have<00:02:47.079> been

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
law basically but it would have been

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.240 
law basically but it would have been
tough<00:02:47.349> to<00:02:47.500> have<00:02:47.590> called<00:02:47.769> a<00:02:47.829> Miss<00:02:48.010> when<00:02:48.160> it

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
tough to have called a Miss when it

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.500 
tough to have called a Miss when it
wasn't<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.549> Miss<00:02:48.700> that<00:02:48.849> would<00:02:48.970> be<00:02:49.090> good<00:02:49.450> enough

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
wasn't a Miss that would be good enough

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.120 
wasn't a Miss that would be good enough
called<00:02:49.870> him<00:02:49.989> no<00:02:50.110> so<00:02:50.440> a<00:02:50.590> straight<00:02:50.829> stroke

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
called him no so a straight stroke

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.089 
called him no so a straight stroke
hasn't<00:02:51.549> been<00:02:51.670> played<00:02:51.910> but<00:02:52.739> in<00:02:53.739> hindsight

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
hasn't been played but in hindsight

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.270 
hasn't been played but in hindsight
maybe<00:02:55.019> because<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.170> sequence<00:02:56.470> of<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:56.950> Miss

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
maybe because the sequence of the Miss

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.890 
maybe because the sequence of the Miss
had<00:02:57.459> already<00:02:57.610> started<00:02:58.090> because<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:58.750> already

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
had already started because I already

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.229 
had already started because I already
called<00:02:59.319> a<00:02:59.410> few<00:02:59.560> misses<00:02:59.920> he<00:03:00.040> should<00:03:00.250> have<00:03:00.370> been

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
called a few misses he should have been

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.509 
called a few misses he should have been
put<00:03:01.480> back<00:03:01.660> to<00:03:01.870> play<00:03:02.079> on<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.319> collar<00:03:02.530> again<00:03:02.709> but

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
put back to play on the collar again but

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.100 
put back to play on the collar again but
the<00:03:03.610> rule<00:03:03.760> doesn't<00:03:03.790> really<00:03:04.329> cover<00:03:04.569> that<00:03:04.690> so

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
the rule doesn't really cover that so

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
more difficult to implement isn't it you
