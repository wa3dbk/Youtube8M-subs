engineering<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.490> then<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:44.820> also<00:01:44.939> take<00:01:45.329> an

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
engineering and then we also take an

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.600 
engineering and then we also take an
engineering<00:01:46.290> design<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.040> communication

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610

very hard-working type really care about

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.289 
very hard-working type really care about
school<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.439> lot<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.340> shows<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.030> their

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
school a lot and that shows in their

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.780 
school a lot and that shows in their
work<00:02:00.540> as<00:02:00.960> for<00:02:01.259> professors<00:02:01.799> students<00:02:02.399> seem<00:02:02.610> to

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
work as for professors students seem to

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.520 
work as for professors students seem to
report<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.210> split<00:02:03.540> between<00:02:03.689> those<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.290> care

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
report a split between those that care

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.170 
report a split between those that care
and<00:02:04.710> those<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.369> research<00:02:05.850> all<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
and those that research all the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.520 
and those that research all the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
professors here who are doing research

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.740 
professors here who are doing research
are<00:02:08.009> extremely<00:02:08.670> bright<00:02:08.879> men<00:02:09.119> probably<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
are extremely bright men probably the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.580 
are extremely bright men probably the
frontrunner<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.229> there

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
frontrunner in there

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.009 
frontrunner in there
in<00:02:11.190> class<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.910> might<00:02:12.090> seem<00:02:12.420> like<00:02:12.690> your<00:02:12.900> little

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
in class you might seem like your little

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.080 
in class you might seem like your little
distance<00:02:13.530> away<00:02:13.590> from<00:02:13.860> them<00:02:14.010> but<00:02:14.310> if<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:14.730> ask

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
distance away from them but if you ask

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.610 
distance away from them but if you ask
them<00:02:15.269> questions<00:02:15.629> on<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> one-on-one<00:02:16.110> basis

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
them questions on a one-on-one basis

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.320 
them questions on a one-on-one basis
they're<00:02:16.769> usually<00:02:16.890> really<00:02:17.129> helpful<00:02:17.670> it's<00:02:17.970> that

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
they're usually really helpful it's that

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.850 
they're usually really helpful it's that
you<00:02:18.569> should<00:02:18.780> make<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.080> effort<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.620> then

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
you should make the effort and then

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.290 
you should make the effort and then
they'll<00:02:20.010> know<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.819> care<00:02:21.030> about<00:02:21.090> your

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
they'll know that you care about your

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.170 
they'll know that you care about your
classes<00:02:21.480> we<00:02:22.200> try<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.739> give<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.250> students

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
classes we try and give the students

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.720 
classes we try and give the students
individual<00:02:24.989> attention<00:02:25.290> relatively<00:02:26.250> smaller

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
individual attention relatively smaller

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.780 
individual attention relatively smaller
class<00:02:27.599> size<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:28.319> have<00:02:28.790> internationally

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
class size we have internationally

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.110 
class size we have internationally
renowned<00:02:30.209> faculty<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:31.500> all<00:02:31.769> areas<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:33.000> the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
students get to do research we have a

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.580 
students get to do research we have a
thing<00:02:35.640> called<00:02:35.700> ctec<00:02:36.330> which<00:02:36.629> is<00:02:36.780> basically<00:02:37.230> an

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
thing called ctec which is basically an

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.220 
thing called ctec which is basically an
online<00:02:37.920> grading<00:02:38.760> system<00:02:39.299> for<00:02:39.629> teachers<00:02:40.080> and

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
online grading system for teachers and

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.580 
online grading system for teachers and
classes<00:02:40.410> where<00:02:40.769> you<00:02:40.830> can<00:02:40.980> reach<00:02:41.190> our<00:02:41.370> class
