00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:18.740
 vp of the conception university started its activities in 1996 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:23.399
 as a linking entity between university research and the 

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:28.630
 needs of the productive sector since then has fulfilled an important 

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:33.570
 work related to scaling setbacks the development of products and 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.570

 university autonomy 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.409
 in energy use of forest biomass this extensive and positive 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.559
 since it is a renewable resource 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.169
 whose cycle is neutral in terms of releases of carbon dioxide 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:32.479
 its content of sulfur nitrogen inventories of states is minimal 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.479
 and it is available in vast territories 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:41.039
