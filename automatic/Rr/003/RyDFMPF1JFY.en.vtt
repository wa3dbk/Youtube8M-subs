a piece or a set you can find somewhat
Amazon<00:00:21.789> but<00:00:22.090> a<00:00:22.269> 12-inch<00:00:22.990> one<00:00:23.170> will<00:00:23.410> start<00:00:23.920> at

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
Amazon but a 12-inch one will start at

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.820 
Amazon but a 12-inch one will start at
$8<00:00:24.490> and<00:00:24.699> a<00:00:25.359> 24<00:00:25.840> inch<00:00:26.019> one<00:00:26.199> will<00:00:26.380> start<00:00:26.650> around

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
$8 and a 24 inch one will start around

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.380 
$8 and a 24 inch one will start around
$11<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:30.460> here<00:00:30.640> are<00:00:30.699> some<00:00:30.849> that<00:00:30.970> I<00:00:31.029> made<00:00:31.269> myself

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
$11 so here are some that I made myself

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.290 
$11 so here are some that I made myself
first<00:00:34.390> you'll<00:00:34.720> need<00:00:34.900> some<00:00:35.230> wire<00:00:35.470> rope<00:00:35.830> I<00:00:36.300> got

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
first you'll need some wire rope I got

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
first you'll need some wire rope I got
the<00:00:37.620> 1/16<00:00:38.620> inch<00:00:38.920> wire<00:00:39.850> rope<00:00:40.120> and<00:00:40.360> it<00:00:40.780> is<00:00:40.900> vinyl

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
the 1/16 inch wire rope and it is vinyl

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.870 
the 1/16 inch wire rope and it is vinyl
covered<00:00:41.770> so<00:00:42.130> it<00:00:42.250> makes<00:00:42.430> it<00:00:42.520> a<00:00:42.610> little<00:00:42.760> bit

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
covered so it makes it a little bit

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.530 
covered so it makes it a little bit
thicker<00:00:43.060> and<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:45.190> wire<00:00:45.430> rope<00:00:45.640> only<00:00:46.060> costs

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
thicker and the wire rope only costs

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.190 
thicker and the wire rope only costs
around<00:00:47.080> 31<00:00:48.040> cents<00:00:48.490> per<00:00:48.760> feet<00:00:49.090> per<00:00:49.870> foot<00:00:52.200> you'll

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
around 31 cents per feet per foot you'll

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.990 
around 31 cents per feet per foot you'll
then<00:00:53.380> need<00:00:53.560> the<00:00:53.800> ferrule<00:00:54.310> and<00:00:54.370> stop<00:00:54.670> sets

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
then need the ferrule and stop sets

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.100 
then need the ferrule and stop sets
because<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.170> vinyl<00:00:56.820> covered<00:00:57.820> wire<00:00:58.690> rope<00:00:58.930> is

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
because the vinyl covered wire rope is

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.000 
because the vinyl covered wire rope is
thicker<00:00:59.380> I<00:00:59.710> got<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.460> 3<00:01:00.910> and<00:01:01.060> 32<00:01:01.480> inch<00:01:02.010> Ferro

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
thicker I got the 3 and 32 inch Ferro

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.039 
thicker I got the 3 and 32 inch Ferro
and<00:01:03.220> stop<00:01:03.460> set<00:01:03.700> which<00:01:04.059> fit<00:01:04.299> it<00:01:04.420> just<00:01:04.629> fine<00:01:04.839> and

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
and stop set which fit it just fine and

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.910 
and stop set which fit it just fine and
those<00:01:05.379> are<00:01:05.530> only<00:01:05.710> a<00:01:05.740> dollar<00:01:06.399> 37<00:01:07.000> cents<00:01:07.240> is<00:01:07.630> set

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.139 

if<00:01:12.359> you<00:01:13.359> got<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.399> wire<00:01:15.399> rope<00:01:15.640> that<00:01:15.789> isn't

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
if you got the wire rope that isn't

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.450 
if you got the wire rope that isn't
vinyl<00:01:16.450> covered<00:01:17.070> which<00:01:18.070> I<00:01:18.189> don't<00:01:18.249> recommend

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
vinyl covered which I don't recommend

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.510 
vinyl covered which I don't recommend
because<00:01:19.030> then<00:01:19.210> it<00:01:19.299> will<00:01:19.359> scratch<00:01:19.719> up<00:01:19.899> your

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
because then it will scratch up your

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.370 
because then it will scratch up your
whatever<00:01:21.520> you're<00:01:21.759> connecting<00:01:22.179> it<00:01:22.270> to<00:01:22.380> then

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
whatever you're connecting it to then

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.130 
whatever you're connecting it to then
you<00:01:23.770> could<00:01:23.979> then<00:01:24.159> use<00:01:24.399> the<00:01:24.670> one<00:01:25.509> and<00:01:25.719> sixteenth

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
you could then use the one and sixteenth

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.050 
you could then use the one and sixteenth
inch

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
inch

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.330 
inch
ferrule<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.149> stops

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.740 

so<00:01:35.340> these<00:01:35.700> are<00:01:35.880> pretty<00:01:36.000> easy<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.360> use<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.719> just

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
so these are pretty easy to use you just

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.590 
so these are pretty easy to use you just
loop<00:01:37.439> around<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.890> wire<00:01:38.100> rope<00:01:38.310> into<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
loop around the wire rope into the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.359 
loop around the wire rope into the
Pharaoh<00:01:41.600> which<00:01:42.600> has<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> two<00:01:43.590> holes<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.009> just

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
Pharaoh which has a two holes in it just

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.090 
Pharaoh which has a two holes in it just
loop<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.670> around<00:01:45.950> you<00:01:46.950> want<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:48.920> opening<00:01:49.920> just

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
loop it around you want the opening just

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.910 
loop it around you want the opening just
big<00:01:50.340> enough<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.729> attach<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.720> your<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:52.890> your

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
big enough to attach to your to your

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.130 
big enough to attach to your to your
GoPro<00:01:53.460> knobs<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:57.090> there's<00:01:57.450> no<00:01:57.630> room<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.110> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
GoPro knobs so there's no room for it to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.080 
GoPro knobs so there's no room for it to
come<00:01:58.799> loose<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.159> course

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.450 

that<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.659> little<00:02:05.049> slack<00:02:05.290> at<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.590> end<00:02:05.740> of<00:02:06.310> the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
that a little slack at the end of the

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:15.000 
that a little slack at the end of the
rope<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:08.020> for<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.649> stop<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:14.470> just<00:02:14.739> make<00:02:14.860> your

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
rope is for the stop so just make your

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.339 
rope is for the stop so just make your
adjustments<00:02:15.520> enough<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.940> fit<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.020> GoPro

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
adjustments enough to fit the GoPro

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.589 
adjustments enough to fit the GoPro
knobs<00:02:20.459> now<00:02:21.459> I'm<00:02:21.700> showing<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.269> you<00:02:22.390> need

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
knobs now I'm showing you that you need

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.610 
knobs now I'm showing you that you need
the<00:02:22.690> hammer<00:02:22.900> down<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.970> ferrule<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.209> stops

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
the hammer down the ferrule and stops

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.680 
the hammer down the ferrule and stops
both<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.800> Ferro<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.130> stops<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.670> make<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:28.450> snug

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
both the Ferro and stops to make it snug

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.559 
both the Ferro and stops to make it snug
with<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.019> wire<00:02:29.230> rope<00:02:29.819> but<00:02:30.819> you<00:02:31.269> can't<00:02:31.480> really

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
with the wire rope but you can't really

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.290 
with the wire rope but you can't really
do<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.840> carpet<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.290> want<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.560> go<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.709> a<00:02:33.300> nice

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
do it a carpet you want to go to a nice

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.860 
do it a carpet you want to go to a nice
flat<00:02:34.780> concrete<00:02:35.530> or<00:02:35.709> cement<00:02:35.950> surface<00:02:36.489> and<00:02:36.870> when

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
flat concrete or cement surface and when

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.240 
flat concrete or cement surface and when
you<00:02:37.959> hammer<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.290> down<00:02:38.410> it'll<00:02:38.920> look<00:02:39.100> pretty

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
you hammer it down it'll look pretty

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:48.090 
you hammer it down it'll look pretty
nice<00:02:39.549> actually<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:46.480> do<00:02:46.660> both<00:02:46.840> sides<00:02:47.100> same

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
nice actually so you do both sides same

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.600 
nice actually so you do both sides same
way<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.640> loop<00:02:48.819> it<00:02:48.940> around<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:53.489> optionally<00:02:54.489> you

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
way to loop it around and optionally you

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.240 
way to loop it around and optionally you
can<00:02:54.730> use<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:55.170> spring<00:02:56.170> links<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.950> kind<00:02:57.190> of

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
can use a spring links to kind of

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.120 
can use a spring links to kind of
connect<00:02:57.519> one<00:02:57.819> end<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:59.440> will<00:02:59.560> come<00:02:59.739> handy<00:02:59.950> in

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
connect one end that will come handy in

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:12.570 
connect one end that will come handy in
some<00:03:00.340> situations

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.970 

so<00:03:13.180> when<00:03:13.300> you<00:03:13.390> make<00:03:13.510> your<00:03:13.570> own<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:14.170> can<00:03:14.350> you

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
so when you make your own you can you

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.950 
so when you make your own you can you
pretty<00:03:15.280> much<00:03:15.400> have<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.670> freedom<00:03:16.390> to<00:03:16.420> use

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
pretty much have the freedom to use

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.350 
pretty much have the freedom to use
whatever<00:03:17.950> length<00:03:18.310> of<00:03:18.460> wire<00:03:18.640> rope<00:03:18.850> you<00:03:18.970> Lycans

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
whatever length of wire rope you Lycans

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.050 
whatever length of wire rope you Lycans
and<00:03:19.660> it's<00:03:19.840> pretty<00:03:20.170> much<00:03:20.260> dirt<00:03:20.620> cheap<00:03:21.060> we're

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
and it's pretty much dirt cheap we're

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:35.100 
and it's pretty much dirt cheap we're
making<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.480> set<00:03:22.720> four<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:24.340> three<00:03:24.490> dollars<00:03:24.730> piece

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:45.250 

that's<00:03:35.800> showing<00:03:36.400> how<00:03:36.580> to<00:03:36.610> spring<00:03:36.940> link<00:03:37.180> works

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.880 

so<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:46.180> suction<00:03:47.180> cup<00:03:47.360> mount<00:03:47.599> is<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.890> pretty

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
so the suction cup mount is a pretty

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.780 
so the suction cup mount is a pretty
handy<00:03:50.560> with<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.680> tether<00:03:51.920> of<00:03:52.250> course<00:03:52.519> because

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
handy with the tether of course because

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.720 
handy with the tether of course because
it<00:03:53.000> might<00:03:53.150> come<00:03:53.330> loose<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:54.610> when<00:03:55.610> you're

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
it might come loose and when you're

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.430 
it might come loose and when you're
tying<00:03:55.909> it<00:03:56.030> around<00:03:56.090> like<00:03:56.510> they're<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:57.049> side

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
tying it around like they're the side

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.080 
tying it around like they're the side
mirror<00:03:57.680> of<00:03:57.799> a<00:03:57.860> car<00:03:58.040> you<00:03:58.340> can<00:03:58.519> just<00:03:58.730> loop<00:03:58.909> around

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
mirror of a car you can just loop around

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.380 
mirror of a car you can just loop around
the<00:03:59.450> the<00:04:00.200> wire<00:04:00.440> rope<00:04:00.620> like<00:04:00.799> that<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:02.120> connect

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
the the wire rope like that and connect

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:09.460 
the the wire rope like that and connect
the<00:04:02.480> other<00:04:02.599> end<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:02.959> suction<00:04:03.739> cup<00:04:08.470> hope

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
the other end to the suction cup hope

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.890 
the other end to the suction cup hope
this<00:04:09.620> helps
