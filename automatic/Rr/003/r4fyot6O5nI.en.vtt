 second battle of omega ruby pokemon and 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.510

 already four things will have been given one 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.320
 battle of three against three that I had in 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.119
 what is the combat area that I was 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.210
 testing what is a new type then to 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.800
 I am fighting guys and as well as 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.930
 they will have read in the title because they will already know 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.340
 what the video is about but I'm not going to 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.500
 plunder but I also want to 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.590
 comment what is an important issue 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.120
 guys we are already very, very close 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.790
 guys to reach 500 subscribers 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.470
 I say close we're still good in front 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.030
 guys I would like to thank you 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.070
 all of you since without your support there 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.450
 we would have arrived this amount that was 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.250
 I know that many say that 500 are 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.920
 few but really for me there are many 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.230
 guys so he added that it's a 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.030
 short not a raffle I'll do something special 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.009
 but really this problem I do not know what 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.390
 I'm going to do so for that maybe 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.520
 question is they would like it to be 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.410
 I did a lottery 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.600
 dynamic or what they would like me to do 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.060
 which is a comment will be taken in 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.920
 account to see what it says it's going to be for a 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.780
 special from Kim Jong subscribers who 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.890
 would come up after this video when 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.860
 let's get to 15 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.420
 guys and well that's the announcement of the day 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.800
 today I can be told guys 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.110
 since I really would like very much your 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.870
 opinion and well let's start with what 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.880
 what is the battle 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.530
 here my continent thinks they are donuts 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.210
 and I started by taking what is to my 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.400
 elements which activates what is the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.810
 intimidation and he cares about the attack of 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.640
 all that really does not matter about 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.710
 a lot since he is a special attacker and 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.650
 not physical and well they did 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.110
 evolve to xala mans in megas besides 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.000
 here really guys I did not think that it 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.610
 will make more debut in both the matches 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.980
 guys but here first web what is 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.690
 the dragon pulse that receives is 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.850
 habituated super effective but look at the 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.560
 damage that I do to part of where we 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.330
 they go for what is the ray that leaves me in 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.830
 the same amount of fish that I what 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.020
 I left him so we paired the 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.850
 things but with a dragon pulse more 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.860
 it will be enough to weaken ashton 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.560
 doubles that if it had not hosted 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.590
 speed I do not know if I get more 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.120
 here to tell you about clans here what 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.010
 what happened is there and what is 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.650
 the pressure skill that will take away more 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.780
 for more movements in each turn and 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.000
 you can see what is the hidden power 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.400
 sinister type since I am very bad going 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.950
 taking out the ones so well then I have this 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.930
 which is a super effective but not 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.680
 we remove a lot is very little and appear 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.680
 but with what is the rest guys 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.290
 aside this does not exist is going to be start 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.079
 to adjust with what is the cosmic mass 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.909
 said this was a very bad situation since 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.799
 that you who came to look for several 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:51.730
 times and to power is not dioxide 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.230
 defensive form that makes it more wiki and 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.730
 well here it takes what is the second most 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.099
 to cosmic and apart it recovers with what 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.260
 which is the rest here I decided to stop 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.819
 do what is the hidden power and so 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.280
 which is the dragon pulse an attack charges 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.290
 subtract and as they saw guys do not say 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.299
 nothing was ports that is what it is 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.010
 stadium exists and what does this I do exist 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.859
 knowing that I can not do much 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.989
 damage decides to go for cosmic mass more than 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.359
 already really is already very bull that with 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.650
 that is three is already too much so 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.389
 now I'm just going so 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.519
 throws flames to try to find what 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:24.340
 it's the burn but I do not get it 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.049
 guys and this one I demand liking yourself is not 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.780
 they realized that the movement in 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.639
 flamethrower guys has changed a lot that 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.859
 I really liked it more as it looks tico 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:35.500
 that in the white test is I loved it 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:37.239
 and so good here yes so you can 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.250
 see or point that as you see guys do not you 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.569
 I do nothing nothing comparison of the 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.249
 first turns 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.170
 What are you doing there gave you clear decides 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:46.180
 how to fuck me the game was going so 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.159
 it's a recovery recovering in the 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.659
 biggest house and the biggest its fish and apart 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.430
 a little more for whatever the rest 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.139
 guys here I've been so it's the 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.269
 power hidden simply to go for a 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:58.150
 super effective and look at these guys a 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.879
 critical grace this critic achieves 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.469
 go down much expresses stadiums csis and by 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.780
 Luckily oxide is so toxic 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:05.980
 that is going to take away a few from me 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.260
 first shifts so I have a few 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.359
 extra shifts that luckily he did not 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.239
 no attack and here but then so 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:15.669
 what is the poisoning and here guys 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.400
 has something magical today so it's a 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:21.459
 dragon pulse and look at all the damage that you 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.289
 we make two critics in a row these are the 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.759
 masses that has happened to me so far 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.800
 I had never been touched what are two 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:28.750
 important critics we get from 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.849
 dioxide interests that was already very 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.280
 look for the defenses now my 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.710
 opponent takes out his king guasa and then 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.840
 that is better for a king 4 boys exact 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.360
 to revolutionize it to 9 wright guasa 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.970
 here he reminds me and I 've already seen a lot 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.710
 which is the competitive one and you can activate 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.110
 what his rafael skill is there 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.210
 protects flying type pokemon and 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.650
 I go for whatever pulse attack 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.979
 drago since that attack is super effective 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:59.639
 and look guys, we managed to avoid 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.770
 one one hit and one critic apart with three 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.690
 critical chips followed guys really 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.960
 I do not know if the critic and has imported a lot 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.060
 no but under one kid and three critics 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.389
 followed in fact for this is the 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.250
