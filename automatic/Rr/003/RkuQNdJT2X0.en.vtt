00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.510 
now so I we really need to get started
the<00:02:16.110> ancient<00:02:16.530> natives<00:02:16.830> use<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.130> technique

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
the ancient natives use this technique

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.280 
the ancient natives use this technique
with<00:02:17.700> their<00:02:17.940> cell<00:02:18.270> phones<00:02:18.569> but<00:02:18.959> it's<00:02:19.080> not

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
with their cell phones but it's not

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.740 
with their cell phones but it's not
always<00:02:19.470> completely<00:02:19.770> accurate<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.849> was<00:02:21.330> off<00:02:21.540> by

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
always completely accurate I was off by

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.100 
always completely accurate I was off by
about<00:02:21.900> six<00:02:22.470> hours<00:02:22.709> I<00:02:23.300> have<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.480> work<00:02:24.599> hastily

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
about six hours I have to work hastily

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.110 
about six hours I have to work hastily
because<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.620> Sun<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:25.860> going<00:02:26.130> down<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:27.090> need

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
because the Sun is going down and I need

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.820 
because the Sun is going down and I need
something<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.840> protect<00:02:27.930> me<00:02:28.380> from<00:02:28.470> all<00:02:28.650> the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
something to protect me from all the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.530 
something to protect me from all the
Predators<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.959> aliens<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:33.330> I've<00:02:33.390> been

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
Predators and aliens so I've been

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.140 
Predators and aliens so I've been
working<00:02:33.780> about<00:02:33.840> five<00:02:34.170> hours<00:02:34.200> now<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:36.060> think

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
working about five hours now and I think

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.150 
working about five hours now and I think
I<00:02:36.420> think<00:02:36.959> I<00:02:36.989> got<00:02:37.140> enough<00:02:37.170> shelter<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:37.860> last<00:02:38.040> me

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
I think I got enough shelter to last me

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:46.670 
I think I got enough shelter to last me
the<00:02:38.190> night<00:02:38.959> yeah

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.339 

but<00:02:47.280> it's<00:02:47.430> no<00:02:47.579> time<00:02:47.849> for<00:02:47.909> rest<00:02:48.299> I<00:02:48.719> have<00:02:49.109> to<00:02:49.260> get

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
but it's no time for rest I have to get

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:57.319 
but it's no time for rest I have to get
moving<00:02:55.340> this<00:02:56.340> terrain<00:02:56.640> is<00:02:56.760> incredibly

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
moving this terrain is incredibly

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.360 
moving this terrain is incredibly
disorientating<00:02:58.319> but<00:02:58.620> luckily<00:02:58.829> I<00:02:59.099> can

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
disorientating but luckily I can

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.670 
disorientating but luckily I can
navigate<00:02:59.549> using<00:02:59.939> the<00:03:00.120> Stars<00:03:00.349> so<00:03:01.349> if<00:03:01.409> you<00:03:01.530> can

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
navigate using the Stars so if you can

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.530 
navigate using the Stars so if you can
find<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.099> star<00:03:02.370> all<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:03.060> have<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.299> do<00:03:03.420> is

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
find the star all you have to do is

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.349 
find the star all you have to do is
follow<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:04.109> and<00:03:04.319> it<00:03:04.469> will<00:03:04.590> always<00:03:05.189> always<00:03:05.549> lead

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
follow it and it will always always lead

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:12.459 
follow it and it will always always lead
you<00:03:06.389> home<00:03:07.069> fifty<00:03:08.069> percent<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.609> time

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:12.469 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.050 

unfortunately<00:03:13.469> for<00:03:13.680> me<00:03:13.829> this<00:03:14.519> was<00:03:14.670> not<00:03:14.879> one<00:03:15.030> of

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
unfortunately for me this was not one of

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.219 
unfortunately for me this was not one of
those<00:03:15.239> times<00:03:15.620> I'm<00:03:16.620> completely<00:03:17.069> lost
