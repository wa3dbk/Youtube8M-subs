one 1/2 inch 120,000 thick do you I'm to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.289 
one 1/2 inch 120,000 thick do you I'm to
eat<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:32.009> key<00:01:32.220> here<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.640> these<00:01:32.970> brackets

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
eat the key here is that these brackets

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.840 
eat the key here is that these brackets
aren't<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:33.960> welded<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.250> tube<00:01:35.460> and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
aren't just welded on to the tube and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.630 
aren't just welded on to the tube and
I'm<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.750> outside<00:01:37.049> surface<00:01:37.640> technically

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
I'm to the outside surface technically

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.390 
I'm to the outside surface technically
they're<00:01:38.850> their<00:01:39.270> channel<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.890> turbine<00:01:41.220> is

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
they're their channel and the turbine is

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.319 
they're their channel and the turbine is
laser<00:01:41.640> cut<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:43.159> this<00:01:44.159> bracket<00:01:44.579> fits<00:01:44.880> inside

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
laser cut and this bracket fits inside

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.240 
laser cut and this bracket fits inside
the<00:01:46.020> tubing<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:47.000> then<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.299> welded<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.250> this

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
the tubing and then it is welded so this

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.719 
the tubing and then it is welded so this
bracket<00:01:51.149> comes<00:01:51.360> through<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.610> touches<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
bracket comes through and touches the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.789 
bracket comes through and touches the
radius<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.390> outside<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.960> tubing<00:01:55.290> so

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
radius of the outside of the tubing so

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.590 
radius of the outside of the tubing so
that<00:01:55.979> bracket<00:01:56.219> goes<00:01:56.520> through<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.090> tubing<00:01:57.509> it

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that bracket goes through that tubing it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.800 
that bracket goes through that tubing it
becomes<00:01:58.049> part<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.979> tubing<00:01:59.369> in<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.630> whole

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
becomes part of the tubing in the whole

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.400 
becomes part of the tubing in the whole
assembly<00:02:01.320> making<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.920> much<00:02:02.040> stronger

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.680 

real<00:02:07.220> quickly<00:02:07.490> here<00:02:10.090> we'll<00:02:11.090> take<00:02:11.270> this<00:02:11.420> board

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
real quickly here we'll take this board

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:25.210 
real quickly here we'll take this board
yeah<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:16.580> you<00:02:17.120> can<00:02:17.240> say<00:02:23.470> unable<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.620> jack<00:02:24.950> this

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
yeah and you can say unable to jack this

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.960 
yeah and you can say unable to jack this

of my floor jack now what I love this
there<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:42.950> slight<00:02:43.460> deflection<00:02:44.180> in<00:02:44.270> that<00:02:44.450> to

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
there is a slight deflection in that to

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.320 
there is a slight deflection in that to
me<00:02:45.010> but<00:02:46.010> it's<00:02:46.130> still<00:02:46.340> not<00:02:46.490> coming<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.850> contact

me but it's still not coming to contact

me but it's still not coming to contact
for<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.540> body<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.140> thing<00:02:48.710> is<00:02:48.890> when<00:02:49.190> that

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
for the body and the thing is when that

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.010 
for the body and the thing is when that
is<00:02:49.520> released<00:02:49.790> that<00:02:50.240> tubing<00:02:50.600> will<00:02:50.750> spring

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
right back to its original shape but

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.270 
right back to its original shape but
that's<00:02:53.750> how<00:02:53.900> strong<00:02:54.290> they<00:02:54.590> are<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.100> can

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
that's how strong they are that you can

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.280 
that's how strong they are that you can
technically<00:02:55.790> lift<00:02:56.210> this<00:02:56.330> machine<00:02:56.720> up<00:02:56.870> if<00:02:57.050> you

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
technically lift this machine up if you

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.920 
technically lift this machine up if you
even<00:02:57.470> got<00:02:57.770> in<00:02:58.160> a<00:02:58.340> jam<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.910> were<00:02:59.330> buried<00:02:59.630> down

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.970 
even got in a jam and were buried down
to<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.170> frame<00:03:00.380> when<00:03:00.590> you<00:03:00.650> get<00:03:00.740> a<00:03:00.770> little<00:03:00.920> bit

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
to the frame when you get a little bit

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.680 
to the frame when you get a little bit
of<00:03:01.100> space<00:03:01.310> you<00:03:01.550> could<00:03:01.670> put<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:01.910> jack<00:03:02.240> underneath

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
of space you could put a jack underneath

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.020 
of space you could put a jack underneath
these<00:03:02.930> bars<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.590> Jack<00:03:04.100> that<00:03:04.340> machine<00:03:04.670> up<00:03:04.880> if

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
these bars and Jack that machine up if

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.130 
these bars and Jack that machine up if
you<00:03:05.180> needed<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.510> get<00:03:05.600> something<00:03:05.870> underneath

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
you needed to get something underneath

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.770 
you needed to get something underneath
the<00:03:06.320> tires<00:03:06.530> for<00:03:06.860> traction<00:03:06.890> or<00:03:07.570> be<00:03:08.570> able<00:03:08.660> to

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
the tires for traction or be able to

the tires for traction or be able to
pull<00:03:08.930> yourself<00:03:09.020> all<00:03:09.500> or<00:03:09.740> even<00:03:10.190> if<00:03:10.280> you<00:03:10.370> need<00:03:10.490> to

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
pull yourself all or even if you need to

jack<00:03:10.850> it<00:03:10.880> up<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.330> change<00:03:11.690> your<00:03:11.780> tire<00:03:12.020> and<00:03:12.050> you

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
jack it up and change your tire and you

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.170 
jack it up and change your tire and you
can't<00:03:12.560> get<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.800> stuff<00:03:12.980> underneath<00:03:13.280> but<00:03:14.030> you

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
can't get the stuff underneath but you

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.230 
can't get the stuff underneath but you
can<00:03:14.330> see<00:03:14.540> that's<00:03:14.720> how<00:03:14.959> strong<00:03:15.290> these<00:03:15.500> bars<00:03:15.860> are

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
can see that's how strong these bars are

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.130 
can see that's how strong these bars are
they<00:03:17.240> come<00:03:17.390> with<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.570> option<00:03:17.600> of<00:03:17.990> being

come in a in a satin black finish that

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.840 
come in a in a satin black finish that
will<00:03:24.050> do<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.709> very<00:03:24.890> good<00:03:24.980> job<00:03:25.100> of<00:03:25.250> mimicking<00:03:25.820> the

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
will do a very good job of mimicking the

will do a very good job of mimicking the
roll<00:03:26.570> bars<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.590> bumper<00:03:27.920> assembly<00:03:27.980> so<00:03:28.910> it

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
roll bars and the bumper assembly so it

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.310 
roll bars and the bumper assembly so it
should<00:03:29.270> pretty<00:03:29.450> much<00:03:29.540> blend<00:03:29.870> in<00:03:30.020> with<00:03:30.200> the

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
should pretty much blend in with the

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.620 
should pretty much blend in with the
rest<00:03:30.350> of<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.709> machine<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:32.120> that's<00:03:32.450> what

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630
