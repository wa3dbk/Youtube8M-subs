00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.500
 Finns and an important nuance is not excluded that 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.240
 Oleg 8 Russians Head Coach 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.310
 will have to hold today's final 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.380
 match on the podium among the spectators to him 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.180

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.900

 Alexander Lyakin Russia in the final on the way 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.099

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.079
 matches on the eve defeated Sweden win 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.910
 sure and albeit difficult and sufficient 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.790
 say that the puck at our gate is swede 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.620
 already scored 19 seconds is 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.940
 discouraging beginnings of anyone 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.399
 could knock out 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.200
 a little bit nervous therefore us 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.539
 missed but then they took you hands 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.500
 after probably 10 minutes of the first period 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.539
 have already transferred the game 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.680
 another zone and started to play confidently and 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.079
 brought the matter to victory 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.090
 mlechina helped they did not shut up not 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.100
 offered enough to hold right after 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.989
 goals and we had to somehow set up 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.150
 our game and you did it only 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.369
 on the 14th minute we abandoned the response 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.680
 washer Sergei carpenters was one on 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.070
 right wing received a pass and composition of the corner 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.930
 calmly hit the gate 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.970
 but the key moment of the match and our players 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.270
 and coaches consider the beginning of the second period 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.979
 when losing already 21 Swedes staged 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.640
 real assault Sergey's turn 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.009
 Bobrovsky 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.940
 At first the holes were thrown into the left corner with 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.560
 close distance 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.940
 and then miller literally point-blank 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.340
 shot the gate 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.200
 but our goalkeeper showed fantastic 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.200
 reaction caught the puck into the trap 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.570
 and then everything is on a subconscious level here 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.890
 hard to describe how something feels like 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.630
 it turned out that it is only possible 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.730
 look at the camera already something 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.620
 analyze loses 31 Swedes 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.930
 provoked a scandal that eventually 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.980
 can leave the Russian national team final 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.960
 match without a coach 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.030
 it all started with the croatian michael 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.370
 cormorant deleted our sergei carpenter 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.950
 blow like not strong but player national team 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.140
 Russia falls Swedish coaches shout about 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.210
 simulations but by sweat in the film on 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.710
 a few seconds ago we see how 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.900
 after the strongest throw 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.030
 a lot of Sergei carpenter hits the puck 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.370
 after which Sergey is barely holding on 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.110
 the ice 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.060
 all this is the main coach of Russia Oleg 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.160
 Znarok probably too emotionally gave 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.560
 understand the Swedes that offended their players 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.570
 he will not give for this gesture 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.490
 be disqualified for the last match 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.880
 and without it our team will be very 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.410
 hard for himself at hand said that the Swedes are not 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.200
 losing and of course regretted my 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.690
 incontinence and tried to laugh it off 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.300
 eagles dishes and if they want to create 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.120
 it's very cold here in coaching 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.540
 skype Venus to chuchka very thin 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.180
 constantly on the ice like a guy I will light a candle 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.190
 lsir question from the Russian national team coach 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.739
 will be decided today on disciplinary 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.170
 Committee and the Swedes already rush, comment 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.830

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.840
 expect 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.610
 Guide for the Russian team do not regret 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.400
 laudatory words Russian team 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.680
 almost impossible to stop sweden 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.420
 there was no chance Russia did not play 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.610

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.640
 it remains only to bow to them and 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.650
 hope for bronze tomorrow of course 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.600
 men's team which finished the final 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.640
 Far Czechs do not agree with this assessment 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.890
 or really want to recoup their 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.930
