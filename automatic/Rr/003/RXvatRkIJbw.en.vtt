00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.619
 What treatment do we recommend from cellular medicine? 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.590
 locke advise test supply 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.230
 the cellular fuel 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.479
 to the millions of cells 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:31.659
 that make up the arterial walls 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:35.429
 guaranteeing in this way the optimal functioning of the same 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.770
 these recommendations not only serve to correct 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.380
 the origin of the problem of hypertension 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.890
 but also to prevent 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.510
 some of the micronutrients especially useful are the machines 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.990
 vitamin c 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.440
 the magnesium 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.050
 and the fast trails pool and hill especially 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.470
 but there are also other micronutrients that we could use 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.420
 several of these micronutrients this time the ones to produce 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.180
 relaxation factors 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.220
 comas the nitric deposit 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.450
 that reduces the tension of the walls of the blood vessels 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.520
 and normalize attention 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.250
 the fine for example 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.000
 is an amino acid that favors the production of ee of this pok sim 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.030
 politician 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.409
 and what to comment 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:21.890
 the one that the exquisite 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.130
 the capacity of 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.539
 p widening 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:25.960
 of the arterial walls 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.420
 contributing in that way 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.549
 to normalize 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.150
 blood pressure 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.860
 vitamin c 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.380
 stimulates the production of 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.720
 prostatic mine 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.939
 a small molecule that has 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.929
 let's say 2 utilities 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.040
 in cases of blood pressure 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.369
 on the one hand relax the arterial walls 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.470
 and on the other optimist 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.500
 the viscosity level of the Andes 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.750
 Magnesium is the natural calcium antagonist 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.450
 and is fundamental in the metabolism justification 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.820
 of the minerals in the cells that make up the couple arteries 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.210
 without this balance 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.280
 said walls 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.939
 they could not relax 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.330
 and therefore the tension could not be regulated 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.010
 the bike on the hill are two amino acids that protect the walls 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.859
 arterial 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:16.129
 and prevent the onset arteriosclerotic cas 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.250
 it's about two 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.590
 fundamental micro nutrients since jail and sclerosis 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.660
 closely related 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.660
 with high voltage 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:28.829
 of garbage 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.010
 percent and prevent in pinamar 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.059
 widening feet thought of the fed 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:37.899
 the judicial of these and other micronutrients 100 people with 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:38.749
 high tension 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:42.899
 it has been shown on countless occasions but there may be a study 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:45.469
 carry out by cell medicine 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:48.559
 the study was performed with 15 patients 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:50.619
 who suffer from hypertension 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:53.389
 whose ages fluctuated between the 32 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.359
 kilos 69 years 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.209
 and lasted 32 weeks that is seven months 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.639
 soon 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.010
 it was controlled to the attention of all of them 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.419
 biweekly 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.449
 and the average tension its historical 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:08.099
 inside the patients 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.329
 who intervened in the experiment 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.749
 it was at the beginning of 16 as 7 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:15.669
 or 167 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:20.180
 and the average ten-day stress of nine as 7 with 97 

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:25.469
 At the end of the study all patients improved their detention levels 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:27.679
 systolic mean 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:29.169
 I hate to get 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:30.729
 of 14 comma 2 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:32.370
 and the diastolic the low 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.199
 of eight battles to say 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:37.379
 around a 15 percent improvement in tension 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.149
 All this 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:42.949
 yes side effects that we know can cause 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:47.229
 per cent the chemical drugs that are used precisely for the same for 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:50.069
 regulate tension with can be dizziness 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.589
 and many other health problems 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:56.939
 many other long-term DNA studies have shown that individuals 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.969
 who control their hypertension with natural means 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:02.029
 without chemical drugs 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:05.140
 they are in better health conditions than those who ingest 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.140
 medications prescribed by your conventional doctors 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:12.629
 this is because blood pressure is 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.799
 like many other signs and symptoms of our body 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.299
 an advert 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.500
 about some negative aspect 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.240
 of our lifestyle 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.909
 and cell medicine 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.030
 have demonstrated 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.949
 what s negative aspect 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:28.830
 the 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.479
 insufficiency 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.379
 I defined as nutrients 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:34.939
 on the walls ten years ago 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:37.889
 when that lack is adequately supplied 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.550
 the problem has to disappear 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.259
 contrary to what many people think 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.479
 no chemical medication 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.620
 use it for hypertension 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.990
 is focused on his healing 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.249
 but simply in decreasing the blood pressure figures 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:56.199
 without taking into account two factors 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:00.759
 underlying is to say the causes of why stress apart from holy art 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:02.800
 that's the reason 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.380
 hello what the patients who start a chemical treatment or by logical framework 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.259
 you can never stop taking it 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.470
 since the tension your life 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.599
 again and immediately 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:15.779
 at the time 

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:20.089
 in which they suspend the treatment since the treatment does not prevent the 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:22.129
 true solution to the problem 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:25.139
 the body knows what 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.050
 with relieve blood pressure levels 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.949
 surely this fulfills an important objective that we do not know 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:36.909
 how to perform certain functions that are impossible to carry out in 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:37.900
 an organism 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.080
 with the lowest voltage 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.819
 and it's safe 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:44.170
 that lower blood pressure 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.610
 artificially 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.069
 it can have negative consequences 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:52.410
 when the true cause disappears the body itself see the need 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.319
 dt again balance the blood pressure 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:58.400
 and everything will return to normal 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.710
 for all of this he encouraged him to start a micronutrient treatment for his 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.330
 kind of attention 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.610
 it is not advisable that you start by administering 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:12.219
 in 2000 with breakers of which I have spoken and others 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:13.699
 either way 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:17.759
 since this could cause a pin biochemical imbalance that your body 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:19.860
 It is important 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.839
 to consider two things 

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:25.160
 how many quantities do you need for each day 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.869
 micronutrient decade 

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:28.800
 as well as the combination 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.669
 adequate 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:30.919
 of all of them 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:32.749
 in order to get a relationship 

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:34.009
 synergistic 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:38.300
 that potentiates the beneficial defects of the micronutrients that 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.800
 needs to 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.720
 so 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.710
 If you want to start a treatment 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.449
 for high tension with the cell rider 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:50.369
 The most prudent thing is to look for a cell medicine consultant in the area 

00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:51.520
 in which he lives 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.979
 or who gets in touch 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:55.740
 we will inform you 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.849
 of the best combinations of product and entities that can take 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:02.419
 as well as the way to do it 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:04.629
 when you start a treatment 

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:06.879
 with these micronutrients 

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:09.189
 you must tell your doctor 

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:12.610
 should tell him he's taking vitamins and other things 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.869
 to try to improve health 

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:18.129
 and it does not stop you from taking the chemical drugs that you have recommended 

00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:21.879
 until there is some improvement 

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:23.850
 when a few weeks passed 

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.349
 your tension is regulated 

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:29.810
 It's time to ask your doctor to tell you in what way 

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:34.430
 Haitian progressively reducing medication 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.460
 chemistry that he recommended 

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.460
 I hope that you have not been of is a complexion 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.400
 I'm sure 

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.189
 that it will also be for people in their environment 

00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:45.080
 whereby 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.300
 bp would say 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.880
 I did not hesitate to contact me if I wish 

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:55.630
 thank you very much for reading this fear and wished you have punk very good day
