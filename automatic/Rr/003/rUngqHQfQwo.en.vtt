the other fruits around them make sure

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.550 
the other fruits around them make sure

you keep them moist don't let them dry

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.600 
you keep them moist don't let them dry
out<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:13.020> best<00:02:13.200> thing<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.530> do<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:13.950> water

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
out and the best thing to do is water

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.110 
out and the best thing to do is water
them<00:02:14.850> with<00:02:15.060> rainwater<00:02:16.430> this<00:02:17.430> is<00:02:17.580> because<00:02:17.760> our

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
them with rainwater this is because our

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.030 
them with rainwater this is because our
tap<00:02:18.390> water<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.870> generally<00:02:19.650> very<00:02:19.680> hard<00:02:20.510> and

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
tap water is generally very hard and

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.949 
tap water is generally very hard and
rainwater<00:02:23.040> already<00:02:23.820> has<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> better<00:02:24.270> acidity

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
rainwater already has a better acidity

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.680 
rainwater already has a better acidity
level<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:26.430> keeps<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.820> blueberries<00:02:27.239> nice<00:02:27.450> and

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
level so keeps the blueberries nice and

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.430 
level so keeps the blueberries nice and
happy<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.739> also<00:02:28.920> need<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.370> grow<00:02:29.930> at<00:02:30.930> least<00:02:31.170> two

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
happy you also need to grow at least two

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.930 
happy you also need to grow at least two
blueberries<00:02:31.980> together<00:02:32.989> and<00:02:33.989> if<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.940> have
