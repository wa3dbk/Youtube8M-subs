00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.720 
similar than yesterday afternoon maybe
little<00:00:24.269> bit<00:00:24.390> less<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:24.920> not<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> big<00:00:26.250> different

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
button and then immediately I get that

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.889 
button and then immediately I get that
feeling<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.929> had<00:00:31.260> yesterday<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.660> and<00:00:33.660> you

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
feeling that I had yesterday and and you

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.740 
feeling that I had yesterday and and you

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
know which is something that was

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.900 
know which is something that was
positive<00:00:36.750> points<00:00:37.410> also<00:00:37.980> somewhere<00:00:38.700> at<00:00:38.760> this

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
positive points also somewhere at this

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.299 
positive points also somewhere at this
point<00:00:39.149> but<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:40.230> most<00:00:40.379> important<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:40.950> we

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.650 
so comfortable so why we need to change
if<00:02:20.530> we<00:02:20.770> waited<00:02:21.040> if<00:02:21.670> I<00:02:21.820> feel<00:02:22.000> good<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.360> think<00:02:22.570> we

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
if we waited if I feel good I think we

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.720 
if we waited if I feel good I think we
need<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.810> keep<00:02:23.020> like<00:02:23.200> that<00:02:23.380> but<00:02:24.250> should<00:02:24.460> have<00:02:24.700> a

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
need to keep like that but should have a

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.150 
need to keep like that but should have a
small<00:02:25.000> thing<00:02:25.240> that<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.720> think<00:02:26.590> still<00:02:26.920> we<00:02:27.010> can

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
small thing that I think still we can

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.280 
small thing that I think still we can
