 hi friends with you real gamer and 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.490
 Today we talk about the game master of a 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.830
 raven 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.130
 Much time has passed and I would like to 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.019
 find out how is being developed and what 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.599
 developers share with us 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.520
 let's start with the developers once submitted 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.869
 race was rati and screenshots and her 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.609
 Representatives were at the army known as 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.099
 aggressive conquerors of the galaxy 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.900
 who rely in battle on their power 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.519
 and physical strength 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.529
 they always seek to be on defense 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.719
 weak due to attempts to reconcile these 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.270
 parties were crayfish often fall into 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.790
 trouble in the galaxy 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.430
 You can read more about this. 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.820
 race its description on the official forum 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.090
 or group in contact there to the fullest 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.010
 told about this race also 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.960
 developers have introduced races of people a 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.739
 most likely just one screenshot and 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.260
 a description of this race was presented 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.690
 race marshan headed which stand 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.270
 empresses possessing ruthless and 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.489
 belligerent character but also among 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.010
 many posts can even be found 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.380
 adviser alkari what is in my 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.650
 opinion of the most interesting information 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.170
 this is a battle fleet and will grow here we are 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.869
 we can see a lot of ships and a lot 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.119
 read about their particular models 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.580
 ships drawn quite well 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.320
 and apparently in the game they will 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.810
 look even better 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.159
 developers also talked a bit about 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.549
 types of planets more precisely introduced us to 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.509
 Earth- like planets for such planets 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.759
 characteristic flooded flora and fauna 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.610
 much of the surface of the planet 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.700
 busy cover well 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.500
 on the schedule also looks enough 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.470
 cute after the last e3 show 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.360
 developers gave a small interview in 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.340
 which told that this game before 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.969
 just designed to 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.920
 give opportunities to the new generation 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:01.829
 read it and that they choose 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.689
 this is the game we would like it to be 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.360
 It became the same experience on which we 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.070
 we ourselves have grown this is probably the most 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.470
 complicated 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.690
 have the whole project in fact we can 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.690
 completely free to use everything 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.340
 original stories all original times 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.100
 and the developers said 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.700
 I think the master of orion's toy 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.410
 new guise will only get better the 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.420
