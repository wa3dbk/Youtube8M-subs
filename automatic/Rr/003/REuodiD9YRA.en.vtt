00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.910
 haidar 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.879
 so in kabul the first news channel on the internet 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.710
 not only in pointing out that we operate explained we have commented on 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.650
 gives his point of view in relation 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.460
 to the situation of the dollar that the tanks go 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.329
 - parity has always been constant 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.410
 however for something inexplicable 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.620
 why 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.570
 that was solina another gasoline the united states our weight always 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.480
 devalue 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.230
 if there are already financial problems going on 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.200
 because and say the great geniuses 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.700
 of the finances that 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.690
 We are solid and we do not have to be afraid because our PC 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.190
 it always devalues 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.460
 the peso came to be at 14 15 pesos debt 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.630
 to buy a dollar 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.940
 and whenever this is a difficult economic situation always to our 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.970
 affected staff then we have not been talking to the truth 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.330
 if there was ever a president who has left 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.260
 was to liquidate debts 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.030
 have more reservations 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.570
 Very substantial in the United States 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.030
 well, that does not only serve to strengthen our economy for a moment 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.060
 since there is some 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.150
 some anomaly 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.300
 however now in that situation do not look 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.790
 dollar is very bad 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.620
 our weight 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.870
 it is valued 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.740
 everything is when we are going to be us for example the pain the right thing would be 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.330
 the Spanish bonus at 14 pesos 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.200
 that our perez 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.660
 that it was 5 pesos 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.829
 but values ​​are implanted the weight of us 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.750
 these do not explain finances well 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.950
 first I thought on the one hand 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.150
 that Shannon fortified curly we are not afraid to dry himself sat 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.090
 two of them 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.120
 and the weight of the ball 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.660
 now economically in the market the shares and anywhere 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.260
 What you pay for a health role for the services 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:16.680
 at least one more year 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.269
 they are not the raw material 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.470
 itil but for the new price you go down everything are decreasing everything you 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:27.590
 shopping and the price does not comment the hairs although in those walks less 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.159
 4 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.409
 that in the end affects our economy because it has been bought 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:39.969
 it's sanitary paper so the example they have - mileage 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.969
 and they are smaller and they charge me the same 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.709
 here the prophecy also I do not know well what plan comes true and in relation to the 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.519
 dollar this manifests 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.989
 because because our weight is always down without trying it killer said up 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.980
 we have commented until the federal authorities there is nothing that 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.249
 be 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:02.789
 but to which they tell us 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:05.889
 that we have great reserves and that we are not afraid 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.379
 to the economic problem that his childhood passed by the question of goods 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:10.209
 estate 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.579
 and yet our but it is devalued 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.199
 They do not explain that and in our DNA, and analysts from Mexico 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.199
 financial 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.449
 that otherwise otherwise gil by politicians talk about another 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.329
 there is a connivance between them 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.119
 precisely because why we do not talk to the truth if we actually have 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:33.119
 big reserves and effectively we should not worry 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:37.319
 that these gentlemen on the other side have problems because we evaluate 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.629
 stumble 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.629
 because the weight shoes offense 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:47.659
 this can only clarify is denouncing a debate without a talk 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.059
 pleasant chat 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:50.330
 in a conversation 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.390
 with the person who is going to be the ones because of this but what is a monologue 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:59.870
 it is not a dialogue visit the militiamen are the dialogues because manolo 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.650
 two years later they are justified 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.879
 but there is no one to control 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.590
 so what is required is a dialogue of people identified with 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.099
 politician 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:10.630
 the giant 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.000
 we say hello, thank you
