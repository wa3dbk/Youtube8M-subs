issues of food safety that relate to the

issues of food safety that relate to the
presence<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.240> potentially<00:00:18.900> dangerous

chemical contaminants and foods one of

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.090 
chemical contaminants and foods one of
the<00:00:21.480> most<00:00:21.630> important<00:00:22.080> principles<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:22.890> deal

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
the most important principles we deal

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.980 
the most important principles we deal
with<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.910> concept<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.539> dose<00:00:24.960> makes

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
with is the concept that the dose makes

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.380 
with is the concept that the dose makes
the<00:00:25.470> poison<00:00:25.590> it's<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.430> amount<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.180> chemical

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the poison it's the amount of a chemical

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.300 
the poison it's the amount of a chemical
not<00:00:27.930> its<00:00:28.109> presence<00:00:28.529> or<00:00:28.650> absence<00:00:28.680> that

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
not its presence or absence that

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.640 
not its presence or absence that
determines<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> potential<00:00:30.390> for<00:00:30.570> harm<00:00:30.779> this

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
determines the potential for harm this

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.229 
determines the potential for harm this
is<00:00:31.830> particularly<00:00:32.279> important<00:00:32.969> when<00:00:33.059> we<00:00:33.210> talk

is particularly important when we talk

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.720 
is particularly important when we talk
about<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.050> presence<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.559> very<00:00:34.920> small<00:00:35.340> amounts

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
about the presence of very small amounts

about the presence of very small amounts
of<00:00:35.820> chemicals<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.570> our<00:00:36.989> food<00:00:37.050> supply<00:00:37.590> since

detecting them the more important

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.569 
detecting them the more important
question<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:42.149> what<00:00:43.050> risks<00:00:43.530> if<00:00:43.739> any<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.430> these
