00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:13.239
 In that time offered for the Super Nintendo groundbreaking Grafweg with the help of the 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:18.130
 The NY Post was offered super-six chips over 2 additional contacts 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.900
 other titles like Sio 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.900
 not something like that 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.400
 what characterized Nico was in sequences 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.600
 I would have to wear with these women 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.600
 really has goose bumps 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.860
 out of the hangar into the battle 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.860
 been 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.420
 Dr 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.360
 b 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.510
 sda always the first 3d shooter even on consoles ever and offered thanks to the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.510
 new technology a feel like it had never experienced before 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.940
 Bremen 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.070
 Dr 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.590
 Wherever she got, I can not directly influence much of her 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.240
 but accordingly in aiming something despite the occasional nixdorf 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.600
 seen today is very good from the gameplay 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.830
 these stars 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.560
 There are a total of three glasses of protective systems one can weigh each 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.400
 and you have the opportunity to post and slow down the ship 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.490
 As you can see, it was not always about the ball but also 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.880
 Skill others only had to maneuver the ships 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.880
 and then the rbi share blow up 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.080
 spent in the studio 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.080
 he is very well that's not a nice word 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.570
 There are three different routes to the enemy's planets 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.079
 Every route has its own level of difficulty 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:14.639
 also the branching over the entrances and black holes like every good one 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.319
 come after three quarters of an hour playing time go 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.939
 but not values ​​really steep there is right to the point 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.269
 Norrington is now an absolute cult status, we rejoice and beast 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.469
 will come out sometime on the Virtual Console 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:34.199
 Unfortunately we can only use Super Nintendo at the moment 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:38.019
 It's worth it in any case because it makes a lot of fun such meadows 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.859
 Stefan Madsen 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.539
 he did that July I say goodbye to one of the 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.629
 biggest pixel explosion on the Super Nintendo soon 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:05.549
