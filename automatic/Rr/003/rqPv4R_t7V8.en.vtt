pulled<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.080> motor<00:00:31.260> out<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.059> I<00:00:33.059> popped<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
pulled a motor out and I popped the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.060 
pulled a motor out and I popped the
cover<00:00:33.809> off<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:35.149> gear<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:37.079> gear<00:00:37.320> assembly<00:00:37.620> or

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
cover off the gear the gear assembly or

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.389 
cover off the gear the gear assembly or
the<00:00:38.129> gear<00:00:38.460> housing<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.940> guess<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:40.250> this<00:00:41.250> is

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
the gear housing I guess and this is

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.130 
the gear housing I guess and this is
what<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.579> found

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.080 

yeah<00:00:46.140> knocked<00:00:46.980> some<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> rust<00:00:47.579> off<00:00:47.730> there

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
yeah knocked some of the rust off there

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
yeah knocked some of the rust off there
already<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.660> could<00:00:48.840> see<00:00:49.050> some<00:00:49.980> purely<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
already as you could see some purely a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.380 
already as you could see some purely a
pretty<00:00:52.110> big<00:00:52.350> pieces<00:00:52.680> anyway<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:53.699> yeah

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
pretty big pieces anyway so yeah

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.650 
pretty big pieces anyway so yeah
that's<00:00:55.260> what<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.530> found<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.280> found<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.390> water

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
that's what I found I found that water

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.500 
that's what I found I found that water
have<00:00:57.899> gotten<00:00:58.230> inside<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.640> casing<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.270> it

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
have gotten inside the the casing and it

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.830 
have gotten inside the the casing and it
had<00:01:00.690> swollen<00:01:01.020> up<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:02.149> that's<00:01:03.149> what<00:01:03.359> shut<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
had swollen up and that's what shut the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.929 
had swollen up and that's what shut the
whole<00:01:04.049> motor<00:01:04.350> down<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.979> anyways<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.400> tested<00:01:05.850> it

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
whole motor down so anyways I tested it

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.630 
whole motor down so anyways I tested it
again<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.540> see<00:01:06.750> if<00:01:07.340> removing<00:01:08.340> some<00:01:08.520> of

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
again just to see if removing some of

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.730 
again just to see if removing some of
this<00:01:08.700> rust<00:01:09.060> were<00:01:09.360> done<00:01:09.740> were<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:12.409> make<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.439> work

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
this rust were done were to make it work

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.690 
this rust were done were to make it work
or<00:01:14.070> let<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.520> work<00:01:14.760> or<00:01:15.000> let<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.330> run<00:01:15.509> free<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.700> to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
or let it work or let it run free and to

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.749 
or let it work or let it run free and to
no<00:01:17.820> avail<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.890> rest<00:01:20.070> got<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.400> there<00:01:20.610> I'm

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
no avail so the rest got in there I'm

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.600 
no avail so the rest got in there I'm
pretty<00:01:21.000> sure<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.479> other<00:01:21.659> parts<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
pretty sure it's in other parts of the

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.399 
pretty sure it's in other parts of the
the<00:01:23.610> motor<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.240> I'm<00:01:24.479> going<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.780> be<00:01:24.990> taking<00:01:25.290> off

you guys's problems also so you know
pull<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> motor<00:01:44.909> out<00:01:45.170> if<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.320> see<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> lot<00:01:46.770> of

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
pull the motor out if you see a lot of

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.499 
pull the motor out if you see a lot of
corrosion<00:01:47.280> which<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.549> did<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.939> mean<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.360> is

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
corrosion which I did I mean this is

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.780 
corrosion which I did I mean this is
what<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.750> looked<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:49.020> from<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.159> backside

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
what it looked like from the backside

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.050 
what it looked like from the backside
and<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.920> had<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> suspicion<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.579> there<00:01:53.939> was

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
and I had a suspicion that there was

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.670 
and I had a suspicion that there was
rust<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.659> inside<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.200> pulled<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.590> off

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
rust on the inside so I pulled it off

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.569 
rust on the inside so I pulled it off
and<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:56.579> behold<00:01:56.969> there<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.649> yes<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:59.070> I'm

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
and on behold there it is yes so I'm

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.800 
and on behold there it is yes so I'm
going<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.790> have<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.969> try<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.180> track<00:02:00.479> down<00:02:00.689> one

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
going to have to try to track down one

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.899 
going to have to try to track down one
of<00:02:00.930> these<00:02:00.990> motors<00:02:01.350> now<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.909> reassemble

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
of these motors now and reassemble

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.209 
of these motors now and reassemble
everything<00:02:03.500> for<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.590> meantime<00:02:05.040> I'm<00:02:05.130> gonna

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
everything for the meantime I'm gonna

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.709
