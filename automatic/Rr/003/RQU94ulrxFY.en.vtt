00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.849
 hello friends look at something yo yo 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.500
 I'm going to make a bikini cake and the 

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:14.100
 ingredients are ham in sweet cheese 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:18.000
 eggs butter milk salt and the 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.780
 Sunday and apart a mold 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.780
 and aluminum foil 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.930
 the first thing we're going to do though is 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.640
 a silicone mold I like 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.520
 forever 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:38.100
 pass a little butter to 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.100
 who does not want anything hooked 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.200
 for now let's beat 2 eggs 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:51.140
 and now we put a little salt and nothing 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.140
 a splash of milk 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.540
 we are not going to give success 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.480
 we already have the eggs beaten and now what 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.480
 what we are going to do is take the slices 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:14.590
 and this has to be put to the simple 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:16.710
 of edge pegadito here and that edge by 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.560
 outside 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.670
 now we take another 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.790
 and we will get like this and this remains 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.790
 outside 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.880
 is already battered and now the next 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:36.659
 step is the next look take the bread 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:39.990
 same and do not pass to sybase good anything 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.439
 one last listen well you put me 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.500
 down and you want well fine 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.530
 coupled and so do not leave it that much 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.330
 soften 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.880
 and we put 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.090
 Now, as you can see here, there is not a whole 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.540
 then what you have to catch what 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.540
 surplus 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.140
 cut it a little and leave it aside 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.590
 so 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.590
 dais 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.410
 and I do it place 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.320
 we already have a layer of made now you 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.320
 let's go putting 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.970
 the capes of ham in sweet 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.360
 over 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.630
 and now the cheese 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.630
 here 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.480
 now he gets the bread again and you go 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.989
 doing layers like I'm teaching 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.989
 I 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:11.400
 if now we put another 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.400
 until everything is full we see 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.630
 and now we start the other 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.109
 and now if you are gay 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.590
 look like I 've put two first 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.290
 eggs and as we need we are going to 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.040
 put the third one and let's do what 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.790
 we are going to pour the salt a little bit 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:44.670
 a little bit of milk and we're going to beat it 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.400
 we follow others doing it 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.900
 we have already filled everything and now what 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.840
 what are we going to do 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.960
 you are taking the ham in sweet and you have 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.819
 to be closing like this 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:00.010
 carefully 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.010
 you have to cover it 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.450
 Look, we've already closed it and now 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.650
 over you put me a little bit like that 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.650
 a little butter 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.999
 to catch is the aluminum foil 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.340
 and we are leaving are closing 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:43.479
 let's put the oven at 180 degrees 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:52.680
 and we will leave it in principle 20 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.500
 minutes then we will check it to 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.500
 sometimes too 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:01.280
 and if not we would leave it a little longer the 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.820
 that do not have a fan that leaves it 25 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.820
 minutes 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.770
 and this one 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:22.420
 and the 20 minutes have passed and now 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.420
 let's check how it is 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.820
 let's take out 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.960
 let's give it a foil 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:41.600
 and we're going to click, take a skewer 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:44.129
 stick what you have we do well 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.550
 watch this 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:50.759
 what we are going to do now is perfect 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:54.559
 is and also the role of the child and what 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:54.559
 let's put with nothing 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.240
 5 minutes 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.900
 in the month of 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:23.700
 of 5 minutes I left it 4 minutes 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.740
 I think it's enough 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.880
 as we want now we will leave it 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.880
 feel good and then 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:35.949
 they have grown up I have taken him out of 

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:38.979
 mold look how is that is 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:42.809
 great to watch this you can eat 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:42.809
 hot warm and cold 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.800
 and today is I prepared a reaction look 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.800
 how is it 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.800

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.210
