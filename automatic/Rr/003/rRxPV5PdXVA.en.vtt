00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:22.069 
the back which just unlocks and we can

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.609 
the back which just unlocks and we can
take<00:01:22.249> the<00:01:22.369> whole<00:01:22.549> side<00:01:22.969> panel<00:01:23.359> off<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:24.200> out<00:01:24.469> of

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
take the whole side panel off and out of

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.129 
take the whole side panel off and out of
the<00:01:24.679> way<00:01:28.060> we<00:01:29.060> can<00:01:29.240> see<00:01:29.420> that<00:01:29.569> this<00:01:29.719> machine's

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:30.139 
the way we can see that this machine's

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:31.779 
the way we can see that this machine's
already<00:01:30.439> have<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.619> graphics<00:01:31.069> card<00:01:31.130> installed

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
already have a graphics card installed

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.519 
already have a graphics card installed
in<00:01:31.939> the<00:01:32.060> cavity<00:01:32.450> here<00:01:32.689> so<00:01:33.170> we're<00:01:33.319> going<00:01:33.469> to

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:33.529 
in the cavity here so we're going to

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:35.589 
in the cavity here so we're going to
remove<00:01:33.799> that<00:01:34.009> one<00:01:34.219> and<00:01:34.459> fit<00:01:34.939> the<00:01:35.029> Sapphire<00:01:35.450> in

00:01:35.589 --> 00:01:35.599 
remove that one and fit the Sapphire in

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:37.749 
remove that one and fit the Sapphire in
as<00:01:35.749> a<00:01:35.779> replacement<00:01:36.069> so<00:01:37.069> the<00:01:37.219> first<00:01:37.459> thing<00:01:37.639> to

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
as a replacement so the first thing to

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.050 
as a replacement so the first thing to
do<00:01:37.939> is<00:01:38.209> to<00:01:38.659> undo<00:01:38.990> these<00:01:39.139> little<00:01:39.499> no<00:01:40.060> screws

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
do is to undo these little no screws

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.499 
do is to undo these little no screws
here<00:01:42.340> which<00:01:43.340> actually<00:01:43.579> lock<00:01:43.999> the<00:01:44.270> back

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
here which actually lock the back

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.949 
here which actually lock the back
bracket<00:01:44.959> in<00:01:45.079> place<00:01:46.359> once<00:01:47.359> those<00:01:47.659> are<00:01:47.840> out<00:01:47.929> of

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959 
bracket in place once those are out of

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:51.249 
bracket in place once those are out of
the<00:01:48.200> way<00:01:48.349> we<00:01:49.249> can<00:01:49.490> just<00:01:49.729> lift<00:01:49.969> the<00:01:50.479> card<00:01:50.749> out<00:01:50.990> of

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
the way we can just lift the card out of

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.349 
the way we can just lift the card out of
its<00:01:51.380> slot<00:01:51.619> it<00:01:51.859> clips<00:01:52.399> in<00:01:52.639> so<00:01:52.849> we<00:01:52.969> need<00:01:52.999> to<00:01:53.240> give

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
its slot it clips in so we need to give

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:56.979 
its slot it clips in so we need to give
it<00:01:53.479> a<00:01:53.539> little<00:01:53.630> tug<00:01:53.990> and<00:01:54.169> out<00:01:54.649> it<00:01:54.829> pops<00:01:55.869> and<00:01:56.869> we

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:56.989 
it a little tug and out it pops and we

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:00.940 
it a little tug and out it pops and we
can<00:01:57.139> disconnect<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.709> power<00:01:57.859> cable<00:01:58.130> here<00:01:59.950> for

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
can disconnect the power cable here for

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.629 
can disconnect the power cable here for
that<00:02:01.099> one<00:02:01.130> side<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:02.810> Sapphire<00:02:03.229> card<00:02:03.639> requires

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:04.639 
that one side the Sapphire card requires

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:06.609 
that one side the Sapphire card requires
2<00:02:04.969> power<00:02:05.209> connectors<00:02:05.779> which<00:02:06.169> are<00:02:06.319> actually

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
2 power connectors which are actually

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.100 
2 power connectors which are actually
provided<00:02:07.189> in<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.459> box<00:02:07.669> we<00:02:08.600> have<00:02:08.630> one<00:02:08.930> already

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
provided in the box we have one already

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.020 
provided in the box we have one already
installed<00:02:09.740> from<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:09.979> previous<00:02:10.430> card<00:02:10.670> so<00:02:10.910> in

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
installed from the previous card so in

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.640 
installed from the previous card so in
this<00:02:11.150> case<00:02:11.390> we<00:02:11.570> just<00:02:11.600> need<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:12.080> put<00:02:12.260> one<00:02:12.470> extra

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
this case we just need to put one extra

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.840 
this case we just need to put one extra
cable<00:02:13.220> in

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
cable in

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.640 
cable in
which<00:02:13.910> fits<00:02:14.150> into<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.510> socket<00:02:14.810> right<00:02:15.230> up<00:02:15.440> in<00:02:15.560> the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
which fits into a socket right up in the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.590 
which fits into a socket right up in the
top<00:02:15.830> corner<00:02:15.860> here<00:02:16.220> so<00:02:19.150> once<00:02:20.150> we've<00:02:20.330> got<00:02:20.360> the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
top corner here so once we've got the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.080 
top corner here so once we've got the
power<00:02:20.750> cable<00:02:21.200> was<00:02:21.290> installed<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:22.640> next<00:02:22.910> thing

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
power cable was installed the next thing

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.030 
power cable was installed the next thing
is<00:02:23.210> to<00:02:23.240> put<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.630> graphics<00:02:24.140> card<00:02:24.380> into<00:02:24.890> its

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
is to put the graphics card into its

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.260 
is to put the graphics card into its
slot<00:02:25.630> so<00:02:26.630> we<00:02:26.780> just<00:02:26.990> guide<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.100> output<00:02:28.580> sockets

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
slot so we just guide the output sockets

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.320 
slot so we just guide the output sockets
to<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:29.720> slots<00:02:30.020> in<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.200> back<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.590> machine

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
to the slots in the back of the machine

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.960 
to the slots in the back of the machine
into<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.570> slot<00:02:33.100> so<00:02:34.100> then<00:02:34.250> all<00:02:34.400> we<00:02:34.430> have<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.700> do

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
into the slot so then all we have to do

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.000 
into the slot so then all we have to do
is<00:02:35.210> to<00:02:35.450> connect<00:02:35.780> with<00:02:35.900> two<00:02:36.080> 6-pin<00:02:36.740> power

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
is to connect with two 6-pin power

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.130 
is to connect with two 6-pin power
connectors<00:02:37.550> it<00:02:38.330> doesn't<00:02:38.660> matter<00:02:38.780> which<00:02:38.960> one

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
connectors it doesn't matter which one

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.480 
connectors it doesn't matter which one
is<00:02:39.290> which<00:02:39.970> just<00:02:40.970> pop<00:02:41.240> those<00:02:41.390> in<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:42.370> then<00:02:43.370> we

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
is which just pop those in and then we

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.810 
is which just pop those in and then we
can<00:02:43.520> refit<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:45.050> bracket<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:46.220> hold<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.550> card

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
can refit the bracket to hold the card

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.130 
can refit the bracket to hold the card
into<00:02:47.000> place<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:50.180> we'll<00:02:50.420> be<00:02:50.540> ready<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.870> fit<00:02:51.050> the

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
into place and we'll be ready to fit the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:58.559 
into place and we'll be ready to fit the
slide<00:02:51.350> back<00:02:51.560> on

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.170 

there<00:02:59.569> we<00:02:59.630> go<00:03:00.310> so<00:03:01.310> as<00:03:01.430> you<00:03:01.550> can<00:03:01.670> see<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:02.030> whole

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
there we go so as you can see the whole

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.059 
there we go so as you can see the whole
installation<00:03:02.630> process<00:03:03.349> only<00:03:03.590> takes<00:03:03.830> a<00:03:03.950> matter

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
installation process only takes a matter

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.830 
installation process only takes a matter
of<00:03:04.250> minutes<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.819> then<00:03:05.270> we're<00:03:05.420> ready<00:03:05.540> to

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
of minutes and then we're ready to

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.630 
of minutes and then we're ready to
connect<00:03:06.170> back<00:03:06.349> the<00:03:06.560> peripherals<00:03:07.040> power<00:03:07.400> and
