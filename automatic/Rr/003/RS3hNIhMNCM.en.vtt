solo play it's a little bit different
than<00:00:07.740> that<00:00:07.770> of<00:00:08.719> you<00:00:09.719> know<00:00:09.809> your<00:00:09.990> regular<00:00:11.150> with

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
than that of you know your regular with

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.459 
than that of you know your regular with
a<00:00:12.179> forger<00:00:12.540> basically<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.049> letters<00:00:13.290> start

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
a forger basically the letters start

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.870 
a forger basically the letters start
appearing<00:00:13.679> in<00:00:13.889> here<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.429> just<00:00:14.580> have<00:00:14.730> to

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
appearing in here and you just have to

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.250 
appearing in here and you just have to
solve<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.269> as<00:00:15.360> soon<00:00:15.480> as<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.630> know<00:00:15.809> so<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.139> can

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
solve it as soon as you know so you can

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.800 
solve it as soon as you know so you can
see<00:00:16.379> here<00:00:16.529> if<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.800> know<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.390> and<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.510> can<00:00:18.630> say

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
see here if you know it and you can say

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.689 
see here if you know it and you can say
if<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.380> don't<00:00:19.859> know<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.100> then<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.369> can<00:00:20.490> you

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
if you don't know it then you can you

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:21.740 
if you don't know it then you can you
have<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.850> gets<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.150> letter<00:00:21.300> obviously

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
have the gets this letter obviously

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.029 
have the gets this letter obviously
right<00:00:21.869> here<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.650> can<00:00:22.800> switch<00:00:22.920> between

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
right here you can switch between

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.439 
right here you can switch between
keyboards<00:00:23.580> which<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.789> kind<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.000> cool<00:00:24.150> if<00:00:24.269> you

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
keyboards which is kind of cool if you

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.529 
keyboards which is kind of cool if you
prefer<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.140> alphanumeric<00:00:25.410> keyboard<00:00:26.449> so<00:00:27.449> you

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
prefer the alphanumeric keyboard so you

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.550 
prefer the alphanumeric keyboard so you
can<00:00:27.660> see<00:00:27.779> if<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:27.960> know<00:00:28.140> it

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
can see if you know it

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.670 
can see if you know it
sea<00:00:29.099> salt<00:00:29.580> I'm<00:00:29.910> gonna<00:00:30.060> guess<00:00:30.179> sea<00:00:30.949> salt<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:33.680> so

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
sea salt I'm gonna guess sea salt and so

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.930 
sea salt I'm gonna guess sea salt and so
I'm<00:00:34.770> not<00:00:34.860> sure<00:00:35.040> I'm<00:00:35.130> should<00:00:35.399> give<00:00:35.579> up<00:00:35.700> if<00:00:35.850> you

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
I'm not sure I'm should give up if you

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.330 
I'm not sure I'm should give up if you
don't<00:00:36.120> know<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:37.110> if<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.440> get<00:00:37.739> up<00:00:37.860> then

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
don't know it so if you get up then

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.700 
don't know it so if you get up then
you're<00:00:38.550> gonna<00:00:38.670> correct<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.690> then<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.500> can

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
you're gonna correct and then you can

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.090 
you're gonna correct and then you can
keep<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.640> letting<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.120> go<00:00:42.300> till<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:43.649> think<00:00:43.980> you

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
keep on letting it go till you think you

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.850 
keep on letting it go till you think you
know<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:45.120> ground<00:00:45.420> pepper<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.289> can<00:00:46.739> see

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
know it and ground pepper so you can see

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.080 
know it and ground pepper so you can see
here<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.100> compete<00:00:47.370> against<00:00:47.579> other

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
here you compete against other

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.880 
here you compete against other
contestants<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.750> if<00:00:48.840> they<00:00:49.260> get<00:00:49.440> close<00:00:49.559> enough

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
contestants and if they get close enough

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.130 
contestants and if they get close enough
then<00:00:50.070> they<00:00:50.160> will<00:00:50.600> guess<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:51.989> get

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
then they will guess here and you get

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.950 
then they will guess here and you get
the<00:00:52.230> points<00:00:52.500> corresponding<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.780> case

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
the points corresponding so in this case

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.990 
the points corresponding so in this case
it's<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.230> jackpot<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.129> let's<00:00:56.370> begin<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.820> round

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
different in that you can see there she

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.800 
different in that you can see there she
doesn't<00:01:20.159> get<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.340> right<00:01:20.369> but<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.420> different

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
the beginning it starts out different

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.469 
the beginning it starts out different
obviously<00:01:25.799> with<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.340> whole<00:01:26.700> toss-up<00:01:27.270> coin

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
can spin and when you spin all you have

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.660 
can spin and when you spin all you have
to<00:01:51.180> do<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.390> actually<00:01:51.540> swipe<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:53.070> actual<00:01:53.460> wheel

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
to do is actually swipe the actual wheel

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.170 
to do is actually swipe the actual wheel
here<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:55.369> we'll<00:01:56.369> see<00:01:56.490> what<00:01:56.640> we<00:01:56.729> land<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.060> we

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
here and we'll see what we land on we

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.830 
here and we'll see what we land on we
get<00:01:57.299> 800<00:01:57.990> if<00:01:58.110> we<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.439> guess<00:01:58.969> the<00:01:59.969> right<00:02:00.270> letter

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
get 800 if we can guess the right letter

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.450 
get 800 if we can guess the right letter
so<00:02:01.140> we'll<00:02:01.320> go<00:02:01.500> with<00:02:04.070> it's<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> living<00:02:05.310> thing
