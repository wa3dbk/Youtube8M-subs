00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.830
 hello i'm stÃ©phanie blogger 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.320
 creative today we're going 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.990
 learn to do together a piloquet 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.599
 stop to do that you're going to have 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.599
 need a piece of printed fabric 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.750
 a strip of 8 cm fabric on the lip 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:31.500
 tissue in my case be a meter 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:35.940
 sixty to pin and dart from a 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.050
 pair of scissors and a criterium for 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.730
 achieve this top 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.760
 you are going to need two 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.020
 rectangle of printed fabric for the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.780
 height of this fabric 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.850
 you need the height of the top that you 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.160
 want to do by adding two 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.039
 centimeters for water down and 4 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.590
 cm for forgetfulness in water for the width 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.960
 you take the width of your hips and 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.579
 you add between 15 and 20 centimeters 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.719
 function of if you want it wide or 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.300
 not very wide 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.769
 here I rejected all sides of my 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.309
 squares in order to have more beautiful 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.110
 finish 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.030
 if you have a sewing machine 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.820
 do not hesitate to do it with a point 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.180
 exergue for the first step I can 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.380
 overlap but two fabric rectangle 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.860
 spot against place I pin on 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.049
 sides to make side seams 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.270
 I pin from the bottom and I 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.270
 stop at 30 cm duo 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.380
 so I will now sew along 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.380
 pins to the sewing machine 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:56.780
 I will now open the panel in 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:58.789
 two and crushed the seam I pin the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.289
 part crushed up for then 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.289
 to attach to the sewing machine 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.579
 I 'm going now the same on the 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.670
 second side i'm going to do now 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.409
 heavy the east down knowing that my 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.439
 piece is sure I have you play visibly 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.810
 to make to return of 1 cm 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:54.359
 if yours did not do it a 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.459
 first came in a centimeter then 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.459
 fold it back on itself 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.390
 I will now go home and son 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.390
 at the of a needle 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.010
 the stage that follows these two forms and the 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:35.120
 two relays that are in the top 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:37.410
 for that I make a fold of 4 cm and g20 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.640
 I'm now going to set the hem to 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.640
 using the sewing machine 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.520
 I go back to the wires with a 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.380
 needle before proceeding on the same 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.170
 the other side so we have now 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.990
 finished with the printed fabrics part 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.720
 so we take the tissue bank 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.510
 united that we fold in half in the 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.980
 sense of the length that we set with 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:11.600
 pins and we then run along 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.600
 pins to the sewing machine 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.669
 I will now return the 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.669
 tube 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.250
 then we make a return of 1 cm to 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.210
 each end that is quickly fixed to 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.210
 the sewing machine 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.580
 I use after the safety pin 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:03.789
 for m at the end of the tube and then the 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:13.180
 passed in the hem formed in water from 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:18.490
 printed fabric first on one side and 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:20.710
 then from the other we can then do 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.940
 with both ends a pretty knot that 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.940
 will be worn on the shoulder 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.550
 so we learned today to 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.169
 together make a stop piloquet that I 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.009
 invites you to decline to make 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.009
 dresses for little girls
