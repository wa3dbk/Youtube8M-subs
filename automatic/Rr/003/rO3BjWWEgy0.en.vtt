00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 hello to everyone today tiny 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.280
 video in the meantime i have to show you 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.750
 explosive arrows in minecraft 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.330
 so I know it's a subject that has 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.980
 been taken by many people since the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.020
 snap shot of the 1.8 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.119
 but I was missing two three 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.449
 little things that I added on his 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.920
 arrows 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.100
 I immediately make it 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.100
 demonstration 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.669
 fireworks against I find at all 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.129
 the world this system works absolutely 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:36.840
 well in multiplayer and suddenly you 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.840
 can add that to your server 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.190
 offensive is much more destructive 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.190
 see I'm amused a little bit with that 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.420
 and I made holes everywhere we go 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.769
 immediately went to see the system on 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.809
 seems that they have not so complex as 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.510
 that I would put you some commands 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.290
 in the depression or even first 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.289
 the easier it is we did yesterday 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.699
 executes on all the entities of type 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.769
 arrow 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.220
 we make them appear a rocket 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:09.130
 finally firework fire firework 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.840
 above with sails then he is 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.310
 that sum that's why there are plenty of 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.679
 a lot of things behind I will put you 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.960
 in the video link of the wii in 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:18.940
 the description of the video the link on 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.679
 a video that explains how to make 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:26.229
 fireworks customize customize 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.090
 rather shabby and good it's in English 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.280
 but it is very well explained explain 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.680
 you have everything you need to create 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.810
 your own fireworks then the 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.610
 second thing is the system in him 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.189
 even this terrain i 'm going to show you 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.570
 when the arrow comes 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.009
 it's an explosion what is 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.549
 relatively friendly 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:54.049
 so how do we do that then we give 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:55.940
 the score but the floor score of all 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.950
 arrow type entities when they 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.159
 do not fill when they fill 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.350
 the condition I am of them certainly 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.270
 as soon as the arrow touches the ground or a 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.009
 wall besides everything works well on a 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:12.560
 wall we give him the time score they in 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.680
 do that score we're going to run on 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.780
 all the arrow type entities that 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.840
 have a minimum balance score of 1 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.299
 the order finally we show up a 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.980
 tnt on what's pretty simple and 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.630
 then that this command is very 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.910
 important one kills all the entities that 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.190
 transports of those because otherwise 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.870
 our arrows stay planted suddenly 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.239
 has a lot of tlt appearing at 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.080
 above which is very nice and very 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:44.060
 noisy too so here is then there is 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.590
 the as I said the little do it the 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.239
 little fireworks there that you can 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.209
 totally removed it will not affect 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.150
 nothing the system and the lady what I 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.959
 wanted to show you it's kind of 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.430
 what is it called rockets of 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.530
 distress if you pulled up 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.989
 but something that is for me a 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:06.269
 absolutely awesome hate end can 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.170
 really good aspects that's it 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.519
 everything for this video enjoyed this little 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.980
 explosive interlude 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.329
 we 'll see each other next time I do not 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.329
 do not know what looks more
