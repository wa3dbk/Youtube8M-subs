hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:29.160
Today we're going to learn how to make mixed herb, honey and oat cookies. So dear friends, for this you know take around 50 grams of butter and 25 grams of powdered suagar and mix this to a nice creamy consistency

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:51.240
You can also add you know around 15 ml of honey in this and mix this to a nice creamy texture. Now in a bowl take 175 grams of wheat flour, in this 50 grams of oats and in this add baking powder, around 2-3 grams of baking powder

00:00:51.240 --> 00:01:05.600
and in this add sesame seeds and mix herb, you know your favourite mix herb just add it in this; and also to add little bit of spice we're going to add some pepper powder. Pepper and honey goes pretty well

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:25.100
In this add pinch of salt also and mix all of this. And now add this flour to the butter and the sugar mixture. In this mixture add around 15-20 ml of milk and then mix this also to a nice creamy texture

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:40.640
In this add this flour and oats mixture and make this into a nice dough like consistency. Once this become a nice, you know dough. Once you make these cookies they are super awesome

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:57.140
And these are the cookies which are usually sold as healthy and gourmet cookies. Now after rolling them into thin sheets just cut them into shapes you want. Today love seems to be in the air and I'm going to cut them into nice heart shapes

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:05.900
Look at these heart cookies, fantastic and you're going to bake them at 180 degrees centigrade for around 15-20 minutes

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.220
Look at these cookies. Hmmm!

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:23.920
You know, you add oats to any of the cookies, they give a wholesomeness and also you can feel the bite of a cookie when you add oats. Dear friends we used whole wheat flour and also honey

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:33.940
So these cookies are fantastic and usually these kind of cookies are the ones which are sold as gourmet cookies and they are quite expensive, you can make them pretty cheap at home

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:44.620
