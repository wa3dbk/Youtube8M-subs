00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
quietly this isn't Equestria girls he

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.770 
quietly this isn't Equestria girls he
was<00:02:02.460> behind<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.939> questionnaire<00:02:03.329> girls<00:02:03.570> all

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
was behind the questionnaire girls all

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.810 
was behind the questionnaire girls all
along<00:02:04.049> maybe<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.799> have<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.979> choice<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.399> two<00:02:05.460> pies

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
along maybe we have a choice of two pies

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.429 
along maybe we have a choice of two pies
now<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.210> easier<00:02:06.540> one<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.750> guess<00:02:06.990> are<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.290> more

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
now the easier one I guess are the more

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.900 
now the easier one I guess are the more
natural<00:02:07.590> one<00:02:07.890> would<00:02:08.009> be<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.190> left<00:02:08.369> side<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:08.879> I

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
natural one would be the left side so I

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.809 
natural one would be the left side so I
chose<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.300> right<00:02:09.420> side<00:02:09.690> all<00:02:10.319> there<00:02:10.800> are<00:02:10.979> you

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
chose the right side all there are you

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.670 
chose the right side all there are you
missed<00:02:12.150> an<00:02:12.390> energy<00:02:12.930> tank<00:02:13.260> at<00:02:13.470> least

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
i believe so let's see maybe if we drain

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.490 
i believe so let's see maybe if we drain
up<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.150> stupid<00:02:57.389> energy<00:02:57.870> being<00:02:58.079> up<00:02:58.260> pretty

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
up that stupid energy being up pretty

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.809 
up that stupid energy being up pretty

out<00:03:26.129> there<00:03:26.430> who<00:03:27.000> would<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.299> be<00:03:28.040> hello<00:03:29.040> this

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
out there who would that be hello this

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.000 
out there who would that be hello this
is<00:03:29.310> mo<00:03:29.970> we<00:03:30.269> can<00:03:30.419> shoot<00:03:30.569> the<00:03:30.629> fire<00:03:30.900> okay<00:03:31.199> I<00:03:31.349> guess
