components of a go-kart here we have one
of<00:00:19.600> our<00:00:19.720> recluses<00:00:20.380> it's<00:00:20.920> a<00:00:20.950> little<00:00:21.130> bit<00:00:21.250> hold

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
of our recluses it's a little bit hold

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.910 
of our recluses it's a little bit hold
and<00:00:21.640> beat-up<00:00:21.940> this<00:00:22.150> is<00:00:22.360> the<00:00:22.570> original<00:00:22.920> recluse

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
and beat-up this is the original recluse

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.040 
and beat-up this is the original recluse
we<00:00:24.910> go<00:00:25.060> over<00:00:25.210> some<00:00:25.390> of<00:00:25.480> the<00:00:25.539> parts<00:00:25.810> really

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
we go over some of the parts really

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.630 
we go over some of the parts really
quick<00:00:26.289> that<00:00:27.190> front<00:00:27.910> end<00:00:28.060> is<00:00:28.240> very<00:00:28.390> simple<00:00:29.640> it's

only a few parts to it this is the
spindle<00:00:33.670> this<00:00:34.629> is<00:00:34.780> the<00:00:34.870> spindle<00:00:35.110> bracket<00:00:35.760> and

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
spindle this is the spindle bracket and

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.459 
spindle this is the spindle bracket and
as<00:00:37.059> you<00:00:37.210> can<00:00:37.329> see<00:00:37.390> the<00:00:37.629> spindle<00:00:37.870> bracket<00:00:38.350> is<00:00:38.440> a

as you can see the spindle bracket is a

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.709 
as you can see the spindle bracket is a
weldment<00:00:38.980> it<00:00:39.579> gets<00:00:39.730> welded<00:00:39.969> onto<00:00:40.269> the<00:00:40.480> frame

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:03.459 
how you get your distance

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:06.149 
how you get your distance
to<00:01:04.120> align<00:01:04.420> your<00:01:04.690> go-cart<00:01:05.140> we'll<00:01:05.890> talk<00:01:06.040> about

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
to align your go-cart we'll talk about

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:07.910 
to align your go-cart we'll talk about
that<00:01:06.400> here<00:01:06.580> in<00:01:06.610> a<00:01:06.700> minute

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920

that here in a minute
so<00:01:08.920> your<00:01:10.409> spindle<00:01:11.409> is<00:01:11.649> here<00:01:12.640> you<00:01:12.880> hook<00:01:13.119> your

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
so your spindle is here you hook your

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.289 
so your spindle is here you hook your
tie<00:01:14.170> rod<00:01:14.200> end<00:01:14.590> onto<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:14.979> spindle<00:01:15.250> and<00:01:15.789> then

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
tie rod end onto the spindle and then

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.749 
tie rod end onto the spindle and then
the<00:01:16.450> other<00:01:16.570> end<00:01:16.810> of<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.170> tie<00:01:17.320> rod<00:01:17.560> goes<00:01:18.310> into

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
the other end of the tie rod goes into

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.330 
the other end of the tie rod goes into
or<00:01:19.119> connects<00:01:19.990> to<00:01:20.170> what<00:01:20.289> we<00:01:20.409> call<00:01:20.590> Pitman<00:01:21.250> arms

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
or connects to what we call Pitman arms

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.599 
or connects to what we call Pitman arms
the<00:01:22.210> Pitman<00:01:22.570> arms<00:01:22.719> are<00:01:23.560> these<00:01:23.799> two<00:01:24.039> arms<00:01:24.369> right

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 
the Pitman arms are these two arms right

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:26.700 
the Pitman arms are these two arms right
here<00:01:24.939> and<00:01:25.090> there's<00:01:25.930> two<00:01:26.079> different<00:01:26.109> ways<00:01:26.409> that

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
here and there's two different ways that

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.999 
here and there's two different ways that
this<00:01:26.829> is<00:01:27.039> applied<00:01:27.869> sometimes<00:01:28.869> you<00:01:29.590> only<00:01:29.740> have

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
this is applied sometimes you only have

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.020 
this is applied sometimes you only have
one<00:01:30.250> pitman<00:01:30.670> arm<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:32.219> one<00:01:33.219> tie<00:01:33.490> rod<00:01:33.729> will<00:01:33.939> go

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
one pitman arm and one tie rod will go

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.490 
one pitman arm and one tie rod will go
on<00:01:34.149> the<00:01:34.240> top<00:01:34.450> and<00:01:34.689> the<00:01:34.750> other<00:01:34.869> tie<00:01:35.049> rod<00:01:35.259> will<00:01:35.409> go

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
on the top and the other tie rod will go

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.919 
on the top and the other tie rod will go
on<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.710> bottom<00:01:35.829> so<00:01:36.729> you<00:01:37.329> could<00:01:37.539> do<00:01:37.689> it<00:01:37.780> like

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
on the bottom so you could do it like

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.740 
on the bottom so you could do it like
that<00:01:37.990> or<00:01:38.770> if<00:01:39.490> you<00:01:39.609> have<00:01:39.759> a<00:01:39.789> double<00:01:40.090> pivot<00:01:40.390> arm

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
that or if you have a double pivot arm

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.109 
that or if you have a double pivot arm
system<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:41.770> put<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.130> tie<00:01:42.369> rods<00:01:42.609> in<00:01:42.789> between

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
system you put the tie rods in between

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.919 
system you put the tie rods in between
the<00:01:43.780> Pitman<00:01:44.109> arms<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:46.000> this<00:01:46.240> has<00:01:46.359> been<00:01:46.479> helpful

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
the Pitman arms so this has been helpful

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.389 
the Pitman arms so this has been helpful
this<00:01:47.469> has<00:01:47.560> been<00:01:47.679> another<00:01:47.890> episode<00:01:48.100> of
