00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
test ESP and abs yeah well you're saying

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.680 
test ESP and abs yeah well you're saying
we've<00:00:14.429> seen<00:00:14.639> these<00:00:14.820> functions<00:00:15.240> we<00:00:15.389> know<00:00:15.540> what

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
we've seen these functions we know what

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.500 
we've seen these functions we know what
they<00:00:15.839> are<00:00:15.960> but<00:00:16.170> here's<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.220> visual<00:00:17.880> experience

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
they are but here's a visual experience

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.630 
they are but here's a visual experience
of<00:00:18.660> really<00:00:19.439> what<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.890> difference<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.400> when

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
of really what the difference is when

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.010 
of really what the difference is when
you<00:00:20.730> have<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.600> don't

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.210 

well<00:00:29.020> I<00:00:29.050> have<00:00:29.349> to<00:00:29.470> point<00:00:29.650> out<00:00:29.890> that<00:00:30.039> we<00:00:30.189> are

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
well I have to point out that we are

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.650 
well I have to point out that we are
well<00:00:30.430> into<00:00:30.460> our<00:00:30.699> monsoons<00:00:31.240> and<00:00:31.360> this<00:00:31.509> is

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
well into our monsoons and this is

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.460 
well into our monsoons and this is
exactly<00:00:31.980> what<00:00:32.980> can<00:00:33.220> happen<00:00:33.400> to<00:00:33.700> you<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:35.320> as

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
you can see the car was not going too

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.540 
you can see the car was not going too
fast<00:00:37.360> it<00:00:37.690> was<00:00:37.870> just<00:00:38.290> under<00:00:38.739> 50<00:00:39.040> kilometers<00:00:39.520> an

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
fast it was just under 50 kilometers an

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.150 
fast it was just under 50 kilometers an
hour<00:00:39.790> actually<00:00:40.390> and<00:00:40.570> that's<00:00:41.230> something<00:00:41.530> you

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
hour actually and that's something you

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.829 
hour actually and that's something you
do<00:00:42.370> every<00:00:42.550> day<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.879> this<00:00:49.089> time<00:00:49.120> around<00:00:49.330> what

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
do every day so this time around what

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.200 
do every day so this time around what
we're<00:00:50.019> going<00:00:50.140> to<00:00:50.260> do<00:00:50.350> is<00:00:50.680> try<00:00:51.250> the<00:00:51.370> ABS<00:00:51.940> on<00:00:52.180> a

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
we're going to do is try the ABS on a

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.450 
we're going to do is try the ABS on a
track<00:00:52.510> that's<00:00:52.540> half<00:00:52.960> dry<00:00:53.320> and<00:00:53.589> half<00:00:53.800> wet<00:00:54.160> and

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
track that's half dry and half wet and

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.479 
track that's half dry and half wet and
see<00:00:55.180> exactly<00:00:55.329> what<00:00:55.900> happens<00:00:56.260> when<00:00:57.129> you<00:00:57.220> have

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
see exactly what happens when you have

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:08.010 
see exactly what happens when you have
abs<00:00:57.879> and<00:00:58.330> when<00:00:58.479> you<00:00:58.570> don't<00:00:58.750> and<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:06.780> see<00:01:07.780> I

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
abs and when you don't and you see I

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.960 
abs and when you don't and you see I
could<00:01:08.470> stop<00:01:08.770> and<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:11.619> car<00:01:11.860> is<00:01:12.100> still<00:01:12.369> in<00:01:12.610> a

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
could stop and the car is still in a

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.440 
could stop and the car is still in a
straight<00:01:13.240> line<00:01:14.369> now<00:01:15.369> it's<00:01:15.970> going<00:01:16.119> to<00:01:16.210> be<00:01:16.299> more

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
straight line now it's going to be more

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:28.700 
straight line now it's going to be more

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
ballet here can you imagine if this had

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.010 
ballet here can you imagine if this had
to<00:01:38.740> be<00:01:38.770> on<00:01:39.040> a<00:01:39.070> highway<00:01:39.670> or<00:01:39.970> with<00:01:40.540> people<00:01:40.900> around

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020

and<00:01:41.730> you<00:01:42.730> had<00:01:42.880> other<00:01:43.060> cars<00:01:43.390> on<00:01:43.600> your<00:01:43.780> side<00:01:44.020> that

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
and you had other cars on your side that

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:58.980 
and you had other cars on your side that
would<00:01:45.040> not<00:01:45.190> be<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.370> happy<00:01:45.550> situation

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.990 

I'm<00:01:59.990> going<00:02:00.290> to<00:02:00.410> test<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.340> ESP<00:02:01.820> system

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
I'm going to test the ESP system

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.600 
I'm going to test the ESP system
basically<00:02:02.870> we<00:02:03.200> are<00:02:03.260> going<00:02:03.410> to<00:02:03.500> get<00:02:04.370> to<00:02:04.520> an

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
basically we are going to get to an

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.330 
basically we are going to get to an
obstacle<00:02:05.000> no<00:02:05.930> break<00:02:06.200> no<00:02:06.470> clutch<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:07.010> try<00:02:07.220> and

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
obstacle no break no clutch to try and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.650 
obstacle no break no clutch to try and
avoid<00:02:07.580> it<00:02:07.790> on<00:02:07.880> instinct<00:02:08.300> because<00:02:08.390> you're

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
avoid it on instinct because you're

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.030 
avoid it on instinct because you're
imagining<00:02:09.140> that<00:02:09.229> it's<00:02:09.290> suddenly<00:02:09.680> come<00:02:09.920> in

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
imagining that it's suddenly come in

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.680 
imagining that it's suddenly come in
front<00:02:10.250> of<00:02:10.399> you<00:02:10.490> let's<00:02:11.030> see<00:02:11.210> what<00:02:11.330> happens<00:02:11.660> and

front of you let's see what happens and
I'm<00:02:11.810> going<00:02:11.960> to<00:02:11.990> try<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.530> not<00:02:12.800> let<00:02:12.830> my<00:02:13.100> instinct

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
I'm going to try and not let my instinct

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:27.330 
I'm going to try and not let my instinct
cut<00:02:13.700> in

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.830

time for me here at boksburg for the

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.550 
time for me here at boksburg for the
last<00:03:13.819> two<00:03:14.000> days<00:03:14.030> lots<00:03:14.569> of<00:03:14.810> technology<00:03:15.409> that

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
last two days lots of technology that

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.500 
last two days lots of technology that
we've<00:03:15.739> seen<00:03:16.010> and<00:03:16.430> even<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:16.730> safety<00:03:17.120> features

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
we've seen and even the safety features

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.819 
we've seen and even the safety features
that<00:03:17.659> you've<00:03:17.870> just<00:03:18.170> watched<00:03:18.470> when<00:03:18.739> you

that you've just watched when you
visually<00:03:19.489> see<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.849> difference<00:03:20.209> it<00:03:20.450> makes

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
when you have it and you don't that's

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:23.949 
when you have it and you don't that's
when<00:03:22.280> you<00:03:22.400> realize<00:03:22.730> what<00:03:23.269> a<00:03:23.299> life-saving

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
when you realize what a life-saving

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.130 
when you realize what a life-saving
device<00:03:24.319> it<00:03:24.739> actually<00:03:25.129> is<00:03:25.609> well<00:03:26.480> it's<00:03:26.989> been<00:03:27.109> a

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
I barely get to drive any cars so I was

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:41.830 
I barely get to drive any cars so I was
super<00:03:40.639> excited<00:03:40.819> when<00:03:41.299> I<00:03:41.450> was<00:03:41.569> asked<00:03:41.750> to

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
super excited when I was asked to

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.229 
super excited when I was asked to
participate<00:03:42.019> in<00:03:42.439> an<00:03:42.650> actual<00:03:42.799> nitrous<00:03:43.400> there

was a catch though I wasn't going to be
behind<00:03:46.370> any<00:03:46.639> steering<00:03:46.909> wheel<00:03:47.180> but<00:03:47.480> instead<00:03:47.780> I

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
behind any steering wheel but instead I

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.949 
behind any steering wheel but instead I
would<00:03:48.200> be<00:03:48.290> behind<00:03:48.680> a<00:03:48.889> remote<00:03:49.579> control<00:03:49.970> yes<00:03:50.689> I'm

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
would be behind a remote control yes I'm

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.659 
would be behind a remote control yes I'm
talking<00:03:51.200> about<00:03:51.439> remote<00:03:51.859> control<00:03:52.189> cars<00:03:52.430> and

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:52.669 
talking about remote control cars and

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.270 
talking about remote control cars and
this<00:03:53.060> is<00:03:53.209> my<00:03:53.299> first<00:03:53.599> shot<00:03:53.840> at<00:03:54.019> RC<00:03:54.439> racing<00:03:54.620> so

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
this is my first shot at RC racing so

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:03.009 
this is my first shot at RC racing so
let's<00:03:55.459> see<00:03:55.579> how<00:03:55.609> I<00:03:55.730> do<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:02.150> best<00:04:02.510> part<00:04:02.840> about

well<00:04:17.550> the<00:04:17.880> first<00:04:17.910> rest<00:04:18.450> of<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.750> event<00:04:19.020> is

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
well the first rest of the event is

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.350 
well the first rest of the event is
about<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.680> plug<00:04:19.890> off<00:04:20.100> at<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.580> costume<00:04:21.060> ready

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.590 

they<00:04:27.420> look<00:04:27.600> like<00:04:27.630> miniature<00:04:27.960> beast<00:04:28.590> on<00:04:28.770> fire

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.470 
they look like miniature beast on fire
and<00:04:30.600> that<00:04:31.230> is<00:04:31.410> some<00:04:31.680> serious<00:04:31.980> speed<00:04:32.370> out<00:04:32.550> there

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.020 

you<00:04:37.110> can<00:04:37.260> actually<00:04:37.500> hit<00:04:37.860> figures<00:04:38.220> of<00:04:38.430> 80<00:04:38.700> 200

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
you can actually hit figures of 80 200

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.240 
you can actually hit figures of 80 200
kilometres<00:04:39.570> per<00:04:39.930> hour<00:04:40.080> which<00:04:40.740> considering

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
kilometres per hour which considering

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.120 
kilometres per hour which considering
the<00:04:41.400> small<00:04:41.670> size<00:04:41.940> is<00:04:42.210> insane<00:04:42.960> talk<00:04:43.860> about

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
the small size is insane talk about

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.830 
the small size is insane talk about
tearing<00:04:44.460> up<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.670> tarmac

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
tearing up the tarmac

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.180 
tearing up the tarmac
yeah<00:04:47.840> so<00:04:48.020> this<00:04:48.140> is<00:04:48.200> the<00:04:48.350> guy<00:04:48.500> I've<00:04:48.680> been<00:04:48.710> given

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
the atmosphere is really heating up and

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.960 
the atmosphere is really heating up and
I'm<00:04:51.470> taking<00:04:51.650> part<00:04:52.040> in<00:04:52.220> the<00:04:52.430> electric<00:04:52.760> buggy

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
I'm taking part in the electric buggy

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.510 
I'm taking part in the electric buggy
race<00:04:53.210> so<00:04:53.660> let's<00:04:53.840> see<00:04:53.930> how<00:04:53.960> I<00:04:54.080> perform<00:04:57.280> make<00:04:58.280> no

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
race so let's see how I perform make no

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.390 
race so let's see how I perform make no
mistake<00:04:59.440> these<00:05:00.440> DP<00:05:00.800> machines<00:05:01.130> may<00:05:01.280> look

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
mistake these DP machines may look

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.730 
mistake these DP machines may look
deceptively<00:05:01.880> small<00:05:02.390> but<00:05:03.110> they're<00:05:03.260> just<00:05:03.500> like

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
deceptively small but they're just like

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.100 
deceptively small but they're just like
real<00:05:03.920> cars<00:05:04.220> with<00:05:04.520> real<00:05:04.730> mechanics<00:05:05.270> powered<00:05:05.900> by

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
real cars with real mechanics powered by
