00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 very good, hello, how are you? 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.859
 to sweet diva and today we are going to 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.280
 talk about two very interesting things 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.380
 first let's talk about sniper elite 3 if 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.080
 sniper elite 3 I think it 's the day 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.250
 Tuesday morning the first day or the 2 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.139
 but I do not remember what I think is the 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.240
 first on Tuesday but good is 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.420
 hyper the lead comes with everything but that 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.990
 what happens people report that they 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.789
 they robbed 3000 destiny key and the people of 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.800
 rebellion that is the people who do this 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.189
 video game will block those codes 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.950
 So, gentlemen, if you bought a 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.739
 of these keys 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.079
 stolen unintentionally you will be blocked 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.719
 because I repeat it these keys were 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.320
 illegally acquired and some pages 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.780
 web they started selling out there and not 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.879
 you as a web or not what event 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.949
 I'm going to play in the lead and at the end they're going to 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.070
 end blocked because those keys what 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.250
 I repeat, they will not work ok 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.030
 so you already know how to take care 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.040
 they said where they sold these keys 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.180
 where you can better said where you can 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.960
 buy keys please this game 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.720

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.180

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.290
 walker there can buy those keys 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.880
 gentlemen of sniper elite 3 because in 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.040
 many good pages to them have said 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.530
 that in these that very sure was legitimized 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.149
 100% safe but in other pages there is no 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.950
 they are very safe but they have not given the 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.420
 name of which pages 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.610
 They have been those that are selling 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.110
 all written chafa das no but there 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.520
 it's got three ok now let's talk about 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.039
 the big question is what will happen to the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.470
 people who paid for your key 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.570
 destination that without knowing obviously without 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.550
 know they bought it and bought it 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.470
 also not knowing that it was stolen not 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.360
 you are a fool but good now 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.270
 we talked about oculus rif who spent the 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.840
 oculus rif when virtual reality is 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.490
 it's very 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.470
 I'll leave you a link in the description 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.140
 so you can see asadicc 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.910
 since I came out they're hop 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.830
 but nightmare version oculus rif 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.420
 there are several examples are and I think so 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.680
 I like shanik but it sucks 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.030
 so you know already I leave a link the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.770
 decision for you to see it and laugh 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.680
 time of the bullshit that happens in 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:33.870
 oculus when they are and it becomes something 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.460
 critical is fearful good that I 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.140
