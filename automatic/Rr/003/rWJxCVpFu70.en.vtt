00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
heel which was enough to warrant a

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.670

guessing anyway Michelle bastoche steps

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.520 
guessing anyway Michelle bastoche steps
up<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:35.939> scores<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.720> knife<00:01:36.840> penalty<00:01:37.290> down<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.179 
up and scores a knife penalty down the
middle<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.759> make<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.119> 3-1<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:41.040> actually

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
middle and to make it 3-1 so we actually

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.039 
middle and to make it 3-1 so we actually
looking<00:01:42.000> like<00:01:42.150> we're<00:01:42.270> going<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.450> win<00:01:42.570> but<00:01:42.899> then

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
looking like we're going to win but then

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.569 
looking like we're going to win but then
he<00:01:43.170> starts<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.500> come<00:01:43.649> back<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.220> see<00:01:44.250> him

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
he starts to come back you can see him

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.060 
he starts to come back you can see him
getting<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.149> goal<00:01:45.930> through<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.530> petroi<00:01:46.860> big

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
getting a goal through that petroi big

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.859 
getting a goal through that petroi big
guy<00:01:47.189> again<00:01:47.490> over<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.850> top<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.270> his<00:01:48.420> pace<00:01:48.630> was

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
guy again over the top and his pace was

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.020 
guy again over the top and his pace was
just<00:01:49.049> too<00:01:49.200> fast<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.890> keep<00:01:50.100> up<00:01:50.250> with<00:01:50.430> him<00:01:50.520> in

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
just too fast I can keep up with him in

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.090 
just too fast I can keep up with him in
the<00:01:51.180> box<00:01:51.360> he<00:01:51.930> gets<00:01:52.110> free<00:01:52.350> header<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.799> scores

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the box he gets free header and scores

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.490 
the box he gets free header and scores
so<00:01:53.790> he<00:01:54.509> actually<00:01:54.630> looks<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.079> great<00:01:55.259> decent

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
so he actually looks like a great decent

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.530 
so he actually looks like a great decent
player<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.399> we<00:01:56.610> pretty<00:01:56.759> much<00:01:56.880> seal<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.390> win

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
player but we pretty much seal the win

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.440 
player but we pretty much seal the win

from<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.190> midfield<00:04:33.520> which<00:04:33.670> would<00:04:33.820> be<00:04:33.880> awesome

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
until he gets across in and it's a very

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.610 
until he gets across in and it's a very
good<00:05:39.700> cross<00:05:40.030> because<00:05:40.180> has<00:05:40.450> others<00:05:40.780> there<00:05:41.020> to

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
the match as a draw which was

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.740 
the match as a draw which was
unfortunate<00:05:51.790> despite<00:05:52.120> me<00:05:52.240> trying<00:05:52.540> the

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
unfortunate despite me trying the

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.750 
unfortunate despite me trying the
up-and-down<00:05:53.050> thing<00:05:53.170> on<00:05:53.560> the<00:05:53.710> two<00:05:54.490> things

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
up-and-down thing on the two things

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.880 
up-and-down thing on the two things
above<00:05:55.060> him<00:05:55.210> and<00:05:55.330> but<00:05:56.230> he<00:05:56.380> wouldn't<00:05:56.560> budge<00:05:56.860> so

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
above him and but he wouldn't budge so

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.000 
above him and but he wouldn't budge so
