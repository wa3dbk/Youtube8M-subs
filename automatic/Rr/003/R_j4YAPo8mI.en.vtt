with<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.369> right<00:02:05.670> training<00:02:05.970> of<00:02:06.180> course<00:02:06.360> I

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
with the right training of course I

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.240 
with the right training of course I
think<00:02:06.720> probably<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.170> one<00:02:07.320> thing<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.710> that

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
think probably the one thing that that

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.249 
think probably the one thing that that
varies<00:02:09.000> between<00:02:09.119> NFL<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:09.780> rugby<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
varies between NFL and rugby is the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.140 
varies between NFL and rugby is the
fitness<00:02:10.530> levels<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.950> think<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.820> board<00:02:12.030> never

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
fitness levels I think the board never

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.120 
fitness levels I think the board never
really<00:02:12.420> stops<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.840> never<00:02:13.020> get<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.440> up<00:02:13.620> you

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
really stops you never get that up you

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.530 
really stops you never get that up you
know<00:02:14.250> once<00:02:14.459> there's<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> down<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.150> don't<00:02:15.420> get

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
know once there's a down you don't get

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.150 
know once there's a down you don't get
that<00:02:15.840> matter<00:02:16.290> 30<00:02:16.500> or<00:02:16.620> 2<00:02:16.739> minutes<00:02:16.980> or<00:02:17.040> whatever

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
that matter 30 or 2 minutes or whatever

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.010 
that matter 30 or 2 minutes or whatever
it<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:18.060> actually<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.480> ball<00:02:18.630> just<00:02:18.810> keeps

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
it is you actually the ball just keeps

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.840 
it is you actually the ball just keeps
on<00:02:19.140> rolling<00:02:19.440> so<00:02:19.560> maintaining<00:02:20.190> fitness<00:02:20.550> levels

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
on rolling so maintaining fitness levels

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.310 
on rolling so maintaining fitness levels
I<00:02:20.910> think<00:02:20.940> if<00:02:21.150> they<00:02:21.239> see<00:02:21.300> anything<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:22.200> you

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
I think if they see anything then you

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.140 
I think if they see anything then you
need<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.560> worry<00:02:22.709> about<00:02:22.739> then<00:02:23.100> he'll<00:02:23.820> be<00:02:23.910> sweet

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
need to worry about then he'll be sweet

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.430 
need to worry about then he'll be sweet
and<00:02:24.269> considering<00:02:25.110> Piatt

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
and considering Piatt

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.800 
and considering Piatt
