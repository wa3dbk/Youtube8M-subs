individual<00:00:55.829> roles<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.460> who<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:56.940> are<00:00:57.090> as<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
individual roles and who we are as a

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.110 
individual roles and who we are as a
basketball<00:00:57.930> team<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:58.410> know<00:00:58.559> our<00:00:58.710> identity<00:00:59.309> I

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.000 

think

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
think

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.340 
think
when<00:01:05.370> you<00:01:05.490> say<00:01:05.700> come<00:01:05.970> together<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.660> don't<00:01:07.140> think

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
when you say come together I don't think

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.650 
when you say come together I don't think
the<00:01:07.470> bench<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.980> really<00:01:08.340> yeah<00:01:08.940> but<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.480> just

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
the bench is really yeah but just just

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.170 
the bench is really yeah but just just
answer<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.350> think<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.580> bench<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.970> still

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
answer that I think the bench is still

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.180 
answer that I think the bench is still
figuring<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.570> out<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:13.050> know<00:01:13.140> when<00:01:13.980> you<00:01:14.160> think

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
figuring it out you know when you think

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.730 
figuring it out you know when you think
about<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:14.730> we've<00:01:14.910> done<00:01:17.960> Harrison<00:01:18.960> hasn't

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
about what we've done Harrison hasn't

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.630 
about what we've done Harrison hasn't
been<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.980> Harrison<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.730> we<00:01:21.510> we<00:01:22.200> expect<00:01:22.710> we

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
been the Harrison that we we expect we

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.040 
been the Harrison that we we expect we
know<00:01:23.790> that's<00:01:24.000> going<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.240> happen<00:01:27.020> he's<00:01:28.020> a

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
know that's going to happen he's a

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.590 
know that's going to happen he's a
big-time<00:01:28.350> scorer<00:01:28.890> off<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.100> bench<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.790> think<00:01:30.510> it

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
big-time scorer off the bench I think it

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.970 
big-time scorer off the bench I think it
has<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.750> do<00:01:30.960> with<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.170> other<00:01:31.320> guys<00:01:31.650> around

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
has to do with the other guys around

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.890 
has to do with the other guys around
them<00:01:32.430> they<00:01:33.030> haven't<00:01:33.270> played<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> best

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
them they haven't played the best

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.770 
them they haven't played the best
basketball<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.880> scary<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.360> think<00:01:36.390> just

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
basketball and it's scary to think just

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.320

how<00:01:36.960> good<00:01:37.200> we<00:01:37.380> are<00:01:37.580> when<00:01:38.580> we<00:01:38.610> click<00:01:38.940> on<00:01:39.120> all

Warriors getting very accustomed to the
flow<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.190> game<00:01:56.220> with<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.060> starting<00:01:57.360> unit

Andre<00:01:58.410> talking<00:01:58.710> about<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.100> was<00:01:59.310> facing<00:01:59.460> his

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
Andre talking about I was facing his

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.790 
Andre talking about I was facing his
former<00:01:59.880> team<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:00.870> getting<00:02:01.290> used<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.770> playing

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800
