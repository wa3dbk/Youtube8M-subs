00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:12.169
 Hi, everybody's good here. 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.589
 photoshop repeats 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:17.779
 I'm here today to teach you 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:23.199
 how to make fish eye effect on 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:28.009
 photoshop is for starters you will need 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:30.380
 machael is frame here this frame bng 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:35.570
 I'll leave the link for a link to 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:37.460
 Then lowering the description you can 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.620
 download and install anywhere in the 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.809
 your computer 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:48.469
 after finding you can open the suit 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:52.760
 that the team goes in editor and opens the 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:56.750
 Photo that you want to edit this photo she 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:01.149
 It has to be big one 're where I came here 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:04.759
 she has 2 thousand pixels is very big 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.740
 If the photo is too small, it will go 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.930
 stay says fans will get ugly okay 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.490
 because this effect making it here 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.110
 stretches the pixels of the photo and when 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.659
 we diminish what will make it but 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.840
 will be very little at the end 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:23.930
 When we decrease, we do not 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.729
 visible in a small photo people do not 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:33.799
 will be able to decrease will become visible will 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:36.939
 ugly so she has to have my 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.939
 pixel is 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.490
 It's something else I wanted to talk about names. 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:51.960
 that this effect also gets very 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:57.240
 cool and in photos like this photos of 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.939
 scenery to nature landscape places 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.039
 finally, it is not very suitable for 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.819
 animal people etc 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:09.360
 Yeah, but you know what you're going to do? 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:11.220
 I lived here to cut people go 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.220
 put on cut book switch to 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.239
 three for four and pulling to select 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.819
 horizontal 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:23.940
 the area that we want to click on to cut 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:29.849
 and come back to the beginning 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:31.400
 Now we're going to filter the distortion of 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.030
 fish 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:43.139
 this value it works best 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:46.769
 ok i being between 30 and 60 is below 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:52.130
 it is not very noticeable and 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.130
 above is ugly it was horrible 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:00.239
 I think that up to 70 at most you can 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.200
 but it works best between 30 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.620
 and 60 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.599
 I'm going to leave 53, we're going 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.260
 resize reduced but logo 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.810
 complemented 400 pixels 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.389
 you see how the distortion was 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.900
 visible 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:23.900
 look and when it decreased 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.430
 It is another thing that will immediately warn the 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.590
 result it will get small tava 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:40.980
 stay with a high gift for 500 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.250
 and something wide will be half 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.200
 small small medium will not stay 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.130
 very large precisely because of 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.970
 Because of this distortion to not get 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:04:00.960
 It's apparent after mentioning people 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:07.460
 goes on filter vignette now switches to 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:15.440
 here is a photo and 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:19.799
 open femme click here to resize 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.020
 e time it will enter the value 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:26.280
 What time is it for our photo? 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:33.110
 fit right here in Kosovo was 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:33.110
 there is however in center and the ok 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.210
 photo more object to join the frame 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.370
 with the background 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.919
 You can choose this one from here with men. 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.810
 a photo with objects and it will stay like this 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.570
 It will be nice too. 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.120
 Can you do this here? I'll do the 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:55.310
 object is out of space leaves 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.900
 Any coke and that 's ok. 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.810
 basically the effect is ready is this 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:05.130
 Yes, but if you want, you can apply. 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:10.490
 some filters it's really cool to stay 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.490
 More inFunny 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.270
 okay that's it I hope you enjoyed 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.960
 I hope who follows the blog so that 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:29.199
 he was sorry for the absence 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:31.840
 there because I do not know the photoscape it does not 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:34.630
 It's getting a bit obsolete. 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.780
 We have to Mars test phone big 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:40.300
 things and photos that has been getting a 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.509
 little back but still I 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.889
 least I use a lot of photoscape yet 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.970
 to edit photos to put on a 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.330
 blog 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:52.500
 these things is that you can not do 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:55.560
 by smartphone 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.870
 so it 's still useful because of this 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:03.220
 I 'm not thinking about stopping after 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:06.099
 tutorials, this is it, you liked it 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.990

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.340
 try to be making video every week 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:14.710
 to put here for you that is more 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:18.389
 Practical easier for me okay this is one 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.389
 Kiss and see you next time.
