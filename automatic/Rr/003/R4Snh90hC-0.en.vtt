 this expansion comes with 30 new 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.670
 tile a piece that represents the 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.910
 dragon and a token that represents the 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.130
 fairy 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.950
 the dragon comes into play as soon as 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.750
 place a tile with a volcano 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.820
 the player who placed the tile will not be able to 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.120
 place any follower and of her and 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.280
 will place the dragon when a 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.699
 tile that has a dragon figure in 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.680
 she then the dragon will move the 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.650
 player may place one of his 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.930
 followers in said tile the dragon is 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.110
 moves exactly six spaces always 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.670
 in horizontal or vertical direction the 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.199
 amount of spaces that moves is 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.360
 independent of the amount of 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.180
 players starting with the player who 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.220
 placed the tile he will be able to move 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.170
 dragon a space 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.090
 and remove any follower who 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.980
 find in it in case this 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.500
 follower study that is true to a 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.110
 builder said tabs will be revealed 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.230
 also then it will play the next 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:29.260
 player who can move it a space on 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:32.870
 next player what 91 we have already 34 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.300
 5 and 6 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.760
 the dragon will have eaten five 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.800
 followers all the followers that have 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.200
 been eaten by the dragon are returned 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.450
 to the player's reserve during his 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.000
 way the dragon will not be able to pass two 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.740
 times for the same the zetas either 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.930
 you can enter the tile in which you 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.760
 finds the bean the only exception to 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.920
 the six movements is when it reaches 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.470
 a dead end road for example if 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.870
 we start here the first player moves from 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.600
 dragon to here and the second moves it 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.220
 down then the dragon as not 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.690
 You can go through it twice 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.250
 recipe will end your journey in this 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.680
 when a dragon appears at seven 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.380
 and the dragon has not yet been placed in 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.620
 game then said recipes should 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.720
 be placed on the side of the table 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.060
 once the volcano and the 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.920
 dragon come to the game then all 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.620
 the tiles that were set aside will be 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.420
 revolts with the rest of the tiles 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.850
 when a color is that a tile with 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.040
 a magic door then the player 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.050
 You can place a follower in that 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.430
 recipe or any other tile that 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.019
 be on the board 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.480
 for this the rules must be followed 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.129
 Normal placement can be placed 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.200
 the follower in the same recipe where 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.260
 is another as long as they do not share 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.359
 an area like castle road or farm 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.939
 nor is it possible to place the follower in 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:55.540
 an area that is already closed then 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:58.090
 I could place it here 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.189
 when a little what a tile with the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.439
 symbol of the princess in a city 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:05.469
 where there is already at least one gentleman 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:08.049
 you must remove one of those gentlemen to 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:10.239
 your choice if the only gentleman in that 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.870
 city was the knight of his color 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.780
 then he will be forced to withdraw it 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.090
 remove a single gentleman if he does this 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.269
 then you can not place any 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.870
 follower on the tile on the contrary 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:29.109
 If the tile is placed creating a new 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.200
 city then you can place one in 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:34.030
 she either in the city in the countryside or in 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.370
 the way following the normal rules 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.409
 of placement when a player decides 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.379
 do not place any of the followers 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.750
 during the shift then you can place 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.329
 the fairy on the tile where she is 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.220
 one of his followers to be able to place 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.109
 the fairy on the board is important 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.629
 keep in mind that you can not move 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:55.030
 no follower ie you can not 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.159
 place followers but neither should 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.600
 have taken out followers because of the 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:02.000
 princess during that turn 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.950
 the fairy gives three benefits in the first 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.290
 place the dragon will never enter the 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.940
 tile where is the day the 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.280
 second place when at the beginning of 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.590
 player's turn the fairy finds 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.630
 next to one of his followers then 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.450
 the player will immediately get a 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.000
 victory point finally when it 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.550
 meets a section in which 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.530
 find the fairy then the player 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.380
 will immediately receive three points of 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.620
 independent victory if you have a majority 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.630
 or not in that section with a player with 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.240
 what this recipe should decide if 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.060
 places his follower in the cloister in 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.340
 the city or in the countryside in case 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.960
 do it in the cloister then you can 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.040
 do it even though there are more followers 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.620
 inside the city 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.210
 the cloister point now when you have 8 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.430
 the zetas around with any other 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.710
 cloister this independent of whether the 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.690
 city has closed or not in turn is 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:58.420
 possible to place followers in the city 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.420
 when there are followers in this cloister 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:18.580
 here
