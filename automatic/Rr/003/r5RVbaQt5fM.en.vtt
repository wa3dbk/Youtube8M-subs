00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
disguise the ground strap so that the

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.639 
disguise the ground strap so that the

high cylinder oils there's an advantage
as<00:01:09.789> far<00:01:09.910> yeah<00:01:10.390> I<00:01:10.420> think<00:01:10.720> I<00:01:10.869> think<00:01:11.229> that<00:01:11.320> the

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.680 

like<00:01:24.370> that<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.700> ignition<00:01:24.940> system<00:01:25.240> always

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
like that the ignition system always

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:26.850 
like that the ignition system always
been<00:01:25.990> left<00:01:26.200> behind

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
been left behind

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.580 
been left behind
and<00:01:27.310> it's<00:01:27.460> it's<00:01:27.850> great<00:01:28.000> to<00:01:28.290> meet<00:01:29.290> a<00:01:29.350> person

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590

wire tests we've been using for a number
of<00:01:47.860> years<00:01:48.540> herb<00:01:49.540> how<00:01:50.170> are<00:01:50.229> we<00:01:50.350> gonna<00:01:50.470> go<00:01:50.680> about

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
of years herb how are we gonna go about

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.760 
of years herb how are we gonna go about
doing<00:01:51.340> it<00:01:51.600> okay<00:01:52.600> I<00:01:52.630> guess<00:01:52.930> what<00:01:53.140> we'll<00:01:53.290> do<00:01:53.500> is

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
doing it okay I guess what we'll do is

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.180 
doing it okay I guess what we'll do is
put<00:01:54.040> a<00:01:54.490> motor<00:01:54.759> on<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.119> dyno<00:01:55.619> we'll<00:01:56.619> baseline

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
put a motor on the dyno we'll baseline

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.249 
put a motor on the dyno we'll baseline
it<00:01:57.369> find<00:01:58.000> out<00:01:58.149> what<00:01:58.330> the<00:01:58.479> horsepower<00:01:58.930> levels

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
it find out what the horsepower levels

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.370 
it find out what the horsepower levels
will<00:01:59.680> be<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.100> torque<00:02:00.369> levels<00:02:00.820> and<00:02:01.240> we'll<00:02:02.200> run

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
will be the torque levels and we'll run

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.340 
will be the torque levels and we'll run
it<00:02:02.500> for<00:02:02.710> a<00:02:02.770> while<00:02:03.420> make<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.630> documentation

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
it for a while make that documentation

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.859 
it for a while make that documentation
and<00:02:05.890> we'll<00:02:06.340> switch<00:02:06.640> over<00:02:06.789> to<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.149> Knology<00:02:07.660> hot

the hot wires the reason that I'm

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.810 
the hot wires the reason that I'm
impressed<00:02:50.630> is<00:02:50.840> that<00:02:50.990> we<00:02:51.110> have<00:02:51.230> seen<00:02:51.580> so<00:02:52.580> many

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
impressed is that we have seen so many

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.840

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
swap the wires out and and see what the

swap the wires out and and see what the
