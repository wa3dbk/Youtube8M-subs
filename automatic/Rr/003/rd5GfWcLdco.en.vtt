00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.130
 I would like you to help us understand 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.690
 the world in which you live is mario and 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.850
 one day I was surprised you told a 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.110
 journalist in a French newspaper he 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.550
 I wonder why he writes and he said 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.189
 why I'm not happy 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.810
 you will explain why you write a 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.590
 person because a write is launched 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.449
 fiction 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.039
 I believe I am human, I think that 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.539
 same reasons that one reads fiction is 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.820
 because you better what 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.210
 because the life we have is not enough for us 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.790
 for all we wanted to have 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.269
 I think we are endowed with that 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.180
 strange ability to live a life but 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:45.490
 of being able to dream and imagine and of 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.100
 wish the thousand other lives 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.170
 Well, I think it 's at that distance 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.640
 there is between reality 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.909
 and the dream world that we 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.800
 we would like to have what we live 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.780
 through fiction fiction we have 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.329
 invented to live those lives that do not 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.759
 we can have to have those adventures 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.580
 those extraordinary destinies those 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:10.670
 great passions that real life ever 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.680
 it gives us everything or like us 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.899
 we would like to cheat having 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.670
 deceive the good deceive us for 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.580
 enrich us to enrich our 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.300
 experiences to complete some 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.870
 way that life that we can only 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.210
 live partly now 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.970
 and I believe that literature 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.920
 fundamentally, that void is filled 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.760
 there is in our lives but also it 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.440
 add many other things I think that 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.690
 makes us much more sensitive to 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.970
 deficiencies that exist in this world for 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.970
 complete all our dreams 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.390
 our longings at the same time I think 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.890
 what 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.789
 deposit in us a dissatisfaction 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.890
 standing before the world as it is 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:02.189
 in front of life we â€‹â€‹begin to feel it 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.159
 as very insufficient compared to the 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.350
 wonderful lives that we 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.090
 we empower through the through 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.769
 reading then I think that the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.590
 Literature is not just a 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:19.160
 entertainment an illusion 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.160
 a deception that we make to believe that 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.680
 we live more than what we really live 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.650
 but it is something that is projected in 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.190
 our behaviors in our way of 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.099
 be and by making us dissatisfied with 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.470
 somehow makes us agents of 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.510
 change transformation 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.980
 I think without it without fiction 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.930
 we would have never left the caverns 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.670
 there is probably a certain dose of 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.950
 fiction bearable now for example in 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.770
 the world that we live a person 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.660
 any of hundreds of scraps of 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.440
 fiction movies we live immersed in 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.960
 fiction how much dose of fiction is 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.720
 good and from what dose the fiction 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.270
 takes us out of reality I think the 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.760
 good fiction is that which does not 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.770
 deceive and appear before us as 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.930
 fiction and we live it like a fiction 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.209
 when we open a novel 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.520
 we know that we are facing a 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.760
 Invented reality is saying something that is not 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.650
 exists or that exists only to the extent 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.680
 that is able to convince us in the 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.140
 magic in the illusion that is the reading of 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.670
 that is true but nobody who reads a 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.440
 fiction thinks he's reading a 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.690
 journalistic report or a book of 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.940
 history but except the naive but 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.430
 can be deeply moved not usually 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.709
 thrill us to get excited a lot more 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.760
 times that the emotions that the 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:44.120
 real life me and gold for example 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.860
 with the suicide of Madame Bovary even 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.930
 reviving my eyes fill me 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.420
 tears again when 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.629
 I live through reading suicide 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.510
 of Madame Bovary but there are some 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.760
 fictions that are evil are the 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.379
 fictions that are not presented to us 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.620
 as fictions but as truths 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.209
 absolute for example ideologies 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.730
 I think that ideologies are fictions 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:13.049
 that make us believe that it is a reading 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.540
 objective reality and introduce in 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.060
 we not only misconceptions and once 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.070
 it's fanatical type convictions and in 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.000
 good part the catastrophes that 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.639
 lived history have resulted from those 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.800
 fanatical visions that come from 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.680
 fictions that can be religious that 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.419
 can be ideological and that is not 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.520
 present before us as what in 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.940
 truth are fictions creations 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.700
 artificial sometimes of minds 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.640
 extraordinarily creative and lucid 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.730
 but it is not the case neither of the police nor 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.320
 of theater or of art in general whose 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.950
 fictions I believe are benign and 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.900
 enriching because we know they are 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.410
 fictions and as such are incorporated into 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.410
 our life
