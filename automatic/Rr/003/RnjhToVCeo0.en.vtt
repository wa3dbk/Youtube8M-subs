00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.980
 friends today want to know something 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.980
 spectacular that these boats 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.030
 parkour is a discipline where 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.739
 you have to use your body to 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.930
 get from a point to a point b as 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.790
 easy fluid and effective possible the first 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.440
 group was in Monterrey is fourth in 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.390
 monterrey and long time ago 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.860
 approximately nine years a 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.770
 Parkour class is divided and or divided 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.150
 in three parts is warming in 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.619
 displacements and stretching goes 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.570
 improving over time every time you 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.860
 You make a small jump, it gives you the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.020
 confidence to make a bigger jump 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.240
 so you go free telling you that i am 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.159
 strong can do it and here comes a 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.860
 word that is the phrase of parkour that 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.240
 It was made by the weak to be strong 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.710
 to be useful anyone 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.520
 anyone who wants to 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.009
 perform it 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.320
 Whoever really wants to do something 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.380
 something different everyday is not 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.880
 is this the physical only for legs alone 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.860
 for arms is not complete 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.320
 I mainly like a lot of guys that 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.850
 they have this 16 attention are very 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.429
 imperatives and that this entertains him 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.920
 they arrive as if to entertain themselves but 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.660
 they stay for the desire to do it and it is 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.820
 with time they are improving their line that 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.520
 is imparted in something central or something 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.530
 anything else 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.630
 concrete and there are guys with therapy that 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.239
 guys who can not move very well in 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.590
 Running group are weak 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.180

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.330
 that they are rehabilitating I write it 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.310
