00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.230
 boards we wanted to talk about protective 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.080
 tenso tents in general how to clean as them 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.910
 to use and why they are needed and plus 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.679
 talk about the benefits specifically 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.769
 our protective cents that we produce 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.769
 we 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.490
 the most important thing to turn 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.410
 attention is fabric and fabric should 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.780
 withstand how to put on temperature 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.779
 so and the negative temperature is very 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.310
 it is important to fabric so that it is at low 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.780
 temperatures dwell elastic 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.920
 and it was easy to put on and take off. 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.710
 the fabric that is used is called 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.820
 taffeta today we can not 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.879
 find a fabric better than this fabric because 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.100
 that all the properties that are required for 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.650
 protective cents i.e. 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.680
 have she not freeze she stand 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.750
 high temperatures plus she elastic 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.309
 and the most important thing is that it stands 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.680
 severe mechanical loads like 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.400
 plain fabric ie we chose fabric 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.339
 some 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.839
 thin for there awnings to 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.240
 something protected that is 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.470
 really good fabric which 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.270
 withstand a load of clothes as well as the 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.580
 eat umyaty in clothes you sit down 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.070
 You can fall in the clothes if scania 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.750
 nothing will happen until really 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.350
 reliable that is at low temperatures 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.110
 now we have a temperature of about minus 15 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.240
 degrees i.e. the fabric should not tear 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:31.460
 as we say a vivid example that is to not 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.460
 torn and not deformed 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.840
 the second most important factor when choosing 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.960
 fabric is the quality of sewing 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.560
 that is, we can guarantee our 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.910
 our protective tynda are stitched with quality 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.770
 two-way shustova guarantees protection 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:50.840
 from moisture and Tomsk Bishop do not pay 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.320
 attention to these two factors quality 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.000
 sewing and choosing fabric you can be 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.350
 sure that the protective awning 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.350
 will serve you for a long time
