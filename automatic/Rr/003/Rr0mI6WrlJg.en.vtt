00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
one and it's always been odd to me that

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.939 
one and it's always been odd to me that
you<00:00:50.520> couldn't<00:00:50.850> do<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.480> Easter<00:00:52.230> Egg<00:00:52.350> solo<00:00:52.680> if

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
you couldn't do the Easter Egg solo if

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.430 
you couldn't do the Easter Egg solo if
you<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.820> ever<00:00:54.000> played<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.360> map<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.260> do

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
you have ever played this map you can do

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.229 
you have ever played this map you can do
half<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.739> Easter<00:00:56.190> Egg<00:00:56.309> solo<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.879> then<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
half the Easter Egg solo and then the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.700 
half the Easter Egg solo and then the
other<00:00:57.390> half<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.109> be<00:00:58.230> playing<00:00:58.440> co-op

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
other half you have to be playing co-op

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.340 
other half you have to be playing co-op
because<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.940> don't<00:01:00.149> get<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.449> goldenrod<00:01:00.840> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
because you don't get the goldenrod and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.700 
because you don't get the goldenrod and
solo<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.449> mod<00:01:03.690> basically<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.530> gives

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
solo so this mod basically just gives

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.590 
solo so this mod basically just gives
you<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.979> goldenrod<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.420> not

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
you the goldenrod and so on it's not

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.380 
you the goldenrod and so on it's not
really<00:01:07.369> you<00:01:08.369> know<00:01:08.490> too<00:01:08.909> much<00:01:09.060> cheating

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
really you know too much cheating

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.899 
really you know too much cheating
because<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.500> just<00:01:10.890> basically<00:01:11.070> get<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> rod

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
because you just basically get the rod

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.690 
because you just basically get the rod
that<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.450> would<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:12.960> already<00:01:13.170> got<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.770> um

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
that you would have already got in um

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.590 
that you would have already got in um
co-op<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.650> cool<00:01:16.860> thing<00:01:17.040> about<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.430> is

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
co-op and the cool thing about this is

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.380 
co-op and the cool thing about this is
you<00:01:18.600> lose<00:01:18.780> quick<00:01:18.990> revive<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.290> few<00:01:19.500> down<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.850> it's

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
you lose quick revive a few down so it's

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.800 
you lose quick revive a few down so it's
not<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:21.869> uh<00:01:22.939> it's<00:01:23.939> not<00:01:24.030> like<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.360> permanent

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
not like uh it's not like it's permanent

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.840 
not like uh it's not like it's permanent
um<00:01:24.979> everything<00:01:25.979> else<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.220> permanent<00:01:26.640> but

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
um everything else is permanent but

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.730 
um everything else is permanent but
quick<00:01:27.270> revive<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.630> not<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.259> can't<00:01:28.500> get<00:01:28.650> it

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
quick revive is not you can't get it

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.020 
quick revive is not you can't get it
again<00:01:28.979> because<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.430> all<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> other

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
again because you have all the other

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.609 
again because you have all the other
perks<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.570> only<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.140> quick<00:01:31.350> revive

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
perks so you only have one quick revive

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.550 
perks so you only have one quick revive
but<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.850> think<00:01:33.479> that's<00:01:33.630> really<00:01:33.869> fair<00:01:34.020> having

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
but I think that's really fair having

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.890 
but I think that's really fair having
all<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> perks<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.820> anyone<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.780> know

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
all the perks and if anyone you know

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.090 
all the perks and if anyone you know
wants<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.170> do<00:01:37.259> an<00:01:37.380> attempt<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:37.920> map

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
wants to do an attempt of this map

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.179 
wants to do an attempt of this map
they're<00:01:38.280> not<00:01:38.369> gonna<00:01:38.520> just<00:01:39.170> forever<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.920> alive

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
they're not gonna just forever be alive

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.760 
they're not gonna just forever be alive
because<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.850> revive<00:01:42.689> thing<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.200> goes<00:01:43.409> over

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
because the revive thing just goes over

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.429 
because the revive thing just goes over
