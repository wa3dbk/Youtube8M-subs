Scotland there is very little traffic
indeed<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.610> position<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.229> almost<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
indeed and the position is almost the

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.819 
indeed and the position is almost the
same<00:01:46.649> with<00:01:47.369> passengers<00:01:51.439> when<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:52.590> came<00:01:52.770> to

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
same with passengers when we came to

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.639 
same with passengers when we came to
analyse<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.210> information<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:55.290> went<00:01:55.470> into

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
analyse the information that went into

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.469 
analyse the information that went into
the<00:01:55.829> making<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.189> these<00:01:56.399> maps<00:01:56.700> we<00:01:57.060> found<00:01:57.299> some

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
the making of these maps we found some

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.590 
the making of these maps we found some
very<00:01:57.630> interesting<00:01:57.990> things<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.399> I<00:02:00.149> think<00:02:00.390> that

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
very interesting things and I think that

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.399 
very interesting things and I think that
I<00:02:00.840> can<00:02:01.439> make<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.570> most<00:02:03.570> striking<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.110> them

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
I can make the most striking of them

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.440 
I can make the most striking of them
clearer<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.159> if<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.579> tell<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.939> all<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.090> on

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
clearer to you if I tell you all that on

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.499 
clearer to you if I tell you all that on
one<00:02:07.350> half<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.250> whole<00:02:08.429> group<00:02:08.640> mileage<00:02:09.149> of

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
one half of the whole group mileage of

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.809 
one half of the whole group mileage of
British<00:02:09.840> Railways<00:02:10.259> there<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.009> only<00:02:11.220> one

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
British Railways there is only one

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.360 
British Railways there is only one
twentieth<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.840> traffic<00:02:13.290> now<00:02:13.739> this<00:02:13.920> is

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
twentieth of the traffic now this is

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.360 
twentieth of the traffic now this is
of<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:15.420> passenger<00:02:15.989> traffic<00:02:16.200> but<00:02:17.010> it's<00:02:17.220> also

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
of the passenger traffic but it's also

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.640 
of the passenger traffic but it's also
true<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:18.120> freight<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.780> we<00:02:19.080> find<00:02:19.380> that

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
true of freight and we find that

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.610 
true of freight and we find that
wherever<00:02:20.220> there<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.209> little<00:02:21.930> passenger

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
wherever there is little passenger

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.190 
wherever there is little passenger
traffic<00:02:23.060> then<00:02:24.060> there's<00:02:24.480> very<00:02:24.690> little<00:02:24.870> Freight

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
traffic then there's very little Freight

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.880 
traffic then there's very little Freight
either<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:26.660> of<00:02:27.660> course<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.410> ominous

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
either and of course this is ominous

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.920 
either and of course this is ominous
from<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.250> point<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:29.580> view<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.300> future<00:02:30.450> of

about all this modernization can't we

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.820 
about all this modernization can't we
have<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:08.430> branch<00:03:08.849> lines<00:03:09.150> as<00:03:09.390> well<00:03:09.660> can't<00:03:10.620> you

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
have the branch lines as well can't you

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.589 
have the branch lines as well can't you
attract<00:03:11.310> enough<00:03:11.580> traffic<00:03:11.849> to<00:03:12.000> them<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.480> make

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
attract enough traffic to them to make

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.059 
attract enough traffic to them to make
them<00:03:12.660> pay<00:03:13.640> but<00:03:14.640> unfortunately<00:03:15.420> we<00:03:15.780> can't<00:03:16.080> this

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
them pay but unfortunately we can't this

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.880 
them pay but unfortunately we can't this
has<00:03:17.220> been<00:03:17.430> tried<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:18.209> very<00:03:19.049> high<00:03:19.260> proportion<00:03:19.470> of

has been tried a very high proportion of

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.789 
has been tried a very high proportion of
them<00:03:20.160> have<00:03:20.489> had<00:03:20.730> new<00:03:21.299> rolling<00:03:21.720> stock<00:03:22.049> diesel

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
them have had new rolling stock diesel

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.970 
them have had new rolling stock diesel
multiple<00:03:22.920> units<00:03:23.549> put<00:03:23.970> on<00:03:24.120> them<00:03:24.329> and<00:03:24.620> we<00:03:25.620> cannot

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
multiple units put on them and we cannot

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.490 
multiple units put on them and we cannot
make<00:03:26.220> them<00:03:26.579> pay<00:03:26.880> because<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.900> traffic<00:03:28.320> is<00:03:28.470> not

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
make them pay because the traffic is not

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.960 
make them pay because the traffic is not
there<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.519> so<00:03:29.880> many<00:03:30.030> people<00:03:30.299> have<00:03:30.720> motorcars

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
there and so many people have motorcars

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.180 
there and so many people have motorcars
now<00:03:32.970> some<00:03:33.269> of<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.540> all<00:03:33.690> say<00:03:34.049> that<00:03:34.650> with<00:03:35.100> the

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
now some of you all say that with the

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.390 
now some of you all say that with the
public<00:03:35.579> service<00:03:35.870> profitability<00:03:37.160> isn't<00:03:38.160> the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
public service profitability isn't the

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.569 
public service profitability isn't the
only<00:03:38.790> yardstick<00:03:39.709> but<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:40.859> isn't<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.250> only

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
only yardstick but it isn't the only

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.059 
only yardstick but it isn't the only
measure<00:03:41.819> of<00:03:42.209> value<00:03:42.600> or<00:03:43.170> even<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.859> efficiency

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
measure of value or even of efficiency

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.210 
measure of value or even of efficiency
and<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:45.450> course<00:03:45.660> it<00:03:45.810> isn't<00:03:46.019> so<00:03:46.769> I<00:03:46.799> don't<00:03:47.069> want

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
and of course it isn't so I don't want

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.520 
and of course it isn't so I don't want
to<00:03:47.310> argue<00:03:47.459> about<00:03:47.730> their<00:03:48.090> head<00:03:48.239> but<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.350> real

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
to argue about their head but the real

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.729 
to argue about their head but the real
issue<00:03:49.739> is<00:03:50.250> different<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:51.780> real<00:03:51.959> question<00:03:52.530> is

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
issue is different the real question is

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.610 
issue is different the real question is
whether<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.730> there's<00:03:54.630> owners<00:03:55.350> of<00:03:55.530> the

whether you there's owners of the
