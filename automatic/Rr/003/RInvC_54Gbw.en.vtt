fact be a negative equity now if I
factored<00:01:12.229> in<00:01:12.380> inflation<00:01:13.340> you'll<00:01:13.850> be<00:01:13.910> down

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
factored in inflation you'll be down

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.750

substantially<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:15.170> this<00:01:15.710> is<00:01:15.860> why<00:01:15.950> i'd<00:01:16.160> say<00:01:16.430> if

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
substantially and this is why i'd say if

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.850 
substantially and this is why i'd say if
investors<00:01:17.240> are<00:01:17.390> willing<00:01:17.440> to<00:01:18.440> move<00:01:18.560> away<00:01:18.740> from
