00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
this and I said come to the class this

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.480 
this and I said come to the class this
is<00:02:40.160> really<00:02:40.550> it's<00:02:40.670> an<00:02:40.760> incredible<00:02:41.150> workout

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.520 

every<00:02:45.490> two<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.820> four<00:02:46.060> weeks<00:02:46.320> we're<00:02:47.320> advancing

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
every two to four weeks we're advancing

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.770 
every two to four weeks we're advancing
what<00:02:48.370> our<00:02:48.520> body<00:02:48.700> is<00:02:48.790> capable<00:02:49.240> of<00:02:49.300> doing

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
what our body is capable of doing

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.090 
what our body is capable of doing
because<00:02:49.900> sometimes<00:02:50.410> we'll<00:02:50.560> focus<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.980> little

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
because sometimes we'll focus a little

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.730 
because sometimes we'll focus a little
bit<00:02:51.310> on<00:02:51.460> muscular<00:02:52.390> endurance<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:53.080> sometimes

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
bit on muscular endurance and sometimes

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.440 
bit on muscular endurance and sometimes
I<00:02:53.860> feel<00:02:54.070> like<00:02:54.250> a<00:02:54.280> little<00:02:54.520> Latin<00:02:54.820> flavor<00:02:55.120> for

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
I feel like a little Latin flavor for

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.360 
I feel like a little Latin flavor for
the<00:02:55.570> night<00:02:55.750> so<00:02:56.020> we're<00:02:56.170> doing<00:02:56.380> more<00:02:56.530> Latin<00:02:56.980> or

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
the night so we're doing more Latin or

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.220 
the night so we're doing more Latin or
we're<00:02:57.760> doing<00:02:57.880> more<00:02:58.150> strength<00:02:58.510> training<00:02:58.840> moves

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
we're doing more strength training moves

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.410 
we're doing more strength training moves
but<00:02:59.890> it's<00:03:00.070> all<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.250> part<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:00.970> progression

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
but it's all a part of the progression

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.640 
but it's all a part of the progression
of<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:06.210> feel<00:03:07.210> great<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:07.660> want<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:07.960> wear<00:03:08.140> tank
