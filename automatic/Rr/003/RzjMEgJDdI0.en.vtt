00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
I guess this is the way that the kicking

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.590 
I guess this is the way that the kicking
stand<00:06:20.030> made<00:06:20.390> me<00:06:21.220> the<00:06:22.220> kick<00:06:22.490> instead<00:06:22.670> made<00:06:23.240> me

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
guess this is the way that the kick
