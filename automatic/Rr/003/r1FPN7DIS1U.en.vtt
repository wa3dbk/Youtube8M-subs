00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.800 
about it not having much of a mount
there<00:01:01.370> so<00:01:01.700> I'm<00:01:02.120> gonna<00:01:02.300> custom-make<00:01:02.809> him<00:01:03.079> out

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:04.810 
there so I'm gonna custom-make him out

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.020 
there so I'm gonna custom-make him out
so<00:01:05.810> it's<00:01:05.990> solitude<00:01:06.470> a<00:01:06.530> firewall<00:01:06.920> and<00:01:07.400> then

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
so it's solitude a firewall and then

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.100 
so it's solitude a firewall and then
there's<00:01:08.180> another<00:01:08.270> mountain<00:01:08.750> that<00:01:08.840> steering

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
there's another mountain that steering

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.530 
there's another mountain that steering
columns<00:01:09.440> want<00:01:09.590> to<00:01:09.650> go<00:01:09.770> and<00:01:10.460> mount<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.450> the

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
columns want to go and mount to the

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.300 
columns want to go and mount to the
bottom<00:01:11.810> of<00:01:11.900> the<00:01:12.020> dash<00:01:12.229> so<00:01:13.010> it<00:01:13.130> should<00:01:13.280> be

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
bottom of the dash so it should be

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.070 
bottom of the dash so it should be
pretty<00:01:13.549> good

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
pretty good

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.830
