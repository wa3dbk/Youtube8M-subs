00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hail salve heroes are direct here gives 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:09.200
 fatality, I'll talk to the boy who is 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.200
 known as the sporting lex luthor 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.920
 entered a lot because face to speak to 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.590
 truth has two great factors like this: 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.960
 that I gave absurdity is the first one 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.470
 I have in college so I went back there 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.480
 To my land, this is the way it is. 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.610
 another that I'm working on a plan 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.399
 secret to take control of the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.710
 national sport in the then vitally lex 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.500
 Total luthor mirror fell well this is 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.770
 I would rather ask you to the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.379
 shopping is back to happen it can be 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.250
 also equal to his evil plans 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.350
 but I 'm not exactly evil but the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.789
 people are creating a team with a 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.180
 very different from the style of 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.530
 sport that we have here and the plan is 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.979
 bring new professional blood 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.740
 competitive and become a strong brand 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.340
 I have not accompanied by light there saw 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.510
 Bombou was this absurd number for you. 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.400
 of inscriptions 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.580
 Dude, I was surprised. 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.640
 our main idea that people 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.100
 It has to be a new touch that we had 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.970
 nearly 14,000 enrollees 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.710
 valid 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.290
 our process to enter the team in the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.650
 last hit time entered inside the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.200
 Water 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.460
 that there actually is kind t day 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.680
 of the woman is the requirements was in teaching 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.270
 18 years in the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.710
 hiring and night better then the 31 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.710
 business is serious will have hiring 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.479
 even so he goes but she has a 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.080
 legal part so we have 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.720
 faced 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.290
 the goal of the professional team both in 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.630
 marketing and coaching on the day of 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.370
 life not only continue what I ask the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.720
 also the legal sector . 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.600
 we are really structuring your 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.700
 company from scratch can count on 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.560
 prices under the structure then after 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.450
 my functions how will it work 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.920
 the step by step this straight between these 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.570
 end of the day coming up now is good 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.320
 People have to talk a little bit in the 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.520
 We started with the assumption that 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.950
 things are a bit different from 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.560
 as with them are going on here 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.360
 in Brazil the first party agent to 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.770
 idea that who raul gil is not the 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.420
 best method of training 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.800
 so we'll have an office in 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.080
 Sao Paulo where officially the freedom 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.240
 of land to her girlfriend's house which 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.610
 do you think the game house is not a format 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.590
 complete and correct your point of view 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.320
 you arrived at the event including in 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.120
 cool this is the following to people 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.860
 are very different with Brazil is a 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.880
 heterogeneous country 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.340
 after that we also have the idea 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.190
 that links the agents is a game of 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.200
 team and is a game where the strategy is 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.269
 father is more important than quality 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.850
 of teaching player why we people 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.670
 did not catch the known players the 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.330
 player stela players were already part 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.640
 of team 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.110
 the big challenge on my part is to get 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.840
 all that knowledge of the joÃ£o that I 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.370
 I have and deliver our people do 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.980
 that they function as one had 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.260
 even as you said lapidary one 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.420
 two teams that are well from there to 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.280
 can get into this subject is also 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:26.250
 this other thing that we have in 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.350
 How much are we going to have ten? 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.300
 players 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.130
 these two players I still do not know if 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.590
 going to be will be a starting team or 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.489
 reservation or if it will be two children 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.480
 separate but the team will be going all 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.489
 the 10 thinking our comedy 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.799
 ae would be very close but even 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.870
 were it not the samsung white block are 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.150
 one team plus one cd not being able to 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.819
 professional teams 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.230
 chosen can we fulfill its 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.409
 day to day of the players then they will 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.080
 to wake up in their homes and there 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:03.530
 Good, they'll get around to our room. 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.530
 to our office next soon 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.420
 had several possible routines 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.620
 we will have a training in theory or 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.790
 so we'll have a workout 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.730
 entanglement 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.950
 the game itself to watch others 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.549
 games like wii talks about psychologists 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.440
 That's it too, we have nht's friend. 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.740
 group she is coaching 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.690
 she is a professional not with 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.960
 aspect of calling people like me 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.360
 I am but it is a life thing by profession 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.750
 she will be working with 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:39.530
 players do not in the psychological and 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.510
 will be a very important force 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.220
 so for the wonder-like well-being 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.199
 It 's sad there, we can 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:51.500
 expect from your project you see yourself in 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:54.020
 12 years it's still me I do not have ambitions 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.020
 to be champion in the year that the team 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.270
 formed but surely be champion in the 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.820
 rip to our objectives 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.539
 within 21 years of fitting a team 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:09.110
 did not take it for sure both the two 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:10.880
 they are good, this is the one who needs it 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.680
 information about their project and will 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.729
 have in the video description here 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.979
 engineers and staff, I know that I 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.860
 Also missing are people who are 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:25.880
 asking what I 'm doing good for 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.940
 fact of your investment it can not 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.440
 be very open to the most 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.180
 We'll be finalizing soon 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.190
 the selective process you will know 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.380
 our 10 players 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.570
 and next year we are playing 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.080
 competing trying to enter the championship 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.529
 and compete in the championships and 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.949
 logically 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:44.949
 your movies
