00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.679 
you have a whole bunch of spring bars
and<00:01:50.530> you<00:01:51.100> need<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.399> figure<00:01:51.549> out<00:01:51.820> what<00:01:52.210> you're

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
and you need to figure out what you're

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.499 
and you need to figure out what you're
going<00:01:52.840> to<00:01:52.899> use<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.700> can<00:01:54.729> go<00:01:55.030> through<00:01:55.329> this

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
going to use you can go through this

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.590 
going to use you can go through this
mess<00:01:55.859> pick<00:01:56.859> up<00:01:57.009> your<00:01:57.159> spring<00:01:57.340> bar<00:01:57.609> and<00:01:57.999> you<00:01:58.420> can

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
mess pick up your spring bar and you can

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.160 
mess pick up your spring bar and you can
actually<00:01:58.990> measure<00:01:59.289> it<00:01:59.999> to<00:02:00.999> find<00:02:01.270> out<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.840> size

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
actually measure it to find out the size

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.029 
actually measure it to find out the size
of<00:02:02.799> what<00:02:03.009> it<00:02:03.039> fits<00:02:03.429> and<00:02:04.350> basically<00:02:05.350> you<00:02:05.859> want
