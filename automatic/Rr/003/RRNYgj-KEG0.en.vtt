00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
not that much of a difference between

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.380 
not that much of a difference between
these<00:01:39.990> two<00:01:40.049> heads<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.829> mean<00:01:41.150> you<00:01:42.150> can<00:01:42.270> obviously

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
these two heads I mean you can obviously

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.399 
these two heads I mean you can obviously
tell<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.110> one<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.770> X<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.790> wider

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
tell it this one the X is wider

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.870 
tell it this one the X is wider
but<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:47.630> mean<00:01:48.630> they're<00:01:48.780> pretty<00:01:49.229> similar<00:01:49.880> pretty

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
but I mean they're pretty similar pretty

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.809 
but I mean they're pretty similar pretty
much<00:01:50.999> the<00:01:51.119> exact<00:01:51.359> same<00:01:51.539> thing<00:01:51.780> except<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
much the exact same thing except for the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.999 
much the exact same thing except for the
the<00:01:53.819> widened<00:01:54.240> throat<00:01:54.479> down<00:01:54.689> here<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.170> then

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
the widened throat down here and then

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.309 
the widened throat down here and then
it's<00:01:56.250> thinner<00:01:56.460> over<00:01:56.759> here<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:58.049> doesn't

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
it's thinner over here but it doesn't

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:59.449 
it's thinner over here but it doesn't
really<00:01:58.380> make<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.649> difference<00:01:58.859> i<00:01:59.130> mean<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.340> ball

00:01:59.449 --> 00:01:59.459 
really make a difference i mean the ball

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:01.039 
really make a difference i mean the ball
bounces<00:01:59.850> around<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.299> little<00:02:00.450> bit<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.780> one

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
bounces around a little bit in this one

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.899 
bounces around a little bit in this one
well<00:02:01.890> bounce<00:02:02.100> around<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.429> little<00:02:02.579> bit<00:02:02.700> more

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
well bounce around a little bit more

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.099 
well bounce around a little bit more
than<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.119> one<00:02:03.590> doesn't<00:02:04.590> really<00:02:04.709> matter<00:02:04.890> but

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
than this one doesn't really matter but

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:09.830 
than this one doesn't really matter but
anyway<00:02:07.310> that's<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.580> i'll<00:02:09.539> give<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.750> my
