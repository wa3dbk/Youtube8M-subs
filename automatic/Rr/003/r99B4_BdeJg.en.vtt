 simple , and the way to solve the 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:46.800
 2000 and 2002 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:50.399
 version 3 x 1 32-bit version of 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.420
 of the game but only has one however is that the game 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.420
 it gets very light

 no matter what she's white in the case of 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.510
 sounds 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:45.899
 description open 22 the platform 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:54.270
 right selected and it will create a 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:56.630
 shortcut that the work will now have a 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.630
 turn 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.609
 the space if you do not give this space no 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.340
 it will work 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:12.459
 the space now you go here in the code 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.040
 copy and paste the space that you 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:53.790

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.660
 to the original of your computer 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.870
 if your computer is good it will not 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.180
 a portal with if your computer had 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:44.470
 good and that will give medium or medium 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:46.989
 Bad break to show you is the 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:52.739
 only difference is going to happen 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:56.430

 ready April here I will show you the 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.170
 difference the difference is that you 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.170
