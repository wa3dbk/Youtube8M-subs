who makes me the bio Home Media decided
to<00:00:40.150> take<00:00:40.360> some<00:00:40.570> of<00:00:40.659> the<00:00:40.780> peat<00:00:40.960> I've<00:00:41.290> sent<00:00:41.530> it

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
to take some of the peat I've sent it

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.030 
to take some of the peat I've sent it
down<00:00:41.739> to<00:00:42.239> Andy<00:00:43.239> put<00:00:44.140> it<00:00:44.229> through<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.530> extruder

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
down to Andy put it through the extruder

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.729 
down to Andy put it through the extruder
to<00:00:45.430> make<00:00:45.580> pellets<00:00:46.030> of<00:00:46.150> peat<00:00:46.420> he<00:00:47.229> then<00:00:47.409> dried

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
to make pellets of peat he then dried

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:57.049 
to make pellets of peat he then dried
them<00:00:47.979> so<00:00:48.129> it<00:00:48.190> was<00:00:48.280> compressed<00:00:48.879> and<00:00:49.420> then<00:00:50.140> dried

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.460 

this<00:00:58.059> is<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.330> result

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.910 

it's<00:01:04.980> rock<00:01:05.430> hard<00:01:05.460> little<00:01:06.150> black<00:01:07.080> pellets<00:01:07.740> of

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
it's rock hard little black pellets of

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:18.320 
it's rock hard little black pellets of
Peter<00:01:12.680> it<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:13.890> are<00:01:14.040> quite<00:01:14.220> solid<00:01:15.800> and<00:01:17.330> it

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
Peter it really are quite solid and it

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.250 
Peter it really are quite solid and it
reduces<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.930> weight<00:01:19.140> by<00:01:19.470> about<00:01:19.680> 80%<00:01:21.260> which

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
reduces the weight by about 80% which

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.640 
reduces the weight by about 80% which
means<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.710> international<00:01:23.340> postage<00:01:24.530> will<00:01:25.530> be

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
means that international postage will be

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.070 
means that international postage will be
quite<00:01:25.830> cheap<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.510> need<00:01:27.510> to<00:01:27.630> test<00:01:27.900> this

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
quite cheap and need to test this

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.860 
quite cheap and need to test this
product<00:01:28.410> in<00:01:29.370> our<00:01:29.490> tanks<00:01:29.940> in<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.120> shop<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
product in our tanks in the shop and

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.220 
product in our tanks in the shop and
also<00:01:31.230> under<00:01:31.620> control<00:01:32.070> circumstances<00:01:33.230> but

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
also under control circumstances but

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.250 
also under control circumstances but
considering<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.340> only<00:01:35.580> Pete<00:01:36.260> it

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
considering that it's only Pete it

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.540 
considering that it's only Pete it
should<00:01:37.620> be<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:38.160> winner<00:01:40.010> now<00:01:41.010> little<00:01:41.370> bit

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
should be a winner now little bit

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.860 
should be a winner now little bit
there's<00:01:41.760> probably<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.450> equivalent<00:01:42.690> of<00:01:44.870> well

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
there's probably the equivalent of well

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.710 
there's probably the equivalent of well
it<00:01:46.620> loses<00:01:47.010> about<00:01:47.100> 80%<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.970> its<00:01:48.120> volume<00:01:48.330> so

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
it loses about 80% of its volume so

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.150 
it loses about 80% of its volume so
that's<00:01:48.930> probably<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.500> equivalent<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:50.070> a

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
that's probably the equivalent of a

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.719 
that's probably the equivalent of a
large<00:01:50.400> people<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.479> there<00:01:52.250> if<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.520> works

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
large people just there if this works

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.870 
large people just there if this works
how<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.390> think<00:01:54.690> it'll<00:01:54.840> work<00:01:55.490> it'll<00:01:56.490> make<00:01:56.729> it

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
how I think it'll work it'll make it

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.260 
how I think it'll work it'll make it
really<00:01:57.240> easy<00:01:57.479> for<00:01:57.630> introduction<00:01:58.410> into<00:01:58.860> a

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
really easy for introduction into a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.330 
really easy for introduction into a
external<00:02:00.270> filter<00:02:00.510> or<00:02:01.229> into<00:02:01.680> an<00:02:01.800> internal

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
external filter or into an internal

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.830 
external filter or into an internal
filter<00:02:02.670> where<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.120> could<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.690> in

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
filter where you could just have this in

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.380 
filter where you could just have this in
a<00:02:03.930> little<00:02:04.050> fine<00:02:04.410> mesh<00:02:04.770> bag<00:02:05.130> water<00:02:06.000> flowing

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
a little fine mesh bag water flowing

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.060 
a little fine mesh bag water flowing
through<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.750> distributing<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:07.740> goodness

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
through it distributing the goodness

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.000 
through it distributing the goodness
into<00:02:08.760> the<00:02:09.000> tank<00:02:09.320> I'm<00:02:10.320> pretty<00:02:10.530> excited<00:02:10.800> about

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
into the tank I'm pretty excited about

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.699 
into the tank I'm pretty excited about
this<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.580> keep<00:02:12.390> your<00:02:12.510> eye<00:02:12.570> open<00:02:12.660> for<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.140> it

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
should be coming to my EBA page not soon

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.050 
should be coming to my EBA page not soon
I<00:02:17.610> need<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.150> test<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.540> but<00:02:19.440> in<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.550> relatively

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
I need to test it but in the relatively

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.160 
I need to test it but in the relatively
