00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 and good people and culture with insurance but 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.470
 note that for a time do not go up 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.780
 videos is because that market is the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.620
 microphone I buy myself new that's not 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.290
 it means that you listen better 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.100
 and good 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.840
 I was talking to a friend and he told me 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.820
 your body can be a video of how 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.430
 download games from a good page and 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.140
 how to unload the bodies to some 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.520
 you know and some do not taste good then 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.670
 and I'm going to make it good the first the 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.870
 page gesta that is towers dotcom a 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.600
 of the best pages to get the 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.470
 game and it comes to you with pc games the 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.960
 boat 67 are 3 wii psp that the 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.500
 portable playstation nintendo ds 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.810
 playstation 2 and magicians 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.310
 good in this case if I am that yes 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.190
 they want to download PC games like in 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.210
 my mode will continue here for example if 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.210
 they want to look for a special game 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:05.320
 for example which in here and while 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.750
 the page is loaded and the good 27 is the 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.600
 game for pc if it is for xbox and 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.530
 playstation 3 what it means is that 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.000
 it looks for all the consoles for pc 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.780
 good for example I now want 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.670
 climb this rock smith 2014 game of 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.970
 what it is about here says what it is about 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.560
 what is and what 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.450
 The first thing that has to be applied is 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.250
 the comments to see what it says if they are 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.970
 English are Spanish and if it is otherwise 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.220
 it serves if it stays if not good 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.220
 and here as you will see this is the size of the 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.320
 game when they uploaded it in format is 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.110
 Y 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.920
 good will make you download torrent and you 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.770
 will leave a torrent file 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.240
 is this but it will not seem like a second 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.299
 milestone to come it looks like that 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.830
 have to download a program called 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.920
 torrent which I get to the page 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.899
 sorry and good for that reason the program that 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.520
 now i will show you they have it 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.140
 download and have it ready the network is 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.890
 extremely easy they will only leave it 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.409
 integrate and ready 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:10.020
 and once they download it in Milan to 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:13.720
 face will not arrive when you accredit 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:17.230
 once they download it but they will be able to 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.599
 a corner and they will be able to 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.849
 start this point torrent and good if 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.800
 they want to add because they are there 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.810
 start downloading now it's me 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.260
 slow and I want to start 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.629
 download easy good 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.069
 it depends on the size of the game 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.750
 time than the time that for example 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.549
 this if I start to download a 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.370
 bit quick in my download between 200 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:41.420
 and 300 kb per second will be downloaded in 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.599
 We in 45 hours depends 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.750
 and well after most of the game with 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.390
 the minority is not needed I knew that 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.190
 with a point file did with which 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.830

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.390
 programs that we will download from here 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.840
 but in the last games that I 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.239
 downloaded between sessions all these 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.560
 two for example this one came to me like that 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.020

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.019
