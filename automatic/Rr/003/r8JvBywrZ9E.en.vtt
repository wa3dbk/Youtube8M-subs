I

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.170 

use<00:00:24.680> an<00:00:24.830> image<00:00:24.980> of<00:00:25.280> an<00:00:26.060> actual<00:00:26.630> humans<00:00:27.380> cow<00:00:27.620> in

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
use an image of an actual humans cow in

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.450 
use an image of an actual humans cow in
tribal<00:00:29.290> so<00:00:30.290> this<00:00:30.500> is<00:00:30.620> the<00:00:30.740> first<00:00:30.950> cover

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
tribal so this is the first cover

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.440 
tribal so this is the first cover
stencil<00:00:33.670> I'm<00:00:34.670> using<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.330> park<00:00:35.630> white<00:00:37.360> so<00:00:38.360> you

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
stencil I'm using the park white so you

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.270 
stencil I'm using the park white so you
have<00:00:38.720> like<00:00:39.020> the<00:00:39.290> difference<00:00:39.680> between<00:00:39.770> the

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
have like the difference between the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.060 
have like the difference between the
black<00:00:40.489> tribal<00:00:41.390> and<00:00:43.150> the<00:00:44.150> white<00:00:44.360> background

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.570 

the<00:00:49.070> little<00:00:49.370> dots<00:00:49.730> you<00:00:50.090> can<00:00:50.120> achieve<00:00:50.960> by

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
the little dots you can achieve by

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:58.300 
the little dots you can achieve by
reducing<00:00:52.580> the<00:00:52.910> air<00:00:53.059> pressure<00:00:53.559> so<00:00:57.130> that's<00:00:58.130> how

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
reducing the air pressure so that's how

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.780 
reducing the air pressure so that's how
you<00:00:58.370> can<00:00:58.610> do<00:00:58.790> this<00:00:58.970> now<00:00:59.810> you<00:00:59.870> do<00:01:00.350> some<00:01:00.790> freehand

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
you can do this now you do some freehand

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.910 
you can do this now you do some freehand
lines<00:01:03.130> so<00:01:04.130> you<00:01:04.520> have<00:01:05.509> like<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.350> effect<00:01:06.740> of

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
lines so you have like the effect of

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:27.219 
lines so you have like the effect of
stone

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.459 

so<00:01:27.829> I<00:01:27.860> have<00:01:28.399> like<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:29.810> average<00:01:29.960> is<00:01:30.259> called

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
so I have like the average is called

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:36.520 
so I have like the average is called
Omni<00:01:30.920> 3000<00:01:31.670> with<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:32.539> l5<00:01:33.140> nozzle<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:35.380> you<00:01:36.380> can

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
Omni 3000 with the l5 nozzle and you can

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.550 
Omni 3000 with the l5 nozzle and you can
also<00:01:36.649> work<00:01:37.310> very<00:01:37.420> detailed<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:38.750> fine<00:01:39.320> with<00:01:39.530> it

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
also work very detailed and fine with it

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.120 
also work very detailed and fine with it
if<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:40.909> color<00:01:41.630> is<00:01:41.719> thicker<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:43.720> this<00:01:44.720> is<00:01:44.899> a

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
if the color is thicker so this is a

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.669 
if the color is thicker so this is a
actually<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.159> color<00:01:46.670> which<00:01:47.479> used<00:01:47.780> by<00:01:48.409> car

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
actually a color which used by car

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:54.639 
actually a color which used by car
painters<00:01:49.539> so<00:01:50.539> it's<00:01:50.810> very<00:01:50.960> thick<00:01:51.439> and<00:01:53.619> with<00:01:54.619> a

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
painters so it's very thick and with a

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.490 
painters so it's very thick and with a
great<00:01:54.979> big<00:01:55.399> noodle<00:01:55.729> you<00:01:56.030> can<00:01:56.270> work<00:01:56.899> fine<00:01:57.469> with

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
great big noodle you can work fine with

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.139 
great big noodle you can work fine with
a<00:01:58.330> thick<00:01:59.330> color<00:02:00.130> here<00:02:01.130> I'm<00:02:01.369> using<00:02:01.520> M<00:02:01.849> the<00:02:02.030> you

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
black

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.380 
black
the<00:02:26.480> second<00:02:26.870> stencil<00:02:27.380> we're<00:02:27.709> using<00:02:28.120> it's<00:02:29.120> of

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
the second stencil we're using it's of

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.599 
the second stencil we're using it's of
the<00:02:29.480> grey<00:02:29.720> which<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.769> done<00:02:30.980> with<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.370> same

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
the grey which is done with the same

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.740 
the grey which is done with the same
black<00:02:31.940> but<00:02:32.500> which<00:02:33.500> with<00:02:34.420> that's<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.569> pack<00:02:35.720> of

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
black but which with that's a pack of

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:43.180 
black but which with that's a pack of
sake<00:02:36.019> so<00:02:37.420> like<00:02:38.420> 30<00:02:38.840> percent<00:02:39.290> of<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.560> black<00:02:42.190> you

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
sake so like 30 percent of the black you

00:02:43.190 --> 00:03:01.080 
sake so like 30 percent of the black you
get<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.730> nice<00:02:44.150> gray

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.770 

okay<00:03:01.840> so<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.980> is<00:03:03.190> now<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.300> main<00:03:04.739> skull<00:03:05.739> with

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
okay so this is now the main skull with

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.420 
okay so this is now the main skull with
like<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.810> light<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.290> now<00:03:08.380> we<00:03:08.440> do<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.950> highlight

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
like a light and now we do the highlight

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:21.580 
like a light and now we do the highlight
white<00:03:11.580> which<00:03:12.580> is<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.090> last<00:03:13.239> stencil

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.850 

and<00:03:22.220> there<00:03:22.459> you<00:03:22.610> can<00:03:22.790> do<00:03:22.970> like<00:03:23.450> four<00:03:24.319> white<00:03:24.620> in

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
and there you can do like four white in

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:39.420 
and there you can do like four white in
the<00:03:24.980> stands<00:03:25.280> long

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.300 

so<00:03:39.970> that<00:03:40.180> would<00:03:40.329> be<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:41.560> black-and-white

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
so that would be the black-and-white

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.809 
so that would be the black-and-white
image<00:03:43.650> now<00:03:44.650> we're<00:03:44.860> having<00:03:45.010> a<00:03:45.250> little<00:03:45.370> bit<00:03:45.549> of

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
image now we're having a little bit of

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:54.300 
image now we're having a little bit of
color<00:03:49.319> and<00:03:50.489> this<00:03:51.489> are<00:03:51.819> the<00:03:52.920> highlights<00:03:53.920> of<00:03:54.129> the

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
color and this are the highlights of the

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:01.890 
color and this are the highlights of the
crack<00:03:54.959> so<00:03:55.959> just<00:03:58.290> when<00:03:59.290> you're<00:03:59.439> painting<00:04:00.900> like

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
crack so just when you're painting like

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.289 
crack so just when you're painting like
remember<00:04:02.379> always<00:04:03.069> put<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.579> highlights<00:04:03.939> above

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
remember always put the highlights above

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.830 
remember always put the highlights above
or<00:04:04.510> underneath<00:04:05.819> one<00:04:06.819> crack<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:07.359> do<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.659> with

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
or underneath one crack and do it with

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:15.250 
or underneath one crack and do it with
every<00:04:08.260> crack

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.449 

so<00:04:15.830> we're<00:04:16.040> doing<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.609> ice<00:04:16.820> little<00:04:17.810> right<00:04:18.459> you

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
so we're doing the ice little right you

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.290 
so we're doing the ice little right you
can<00:04:19.639> go<00:04:19.790> into<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.359> skull<00:04:20.660> so<00:04:21.550> it<00:04:22.550> seems<00:04:22.970> like

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
can go into the skull so it seems like

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.060 
can go into the skull so it seems like
the<00:04:23.750> eyes<00:04:23.930> really<00:04:24.229> glowing<00:04:25.330> because<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:27.470> glow

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
the eyes really glowing because the glow

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:35.100 
the eyes really glowing because the glow
gets<00:04:28.460> out<00:04:28.880> of<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:29.240> eyes<00:04:29.360> into<00:04:30.199> the<00:04:30.410> scalp<00:04:30.740> just

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.210 

now<00:04:36.110> a<00:04:36.380> light<00:04:36.830> brown<00:04:38.620> which<00:04:39.620> I<00:04:39.770> mix<00:04:40.010> myself

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
now a light brown which I mix myself

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.840 
now a light brown which I mix myself
it's<00:04:41.150> 90%<00:04:42.130> yellow<00:04:43.130> and<00:04:43.400> a<00:04:43.430> little<00:04:43.520> bit<00:04:43.790> of

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
it's 90% yellow and a little bit of

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.529 
it's 90% yellow and a little bit of
total<00:04:44.830> and<00:04:45.830> again<00:04:46.520> you<00:04:46.639> can<00:04:46.850> put<00:04:47.060> all<00:04:47.479> the

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
total and again you can put all the

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.430 
total and again you can put all the
stencils<00:04:48.289> back<00:04:48.620> on<00:04:49.300> to<00:04:50.300> highlight<00:04:50.960> special

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
stencils back on to highlight special

00:04:51.440 --> 00:05:09.370 
stencils back on to highlight special
areas

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.760 

so<00:05:09.980> now<00:05:10.130> we're<00:05:10.340> using<00:05:10.370> the<00:05:11.170> cover-up<00:05:12.170> stencil

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
so now we're using the cover-up stencil

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.580 
so now we're using the cover-up stencil
again<00:05:13.010> to<00:05:13.250> doing<00:05:13.550> like<00:05:14.330> a<00:05:14.360> background<00:05:14.630> color

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.060 

don't<00:05:18.590> need<00:05:18.860> to<00:05:18.980> use<00:05:19.520> the<00:05:19.700> colors<00:05:20.090> but

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
don't need to use the colors but

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.800 
don't need to use the colors but
sometimes<00:05:22.070> it<00:05:22.550> gets<00:05:23.030> a<00:05:23.300> little<00:05:23.450> bit<00:05:23.630> too

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
sometimes it gets a little bit too

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.230 
sometimes it gets a little bit too
colorful<00:05:24.100> so<00:05:25.100> normally<00:05:25.610> the<00:05:25.790> black<00:05:25.940> and<00:05:26.120> white

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
colorful so normally the black and white

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.860 
colorful so normally the black and white
background<00:05:26.810> with<00:05:27.230> the<00:05:27.500> young<00:05:27.710> eyes<00:05:28.870> sometimes

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
background with the young eyes sometimes

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:38.460 
background with the young eyes sometimes
is<00:05:30.140> just<00:05:30.860> right<00:05:31.340> and<00:05:31.520> enough<00:05:36.070> but<00:05:37.070> here<00:05:37.400> it's

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
is just right and enough but here it's

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.250 
is just right and enough but here it's
the<00:05:39.470> complementing<00:05:40.160> contrast<00:05:40.790> to<00:05:41.090> the<00:05:41.930> orange

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
the complementing contrast to the orange

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.670 
the complementing contrast to the orange
of<00:05:42.380> the<00:05:42.440> eyes<00:05:43.660> that<00:05:44.660> pop<00:05:45.020> out<00:05:45.230> a<00:05:45.260> little<00:05:45.410> bit

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
of the eyes that pop out a little bit

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:52.370 
of the eyes that pop out a little bit
more

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.620 

now<00:05:52.950> I'm<00:05:53.160> doing<00:05:53.370> a<00:05:53.750> little<00:05:54.750> bit<00:05:54.930> of<00:05:55.080> freehand

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
now I'm doing a little bit of freehand

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.460 
now I'm doing a little bit of freehand
like<00:05:57.630> little<00:05:58.320> lightning<00:06:00.170> which<00:06:01.170> are

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
like little lightning which are

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:14.690 
like little lightning which are
centering<00:06:02.010> in<00:06:02.790> the<00:06:02.910> middle<00:06:03.150> of<00:06:03.240> the<00:06:03.360> eye

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.070
