00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.900
 Well, here's the telcel zinc 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.670
 is inside we are seeing that good not 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.009
 is saying that some applications 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.049
 they could be costs since they require 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.390
 some connection then data is spent 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.270
 let's tell him if we're going to say that 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.360
 we do not want to see this let's start the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.760
 initial configuration of this phone 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.100
 we have let's see what options 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.490
 Spanish beech Spanish and Spanish 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.920
 from the USA 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.570
 and well so let's put that 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.750
 let's see next here 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.280
 let's connect it to the internet we are going to 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.280
 put the key 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.200
 says that a license agreement between 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.579
 samsung and you as a user that goes through 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.579
 all your software 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.270
 etc 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.660
 let's see what we accept and if many 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.660
 Thank you 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:13.000
 and start with our samsung account 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.070
 you can create an account if you do not have a 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.470
 samsung account it is important that if 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.720
 you have a team of this 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.420
 company through this account 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.670
 samsung can you get like having a 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.530
 file of the applications that you use 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.920
 and in that way do everything much more 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.920
 easy 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.100
 is registering says we can restore 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.710
 the team and I create a secure account 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.650
 has a samsung team I could 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.270
 restore with this information from this 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.490
 another samsung computer but in this case 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.530
 I want to live the complete experience with 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.740
 the s4 of a start and let's put here 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.230
 next says 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.410
 Lets put 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.410
 yes 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.260
 let's put to accept we do not care 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.810
 in this case now the google accounts 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.310
 let's put that if this allows us 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.380
 also that our information from the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.050
 e - mail shop etc. 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.520
 etcetera etcetera everything is configured 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.520
 and synchronized 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.390
 here we are seeing the use of espn that 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.250
 allows the exchange of information 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.180
 data touching other devices we are going to 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.180
 put that yes that is available 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.010
 at the sight of the history shows 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.840
 useful information when we put everything 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.340
 on the screen for a moment the 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.659
 manager with three best elements that 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.519
 witnesses with your hand on the sensor 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.590
 let's go with the one that if control of voice 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.530
 fixed is also activated 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.120
 can smart is to pose the video that 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.019
 device of 30 that is remote its 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.019
 face of the screen 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.549
 if the easy mode does not optimize the 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.549
 screen 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.450
 I have 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.450
 here 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.390
 and ends 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:20.910
 is already set up my son is already in 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.910
 the messenger and data 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.819
 and is configuring we see already the subject of 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.349
 the screen 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.610
 let's go the screen is in automatic 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.410
 but let's put it at its maximum level 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.410
 so you can appreciate better 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.270
 the job 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.800
 as it is in the stories the time 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.800
 the icons look very good 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.870
 we will be testing each of the 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.120
 applications installed in this 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.670
 device but it is striking that 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.000
 one of a start comes trip advisor is 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.290
 games as one is health that is one of 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.319
 the new applications that were 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.550
 shown good polaris that is a 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.560
 system of 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.720
 documents that says says this is 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.030
 just opened the screen 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.780
 software acquisition 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.780
 yes 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.989
 install 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.940
 and that 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.570
 is going to restart is being updated 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.570
 the computer software 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.830
 we are here updating the software 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.830
 of the team 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.900
 but in the meantime we can you 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:48.639
 can compare 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:52.229
 the screen with the file is the 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.229
 stress you can see here 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.040
 and we can buy even good too 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.040
 sizes and thicknesses 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.100
 this was the team that in which 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.630
 based on a focus group people 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.800
 determined that see what should reach 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.670
 our country and of which we are 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.670
 using here in mexico 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.740
 Many people disagree on that 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.950
 decision but good as the team that 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.950
 we have 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.060
 Well, the update is finished 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.880
 We are waiting for you to reload 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.850
 the team we see having for example a 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.540
 samsung logo with the s4 much more 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.540
 stylized 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.520
 is optimizing the system 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.460
 there are 119 applications that are being 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.460
 optimizing 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.750
 it's a process that maybe can be a 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:13.110
 little long maybe tedious but good 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.580
 It's a pity that you know the kind of things 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.599
 that could happen at the moment of 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:21.210
 turn on your galaxy s 4 for the first time and 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:24.750
 that when this video can serve you 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.550
 as the guide of what to do in your case the 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:30.770
 base as you have seen all inmates have 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.770
 been very simple very fast 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.360
 apparently it's over 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.140
 something that you see me I do not know if you can 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.720
 appreciate maybe not but let's go 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:53.680
 maybe with this other camera they are going to 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:56.890
 appreciate it like without touching the screen the 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.510
 screen detects that this video here 

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.320
 the screen went out but well we're going to 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:04.640
 repeat 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:08.050
 see how I can this sensor in the 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.050
 screen that allows 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.840
 is what there is 

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.419
 to accept 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.190
 the truth that this touch wizo this 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:21.460
 All wish version that we had already 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.460
 viewed 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.660
 it looks much more graphic when we can 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.500
 we are still here watching the applications 

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.540
 but as we already mentioned 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.820
 we will be testing along these 

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:34.640
 days to show you the differences with 

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.410
 other equipment the truth is that it looks very 

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.840
 well the screen with the naked eye looks 

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.910
 very very good but good we will be 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:44.770
 testing all this in the coming days 

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.770
 I am Luis cake, take care
