00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.889 
answer I usually start off doing time
tremolo<00:01:53.040> picking<00:01:53.280> drills<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.509> just

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
tremolo picking drills and this is just

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.359 
tremolo picking drills and this is just
to<00:01:55.680> get<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.579> warm<00:01:56.969> up<00:01:57.180> these<00:01:57.360> muscles<00:01:57.630> and

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
to get it to warm up these muscles and

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.230 
to get it to warm up these muscles and
develop<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.520> in

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
develop the in

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.899 
develop the in
and<00:02:00.570> have<00:02:00.750> good<00:02:01.020> hand<00:02:01.470> posture<00:02:02.130> for<00:02:02.670> what<00:02:02.820> I'm

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
and have good hand posture for what I'm

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:03.530 
and have good hand posture for what I'm
thinking

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
thinking

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.380 
thinking
I'd<00:02:03.690> like<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.290> pretty<00:02:04.619> much<00:02:04.799> adhere<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:06.150> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
I'd like to pretty much adhere to the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.889 
I'd like to pretty much adhere to the
standardized<00:02:07.819> 45-degree<00:02:08.819> angle<00:02:09.330> with<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
standardized 45-degree angle with the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.050 
standardized 45-degree angle with the
pit<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.380> can<00:02:10.500> see<00:02:10.709> them<00:02:10.800> hold<00:02:11.100> it<00:02:11.310> between<00:02:11.760> my

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
pit you can see them hold it between my

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.449 
pit you can see them hold it between my
thumb<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.330> index<00:02:12.780> finger<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.440> get<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:13.800> 45<00:02:14.310> degree

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
thumb and index finger I get a 45 degree

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.790 
thumb and index finger I get a 45 degree
angle<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.240> I'll<00:02:15.569> do<00:02:15.750> time<00:02:16.080> drill<00:02:16.440> through<00:02:16.709> our

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
angle and I'll do time drill through our

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.340 
angle and I'll do time drill through our
tremolo<00:02:17.250> feet<00:02:17.520> so<00:02:18.270> it's<00:02:18.600> basically<00:02:18.959> goes<00:02:19.230> like

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
tremolo feet so it's basically goes like

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.949 
tremolo feet so it's basically goes like
this<00:02:19.709> I'll<00:02:20.220> turn<00:02:20.459> on<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.700> timer<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.630> I'll<00:02:21.810> go

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
this I'll turn on the timer and I'll go

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.780 
this I'll turn on the timer and I'll go
one<00:02:22.230> minute<00:02:22.410> lately<00:02:23.010> I've<00:02:23.130> been<00:02:23.250> stepping<00:02:23.580> it

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
one minute lately I've been stepping it

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.280 
one minute lately I've been stepping it
up<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.209> go<00:02:24.330> in<00:02:24.390> about<00:02:24.569> two<00:02:24.810> minutes

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
up and you go in about two minutes

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.280 
up and you go in about two minutes
and<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:25.980> basically<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:27.270> don't<00:02:27.420> pick<00:02:28.110> with

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
and you basically you don't pick with

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.199 
and you basically you don't pick with
your<00:02:28.440> arm<00:02:28.709> don't<00:02:29.220> do<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:29.670> is<00:02:29.819> kind<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.120> a

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
your arm don't do this is kind of a

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.780 
your arm don't do this is kind of a
teeny<00:02:30.450> Loggins<00:02:30.989> type<00:02:31.319> of<00:02:31.530> strum<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.519> want<00:02:32.730> a

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
teeny Loggins type of strum you want a

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.300 
teeny Loggins type of strum you want a
really<00:02:33.450> minimize<00:02:33.959> movement<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.950> get<00:02:35.160> the

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
really minimize movement to get the

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.570 
really minimize movement to get the
maximum<00:02:35.940> amount<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.930> energy<00:02:37.709> going<00:02:38.430> in<00:02:38.550> a

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
maximum amount of energy going in a

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:47.750 
maximum amount of energy going in a
smallest<00:02:39.269> space<00:02:45.019> I'll<00:02:46.019> do<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.470> for<00:02:46.800> a<00:02:47.070> minute

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
smallest space I'll do that for a minute

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.640 
smallest space I'll do that for a minute
or<00:02:47.940> two<00:02:47.970> minutes<00:02:48.480> I'll<00:02:48.630> have<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.810> timer<00:02:49.170> get<00:02:49.620> a

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
or two minutes I'll have a timer get a

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.620 
or two minutes I'll have a timer get a
stopwatch<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.400> time<00:02:50.580> or<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.239> probably<00:02:51.480> got

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
stopwatch to time or you probably got

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.340 
stopwatch to time or you probably got
one<00:02:51.810> on<00:02:51.930> your<00:02:52.050> phone<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.970> then<00:02:54.360> I'll<00:02:54.780> go<00:02:55.050> a

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
one on your phone and then I'll go a

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.290 
one on your phone and then I'll go a
minute<00:02:55.800> on<00:02:55.920> two<00:02:56.280> minutes<00:02:56.489> on<00:02:56.790> however<00:02:57.120> long

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
minute on two minutes on however long

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.940 
minute on two minutes on however long
I'm<00:02:57.390> going<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:58.050> then<00:02:58.200> take<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.410> break<00:02:58.590> for<00:02:58.830> a

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
I'm going and then take a break for a

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.320 
I'm going and then take a break for a
minute<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.400> let<00:02:59.610> you<00:02:59.880> know<00:02:59.970> because<00:03:00.090> you're

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
going to get sore if you do this this is

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.270 
going to get sore if you do this this is
physical<00:03:03.000> activity<00:03:03.200> take<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.230> break<00:03:04.560> go<00:03:05.130> the

you<00:03:16.330> can<00:03:16.540> mess<00:03:16.720> around<00:03:16.930> piggy<00:03:17.290> dynamics<00:03:18.040> you

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
you can mess around piggy dynamics you

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:27.530 
you can mess around piggy dynamics you
can<00:03:18.190> here<00:03:18.640> as<00:03:18.820> I<00:03:19.300> do<00:03:19.360> this<00:03:19.690> if<00:03:19.870> I<00:03:19.990> move

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.540 

palm<00:03:28.540> unit<00:03:29.170> you<00:03:29.290> get<00:03:29.500> a<00:03:29.530> real<00:03:29.800> punchy<00:03:30.280> sound

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
palm unit you get a real punchy sound

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.790 
palm unit you get a real punchy sound
and<00:03:31.060> if<00:03:31.210> you<00:03:31.540> play<00:03:31.750> open<00:03:32.230> you<00:03:32.350> get<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.530> really

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
and if you play open you get a really

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.970 
and if you play open you get a really
big<00:03:33.100> Russia<00:03:33.730> open<00:03:34.060> seven<00:03:34.300> anyway<00:03:34.710> so<00:03:35.710> if<00:03:35.860> you

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
big Russia open seven anyway so if you

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.580 
big Russia open seven anyway so if you
do<00:03:36.190> that<00:03:36.400> time<00:03:37.090> on<00:03:37.510> each<00:03:37.630> string<00:03:38.080> you'll<00:03:38.410> get<00:03:38.560> a

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
do that time on each string you'll get a

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.920 
do that time on each string you'll get a
good<00:03:38.890> little<00:03:39.250> warm-up<00:03:39.730> for<00:03:39.940> your<00:03:40.090> right<00:03:40.330> hand
