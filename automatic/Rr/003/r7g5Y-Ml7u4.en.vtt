00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.520 
same time I thought the simulation was
excellent<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.420> think<00:02:28.630> that<00:02:28.750> this<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.080> done<00:02:29.230> in

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
excellent to think that this is done in

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.830 
excellent to think that this is done in
a<00:02:29.650> field<00:02:29.950> hospital<00:02:30.220> if<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.150> had<00:02:31.299> a<00:02:31.330> doctor<00:02:31.720> who
