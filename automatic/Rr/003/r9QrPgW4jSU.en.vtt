00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
five or six inches i guess but you can

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.520 
five or six inches i guess but you can
see<00:03:41.220> right<00:03:41.250> on<00:03:41.610> this<00:03:41.970> sword<00:03:42.299> line<00:03:42.660> where<00:03:43.019> the

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
see right on this sword line where the

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.060 
see right on this sword line where the
ice<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.820> waves<00:03:45.269> have<00:03:45.750> brought<00:03:45.989> in<00:03:46.230> these

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
ice and the waves have brought in these

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.789 
ice and the waves have brought in these
rocks<00:03:47.489> up<00:03:47.880> here<00:03:48.299> that's<00:03:48.780> about<00:03:49.079> what<00:03:49.440> i<00:03:49.470> can

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
rocks up here that's about what i can

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.590 
rocks up here that's about what i can
get<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:52.700> otherwise<00:03:53.700> they'll<00:03:53.970> be<00:03:54.120> over<00:03:54.450> my

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
get to and otherwise they'll be over my

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.259 
get to and otherwise they'll be over my
boots<00:03:54.920> anyway<00:03:55.920> my<00:03:56.489> thinking<00:03:56.790> is<00:03:57.090> hopefully<00:03:57.810> if

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
boots anyway my thinking is hopefully if

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.240 
boots anyway my thinking is hopefully if
the<00:04:00.269> ice<00:04:00.390> was<00:04:00.720> able<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.079> move<00:04:01.290> these<00:04:01.530> rocks<00:04:01.859> up

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
the ice was able to move these rocks up

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.190 
the ice was able to move these rocks up
maybe<00:04:02.519> it<00:04:02.730> brought<00:04:02.940> up<00:04:03.120> some<00:04:03.329> jewelry<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:04.019> you

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
maybe it brought up some jewelry to you

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.140 
maybe it brought up some jewelry to you
never<00:04:04.410> know<00:04:04.620> so<00:04:05.430> that's<00:04:05.640> where<00:04:05.850> i'm<00:04:05.940> going<00:04:06.090> to

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
never know so that's where i'm going to

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.150 
never know so that's where i'm going to
be<00:04:06.269> working<00:04:06.299> for<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:07.019> a<00:04:07.079> little<00:04:07.200> bit<00:04:07.470> i<00:04:07.709> think

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
be working for it a little bit i think

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.550 
be working for it a little bit i think
that's<00:04:08.549> cool<00:04:08.820> helps<00:04:09.209> get<00:04:09.390> like<00:04:09.600> almost<00:04:10.109> a<00:04:10.320> line

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
that's cool helps get like almost a line

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.319 
that's cool helps get like almost a line
where<00:04:11.390> it's<00:04:12.390> all<00:04:12.570> sinned<00:04:12.989> and<00:04:13.380> then<00:04:13.709> all<00:04:13.920> rock

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
where it's all sinned and then all rock

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.550 
where it's all sinned and then all rock
so<00:04:15.329> I'm<00:04:15.420> going<00:04:15.570> to<00:04:15.600> try<00:04:15.810> these<00:04:15.870> rocks<00:04:16.289> out
