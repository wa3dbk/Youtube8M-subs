00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.910
 hello good morning friends and friends today 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.559
 let's make a meal like this very fast 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.500
 let's make a provolone cheese 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.900
 oven and we're going to fold it a little bit with 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.720
 a few species 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.520
 I'm going to use onion and garlic powder a 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.570
 little pepper and a little oregano 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.830
 salt and extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.310
 I teach common 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:36.420
 Well, first of all, it's a good 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.420
 trickle of oil 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.079
 between the salt and then I put my 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.079
 slice 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.160
 another good splash of oil other 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.920
 little bit of salt and now it's starting to 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.920
 fold it with the onion 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.300
 garlic 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.590
 what do you say about ground pepper 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.670
 and the oregano 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.420
 you can use more herbs like thyme 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:28.009
 You can also use sweet paprika or 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.860
 paprika a little spicy that's already going to 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.079
 I like it now this is cazoleta the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.979
 put in the oven until it melts 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:40.030
 about 10-15 minutes we put the cheese in 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.030
 the tray itself 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.240
 and we will wait for 10-15 minutes on 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.010
 oven I have set it to about 200 degrees and 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.750
 here you have the cheese fresh from the 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:54.200
 oven looks 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.770
 we counted some piquitos and to eat 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.479
 You see, it's like a nest, I hope that you 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.479
 I like it very much, take advantage
