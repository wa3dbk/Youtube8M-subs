day<00:00:50.170> I'm<00:00:50.920> level<00:00:51.220> 60<00:00:51.670> actually<00:00:51.940> technically

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
day I'm level 60 actually technically

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.430

like<00:00:52.620> 65<00:00:53.620> now<00:00:53.920> I<00:00:53.980> think<00:00:54.750> I've<00:00:55.750> leveled<00:00:55.989> up<00:00:56.170> past

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
like 65 now I think I've leveled up past

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.219 
like 65 now I think I've leveled up past
that<00:00:56.650> for<00:00:56.860> the<00:00:56.979> new<00:00:57.629> specializations<00:00:58.629> and

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:08.190 

move<00:01:02.229> down<00:01:02.500> to<00:01:02.949> two<00:01:03.309> or<00:01:03.370> three<00:01:03.610> now

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.190

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
and it's a great way to not only level

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.490 
and it's a great way to not only level
