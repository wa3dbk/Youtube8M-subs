00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
more like stock Samsung Samsung Samsung

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.390 
more like stock Samsung Samsung Samsung
Samsung<00:00:20.510> so<00:00:21.510> one<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.810> coolest<00:00:22.230> things<00:00:22.560> it

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
Samsung so one of the coolest things it

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.800 
Samsung so one of the coolest things it
does<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:25.470> shows<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.160> LED

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
does is that it shows you that LED

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.560 
does is that it shows you that LED
notifications<00:00:27.810> without<00:00:28.260> an<00:00:28.410> LED<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.570> that's

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
notifications without an LED so that's

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.639 
notifications without an LED so that's
really<00:00:30.750> cool<00:00:31.759> the<00:00:32.759> app<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.360> no<00:00:33.780> LED<00:00:34.230> settings

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
really cool the app is no LED settings

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.549 
really cool the app is no LED settings
so<00:00:35.219> if<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.820> put<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:36.809> change<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
so if you put that on you can change the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.500 
so if you put that on you can change the
toggle<00:00:37.980> notifications<00:00:38.640> colors<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.270> stuff

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
toggle notifications colors and stuff

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.040 
toggle notifications colors and stuff
and<00:00:40.280> you<00:00:41.280> know<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.489> get<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:42.050> led

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
and you know you get that led

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.200 
and you know you get that led
notification<00:00:43.350> since<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.579> phone<00:00:44.820> doesn't

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
notification since this phone doesn't

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.700 
notification since this phone doesn't
have<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> real<00:00:46.170> LED<00:00:46.649> like<00:00:47.239> Galaxy<00:00:48.239> Nexus<00:00:48.710> you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
have a real LED like Galaxy Nexus you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.790 
have a real LED like Galaxy Nexus you
can<00:00:49.860> use<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.190> app<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.660> other<00:00:52.620> than

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
can use that app to do it other than

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.500 
can use that app to do it other than
that<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.160> comes<00:00:53.430> with<00:00:53.610> three<00:00:54.000> launchers

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
that this comes with three launchers

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.170 
that this comes with three launchers
Apex<00:00:55.050> Launcher<00:00:55.170> nova<00:00:56.010> launcher<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.699> touchwiz

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
Apex Launcher nova launcher and touchwiz

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.520 
Apex Launcher nova launcher and touchwiz
launcher

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
launcher

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.560 
launcher
I<00:00:58.559> think<00:00:59.129> touchwiz<00:00:59.520> launcher<00:00:59.550> makes<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.390> most

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
I think touchwiz launcher makes the most

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.290 
I think touchwiz launcher makes the most
sense<00:01:00.690> since<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.710> more<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.399> people<00:01:03.090> who

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
sense since this is more for people who

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.560 
sense since this is more for people who
like<00:01:03.600> stock<00:01:04.080> Samsung<00:01:04.700> Apps<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.450> know

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
like stock Samsung Apps and you know

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.899 
like stock Samsung Apps and you know
TouchWiz<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.380> stuff<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:08.369> still<00:01:08.640> get<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
TouchWiz and stuff you still get the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.950 
TouchWiz and stuff you still get the
benefits<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.570> having<00:01:10.260> all<00:01:10.530> those<00:01:10.830> TouchWiz

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
benefits of having all those TouchWiz

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.200 
benefits of having all those TouchWiz
widgets<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.170> one<00:01:13.320> not<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.909> it's<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.970> great

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
widgets and one not so it's a great

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.140 
widgets and one not so it's a great
choice<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.860> if<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.070> need<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.369> use<00:01:17.670> samsung

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
choice and if you need to use samsung

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.060 
choice and if you need to use samsung
kies<00:01:18.360> personally<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:18.930> don't<00:01:19.020> use<00:01:19.290> tamson<00:01:19.860> keys

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
kies personally I don't use tamson keys

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.649 
kies personally I don't use tamson keys
and<00:01:20.310> that's<00:01:20.460> why<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.640> like<00:01:21.060> custom<00:01:21.479> homes

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and that's why I like custom homes

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.260 
and that's why I like custom homes
because<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.170> removes<00:01:23.009> all<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.189> blower<00:01:23.549> but

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
because it removes all that blower but

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.899 
because it removes all that blower but
you<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.630> add<00:01:24.930> all<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.530> back<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.220> using

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
you can add all of that back in using

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:27.770 
you can add all of that back in using

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.670 
and it's a pretty cool ROM I've got see
a<00:01:38.759> kernel<00:01:39.360> running<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.650> can

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
a kernel running on it so I can

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.679 
a kernel running on it so I can
overclock<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.460> 1.6<00:01:41.880> gigahertz<00:01:42.360> you'll

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
overclock it to 1.6 gigahertz you'll

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.039 
overclock it to 1.6 gigahertz you'll
meet<00:01:42.869> setcpu<00:01:43.439> app<00:01:44.000> since<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.689> more<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.960> a
