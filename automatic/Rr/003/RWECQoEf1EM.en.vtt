00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
work in the United States so why did the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.530 
work in the United States so why did the
Soviets<00:02:05.549> pour<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:05.909> much<00:02:05.969> energy<00:02:06.240> and

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
Soviets pour so much energy and

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.210 
Soviets pour so much energy and

fighting to keep their best players

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.589 
fighting to keep their best players
inside<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.560> system<00:02:11.009> for<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.430> long<00:02:11.730> according

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
inside the system for so long according

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.270 
inside the system for so long according
to<00:02:12.629> Polsky

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
to Polsky

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.550 
to Polsky
it<00:02:13.700> all<00:02:13.850> stems<00:02:14.150> from<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.510> very<00:02:14.750> clear<00:02:15.050> agenda<00:02:15.140> at

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
it all stems from a very clear agenda at

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.920 
it all stems from a very clear agenda at
the<00:02:15.680> heart<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.250> Cold<00:02:16.459> War<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:17.060> think<00:02:17.600> sports

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
the heart of the Cold War I think sports

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.040 
the heart of the Cold War I think sports
is<00:02:18.140> an<00:02:18.260> easy<00:02:18.500> way<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.890> reach<00:02:19.610> people<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.600> I

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
is an easy way to reach people and I

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.230 
is an easy way to reach people and I
think<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.410> Soviet<00:02:21.800> Union<00:02:22.100> knew<00:02:22.700> that<00:02:22.940> they
