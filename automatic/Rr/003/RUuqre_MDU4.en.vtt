00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.260
 it can hardly be a coincidence 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.390
 when we got the lg optimus live to bully both manufacturers press release 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.390
 out the door that in 40 days no fewer than a million copies 

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:17.929
 there are quite a few and i have to say after i use my 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:19.449
 I am not surprised 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.910
 the lg optimus live is already the third device of elteren that runs on it 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.509
 operating system emmeloord 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.489
 and again in this case is a nice cheap device 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.589
 if it is seen because device are just fej ajax 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.780
 fortunately he could be very sturdy through the use of a lot of metal he he lies 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.340
 nice in the hand 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.770
 the recording man revolves around the very latest version of 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.220
 operating system android version 2 points 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.370
 just like for example a lot of hsv graduates who he said p 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.640
 but although operating system people who are kids the experience does very differently 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.630
 screen is a lot smaller and the processor is also a lot slower 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.350
 although and then in many cases very smoothly, it sometimes notices 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.380
 the heavier work however, it is difficult for the headphones and with 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.380
 percussion I also mean a game of volvo example pink 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.610
 but no compulsory work really goes very smoothly the device 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.680
 and sometimes the internet is excellent 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.480
 a small side note 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.830
 the device cannot display flash movies such as a movie 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.180
 best product 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.680
 that is a new function from and by the pvv but because the screen 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.820
 that can't handle it's that out 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.870
 nevertheless there were very very positive 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.120
 mw2 the two star convent versatile and nice and fast and market-able 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.620
 completely filled with 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.850
 and the device has everything to make use of it 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.759
 from live out and after seven years for a fast connection to generate so that you 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.250
 always know how to point 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.760
 the 3 megapixel camera at the back of the day is still pretty nice 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.350
 but because there is no fish on it you have nothing to look for in the twilight 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.640
 The absolute plus of the device is the battery that lasts much longer than 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.960
 to come to the average few 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.120
 lg has the interface of there should also be a bit of an own face 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:01:59.820
 to give 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.250
 no real improvement I am not really part of the anp axes with which they have 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.860
 done 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.500
 A big advantage is that you never enter the main menu again 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.920
 you can categorize it is often little out of the park anyway 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.659
 much more overview 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:16.400
 the lg optimus what is not a device that makes a lot of impression but I do 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.449
 very good value for money 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:21.899
 the latest version of never have a very solid and not too expensive device 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:24.229
 yes although I understand that he is so popular
