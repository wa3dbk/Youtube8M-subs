get<00:03:40.120> one<00:03:40.390> thick<00:03:40.750> coat<00:03:40.780> all<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.380> time<00:03:41.770> you

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
get one thick coat all the time you

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.410 
get one thick coat all the time you
really<00:03:42.160> have<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.370> be<00:03:42.490> patient<00:03:42.970> when<00:03:43.360> you're

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
spray painting you can see how light the

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.290 
spray painting you can see how light the
coats<00:03:55.360> are<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:55.990> it's<00:03:56.860> tempting<00:03:57.250> to<00:03:57.610> think

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
coats are and it's tempting to think

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.610 
coats are and it's tempting to think
well<00:03:58.600> I'm<00:03:58.690> just<00:03:58.810> going<00:03:58.990> to<00:03:59.050> try<00:03:59.230> to<00:03:59.290> get<00:03:59.470> that

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
black but that would be a mistake let

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.240 
black but that would be a mistake let
the<00:04:01.720> paint<00:04:01.960> dry<00:04:02.050> come<00:04:02.590> back<00:04:02.740> in<00:04:02.860> about<00:04:03.010> ten

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
the paint dry come back in about ten

the paint dry come back in about ten
minutes<00:04:03.430> and<00:04:04.030> give<00:04:04.180> it<00:04:04.270> another<00:04:04.450> thin<00:04:04.720> coat

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
minutes and give it another thin coat

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.870 
minutes and give it another thin coat
well<00:04:05.260> now<00:04:05.380> I've<00:04:05.500> got<00:04:05.560> about<00:04:05.830> five<00:04:06.190> thin<00:04:06.550> coats

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
well now I've got about five thin coats

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.670 
well now I've got about five thin coats
of<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.330> black<00:04:07.540> spray<00:04:07.870> paint<00:04:07.900> on<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.410> board

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
of the black spray paint on the board

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.190 
of the black spray paint on the board
and<00:04:08.920> I<00:04:09.550> should<00:04:09.760> mention<00:04:09.940> that<00:04:10.180> I<00:04:10.600> allow<00:04:11.140> the

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
and I should mention that I allow the

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.590 
and I should mention that I allow the
paint<00:04:11.620> to<00:04:11.710> dry<00:04:11.980> about<00:04:12.190> 15<00:04:12.730> or<00:04:12.850> 20<00:04:12.880> minutes<00:04:13.240> in

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
paint to dry about 15 or 20 minutes in

paint to dry about 15 or 20 minutes in
between<00:04:13.720> coats<00:04:14.170> because<00:04:14.920> ten<00:04:15.160> minutes<00:04:15.430> just

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
between coats because ten minutes just

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.099 
between coats because ten minutes just
wasn't<00:04:16.000> long<00:04:16.150> enough<00:04:16.390> and<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.750> paint<00:04:16.989> was

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
wasn't long enough and the paint was

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.170 
wasn't long enough and the paint was
still<00:04:17.230> a<00:04:17.350> little<00:04:17.590> bit<00:04:17.680> tacky<00:04:17.980> the<00:04:18.760> last<00:04:18.970> coat

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180

still a little bit tacky the last coat
of<00:04:19.209> paint<00:04:19.480> I<00:04:19.750> allowed<00:04:20.290> that<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.680> dry<00:04:20.920> for<00:04:20.980> two

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
of paint I allowed that to dry for two

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.610 
of paint I allowed that to dry for two
hours<00:04:21.910> just<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.600> give<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:22.930> paint<00:04:23.170> a<00:04:23.380> good

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
hours just to give the paint a good

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.410 
hours just to give the paint a good
chance<00:04:23.890> to<00:04:23.980> set<00:04:24.280> up<00:04:24.400> before<00:04:24.730> I<00:04:24.970> remove<00:04:25.240> the

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
chance to set up before I remove the

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:43.949 
chance to set up before I remove the
tape

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:43.959 

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:46.359 

all<00:04:44.959> right<00:04:45.169> well<00:04:45.349> the<00:04:45.439> next<00:04:45.619> step<00:04:45.770> is<00:04:45.919> to<00:04:46.219> bring

00:04:46.359 --> 00:04:46.369 
all right well the next step is to bring

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:48.369 
all right well the next step is to bring
the<00:04:46.490> board<00:04:46.669> back<00:04:46.879> outside<00:04:47.149> and<00:04:47.659> just<00:04:48.139> give<00:04:48.259> it

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:48.379 
the board back outside and just give it

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:50.589 
the board back outside and just give it
one<00:04:48.559> more<00:04:48.709> thin<00:04:49.009> coated<00:04:49.369> clear<00:04:49.669> and<00:04:49.939> then<00:04:50.569> I

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
one more thin coated clear and then I

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:55.540 
one more thin coated clear and then I
can<00:04:50.809> put<00:04:50.959> the<00:04:51.050> board<00:04:51.259> back<00:04:51.379> together<00:04:54.520> well<00:04:55.520> I

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
can put the board back together well I

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.919 
can put the board back together well I
think<00:04:55.639> I'm<00:04:55.849> going<00:04:55.939> to<00:04:55.999> let<00:04:56.119> the<00:04:56.270> paint<00:04:56.599> set<00:04:56.809> up

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:56.929 
think I'm going to let the paint set up

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:59.139 
think I'm going to let the paint set up
for<00:04:57.139> a<00:04:57.169> day<00:04:57.349> or<00:04:57.469> two<00:04:57.649> before<00:04:57.860> I<00:04:58.309> put<00:04:58.819> the<00:04:58.909> skate

00:04:59.139 --> 00:04:59.149 
for a day or two before I put the skate

00:04:59.149 --> 00:05:01.629 
for a day or two before I put the skate
tape<00:04:59.389> on<00:04:59.599> and<00:04:59.929> attach<00:05:00.229> the<00:05:00.439> trucks<00:05:00.800> now<00:05:01.459> I<00:05:01.490> know

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
tape on and attach the trucks now I know

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.040 
tape on and attach the trucks now I know
this<00:05:01.849> video<00:05:01.999> is<00:05:02.180> a<00:05:02.240> little<00:05:02.419> bit<00:05:02.599> different

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
this video is a little bit different

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.809 
this video is a little bit different
from<00:05:03.259> what<00:05:03.529> I<00:05:03.559> usually<00:05:03.830> do<00:05:04.219> when<00:05:04.580> I'm<00:05:04.699> making

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
from what I usually do when I'm making

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.959 
from what I usually do when I'm making
furniture<00:05:05.300> or<00:05:06.159> making<00:05:07.159> art<00:05:07.399> related<00:05:07.759> things

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:07.969 
furniture or making art related things

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:09.790 
furniture or making art related things
but<00:05:08.539> really<00:05:08.659> in<00:05:08.869> my<00:05:08.990> view<00:05:09.229> it's<00:05:09.379> all<00:05:09.469> the<00:05:09.619> same

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
but really in my view it's all the same

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.139 
but really in my view it's all the same
thing<00:05:10.039> as<00:05:10.159> long<00:05:10.309> as<00:05:10.430> you're<00:05:10.550> making<00:05:10.729> something

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:11.149 
thing as long as you're making something

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:13.329 
thing as long as you're making something
