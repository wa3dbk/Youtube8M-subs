or four days so a 10 in the month is
what<00:01:12.540> I'm<00:01:12.659> thinking<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.740> epic<00:01:14.310> fail

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
what I'm thinking I do a epic fail

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.120 
what I'm thinking I do a epic fail
predator<00:01:15.750> there<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.759> um<00:01:18.110> yeah<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.680> was<00:01:19.770> also

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
predator there but um yeah that was also

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.560 
predator there but um yeah that was also
an<00:01:20.250> epic<00:01:20.490> fail<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> double<00:01:21.270> fail

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
an epic fail so it's like a double fail

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.179 
an epic fail so it's like a double fail

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
actually it's better for me because I'm

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.330 
actually it's better for me because I'm
actually<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.290> one<00:02:25.350> picking<00:02:25.650> up<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:25.920> lot<00:02:26.310> of

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
I was talking about

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.460 
I was talking about
you<00:04:13.340> can<00:04:13.489> basically<00:04:13.659> look<00:04:14.659> at<00:04:14.810> both<00:04:14.989> sides<00:04:15.019> of

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
you can basically look at both sides of

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.800 
you can basically look at both sides of
map<00:04:15.739> and<00:04:16.040> you<00:04:16.820> actually<00:04:16.970> pick<00:04:17.209> up<00:04:17.239> quite<00:04:17.600> a<00:04:17.630> bit

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
map and you actually pick up quite a bit

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.370 
map and you actually pick up quite a bit
of<00:04:17.900> kills<00:04:19.030> so<00:04:20.030> right<00:04:20.180> now<00:04:20.239> I'm<00:04:20.509> just<00:04:20.570> kind<00:04:21.320> of

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
of kills so right now I'm just kind of

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.379 
of kills so right now I'm just kind of
finish<00:04:21.680> up<00:04:21.889> real<00:04:22.190> fast<00:04:22.310> could<00:04:22.759> pick<00:04:23.030> up<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.210> few

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
finish up real fast could pick up a few

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.870 
finish up real fast could pick up a few
last<00:04:23.630> kills<00:04:26.080> think<00:04:27.080> I'm<00:04:27.169> few<00:04:28.130> three<00:04:28.699> or<00:04:28.759> four

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
last kills think I'm few three or four

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.029 
last kills think I'm few three or four
kills<00:04:29.240> I<00:04:29.419> think<00:04:29.600> of<00:04:29.780> me<00:04:30.139> five<00:04:30.380> kills<00:04:30.620> away<00:04:30.800> from

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.689 
kills I think of me five kills away from
winning<00:04:31.699> and<00:04:32.000> I<00:04:32.120> do<00:04:32.180> a<00:04:32.300> little<00:04:32.509> jig<00:04:32.810> and<00:04:33.050> I<00:04:33.699> kill

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
winning and I do a little jig and I kill

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.060 
winning and I do a little jig and I kill
that<00:04:34.850> kid<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:35.270> I<00:04:35.389> know<00:04:35.449> he's<00:04:35.780> yelling<00:04:36.169> about

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070
