00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
highlighted it with just just the

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.780 
highlighted it with just just the
original<00:04:49.380> base<00:04:49.680> color<00:04:49.950> and<00:04:50.100> then<00:04:50.220> it<00:04:50.400> makes<00:04:50.610> a

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
original base color and then it makes a

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.700 
original base color and then it makes a
really<00:04:51.360> small<00:04:51.600> amount<00:04:51.720> of<00:04:51.930> white<00:04:52.169> and<00:04:52.470> then

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
really small amount of white and then

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.890 
really small amount of white and then
one<00:04:52.979> extra<00:04:53.310> highlight<00:04:53.490> on<00:04:53.760> all<00:04:53.880> the<00:04:53.970> areas<00:04:54.300> so

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
one extra highlight on all the areas so

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.330 
one extra highlight on all the areas so
you<00:04:54.930> can<00:04:55.110> see<00:04:55.320> on<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:55.560> areas<00:04:55.830> like<00:04:55.890> the<00:04:56.130> bone

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
you can see on the areas like the bone

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.900 
you can see on the areas like the bone
and

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
and

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.460 
and
you<00:04:57.120> can<00:04:57.300> you<00:04:57.540> can<00:04:57.690> really<00:04:57.960> see<00:04:58.140> how<00:04:58.260> it's

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
you can you can really see how it's

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.590 
you can you can really see how it's
nicely<00:04:58.980> got<00:04:59.460> now<00:04:59.760> how<00:05:00.120> you've<00:05:00.240> got<00:05:00.330> a<00:05:00.390> nice

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
nicely got now how you've got a nice

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.930 
nicely got now how you've got a nice
gradient<00:05:00.960> from<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.920> really<00:05:02.220> dark<00:05:02.400> brown<00:05:02.640> and

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
gradient from the really dark brown and

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.210 
gradient from the really dark brown and
the<00:05:03.000> shade<00:05:03.240> areas<00:05:03.720> through<00:05:04.230> the<00:05:04.470> kind<00:05:04.890> of<00:05:04.950> bone

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
the shade areas through the kind of bone

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.840 
the shade areas through the kind of bone
color<00:05:05.580> right<00:05:06.000> up<00:05:06.150> to<00:05:06.470> almost<00:05:07.470> white<00:05:08.130> so<00:05:08.670> all

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
color right up to almost white so all

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.670 
color right up to almost white so all
that's<00:05:08.970> left<00:05:09.060> to<00:05:09.270> highlight<00:05:09.720> is<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.110> rock<00:05:10.500> on

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
that's left to highlight is the rock on

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.220 
that's left to highlight is the rock on
the<00:05:10.800> base<00:05:11.010> and<00:05:11.390> there's<00:05:12.390> a<00:05:12.480> very<00:05:12.630> easy<00:05:12.900> way<00:05:13.080> of

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
the base and there's a very easy way of

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.720 
the base and there's a very easy way of
doing<00:05:13.470> this<00:05:13.590> and<00:05:14.130> it's<00:05:14.310> called<00:05:14.430> dry<00:05:14.700> brushing

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
doing this and it's called dry brushing

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.900 
doing this and it's called dry brushing
now<00:05:15.690> dry<00:05:15.900> abortion<00:05:16.230> isn't<00:05:16.380> is<00:05:16.620> a<00:05:17.160> is<00:05:17.580> a<00:05:17.640> very

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
now dry abortion isn't is a is a very

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.970 
now dry abortion isn't is a is a very
common<00:05:18.300> technique<00:05:18.420> but<00:05:19.260> a<00:05:19.290> lot<00:05:19.470> of<00:05:19.500> people<00:05:19.800> use

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
common technique but a lot of people use

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.630 
common technique but a lot of people use
it<00:05:20.130> in<00:05:20.160> in<00:05:20.810> in<00:05:21.810> what<00:05:22.650> I<00:05:22.680> consider<00:05:22.800> to<00:05:23.250> be<00:05:23.370> quite

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
it in in in what I consider to be quite

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.400 
it in in in what I consider to be quite
bad<00:05:23.850> ways<00:05:24.090> a<00:05:24.120> lot<00:05:24.450> of<00:05:24.510> people<00:05:24.780> use<00:05:24.960> it<00:05:25.080> to<00:05:25.110> paint

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
bad ways a lot of people use it to paint

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.680 
bad ways a lot of people use it to paint
models<00:05:26.250> when<00:05:26.430> they<00:05:26.550> really<00:05:26.850> should<00:05:27.060> be<00:05:27.210> should

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
models when they really should be should

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.270 
models when they really should be should
be<00:05:27.810> learning<00:05:27.990> how<00:05:28.260> to<00:05:28.290> highlight<00:05:28.650> a<00:05:28.830> model

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
be learning how to highlight a model

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.530 
be learning how to highlight a model
properly

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
properly

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.170 
properly
but<00:05:31.380> it<00:05:31.620> is<00:05:31.830> a<00:05:31.860> great<00:05:32.160> technique<00:05:32.550> for<00:05:32.610> for

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
but it is a great technique for for

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.940 
but it is a great technique for for
things<00:05:33.360> like<00:05:33.480> stonework<00:05:34.140> or<00:05:34.380> bases<00:05:34.830> or

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
things like stonework or bases or

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.160 
things like stonework or bases or
whatever<00:05:35.180> basically<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.420> principle<00:05:36.870> is<00:05:36.960> all

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.170 
whatever basically the principle is all

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.020 
whatever basically the principle is all
you<00:05:37.380> want<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.620> do<00:05:37.770> is<00:05:37.860> get<00:05:38.010> a<00:05:38.070> bit<00:05:38.250> of<00:05:38.370> a<00:05:38.400> bit<00:05:38.970> of

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
you want to do is get a bit of a bit of

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.270 
you want to do is get a bit of a bit of
light<00:05:39.300> colored<00:05:39.630> paint<00:05:39.870> on<00:05:40.020> your<00:05:40.110> brush<00:05:40.170> so<00:05:41.010> in

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
light colored paint on your brush so in

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.950 
light colored paint on your brush so in
this<00:05:41.760> case<00:05:42.000> we're<00:05:42.240> highlighting<00:05:42.510> the<00:05:42.720> gray<00:05:42.900> so

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
this case we're highlighting the gray so

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.200 
this case we're highlighting the gray so
we<00:05:43.200> want<00:05:43.410> something<00:05:43.620> a<00:05:44.310> grey<00:05:44.700> that's<00:05:44.970> very

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
we want something a grey that's very

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.000 
we want something a grey that's very
close<00:05:45.450> to<00:05:45.660> white<00:05:47.510> rub<00:05:48.510> a<00:05:48.600> bit<00:05:48.720> off<00:05:48.870> either<00:05:49.740> on

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
close to white rub a bit off either on

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.860 
close to white rub a bit off either on
the<00:05:50.100> back<00:05:50.250> of<00:05:50.370> your<00:05:50.490> hand<00:05:50.670> like<00:05:51.480> I'm<00:05:51.630> doing

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
the back of your hand like I'm doing

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.130 
the back of your hand like I'm doing
there<00:05:52.080> or<00:05:52.880> our<00:05:53.880> tissue<00:05:54.210> I<00:05:54.510> like<00:05:54.750> to<00:05:54.930> use<00:05:55.050> the

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
there or our tissue I like to use the

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.780 
there or our tissue I like to use the
back<00:05:55.260> of<00:05:55.410> my<00:05:55.470> hand<00:05:55.650> because<00:05:56.010> you<00:05:56.130> can<00:05:56.280> see<00:05:56.490> when

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
back of my hand because you can see when

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.400 
back of my hand because you can see when
the<00:05:56.910> when<00:05:57.330> the<00:05:57.450> paint<00:05:57.630> starts<00:05:57.930> to<00:05:58.020> run<00:05:58.140> out<00:05:58.230> and

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
the when the paint starts to run out and

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.410 
the when the paint starts to run out and
you<00:05:58.470> can<00:05:58.650> see<00:05:58.830> now<00:05:59.040> as<00:05:59.190> I'm<00:05:59.310> brushing<00:05:59.520> there's

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:00.420 
you can see now as I'm brushing there's

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.700 
you can see now as I'm brushing there's
almost<00:06:00.630> no<00:06:01.080> paint<00:06:01.380> left<00:06:01.440> on<00:06:01.740> my<00:06:01.830> brush<00:06:03.590> so<00:06:04.590> it's

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
almost no paint left on my brush so it's

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.680 
almost no paint left on my brush so it's
quite<00:06:04.950> quite<00:06:05.370> clear<00:06:05.610> to<00:06:05.760> see<00:06:05.940> that<00:06:05.970> really<00:06:06.570> all

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
quite quite clear to see that really all

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.420 
quite quite clear to see that really all
I'm<00:06:06.840> leaving<00:06:07.140> behind<00:06:07.230> is<00:06:07.500> it<00:06:07.620> is<00:06:07.740> a<00:06:07.770> dusting<00:06:08.310> of

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
I'm leaving behind is it is a dusting of

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.510 
I'm leaving behind is it is a dusting of
paint<00:06:08.700> and<00:06:09.180> the<00:06:10.170> same<00:06:10.380> that<00:06:10.830> principle<00:06:11.400> is

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
paint and the same that principle is

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.590 
paint and the same that principle is
what<00:06:11.670> you're<00:06:11.790> going<00:06:11.880> to<00:06:11.940> apply<00:06:12.210> to<00:06:12.270> the<00:06:12.450> base

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
what you're going to apply to the base

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.870 
what you're going to apply to the base
so<00:06:12.870> all<00:06:13.050> you're<00:06:13.260> doing<00:06:13.560> is<00:06:13.740> dusting<00:06:14.520> the<00:06:14.669> rage

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
so all you're doing is dusting the rage

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.920 
so all you're doing is dusting the rage
raised<00:06:15.540> areas<00:06:16.080> of<00:06:16.230> there<00:06:17.780> of<00:06:18.780> the<00:06:18.930> model<00:06:20.930> with

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
raised areas of there of the model with

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.460 
raised areas of there of the model with
that<00:06:21.960> white<00:06:22.320> colour

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.230 

so<00:06:26.070> you<00:06:26.160> leave<00:06:26.310> in<00:06:26.490> the<00:06:26.520> recesses<00:06:28.010> dark<00:06:29.240> and

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
so you leave in the recesses dark and

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.130 
so you leave in the recesses dark and
just<00:06:30.420> picking<00:06:30.750> out<00:06:30.840> the<00:06:30.930> detail<00:06:31.290> at<00:06:31.440> the<00:06:31.500> top

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
just picking out the detail at the top
