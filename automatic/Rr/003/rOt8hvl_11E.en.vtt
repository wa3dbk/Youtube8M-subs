that are we talking about sun damage or
birth<00:00:33.450> defects<00:00:33.870> what<00:00:34.140> would<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.320> be

be across the cheeks nose and chin a lot
of<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> times<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.870> always<00:01:01.109> heard<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.710> laser

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
of the times we always heard of laser

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.280 
of the times we always heard of laser
before<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.120> still<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> good<00:01:03.750> treatment<00:01:04.170> or

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
before is that still a good treatment or

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.600 
before is that still a good treatment or
does<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.500> actually<00:01:04.710> creams<00:01:05.159> now<00:01:05.400> that's

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
does it actually creams now that's

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.640 
does it actually creams now that's
working<00:01:05.760> yes<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.420> no<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.810> lasers<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.470> have

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
working yes and no with lasers you have

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.109 
working yes and no with lasers you have
to<00:01:07.830> be<00:01:07.920> careful<00:01:08.369> because<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> type<00:01:09.090> of

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
to be careful because of the type of

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.450 
to be careful because of the type of
pigmentation<00:01:09.750> anything<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.590> induces<00:01:11.100> heat

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
pigmentation anything that induces heat

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.030 
pigmentation anything that induces heat
so<00:01:11.760> sunlight<00:01:12.360> laser<00:01:12.930> light<00:01:13.350> will<00:01:13.770> stimulate

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
so sunlight laser light will stimulate

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.520 
so sunlight laser light will stimulate
melanocytes<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.299> make<00:01:15.479> more<00:01:15.720> pigment<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.500> I

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
melanocytes and make more pigment so I

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.160 
melanocytes and make more pigment so I
usually<00:01:16.830> tell<00:01:17.189> patients<00:01:17.400> who<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:17.790> melasma

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
usually tell patients who have melasma

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.170 
usually tell patients who have melasma
specifically<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.710> avoid<00:01:19.860> laser<00:01:20.520> treatment<00:01:21.090> if

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
specifically to avoid laser treatment if

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.940 
specifically to avoid laser treatment if
the<00:01:21.330> brown<00:01:21.570> spots<00:01:21.900> are<00:01:22.049> actually<00:01:22.350> due<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.500> sun

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the brown spots are actually due to sun

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.649 
the brown spots are actually due to sun
like<00:01:23.220> little<00:01:23.580> brown<00:01:23.820> spots<00:01:24.210> those<00:01:24.420> can

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
like little brown spots those can

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.749 
like little brown spots those can
respond<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.170> intense<00:01:25.920> pulse<00:01:26.159> light<00:01:26.250> or<00:01:26.520> photo

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
respond to intense pulse light or photo

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.270 
respond to intense pulse light or photo
facial<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.750> creams<00:01:28.170> are<00:01:28.439> really<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.890> domain

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
facial so creams are really the domain

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.520 
facial so creams are really the domain
we<00:01:29.520> use<00:01:29.790> for<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.119> melasma<00:01:30.570> or<00:01:30.930> hormone

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
we use for that melasma or hormone

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.350 
we use for that melasma or hormone
induced<00:01:31.860> pigmentation<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.729> women<00:01:33.030> what<00:01:33.210> is

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
induced pigmentation and women what is

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.969 
induced pigmentation and women what is
in<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.780> does<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.409> mean<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.650> think<00:01:34.799> of

in it that does that I mean you think of
bleach<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:35.700> taking<00:01:36.570> out<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.810> color<00:01:36.990> what

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
bleach if it's taking out the color what

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.230 
bleach if it's taking out the color what
is<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.829> we<00:01:38.159> call<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.670> bleach<00:01:38.909> but<00:01:39.119> it's

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
is it we call it bleach but it's

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.630 
is it we call it bleach but it's
actually<00:01:39.570> hydroquinone<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.680> previously<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
actually hydroquinone so previously the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.130 
actually hydroquinone so previously the
most<00:01:41.820> common<00:01:42.180> ingredient<00:01:42.780> which<00:01:42.960> was

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
most common ingredient which was

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.050 
most common ingredient which was
prescription<00:01:43.860> based<00:01:44.009> 4%<00:01:44.759> hydroquinone

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
prescription based 4% hydroquinone

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.880 
prescription based 4% hydroquinone
over-the-counter<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.380> get<00:01:46.500> 2%

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
over-the-counter you can get 2%

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.880 
over-the-counter you can get 2%
hydroquinone<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:48.299> 4%<00:01:48.960> hydroquinone<00:01:49.200> was<00:01:49.770> this

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
hydroquinone so 4% hydroquinone was this

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.830 
hydroquinone so 4% hydroquinone was this
very<00:01:50.100> potent<00:01:50.670> product<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:51.329> use<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:51.750> you
