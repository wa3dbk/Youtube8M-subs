00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
more like a D chord and then what we'll

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.030 
more like a D chord and then what we'll
do<00:01:35.440> is

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.980 

so<00:01:39.640> we're<00:01:39.760> actually<00:01:39.880> going<00:01:40.120> to<00:01:40.210> hit<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.630> fifth

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
so we're actually going to hit the fifth

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.720 
so we're actually going to hit the fifth
of<00:01:41.230> that<00:01:41.260> decore<00:01:41.890> -<00:01:42.100> so<00:01:42.310> what<00:01:42.460> we're<00:01:42.580> going<00:01:42.670> to

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
of that decore - so what we're going to

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.030 
of that decore - so what we're going to
do<00:01:42.880> is<00:01:42.970> same<00:01:43.210> kind<00:01:43.450> of<00:01:43.510> thing<00:01:43.720> but<00:01:43.960> now<00:01:44.860> we're

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
do is same kind of thing but now we're

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.590 
do is same kind of thing but now we're
starting<00:01:45.370> from<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:45.880> a<00:01:45.910> string<00:01:46.420> so<00:01:46.510> we're

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
starting from the a string so we're

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.510 
starting from the a string so we're
going<00:01:46.690> to<00:01:46.780> go<00:01:46.840> down<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.170> G

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.160 

and<00:01:49.610> then<00:01:50.150> what<00:01:50.270> we'll<00:01:50.420> do<00:01:50.600> is<00:01:50.840> we're<00:01:51.140> just
