00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.910
 well we've seen the crawl arms 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.830
 and the backs that are the styles 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.050
 asymmetric now let's start with the 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.639
 stretched symmetrically we are with the arm 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.240
 yes when we explain the arms of 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.510
 colors that we made the arm go in 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.609
 with the elbow high in grip position 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.710
 in breasts it is exactly the same 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.869
 that anchored as you see the shoulder that 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.550
 is ahead in embers or with both 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.800
 arms at the same time is symmetrical 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.419
 reaches an apex of grip position 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.269
 but with both arms at the same time 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.140
 they do not take their arms up like that because 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:40.370
 the ass would be relatively low 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.710
 it would be like two grip positions of 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.540
 simultaneous crue 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.870
 and we go as I go doing the arms of 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.340
 breaststroke but too open 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.430
 bring your arms so open I'm going to 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.020
 allow to sustain more but I'm just going to 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.059
 traccionar or will allow me to climb well 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.309
 the head then I have to try is 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.250
 try to go doubling little by little more 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.260
 elbows to achieve that position of 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.540
 grip like alcohol or the butterfly 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.400
 we can try in a place where 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.200
 foot to go practicing keeping the 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.450
 elbows near the surface 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.829
 or here with the trickle we are doing the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.829
 successive arm stroke 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.079
 you realize and the angle goes a little 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.050
 down that will take allowed was 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.570
 take off the head for nativity 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.660
 and only until type the lateral one is only 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.060
 until well let's say they were not empty 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.250
 and I do half stroke is not a 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.400
 armful complete as many people do 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.290
 until back then because after all the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.820
 of attractions you have to recover 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.250
 below the water and that's 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.410
 counterproductive here we can see how 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.940
 I'm practicing this stroke 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.790
 half strokes in the area where 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.430
 I stand and watched that in the elbows 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.780
 pass the midline of the shoulders here 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.210
 we see the side in the lateral plane in the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.700
 that helped by the trickle prevents 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.120
 the arms exceed that average line of 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.120
 shoulders 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.380
 here we see the frontal plane which is what 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.270
 same with the churro and also assured me 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.180
 that the elbows are close to the 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.069
 surface and be able to adopt that 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.610
 grip position that interests us in 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.610
 all styles 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.190
 with the churro once we have mastered that 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.370
 we can do it with the soil between 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.840
 legs and we are practicing the stroke 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.110
 of breaststroke 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.629
 when we are dominating a little more 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.540
 there are very good elbows in 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:39.489
 slow motion 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.489
 we can take legs of arms of crawl 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.670
 it would be like a half hugged and you 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.170
 support the thumbs left here 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.780
 confronted 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.360
 according to 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.850
 I take out the tray privileging the 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.280
 arms and while I'm pulling arms 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.060
 internal rotation in which in the end 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.730
 the indices are left touching on the outside 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.670
 to be as close as possible to the 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.080
 Stronger tennis position no 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.650
 exactly the position of minimum 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.650
 resistance 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.400
 the devastated 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.550
 that's because I've done well if you give 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.340
 count the angle of the hand 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.810
 down and back here that was 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.380
 let's say practically back 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.709
 and we see the position of the arms from 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.660
 back as the angle of the hand in the 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.790
 palm of the hand looks back and to the 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.069
 beginning a little down and as we 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.440
 It also helps keep elbows high 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.060
 keeping the grip position the 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.190
 of the breaststroke and the butterfly of 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.670
 bilateral form and the same as the 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.120
 unilateral form 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.980
 and then just put together because this 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.200
 It helps me get my head out between 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.170
 arms 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.150
 like he pulled out the tray here and this 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.879
 movement of internal rotation of the 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.720
 arms so that I stay with the head 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:07.310
 in the water always 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.440
 trying to slide you breathe looking 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.580
 forward without acting when I put the 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.410
 head in the water 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.230
 I try to be in the most position 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.120
 aerodynamic that can position 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.650
 be called so that the arms 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.650
 they are behind the ears 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.440
 our view there is here we see how I go 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.500
 doing the arm stroke and 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.810
 slide left tried to adapt the 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.880
 position of minimum resistance now it 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.070
 go here in slow motion as the arms 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.650
 they stay behind the ears and 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.100
 I try to occupy the least surface 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.100
 slide 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:48.030
 and here you see how I swim swimming embraces in 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.470
 the lateral plane as I go sliding that 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.690
 I can actually do much more 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.690
 sticking his head in and sticking his chin
