plans<00:00:32.940> are<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:34.010> make<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> new<00:00:35.250> plug<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:36.050> then

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
plans are is make a new plug and then

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.840 
plans are is make a new plug and then
shave<00:00:39.059> off<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.780> end<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.110> broken<00:00:40.350> piece

more challenging nothing can't be

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.670 
more challenging nothing can't be
complic<00:01:01.890> when<00:01:02.789> i<00:01:02.879> turn<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.210> part<00:01:03.449> over<00:01:03.750> its

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
complic when i turn the part over its

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.280 
complic when i turn the part over its
hollow<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> back<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:06.540> i<00:01:06.570> was<00:01:06.810> planning<00:01:07.200> on

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
hollow in the back so i was planning on

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.880 
hollow in the back so i was planning on
cleaning<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:08.040> off<00:01:08.420> drilling<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.540> tapping

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
cleaning this off drilling and tapping

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.410 
cleaning this off drilling and tapping
into<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.100> plastic<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.760> being<00:01:12.000> able<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.270> put<00:01:12.390> a

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
into the plastic and being able to put a

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.410 
into the plastic and being able to put a
bolt<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.750> there<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.650> now<00:01:14.130> i'll<00:01:14.280> end<00:01:14.460> up<00:01:14.610> making

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
bolt in there so now i'll end up making

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.039 
bolt in there so now i'll end up making
a<00:01:15.600> backing<00:01:16.590> piece<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:17.130> go<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.460> here<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.049> go

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
a backing piece to go in here and go

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.690 
a backing piece to go in here and go
ahead<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.439> drill<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.799> tap<00:01:19.830> into<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.340> backing

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
ahead and drill and tap into the backing

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.969 
ahead and drill and tap into the backing
piece<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:22.020> pull<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.520> so<00:01:23.840> plan<00:01:24.840> B<00:01:24.979> see

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
piece so it can pull on it so plan B see

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.190 
piece so it can pull on it so plan B see
if<00:01:26.040> we<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.250> get<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.460> fixed<00:01:26.900> here's<00:01:27.900> just<00:01:28.110> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
if we can get it fixed here's just a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.780 
if we can get it fixed here's just a
quick<00:01:28.409> shot<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.710> how<00:01:28.979> I've<00:01:29.100> got<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.369> set<00:01:29.549> up<00:01:29.700> in

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
quick shot of how I've got it set up in

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.929 
quick shot of how I've got it set up in
the<00:01:29.909> mill<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.110> go<00:01:31.229> ahead<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.560> get<00:01:31.890> that

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
the mill so I can go ahead and get that

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:39.000 
the mill so I can go ahead and get that
surface<00:01:33.320> flat

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.920 

well<00:01:40.010> here<00:01:40.310> it<00:01:40.370> is<00:01:40.430> I<00:01:40.580> got<00:01:40.730> a<00:01:40.760> backer<00:01:41.300> piece<00:01:41.690> in

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
well here it is I got a backer piece in

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.740 
well here it is I got a backer piece in
there<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.700> drilled<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:43.850> tapped<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:44.270> for<00:01:44.510> 10

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
there and drilled and tapped it for 10

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.250 
there and drilled and tapped it for 10
32<00:01:45.400> so<00:01:46.400> now<00:01:46.790> I'll<00:01:46.910> make<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.240> plug<00:01:47.510> then<00:01:48.140> I'll

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
32 so now I'll make the plug then I'll

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.219 
32 so now I'll make the plug then I'll
counterbore<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.160> plug<00:01:49.700> so<00:01:50.600> that<00:01:50.750> I<00:01:50.780> can<00:01:50.900> put

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
counterbore the plug so that I can put

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.219 
counterbore the plug so that I can put
it<00:01:51.460> tight<00:01:52.460> onto<00:01:52.700> here<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.270> put<00:01:54.050> it<00:01:54.140> back

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
it tight onto here and put it back

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.560 
it tight onto here and put it back
together<00:01:54.410> I<00:01:54.830> think<00:01:55.010> I<00:01:55.100> may<00:01:55.250> have<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:58.390> all<00:01:59.390> right

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
together I think I may have it all right

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.570 
together I think I may have it all right
bring<00:02:00.110> you<00:02:00.200> back<00:02:00.350> again<00:02:00.619> here's<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.100> plug

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
that'll go back in there's no reason to

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.880 
that'll go back in there's no reason to
counterbore<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:05.690> bolt<00:02:05.990> at<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.530> top<00:02:06.710> of<00:02:06.740> the

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
counterbore the bolt at the top of the

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.740 
counterbore the bolt at the top of the
bolt<00:02:07.100> there's<00:02:07.369> plenty<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.060> clearance<00:02:08.390> and

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
bolt there's plenty of clearance and

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.830 
bolt there's plenty of clearance and
then<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.800> screw<00:02:10.459> gets<00:02:11.590> down<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:13.720> drilled<00:02:14.720> and

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
then the screw gets down the drilled and

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.550 
then the screw gets down the drilled and
tapped<00:02:14.870> into<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.440> top<00:02:15.650> there<00:02:15.920> oh<00:02:17.350> yeah<00:02:18.350> I

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
tapped into the top there oh yeah I

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.290 
tapped into the top there oh yeah I
remember<00:02:18.800> now<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.340> need<00:02:19.640> why<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.090> had<00:02:20.270> a

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
remember now I need why I had a

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.690 
remember now I need why I had a
countersink<00:02:20.840> this<00:02:21.110> because<00:02:21.560> this<00:02:22.220> screws

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
countersink this because this screws

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.420 
countersink this because this screws
going<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.030> go<00:02:23.120> right<00:02:23.300> into<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:24.130> into<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.250> bolt
