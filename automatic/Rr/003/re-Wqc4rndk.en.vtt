00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.939
 This tutorial is to teach you how your 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.939
 guitar 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.920
 for example adapters 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.920
 jac 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:37.920
 of this day will be sending me the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.330
 normal guitar plug signal goes 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.340
 be sending something that is this 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.340
 home ministry for example me because 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.190
 we all have these cables kind of be 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.360
 which are audio and it is yellow is 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.840
 good video these cables it's 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.840
 connected with this one 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.200
 this is my 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.370
 normal guitar look and with this 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.550
 adapter you are being sent to what is 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.440
 the outside and basically that connection 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.360
 this can be told directly 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.070
 your guitar and it's going to be sounding but for 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.570
 example here I have connected ones 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:22.450
 chopsticks so that this can pull out what 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:25.100
 what is the instruction 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.850
 My guitar does not 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.380
 and this for example can be for example 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.330
 for people who are beginners and not 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.000
 has for example an amplifier like 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.940
 that little one this post can connect 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.160
 to your home stereo without any problem 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.260
 for example this video this I did 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.520
 because then when we go to some 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.680
 shops 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.510
 this tells us that we can burn what 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.120
 it's all home stereo if you connect it 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.770
 your guitar when it's true this one does not 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.320
 nothing happens to him he does not burn or anything because 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.030
 we are only giving a signal and how 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.610
 we can see in this video this we can 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.760
 take out what the clean guitar is for 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.280
 example just like the distortion here at 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.560
 to the pedal 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.680
 and that's what the guitar sounds like 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.680
 clean 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.580
 for example there is what is the 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.709
 you 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.800
 for example this the wide ones that sell 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.240
 small ones that are more or less good 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.560
 I was still half decent but there 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.540
 others that will have for example in 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.890
 internet packages is really 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.860
 we recommend better understanding 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.750
 only the pure guitar and connect not to 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.550
 home stereo and in any case if 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.990
 they want to have the instruction they can 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.210
 buy a caldito of instruction as 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.940
 these are some very cheap for example 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.190
 of voice the song can be 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.440
 it's very good for instruction and everything 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.440
 that's good what this video has been used
