00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.340

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:38.129
 cpu 3 nuclear there purity three with 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:41.070
 superfluous but look how I set up 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.690

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.920
 Bandikam records 3026 there so frames 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.110

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.299
 No, I thought when I got Dasha , I 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.500
 looked at system requirements looked 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.420

 the game itself and through the file with this but you 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.250
