00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
 as an example why 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.940
 24 ore 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.650
 so I do these tests 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.900
 in China this is part of the backhoe loaders and I think 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.339
 it's probably the next 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.339
 except that you will chat on your i-phone 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.279
 an angelina couple 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:25.769
 form simulator 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.509
 quality level 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.439
 so the controls are yet it's finally in the simple enough theory 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.020
 we can turn 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.780
 the machine move in all directions 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.780
 the backhoe 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.910
 the clichÃ©s nor for that 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.100
 this new art 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.960
 the principle being 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.990
 all the pebbles 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.070
 by as many countries as possible 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.440
 in the truck before the fuel gauge at the top left of 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.700
 the screen 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.700
 or their tumor 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.470
 let's get to work 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.050
 there is a physical engine that is for rather rather honestly 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.050
 with mike lang the limits it is not bad this game 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.010
 by winning the stage and no longer take place 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.010
 good graphically it is known pretty much 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.340
 on the video will be caught in the nose on the iphone screen 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.340
 by the way the last movie 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.450
 - pressing the tractopelle so that by definition it is 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.790
 it's boring like death 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.170
 it would be the merit of existing and the concept week with so much fun that 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.170
 we can not miss 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.890
 info that this model and we 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.230
 phantom and calyon 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.290
 what canyoning 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.520
 it's encouraging 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.520
 it's a rate curve it's also pursued 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.560
 a spot 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.200
 and that's exactly why we need a lot of pebbles in the truck 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.780
 to listen to a lot of vegetables 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.349
 so I said that the truck is run by the physics engine 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.620
 so be careful not to return it to them 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.039
 like that for example 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:22.249
 finally, you do not have to 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:25.019
 Evelyn excavations 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.019
 two of the seven do not do 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.149
 so I did not want to ajax more 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:38.369
 but the machine and is well managed by the engine 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.379
 the technique lacks that it is technically it is not so bad 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.309
 if I am the subject and proactive 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:50.519
 here we are 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.269
 even the second injection of November we see on the schooner who who at 39 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.619
 years 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.619
 after the change too little alone on the collisions 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.359
 very good idea the thing that lacks realism 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.179
 all along its corridor 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:12.389
 justice is actually korea 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.119
 when the cameras will beat 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:17.309
 it's really a completely manual game of psychology with oneself to 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:20.309
 every time 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:24.629
 but they forgot to disguise me 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.629
 the interior unwind of the truck 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:31.229
 we will make a name 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:34.519
 another level in the second I do not ask too much more than what he 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.699
 you have to keep a little fun 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.699
 but what level has something interesting 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.760
 compo moved not only the backhoe but also the truck 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.349
 with the best 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.269
 the icon at the top left that shows the controls 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.019
 and in which he is super handy super fun had placed 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.459
 and in fact 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.549
 we made it fun to move the drunk truck to 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.549
 walk with that the case on the game 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.999
 the funny antechamber 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:10.999
 I do not get along very well on the video 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.879
 technically nothing any if we see very well the dry if we mouth for his fingers 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:16.909
 on the screen 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:19.909
 we end up moving the camera 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.699
 where it can give stuff a little forced 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.840
 in that level the idea 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.539
 the butt of the barrels are in the water 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:30.729
 in the truck 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.129
 will you be the camera 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:34.590
 and to pass the truck 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.590
 in the long run 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.309
 here is the league each barrel 

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:46.309
 here it is said very interesting 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.620
 there are two other levels that are 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.620
 in the world so amazing I leave you the pleasure to discover 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.529
 before 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:58.389
 the to stop I just want to show 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.860
 inside 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.169
 everything was exceptional 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.419
 good not only 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.759
 move the amateur camera from the cockpit 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.419
 white modeled way 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.419
 but it's not bad 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.180
 after a part immersion 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:25.659
 here is a good bah 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.340
 among which we go out a 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.059
 family photo by finishing loire 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:35.740
 and then there too a plus 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.740
 if we drop the truck it becomes rare 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.520
 and to mark the passage that the young Italian talent 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:52.229
 all that stuff
