but<00:00:46.620> from<00:00:47.579> what<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.730> can<00:00:47.820> gather<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.360> book<00:00:48.660> is

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
but from what I can gather this book is

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.799 
but from what I can gather this book is
about<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:50.390> angels<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.809> demons<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.809> their

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
about like angels and demons and their

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.920 
about like angels and demons and their
interaction<00:00:55.649> I'm<00:00:55.949> again<00:00:56.399> I'm<00:00:57.120> not<00:00:57.480> very<00:00:57.629> far

interaction I'm again I'm not very far

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.840 
interaction I'm again I'm not very far
so<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.140> don't<00:00:58.350> know<00:00:58.469> much<00:00:58.680> but<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.550> girl
