electric<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.710> magnetic<00:00:22.740> fields<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.939> then

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
electric and magnetic fields and then

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.480 
electric and magnetic fields and then
I'm<00:00:25.020> going<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.349> also<00:00:25.590> measure<00:00:26.009> with<00:00:26.250> another

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
I'm going to also measure with another

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.019 
I'm going to also measure with another
tool<00:00:26.789> for<00:00:27.150> radio<00:00:27.480> frequency<00:00:28.170> microwaves<00:00:29.029> for

than<00:00:53.489> my<00:00:53.640> desk<00:00:53.940> up<00:00:54.330> that's<00:00:54.780> why<00:00:54.930> I'm<00:00:55.019> using<00:00:55.260> it

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
than my desk up that's why I'm using it

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.049 
than my desk up that's why I'm using it
and<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.839> think<00:00:57.900> that<00:00:58.619> I<00:00:58.650> wouldn't<00:00:59.190> need<00:00:59.640> my

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
and I think that I wouldn't need my

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.850 
and I think that I wouldn't need my
desktop<00:01:00.540> anymore<00:01:02.689> so<00:01:03.689> let's<00:01:04.409> go<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
desktop anymore so let's go to the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.550 
desktop anymore so let's go to the
business<00:01:05.270> let<00:01:06.270> me<00:01:06.770> turn<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.340> device<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
business let me turn on this device and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.679 
business let me turn on this device and
like<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.100> seen<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.580> other<00:01:11.760> videos<00:01:12.240> first

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
like you have seen in other videos first

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.569 
like you have seen in other videos first
I'm<00:01:12.869> going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.110> measure<00:01:13.490> electric<00:01:14.490> fields

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
I'm going to measure electric fields

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.200 
I'm going to measure electric fields
here<00:01:17.579> and<00:01:17.729> here<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.899> counter<00:01:19.850> like<00:01:20.850> if<00:01:21.090> you

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
here and here is the counter like if you

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.770 
here and here is the counter like if you
go<00:01:21.390> far<00:01:21.750> away<00:01:21.899> from<00:01:22.109> the<00:01:22.649> computer<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:24.210> digits

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
go far away from the computer the digits

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.980 
go far away from the computer the digits
are<00:01:25.189> the<00:01:26.189> amount<00:01:26.789> of<00:01:26.939> radiation<00:01:27.329> is<00:01:27.689> lower

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
are the amount of radiation is lower

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.779 
are the amount of radiation is lower
lowering<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:30.560> when<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:32.689> when<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:34.789> get

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
lowering and when you when you get

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.889 
lowering and when you when you get
closer<00:01:36.149> to<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.509> laptop<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.859> digits<00:01:38.280> are

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
closer to the laptop the digits are

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.649 
closer to the laptop the digits are
getting<00:01:40.069> the<00:01:41.069> radiation<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.850> stronger<00:01:42.719> like

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
getting the radiation is stronger like

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.730 
getting the radiation is stronger like
53<00:01:45.950> if<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.880> go<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.509> close<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.109> laptop

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
53 if you go really close to the laptop

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.800 
53 if you go really close to the laptop
you<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.340> see<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.819> machine<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.359> already

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
you can see the machine is already

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.809 
you can see the machine is already
making<00:01:52.740> sounds<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.579> here<00:01:54.799> it's<00:01:55.799> around<00:01:56.189> 20

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
making sounds and here it's around 20

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:02.300 
making sounds and here it's around 20
and<00:01:57.030> if<00:01:57.689> we<00:01:57.929> go<00:01:58.139> below<00:01:59.039> the<00:01:59.069> laptop<00:02:00.950> it<00:02:01.950> reads

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and if we go below the laptop it reads

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.960 
and if we go below the laptop it reads
also<00:02:04.520> 30<00:02:06.709> it<00:02:07.709> depends<00:02:08.190> where<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.459> processor

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
also 30 it depends where the processor

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:17.940 
also 30 it depends where the processor
and<00:02:09.119> hard<00:02:09.270> disk<00:02:09.569> are<00:02:11.300> 18<00:02:14.209> 18<00:02:15.380> volts<00:02:16.380> per<00:02:16.560> meter

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
and hard disk are 18 18 volts per meter

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.580 
and hard disk are 18 18 volts per meter
and<00:02:18.069> that<00:02:18.819> declared<00:02:19.510> as<00:02:19.840> like<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.110> strong

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
and that declared as like a strong

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.770 
and that declared as like a strong
radiation<00:02:21.010> five<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.940> fifty<00:02:22.390> strong

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
radiation five to fifty strong

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.770 
radiation five to fifty strong
graduation<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:26.530> is<00:02:26.910> for<00:02:27.910> electric

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
graduation and that is for electric

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.430 
graduation and that is for electric
fields<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:30.340> basically<00:02:30.819> if<00:02:31.000> you're<00:02:31.180> like<00:02:31.390> a

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
fields so basically if you're like a

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.050 
fields so basically if you're like a
little<00:02:32.440> bit<00:02:32.560> away<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:34.150> get<00:02:34.330> like<00:02:34.599> six<00:02:35.019> five

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
little bit away you get like six five

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.920 
little bit away you get like six five
volts<00:02:37.060> per<00:02:37.269> meter<00:02:37.560> that's<00:02:38.560> not<00:02:38.739> so<00:02:38.950> bad<00:02:38.980> and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
volts per meter that's not so bad and

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.949 
volts per meter that's not so bad and
that's<00:02:40.930> declare<00:02:41.620> like<00:02:41.920> week<00:02:42.519> radiation<00:02:43.330> 125

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
that's declare like week radiation 125

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.220 
that's declare like week radiation 125
volts<00:02:44.830> per<00:02:44.950> meter<00:02:44.980> still<00:02:45.549> weak<00:02:45.900> now<00:02:46.900> let's

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
volts per meter still weak now let's

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:55.160 
volts per meter still weak now let's
change<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.660> my<00:02:49.660> two<00:02:50.019> magnetic<00:02:50.620> fields<00:02:52.590> and

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
change it to my two magnetic fields and

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:03.240 
change it to my two magnetic fields and
we<00:02:56.170> get<00:02:56.410> like<00:02:56.940> 15<00:02:58.110> aunty<00:02:59.670> that's<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:02.040> mark<00:03:03.040> up

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
we get like 15 aunty that's the mark up

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.100 
we get like 15 aunty that's the mark up
for<00:03:03.519> magnetic<00:03:04.420> radiation<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:05.459> that's<00:03:06.459> 15<00:03:07.110> if

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
for magnetic radiation and that's 15 if

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:15.460 
for magnetic radiation and that's 15 if
you<00:03:08.260> go<00:03:08.380> closer<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:09.549> Machine<00:03:09.910> goes<00:03:10.150> like<00:03:10.510> more

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.990 

continue<00:03:15.970> your<00:03:17.170> measuring<00:03:18.170> measuring

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
continue your measuring measuring

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.510 
continue your measuring measuring
magnetic<00:03:20.000> fields<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:20.840> if<00:03:21.770> you<00:03:21.890> go<00:03:22.070> really

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
magnetic fields and if you go really

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.720 
magnetic fields and if you go really
close<00:03:22.820> to<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.060> keyboard<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:25.130> machine<00:03:25.490> reads

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
close to the keyboard the machine reads

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:37.120 
close to the keyboard the machine reads
like<00:03:27.760> 70<00:03:29.200> over<00:03:30.200> 100<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:35.180> tea<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:36.410> that's

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
like 70 over 100 and and tea and that's

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.840 
like 70 over 100 and and tea and that's
declared<00:03:40.420> 20<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:41.630> 100<00:03:41.960> is<00:03:42.740> still<00:03:43.610> weak

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
declared 20 to 100 is still weak

stronger radiation and this this serious
the<00:04:39.740> new<00:04:39.860> serious<00:04:40.250> is<00:04:40.400> not<00:04:40.640> it's<00:04:41.360> not<00:04:41.540> perfect

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
the new serious is not it's not perfect

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.850 
the new serious is not it's not perfect
the<00:04:42.860> radiation<00:04:43.160> could<00:04:43.460> be<00:04:43.610> lower<00:04:44.590> but<00:04:45.590> still

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
the radiation could be lower but still

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.620 
the radiation could be lower but still
it's<00:04:46.370> better<00:04:47.090> than<00:04:47.950> than<00:04:48.950> the<00:04:49.250> old<00:04:49.430> ones<00:04:49.700> who

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
it's better than than the old ones who

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.570 
it's better than than the old ones who
are<00:04:50.780> really<00:04:51.140> radiating<00:04:51.740> really<00:04:52.160> really

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
are really radiating really really

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.480 
are really radiating really really
strong<00:04:53.210> let's<00:04:54.050> go<00:04:54.229> back<00:04:54.470> to<00:04:54.500> electromagnetic

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
strong let's go back to electromagnetic

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.409 
strong let's go back to electromagnetic
fields<00:04:56.770> you<00:04:57.770> get<00:04:57.979> like<00:04:58.250> free<00:04:59.229> volts<00:05:00.229> per<00:05:00.410> meter

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
fields you get like free volts per meter

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.890 
fields you get like free volts per meter
that's<00:05:02.650> weak<00:05:03.650> radiation<00:05:04.520> it's<00:05:05.000> not<00:05:05.210> safe<00:05:05.540> but

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
that's weak radiation it's not safe but

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.520 
that's weak radiation it's not safe but
its<00:05:06.080> weak<00:05:08.919> right<00:05:09.919> above<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:11.570> keyboard<00:05:11.960> it's

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
its weak right above the keyboard it's

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.400 
its weak right above the keyboard it's
still<00:05:13.190> six<00:05:13.550> so<00:05:14.419> basically<00:05:14.930> the<00:05:15.680> this<00:05:17.410> laptop

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
still six so basically the this laptop

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.500 
still six so basically the this laptop
is<00:05:18.680> not<00:05:18.890> causing<00:05:19.160> problems<00:05:19.340> with<00:05:19.970> electric

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
stop the radiation but with magnetics it

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.410 
stop the radiation but with magnetics it
goes<00:05:36.650> through<00:05:36.950> the<00:05:37.070> body<00:05:37.280> and<00:05:37.550> it<00:05:37.700> can<00:05:38.000> affect

recommend having laptop knew your

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.990 
recommend having laptop knew your
