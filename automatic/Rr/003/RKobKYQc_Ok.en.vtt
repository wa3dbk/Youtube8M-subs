00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:09.190
 good only are the parts escort zetec 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:11.139
 of avaÃ­ was giving us problems in 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.280
 planets 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:17.110
 We pick up his space engine here. 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.320
 was used together I already only one glue of 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.020
 silicone was giving air intake 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.290
 violent 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.840
 the pension the new part 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:34.210
 It's that exchange recently have here 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:37.600
 a tag that has injection injection 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:42.190
 I do not even know the injection but it does not have 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.200
 also when it was played or anything for 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.870
 inside it is all carbonized due to 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.770
 excess that was but did not have 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:54.150
 seal missing a piece of the silicone 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:58.600
 tbi many years that no one takes 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.700
 totally stupid clogged censor 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 apparently exercised positioner 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.600
 normal too 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:10.710
 I felt some air was cut in the 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.180
 in the car and at least that is 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.950
 their existence here seems to be 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:20.610
 I also did not understand that 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.310
 here the cover of the stream of water and candles 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.770
 look at the general state of 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.030
 candles but many years no one takes away 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.790
 these cells of the place and there in the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.630
 The pipe was also glued to where it 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:43.170
 to know here had not joined the entrance of 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.940
 air and lots of glue your glue effectively 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.700
 speaking recently only thing that 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.760
 played with this piece here probably 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:54.050
 that looks new was pasted and I 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.050
 they are just glue 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.550
 so we do the procedure the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.250
 brass nozzles also the advanced ones to the 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.369
 screws then I'll get it right 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.170
 at first here many years ago that 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.720
 nobody was the mother nothing that is not to be 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.940
 this piece was changed and a thread in the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.850
 whip that was cut off from the watercourse 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:19.840
 Well, he said good. 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:24.110
 only they are the pieces of the sport seitec 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.110
 odair that who has another video that 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.140
 take all hadash silicones ask all 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.750
 chipped head that was new but was not even 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.340
 all in carbonized whole fiber 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:40.910
 so we did her chemical cleaning 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.610
 with the help of the machine to power 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:49.750
 the plunger that stays in here is clean 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:53.120
 Missed me locked air flow sensor 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.590
 now everything is clean everything right 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.360
 this text assists here 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.070
 seem normal then we'll go 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.480
 see the car running then off 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.290
 original butterfly conditioner 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.900
 still 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.420
 I have apparently been working 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.180
 also in hand 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.180
 the drink he was totally 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.860
 interrupted dirty all full of splintered 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.400
 Silicon for all that is side people 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:23.990
 gave chemical bath in it with seals there 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:27.290
 inside leaving everything cute and finishes 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:30.200
 to think of air flow that we 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.530
 nor yet charred because in the 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.790
 carbonising in chemicals to 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.980
 give that general cleaning and stay top 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.349
 is safe because the assembly of parts and 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:47.299
 then we'll see if he's lucky that the 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:49.640
 car does not need to change anything good 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:55.659
 It's another video of the cuts and ceiling 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:58.430
 to leave this board here is going on tv and 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:00.470
 it was all glued together with silicone 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.349
 the underside of the joint here is 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.920
 with latent crimp going in low and 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:09.019
 fully kneaded top not 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.409
 has fence has nothing until the marks 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.209
 ac from where I was being forced to 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:19.400
 water inlet 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:22.570
 this is the turn of the new tvi where 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:27.620
 I took it from both sides have a resolve 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.479
 It is precisely from the fence that part of 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.090
 up who will contact the tvi 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:35.090
 and will write something that does not 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.520
 happened to the bass joins her so 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.160
 worn and so tight that it does not 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.430
 got the fence did not do the service 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.680
 correct increase of air among others 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:50.139
 holders, among other 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.139
 they were in the same situation there ok 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:58.009
 well here is the final river of the sport 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:01.130
 all that the mechanic seems to step 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:04.389
 leg strength even we managed 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:07.190
 stabilize him but obviously inside 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:10.039
 it is not perfect yet 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:15.440
 closest to the perfect 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:17.630
 It's slowing down on the whole acceleration. 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.490
 right 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.840
 That's it, watch out for those mechanics. 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.840
 Pick which is around my 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.280
 the TV is still the talent for its engine 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.270
 steps 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.039
 despite being new but starting already 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.850
 To answer 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.850
 that's it
