but<00:01:27.920> um<00:01:28.570> so<00:01:29.570> I<00:01:29.990> pretty<00:01:30.859> much<00:01:30.950> have<00:01:31.340> tried<00:01:31.969> to

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
but um so I pretty much have tried to

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.969 
but um so I pretty much have tried to
achieve<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.689> couple<00:01:33.170> of<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.350> hairstyles<00:01:33.859> I

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979

if you can really see right there so i

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.719 
if you can really see right there so i

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
don't use all two boxes but it's really

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.779 
don't use all two boxes but it's really
