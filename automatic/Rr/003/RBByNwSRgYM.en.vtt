welcome to another drum lesson this drum

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.560 
welcome to another drum lesson this drum
lesson<00:00:07.160> is<00:00:07.250> called<00:00:07.430> the<00:00:07.639> doubling<00:00:08.120> technique

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
lesson is called the doubling technique

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.060 
lesson is called the doubling technique
and<00:00:08.809> the<00:00:09.170> doubling<00:00:09.470> technique<00:00:09.889> is<00:00:10.040> a

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
and the doubling technique is a

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.919 
and the doubling technique is a
technique<00:00:10.160> that<00:00:10.669> you<00:00:10.969> can<00:00:11.179> use<00:00:11.360> to<00:00:11.570> spice<00:00:11.900> up

technique that you can use to spice up

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.230 
technique that you can use to spice up
your<00:00:12.259> drum<00:00:12.499> fills<00:00:12.860> your<00:00:13.309> drum<00:00:13.610> beats<00:00:13.849> and<00:00:14.059> your

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
your drum fills your drum beats and your

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.330 
your drum fills your drum beats and your
overall<00:00:14.539> drumming<00:00:15.079> and<00:00:15.230> it's<00:00:15.650> a<00:00:15.829> relatively

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
overall drumming and it's a relatively

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.730 
overall drumming and it's a relatively
simple<00:00:16.730> technique<00:00:17.330> to<00:00:17.360> you<00:00:17.750> to<00:00:18.020> start<00:00:18.290> off<00:00:18.500> I'm

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
simple technique to you to start off I'm

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.260 
simple technique to you to start off I'm
going<00:00:18.830> to<00:00:18.890> show<00:00:19.100> you<00:00:19.160> what<00:00:19.400> a<00:00:19.430> double<00:00:19.850> is<00:00:20.030> and

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
going to show you what a double is and

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.840 
going to show you what a double is and
we<00:00:20.720> have<00:00:20.930> a<00:00:20.960> single<00:00:21.560> and<00:00:22.240> we<00:00:23.240> have<00:00:23.390> a<00:00:23.420> double

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
we have a single and we have a double

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.130 
we have a single and we have a double
single<00:00:25.850> and<00:00:26.620> a<00:00:27.620> double<00:00:27.650> a<00:00:28.780> double<00:00:29.780> is<00:00:29.900> just

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
single and a double a double is just

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.930 
single and a double a double is just
when<00:00:30.290> you<00:00:30.380> hit<00:00:30.530> the<00:00:30.650> stick<00:00:30.860> twice<00:00:31.340> you<00:00:31.610> double

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
when you hit the stick twice you double

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.970 
when you hit the stick twice you double
there<00:00:32.029> are<00:00:32.270> a<00:00:32.300> few<00:00:32.509> methods<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:33.260> doubling<00:00:33.800> up

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
there are a few methods to doubling up

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.819 
there are a few methods to doubling up
one<00:00:34.519> method<00:00:34.969> is<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:35.329> bounce<00:00:35.660> method<00:00:36.199> and<00:00:36.410> the

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
one method is the bounce method and the

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:38.229 
one method is the bounce method and the
bounce<00:00:37.010> method<00:00:37.460> is<00:00:37.579> when<00:00:37.760> you<00:00:37.940> actually

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
bounce method is when you actually

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.360 
bounce method is when you actually
bounce<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:39.170> stick<00:00:39.499> your<00:00:39.710> wrist<00:00:39.949> goes<00:00:40.190> down

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
bounce the stick your wrist goes down

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.270 
bounce the stick your wrist goes down
one<00:00:40.640> time<00:00:40.940> but<00:00:41.480> your<00:00:41.659> stick<00:00:41.989> bounces<00:00:42.589> twice

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
one time but your stick bounces twice

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.340 
one time but your stick bounces twice
and<00:00:43.789> you<00:00:44.149> achieve<00:00:44.269> that<00:00:44.690> just<00:00:44.989> by<00:00:45.109> putting

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
and you achieve that just by putting

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.439 
and you achieve that just by putting
some<00:00:45.620> pressure<00:00:45.800> on<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:46.309> tip<00:00:46.489> of<00:00:46.609> the<00:00:46.730> stick<00:00:46.969> so

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
some pressure on the tip of the stick so

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.450 
some pressure on the tip of the stick so
that<00:00:47.690> it<00:00:47.839> bounces<00:00:48.260> again<00:00:48.589> and<00:00:48.829> then<00:00:49.159> you<00:00:49.249> catch

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
that it bounces again and then you catch

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.590 
that it bounces again and then you catch
it<00:00:50.620> another<00:00:51.620> method<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.129> doubling<00:00:52.819> is<00:00:52.999> to

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
it another method to doubling is to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.029 
it another method to doubling is to
rinsed<00:00:53.960> it<00:00:54.079> out<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:54.469> that's<00:00:54.800> when<00:00:54.949> you

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
rinsed it out and that's when you

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.950 
rinsed it out and that's when you
actually<00:00:55.190> use<00:00:55.370> your<00:00:55.640> wrist<00:00:55.909> to<00:00:56.390> hit<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.719> drum

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
actually use your wrist to hit the drum

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.419 
actually use your wrist to hit the drum
twice<00:00:58.300> in<00:00:59.300> a<00:01:00.229> final<00:01:00.620> method<00:01:00.739> to<00:01:00.949> doubling<00:01:01.280> that

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
twice in a final method to doubling that

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.040 
twice in a final method to doubling that
we're<00:01:01.579> going<00:01:01.699> to<00:01:01.760> talk<00:01:01.940> about<00:01:02.120> is<00:01:02.449> the

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
we're going to talk about is the

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.930 
we're going to talk about is the
dribbling<00:01:03.559> method<00:01:03.979> and<00:01:04.129> that's<00:01:04.519> when<00:01:04.699> you<00:01:04.820> use

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
dribbling method and that's when you use

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.870 
dribbling method and that's when you use
your<00:01:04.970> fingers<00:01:05.570> to<00:01:06.250> sort<00:01:07.250> of<00:01:07.340> dribble<00:01:07.729> the

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
your fingers to sort of dribble the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.340 
your fingers to sort of dribble the
stick<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:08.360> I'm<00:01:08.479> going<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.630> do<00:01:08.750> it<00:01:08.840> slowly<00:01:09.110> so

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
stick and I'm going to do it slowly so

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.050 
stick and I'm going to do it slowly so
you<00:01:09.439> can<00:01:09.469> see<00:01:09.649> I<00:01:09.829> get<00:01:09.950> a<00:01:10.070> pivot<00:01:10.460> point<00:01:10.490> with<00:01:10.909> my

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
you can see I get a pivot point with my

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.389 
you can see I get a pivot point with my
fingers<00:01:11.479> here<00:01:11.719> and<00:01:11.899> I<00:01:12.259> use<00:01:12.469> my<00:01:12.680> remaining

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
fingers here and I use my remaining

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:16.480 
fingers here and I use my remaining
fingers<00:01:13.820> to<00:01:14.320> dribble<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.890> stick<00:01:16.219> other

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
fingers to dribble the stick other

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.139 
fingers to dribble the stick other
slowly<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:16.969> you<00:01:17.090> can<00:01:17.240> see<00:01:17.979> so<00:01:18.979> a<00:01:19.009> double<00:01:19.340> you

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
slowly so you can see so a double you

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.899 
slowly so you can see so a double you
just<00:01:20.360> dribble<00:01:20.659> twice<00:01:21.399> we're<00:01:22.399> going<00:01:22.549> to<00:01:22.610> start

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
just dribble twice we're going to start

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.539 
just dribble twice we're going to start
out<00:01:23.090> by<00:01:23.390> doubling<00:01:24.110> on<00:01:24.320> just<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:25.039> basic

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
out by doubling on just a basic

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.760 
out by doubling on just a basic
sixteenth<00:01:26.090> note<00:01:26.270> drum<00:01:26.539> fill<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.200> we'd<00:01:27.320> have<00:01:27.350> 1

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
sixteenth note drum fill so we'd have 1

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.399 
sixteenth note drum fill so we'd have 1
T<00:01:28.009> and<00:01:28.189> up<00:01:28.490> to<00:01:28.729> T<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:29.149> the<00:01:29.329> 3/8<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:29.810> up<00:01:30.229> will

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
T and up to T and the 3/8 and up will

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.469 
T and up to T and the 3/8 and up will
end<00:01:30.829> up<00:01:31.100> that's<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:31.609> drum<00:01:31.820> fill<00:01:32.060> we're<00:01:32.240> going

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
end up that's the drum fill we're going

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.959 
end up that's the drum fill we're going
to<00:01:32.600> use<00:01:32.810> we're<00:01:33.229> going<00:01:33.259> to<00:01:33.500> first<00:01:34.130> use<00:01:34.430> leading

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
to use we're going to first use leading

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.209 
to use we're going to first use leading
hand<00:01:35.210> doubling<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.439> leading<00:01:36.710> hand<00:01:37.039> is

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
hand doubling and the leading hand is

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.010 
hand doubling and the leading hand is
simply<00:01:37.609> the<00:01:37.759> hand<00:01:38.000> that<00:01:38.149> you<00:01:38.270> start<00:01:38.659> the<00:01:38.719> drum

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
simply the hand that you start the drum

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.810 
simply the hand that you start the drum
fill<00:01:39.259> with<00:01:39.409> in<00:01:39.560> my<00:01:39.710> case<00:01:39.950> it's<00:01:40.130> my<00:01:40.310> right<00:01:40.520> hand

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
fill with in my case it's my right hand

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.870 
fill with in my case it's my right hand
we<00:01:41.719> are<00:01:41.840> going<00:01:41.869> to<00:01:42.320> double<00:01:42.920> up<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.640> leading

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
we are going to double up the leading

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.840 
we are going to double up the leading
hand<00:01:44.240> every<00:01:44.869> time<00:01:45.140> we<00:01:45.469> switch<00:01:46.009> a<00:01:46.130> drum<00:01:46.429> in<00:01:46.670> this

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
hand every time we switch a drum in this

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.880 
hand every time we switch a drum in this
fill<00:01:47.149> now<00:01:48.020> that's<00:01:48.229> actually<00:01:48.469> going<00:01:48.679> to<00:01:48.740> work

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
fill now that's actually going to work

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.359 
fill now that's actually going to work
out<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:49.130> be<00:01:49.310> every<00:01:49.850> number<00:01:50.210> one<00:01:50.810> into<00:01:51.500> two<00:01:51.859> and

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
out to be every number one into two and

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.569 
out to be every number one into two and
A<00:01:52.640> three<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:53.329> a<00:01:53.630> four<00:01:53.659> E<00:01:53.990> and<00:01:54.140> s<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:54.679> slowly<00:01:54.979> you

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
A three and a four E and s so slowly you

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.770 
A three and a four E and s so slowly you
have<00:01:55.609> a<00:01:55.700> mm1<00:01:56.240> e<00:01:56.829> and

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
have a mm1 e and

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.070 
have a mm1 e and
and<00:02:00.110> then<00:02:00.950> on<00:02:01.070> three<00:02:01.400> three<00:02:01.820> E<00:02:02.150> and<00:02:02.530> four<00:02:03.530> E<00:02:03.890> and

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
and then on three three E and four E and

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.720 
and then on three three E and four E and
now<00:02:06.080> just<00:02:06.470> so<00:02:06.620> you<00:02:06.680> can<00:02:06.920> hear<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.250> difference

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
now just so you can hear the difference

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.090 
now just so you can hear the difference
between<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.660> normal<00:02:09.170> Phil<00:02:09.470> playing<00:02:09.890> the

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
between the the normal Phil playing the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.400 
between the the normal Phil playing the
single<00:02:10.340> strokes<00:02:10.759> with<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.300> end<00:02:11.510> up<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.960> a<00:02:11.990> 10

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
single strokes with the end up to a 10

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.540 
single strokes with the end up to a 10
degree<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:14.780> doesn't<00:02:15.110> sound<00:02:15.230> bad<00:02:15.560> but<00:02:16.280> it's<00:02:16.430> not

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
degree it doesn't sound bad but it's not

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.300 
degree it doesn't sound bad but it's not
bad<00:02:16.790> enough<00:02:16.970> we're<00:02:17.780> going<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:17.959> double<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.350> up

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.370 

instead<00:02:22.310> of<00:02:22.370> only<00:02:22.700> doubling<00:02:23.330> on<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.600> one<00:02:23.840> two

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
instead of only doubling on the one two

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.920 
instead of only doubling on the one two
three<00:02:24.950> or<00:02:25.190> four<00:02:25.490> you<00:02:25.670> can<00:02:25.820> also<00:02:26.000> double<00:02:26.480> on<00:02:26.660> the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
three or four you can also double on the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.410 
three or four you can also double on the
ands<00:02:27.530> which<00:02:27.770> is<00:02:27.950> actually<00:02:28.370> will<00:02:28.940> be<00:02:29.030> every

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
ands which is actually will be every

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.750 
ands which is actually will be every
single<00:02:29.780> time<00:02:30.020> you<00:02:30.050> hit<00:02:30.410> your<00:02:30.470> leading<00:02:31.370> hand

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
single time you hit your leading hand

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.699 
single time you hit your leading hand
the<00:02:31.970> one<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.420> two<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:32.840> three<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.260> four<00:02:33.350> and

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
the one and two and three and four and

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:41.800 
the one and two and three and four and
I'll<00:02:33.800> show<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.130> one<00:02:40.300> when<00:02:41.300> you<00:02:41.390> speed<00:02:41.690> it

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
I'll show you that one when you speed it

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.060 
I'll show you that one when you speed it
up<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:42.080> get<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.260> nice<00:02:42.440> sounding<00:02:42.830> fill<00:02:43.959> and

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
up you get a nice sounding fill and

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.010 
up you get a nice sounding fill and
that's<00:02:46.070> doubling<00:02:46.670> up<00:02:46.850> every<00:02:47.330> time<00:02:47.600> I<00:02:47.630> hit<00:02:47.870> the

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
that's doubling up every time I hit the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.630 
that's doubling up every time I hit the
leading<00:02:48.320> hand<00:02:48.500> if<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:48.770> limit<00:02:49.160> yourself<00:02:49.580> to

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
leading hand if you limit yourself to

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.640 
leading hand if you limit yourself to
only<00:02:49.940> doubling<00:02:50.780> with<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.050> leading<00:02:51.350> hand

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
only doubling with the leading hand

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.210 
only doubling with the leading hand
you'll<00:02:52.489> be<00:02:52.700> limited<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.660> only<00:02:54.070> doubling<00:02:55.070> with

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
you'll be limited to only doubling with

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.040 
you'll be limited to only doubling with
the<00:02:55.340> leading<00:02:55.670> hand<00:02:55.910> so<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:56.630> want<00:02:56.810> to<00:02:56.870> practice

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
the leading hand so you want to practice

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.800 
the leading hand so you want to practice
also<00:02:57.860> doubling<00:02:58.430> with<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.820> secondary<00:02:59.420> hand

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
also doubling with the secondary hand

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.870 
also doubling with the secondary hand
the<00:03:00.020> secondary<00:03:00.650> hand<00:03:00.980> is<00:03:01.160> just<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.489> hand<00:03:01.730> that

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
the secondary hand is just the hand that

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.110 
the secondary hand is just the hand that
you<00:03:02.030> use<00:03:02.470> secondly<00:03:03.470> it's<00:03:04.280> not<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.820> leading

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
you use secondly it's not the leading

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.370 
you use secondly it's not the leading
hand<00:03:05.330> it's<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:05.660> other<00:03:05.810> hand<00:03:06.080> we're<00:03:06.200> going<00:03:06.290> to

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
hand it's the other hand we're going to

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.810 
hand it's the other hand we're going to
use<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.650> doubling<00:03:07.040> technique<00:03:07.489> with<00:03:07.700> the

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
use the doubling technique with the

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.090 
use the doubling technique with the
secondary<00:03:08.269> hand<00:03:08.600> on<00:03:08.750> that<00:03:09.200> same<00:03:09.470> sixteenth

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
secondary hand on that same sixteenth

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.490 
secondary hand on that same sixteenth
note<00:03:10.430> drum<00:03:10.760> fill<00:03:11.060> pattern<00:03:11.930> we're<00:03:12.320> going<00:03:12.350> to

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
note drum fill pattern we're going to

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.220 
note drum fill pattern we're going to
double<00:03:13.280> up<00:03:13.489> on<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:13.730> ease<00:03:14.180> so<00:03:14.780> it's<00:03:14.959> going<00:03:15.140> to

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
double up on the ease so it's going to

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.610 
double up on the ease so it's going to
be<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.500> second<00:03:16.100> hit<00:03:16.340> on<00:03:17.080> each<00:03:18.080> drum<00:03:18.320> two<00:03:18.970> and

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
be the second hit on each drum two and

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.099 
be the second hit on each drum two and
three

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.580 

let<00:03:27.109> me<00:03:27.200> play<00:03:27.349> that<00:03:27.379> a<00:03:27.530> little<00:03:27.769> faster<00:03:29.590> using

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
let me play that a little faster using

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.800 
let me play that a little faster using
the<00:03:30.859> doubling<00:03:31.250> technique<00:03:31.640> is<00:03:31.819> to<00:03:32.299> double<00:03:32.659> up

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
the doubling technique is to double up

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.199 
the doubling technique is to double up
on<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.049> sixteenth<00:03:33.620> note<00:03:33.859> hi-hat<00:03:34.370> beat<00:03:34.579> the

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
on the sixteenth note hi-hat beat the

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.030 
on the sixteenth note hi-hat beat the
sixteenth<00:03:35.599> note<00:03:35.810> hi-hat<00:03:36.319> beat<00:03:36.530> is<00:03:36.739> just

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
sixteenth note hi-hat beat is just

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
sixteenth note hi-hat beat is just
sixteenth<00:03:37.819> notes<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:40.340> snare<00:03:40.640> on<00:03:40.790> two<00:03:40.970> and

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
sixteenth notes and the snare on two and

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:52.119 
sixteenth notes and the snare on two and
four<00:03:42.400> then<00:03:43.400> you<00:03:43.430> can<00:03:43.790> throw<00:03:44.540> in<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.750> bass<00:03:51.129> pretty

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
four then you can throw in a bass pretty

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.610 
four then you can throw in a bass pretty
geeky<00:03:52.370> but<00:03:52.939> we<00:03:53.090> can<00:03:53.239> really<00:03:53.480> spice<00:03:53.810> it<00:03:54.049> up<00:03:54.200> by

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
geeky but we can really spice it up by

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.770 
geeky but we can really spice it up by
throwing<00:03:54.859> in<00:03:55.250> some<00:03:55.730> leading<00:03:56.090> hand<00:03:56.269> doublings

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
throwing in some leading hand doublings

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.690 
throwing in some leading hand doublings
and<00:03:56.959> maybe<00:03:57.079> some<00:03:57.319> secondary<00:03:57.829> hand<00:03:58.189> doublings

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
and maybe some secondary hand doublings

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.309 
and maybe some secondary hand doublings
so<00:03:59.060> let's<00:03:59.269> kick<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.689> regular<00:04:00.109> beat<00:04:02.319> with

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
so let's kick the regular beat with

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:13.629 
so let's kick the regular beat with
straight<00:04:03.680> six<00:04:04.040> days<00:04:04.220> now<00:04:04.549> let's<00:04:05.299> double<00:04:12.639> the

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
straight six days now let's double the

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:15.520 
straight six days now let's double the
final<00:04:13.970> way<00:04:14.239> to<00:04:14.269> use<00:04:14.599> the<00:04:14.780> doubling<00:04:15.139> technique

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
final way to use the doubling technique

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.680 
final way to use the doubling technique
that<00:04:15.709> we're<00:04:15.889> going<00:04:16.099> to<00:04:16.190> talk<00:04:16.400> about<00:04:16.579> is<00:04:16.849> double

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
that we're going to talk about is double

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.779 
that we're going to talk about is double
doubling<00:04:18.049> double<00:04:18.919> doubling<00:04:19.370> is<00:04:19.519> when<00:04:19.699> you

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
doubling double doubling is when you

fill<00:04:32.570> pattern<00:04:33.139> that<00:04:33.349> we've<00:04:33.470> been<00:04:33.710> doing<00:04:33.949> the

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
fill pattern that we've been doing the

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.879 
fill pattern that we've been doing the
first<00:04:34.909> two<00:04:35.150> hits<00:04:35.419> on<00:04:35.570> each<00:04:35.720> drum<00:04:36.050> are<00:04:36.440> going<00:04:36.800> to

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
first two hits on each drum are going to

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:46.149 
first two hits on each drum are going to
be<00:04:37.039> doubles<00:04:37.610> double<00:04:38.060> double<00:04:38.570> hit<00:04:38.900> hit<00:04:39.440> -<00:04:45.159> now

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:46.159 
be doubles double double hit hit - now

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:48.040 
be doubles double double hit hit - now
when<00:04:46.430> we<00:04:46.520> put<00:04:46.669> that<00:04:46.789> in<00:04:46.970> time<00:04:47.210> in<00:04:47.479> a<00:04:47.659> normal

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
when we put that in time in a normal

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.320 
when we put that in time in a normal
tempo<00:04:48.440> it's<00:04:48.919> going<00:04:49.070> to<00:04:49.130> sound<00:04:49.250> like<00:04:49.370> this

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330

that's<00:04:52.199> the<00:04:52.770> doubling<00:04:53.099> technique<00:04:53.490> I<00:04:53.699> hope<00:04:54.030> you

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
that's the doubling technique I hope you

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.710 
that's the doubling technique I hope you
