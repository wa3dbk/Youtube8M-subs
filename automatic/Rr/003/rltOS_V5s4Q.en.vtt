incredibly<00:01:43.579> crazy<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:44.179> ironic<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:44.810> I<00:01:44.869> was

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
incredibly crazy and ironic and I was

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.889 
incredibly crazy and ironic and I was
like<00:01:45.079> whoa<00:01:45.789> anyway<00:01:46.789> you<00:01:47.179> know<00:01:47.299> life<00:01:47.600> after

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
like whoa anyway you know life after

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.460 
like whoa anyway you know life after
fires<00:01:48.110> singles<00:01:49.039> with<00:01:49.789> fires<00:01:50.000> on<00:01:50.299> them<00:01:50.509> so<00:01:51.049> nice

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
fires singles with fires on them so nice

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.160 
fires singles with fires on them so nice
to<00:01:51.799> these<00:01:52.340> new<00:01:52.520> generation<00:01:53.149> let<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:53.990> they<00:01:54.110> do

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
to these new generation let you they do

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.440 
to these new generation let you they do
after<00:01:54.649> the<00:01:54.979> pure<00:01:55.159> silver<00:01:55.549> and<00:01:55.939> then<00:01:56.119> move<00:01:56.299> on

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
after the pure silver and then move on

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.359 
after the pure silver and then move on
after<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.380> tour's<00:01:57.619> over<00:01:57.770> I<00:01:57.890> think<00:01:58.069> it's

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
after the tour's over I think it's

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:59.830 
after the tour's over I think it's
important<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:59.030> take<00:01:59.179> a<00:01:59.240> little<00:01:59.479> bit<00:01:59.659> of<00:01:59.720> a

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
important to take a little bit of a

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.010 
important to take a little bit of a
break<00:02:00.079> because<00:02:00.380> you've<00:02:01.039> been<00:02:01.310> in<00:02:01.729> this<00:02:02.479> mix<00:02:02.810> of

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
break because you've been in this mix of

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.050 
break because you've been in this mix of
craziness<00:02:03.409> for<00:02:03.649> so<00:02:03.829> long<00:02:03.979> a<00:02:04.220> little<00:02:04.819> bit<00:02:04.909> of<00:02:05.000> a

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
craziness for so long a little bit of a

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.460 
craziness for so long a little bit of a
break<00:02:05.270> but<00:02:05.390> make<00:02:05.569> sure<00:02:05.599> to<00:02:05.929> get<00:02:06.079> right<00:02:06.319> back

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
break but make sure to get right back

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.529 
break but make sure to get right back
into<00:02:06.679> it<00:02:06.829> like<00:02:07.189> as<00:02:07.520> soon<00:02:07.729> as<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:07.970> can<00:02:08.179> after

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
into it like as soon as you can after

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.270 
into it like as soon as you can after
you<00:02:08.869> take<00:02:09.049> a<00:02:09.079> moment<00:02:09.289> for<00:02:09.470> yourself<00:02:09.920> because

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
you take a moment for yourself because

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.600 
you take a moment for yourself because
it's<00:02:10.429> a<00:02:10.519> really<00:02:11.380> crazy<00:02:12.380> experience<00:02:13.099> and<00:02:13.340> it's

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
it's a really crazy experience and it's

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.410 
it's a really crazy experience and it's
kind<00:02:13.970> of<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.180> little<00:02:14.450> bit<00:02:14.569> of<00:02:14.660> a<00:02:14.720> mind<00:02:14.930> jolt<00:02:15.230> and

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
kind of a little bit of a mind jolt and

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.490 
kind of a little bit of a mind jolt and
but<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.450> do<00:02:17.569> think<00:02:17.840> it's<00:02:18.019> important<00:02:18.440> to

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
but I do think it's important to

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.140 
but I do think it's important to
continue<00:02:18.920> while<00:02:19.459> you<00:02:19.579> still<00:02:19.760> have<00:02:19.819> momentum

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
continue while you still have momentum

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.539 
continue while you still have momentum
and<00:02:20.510> get<00:02:20.690> things<00:02:20.959> going<00:02:21.739> and<00:02:21.950> get<00:02:22.190> what<00:02:22.400> you

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
and get things going and get what you

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.590 
and get things going and get what you
want<00:02:22.849> out<00:02:23.030> there<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.540> get<00:02:24.380> her<00:02:24.470> done
