00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
which don't matter too much but the c4

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.640 
which don't matter too much but the c4
and<00:01:32.729> one<00:01:33.360> concussion<00:01:33.869> grenades<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.560> is

the<00:01:34.799> class<00:01:35.009> atop<00:01:35.310> if<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.820> want<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> be<00:01:36.180> going

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
the class atop if you want to be going

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.700 
the class atop if you want to be going
ahead<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.780> trying<00:01:37.049> out<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> class<00:01:37.500> i'm

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
ahead and trying out the class i'm

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.890 
ahead and trying out the class i'm
guessing<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.250> quite<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.060> lot<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.509> already

guessing that quite a lot of you already

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.480 
guessing that quite a lot of you already
use<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> class<00:01:40.439> very<00:01:40.710> similar<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.250> because

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
use a class very similar to this because

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.880 
use a class very similar to this because
you<00:01:42.450> know<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.659> spoke<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.140> pretty<00:01:43.590> much<00:01:43.619> still

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
you know you spoke you pretty much still

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.800 
you know you spoke you pretty much still

mags<00:02:25.080> was<00:02:25.320> seem<00:02:25.770> like<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.010> best<00:02:26.130> idea

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
mags was seem like the best idea

mags was seem like the best idea
considered<00:02:26.940> had<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.240> reload<00:02:27.540> quite<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.840> lot<00:02:28.050> and

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
considered had to reload quite a lot and

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.920 
considered had to reload quite a lot and
of<00:02:28.620> course<00:02:28.650> quick-draw<00:02:29.510> forgetting<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:30.570> you

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
of course quick-draw forgetting this you

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.590 
of course quick-draw forgetting this you
know<00:02:31.050> kind<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.500> longer<00:02:32.010> ranged<00:02:32.640> places<00:02:33.480> where

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
know kind of longer ranged places where

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.180 
know kind of longer ranged places where
you<00:02:33.690> can't<00:02:33.870> really<00:02:34.020> hip<00:02:34.350> fire<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.740> things<00:02:34.980> so

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
you can't really hip fire and things so

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.340 
you can't really hip fire and things so
that's<00:02:35.640> while<00:02:35.850> she's<00:02:36.060> in<00:02:36.090> quick-draw<00:02:36.570> now<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
that's while she's in quick-draw now the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.560 
that's while she's in quick-draw now the
secondary<00:02:37.980> was<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.460> kap-40<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.210> course<00:02:39.420> and

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
secondary was the kap-40 of course and

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.110 
secondary was the kap-40 of course and
this<00:02:39.630> works<00:02:39.870> very<00:02:40.140> well<00:02:40.230> because<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:41.090> lot<00:02:42.090> of

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
this works very well because a lot of

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.820 
this works very well because a lot of
the<00:02:42.210> time<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.810> don't<00:02:42.840> have<00:02:43.170> time<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.530> reload

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
the time you don't have time to reload

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.590 
the time you don't have time to reload
you<00:02:44.280> know<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.760> just<00:02:44.910> doesn't<00:02:45.030> really<00:02:45.270> a<00:02:45.360> quick

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
you know it just doesn't really a quick

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.630 
you know it just doesn't really a quick
enough<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:45.840> being<00:02:46.290> able<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.590> switch<00:02:46.800> out<00:02:47.040> at<00:02:47.280> to

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
enough so being able to switch out at to

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.870 
enough so being able to switch out at to
the<00:02:47.730> kap-40<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.600> having<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:48.900> amazing<00:02:49.880> rpm

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
the kap-40 and having that amazing rpm

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.460 
the kap-40 and having that amazing rpm
rounds<00:02:51.240> per<00:02:51.390> minute<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.810> really<00:02:52.230> really

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
rounds per minute is really really

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.680 
rounds per minute is really really
useful<00:02:52.650> i<00:02:52.920> switched<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.400> so<00:02:53.670> much<00:02:54.000> in<00:02:54.210> this

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
useful i switched to it so much in this

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.630 
useful i switched to it so much in this
game<00:02:54.930> play<00:02:55.230> because<00:02:55.770> it<00:02:55.800> is<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.160> helpful<00:02:56.400> it

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
game play because it is so helpful it

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.640 
game play because it is so helpful it
fires<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.300> quickly<00:02:57.780> people<00:02:58.020> just<00:02:58.290> can't<00:02:58.500> put

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
fires so quickly people just can't put

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.530 
fires so quickly people just can't put
up<00:02:58.680> with<00:02:58.800> it<00:02:59.070> and<00:02:59.190> they<00:02:59.550> can't<00:03:00.060> really<00:03:00.180> fire

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
up with it and they can't really fire

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.090 
up with it and they can't really fire
back<00:03:00.780> quick<00:03:00.990> enough<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.290> know<00:03:01.470> but<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.980> only

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
back quick enough you know but the only

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.160 
back quick enough you know but the only
downside<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:02.640> that<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.570> course<00:03:03.690> it's<00:03:03.900> only<00:03:04.080> got

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
downside is that of course it's only got

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.200 
downside is that of course it's only got
15<00:03:04.530> bullets<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.100> because<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.460> fires<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:05.910> quick

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
15 bullets and because it fires so quick

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.820 
15 bullets and because it fires so quick
you<00:03:06.810> actually<00:03:07.080> go<00:03:07.170> through<00:03:07.200> those<00:03:07.500> bullets

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
you actually go through those bullets

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.440 
you actually go through those bullets
very<00:03:08.100> quickly<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:08.700> that's<00:03:08.850> why<00:03:09.030> we<00:03:09.150> put<00:03:09.300> on<00:03:09.420> the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
very quickly so that's why we put on the

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.360 
very quickly so that's why we put on the
fast<00:03:09.780> mags<00:03:10.020> as<00:03:10.200> well<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.830> so<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.010> can<00:03:11.070> reload

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
fast mags as well and so you can reload

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.070 
fast mags as well and so you can reload
a<00:03:11.400> tiny<00:03:11.670> bit<00:03:11.820> quicker<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.540> really<00:03:12.870> does

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
a tiny bit quicker and it really does

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.230 
a tiny bit quicker and it really does
make<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.380> difference<00:03:13.560> especially<00:03:14.310> on<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:15.000> cat

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
make the difference especially on a cat

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.770 
make the difference especially on a cat
40<00:03:15.690> now<00:03:16.170> for<00:03:16.620> perkone<00:03:17.450> will<00:03:18.450> using

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
40 now for perkone will using

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.420 
40 now for perkone will using
lightweight<00:03:19.050> now<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:19.920> was<00:03:20.070> kind<00:03:20.280> of

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
lightweight now this was kind of

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.490 
lightweight now this was kind of
strangely<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:21.180> guess<00:03:21.420> you<00:03:21.540> could<00:03:21.570> probably<00:03:22.140> use

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
strangely I guess you could probably use

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.560 
strangely I guess you could probably use
ghost<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.280> switch<00:03:23.640> out<00:03:23.850> quick<00:03:24.090> draw<00:03:24.330> for

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
ghost and switch out quick draw for

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.300 
ghost and switch out quick draw for
silencer<00:03:25.110> if<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.650> were<00:03:25.740> wanting<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.070> go<00:03:26.160> for

silencer if you were wanting to go for

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.770 
silencer if you were wanting to go for
nucleus<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:26.850> stuff<00:03:27.060> but<00:03:27.210> I<00:03:27.270> was<00:03:27.390> just<00:03:27.540> want<00:03:27.720> to

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
nucleus and stuff but I was just want to

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.200 
nucleus and stuff but I was just want to
get<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:27.900> really<00:03:28.200> fast-paced<00:03:28.560> gameplay<00:03:29.210> running

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
get a really fast-paced gameplay running

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.520 
get a really fast-paced gameplay running
around<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.480> map<00:03:30.630> as<00:03:30.750> quickly<00:03:30.990> could<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.440> make

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
around the map as quickly could to make

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.980 
around the map as quickly could to make
it<00:03:31.740> interesting<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.700> entertaining<00:03:32.990> so

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
it interesting and entertaining so

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.570 
it interesting and entertaining so
lightweight<00:03:34.230> seemed<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:34.800> a<00:03:34.830> very<00:03:34.980> sensible

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
lightweight seemed like a very sensible

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.240 
lightweight seemed like a very sensible
you<00:03:36.570> know<00:03:36.660> option<00:03:37.110> for<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:38.160> know

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
you know option for that and you know

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.830 
you know option for that and you know
how<00:03:38.490> quite<00:03:38.700> a<00:03:38.730> lot<00:03:38.940> i<00:03:38.970> love<00:03:39.270> being<00:03:39.480> able<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.630> run

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
how quite a lot i love being able to run

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.690 
how quite a lot i love being able to run
quickly<00:03:40.110> it<00:03:40.650> really<00:03:41.070> does<00:03:41.310> speed<00:03:41.550> up

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
quickly it really does speed up

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.100 
quickly it really does speed up
gameplays<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.180> make<00:03:42.480> things<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.810> lot<00:03:43.050> more

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
gameplays and make things a lot more

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.410 
gameplays and make things a lot more
fast<00:03:43.500> paced<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:44.010> morph<00:03:44.160> into<00:03:44.370> play<00:03:44.640> so<00:03:45.270> that's

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
fast paced and morph into play so that's

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.980 
fast paced and morph into play so that's
why<00:03:45.570> we're<00:03:45.690> using<00:03:45.840> lightweight<00:03:46.730> now<00:03:47.780> for<00:03:48.780> perk

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
why we're using lightweight now for perk

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.290 
why we're using lightweight now for perk
to<00:03:49.410> i<00:03:49.740> would<00:03:50.160> normally<00:03:50.580> suggest<00:03:50.910> that<00:03:51.180> to

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
to i would normally suggest that to

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.330 
to i would normally suggest that to
using<00:03:51.600> fast<00:03:51.840> hands<00:03:52.110> because<00:03:52.830> obviously<00:03:52.980> if<00:03:53.250> we

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
using fast hands because obviously if we

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.730 
using fast hands because obviously if we
got<00:03:53.490> a<00:03:53.520> c4<00:03:54.090> or<00:03:54.360> concussion<00:03:54.750> grenade<00:03:55.230> you<00:03:55.620> want

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
got a c4 or concussion grenade you want

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.650 
got a c4 or concussion grenade you want
to<00:03:55.800> be<00:03:55.860> able<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.070> from<00:03:56.340> as<00:03:56.520> quickly<00:03:56.820> as<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.390> can

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
to be able to from as quickly as you can

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.780 
to be able to from as quickly as you can
but<00:03:58.500> we're<00:03:58.860> actually<00:03:58.950> using<00:03:59.130> toughness<00:03:59.760> which

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
but we're actually using toughness which

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.670 
but we're actually using toughness which
is<00:04:00.120> kind<00:04:00.420> of<00:04:00.540> strange<00:04:00.690> for<00:04:01.020> me<00:04:01.050> a<00:04:01.290> lot<00:04:01.650> of

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
is kind of strange for me a lot of

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.440 
is kind of strange for me a lot of
people<00:04:01.890> tend<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.370> stick<00:04:02.670> to<00:04:02.730> toughness

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
people tend to stick to toughness

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.660 
people tend to stick to toughness
because<00:04:04.230> they<00:04:04.350> often<00:04:04.890> get<00:04:04.950> outgunned<00:04:05.430> and

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
because they often get outgunned and

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.360 
because they often get outgunned and
things<00:04:05.940> like<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:06.180> but<00:04:06.690> for<00:04:06.930> me<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:08.100> i

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
things like that but for me and i

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.850 
things like that but for me and i
normally<00:04:08.640> stick<00:04:09.270> to<00:04:09.420> fast<00:04:09.630> hands<00:04:09.870> but<00:04:10.140> perk<00:04:10.560> 2

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
normally stick to fast hands but perk 2

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.620 
normally stick to fast hands but perk 2
is<00:04:11.100> one<00:04:11.220> of<00:04:11.310> those<00:04:11.400> perks<00:04:11.700> where<00:04:12.270> it's<00:04:12.390> really

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
is one of those perks where it's really

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.480 
is one of those perks where it's really
personal<00:04:13.350> preference<00:04:13.980> you<00:04:14.130> can<00:04:14.160> pretty<00:04:14.400> much

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
personal preference you can pretty much

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.940 
personal preference you can pretty much
put<00:04:14.730> on<00:04:14.850> anything<00:04:15.150> on<00:04:15.420> a<00:04:15.450> gun<00:04:15.750> in<00:04:16.380> terms<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.770> per

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
put on anything on a gun in terms of per

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.800 
put on anything on a gun in terms of per
2<00:04:17.220> and<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:17.549> will<00:04:17.640> work<00:04:17.850> pretty<00:04:18.090> well<00:04:18.210> so<00:04:18.660> for

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
2 and it will work pretty well so for

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.050 
2 and it will work pretty well so for
instance<00:04:18.870> are<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:19.739> scavenge<00:04:20.430> on<00:04:20.640> all<00:04:20.940> my

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
instance are you scavenge on all my

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.090 
instance are you scavenge on all my
assault<00:04:21.299> rifles<00:04:21.720> but<00:04:22.080> you<00:04:22.320> can<00:04:22.470> switch<00:04:22.740> out<00:04:22.919> to

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
assault rifles but you can switch out to

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.710 
assault rifles but you can switch out to
toughness<00:04:23.490> so<00:04:24.150> that's<00:04:24.300> why<00:04:24.419> we're<00:04:24.570> using

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
toughness so that's why we're using

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.180 
toughness so that's why we're using
toughness<00:04:25.290> you<00:04:25.440> know<00:04:25.560> obviously<00:04:25.919> changeup<00:04:26.460> 22

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
toughness you know obviously changeup 22

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.920 
toughness you know obviously changeup 22
you<00:04:27.310> want<00:04:27.520> whatever's<00:04:27.880> your<00:04:28.060> personal

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
you want whatever's your personal

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.930 
you want whatever's your personal
preference<00:04:29.320> so<00:04:29.860> now<00:04:30.100> we're<00:04:30.370> moving<00:04:30.550> on<00:04:30.910> to

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
preference so now we're moving on to

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.120 
preference so now we're moving on to
perk<00:04:31.360> 3<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:32.020> I'm<00:04:32.080> guessing<00:04:32.500> it's<00:04:32.740> not<00:04:33.010> going

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
perk 3 and I'm guessing it's not going

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.980 
perk 3 and I'm guessing it's not going
to<00:04:33.220> surprise<00:04:33.370> most<00:04:33.820> of<00:04:34.030> you<00:04:34.180> i<00:04:34.330> was<00:04:34.780> using

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
to surprise most of you i was using

sure<00:04:40.720> that<00:04:40.900> none<00:04:41.020> of<00:04:41.050> you<00:04:41.230> are<00:04:41.290> surprised<00:04:41.740> if

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
sure that none of you are surprised if

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.700 
sure that none of you are surprised if
you've<00:04:42.430> watched<00:04:42.640> these<00:04:42.850> episodes<00:04:43.210> before

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
you've watched these episodes before

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.110 
you've watched these episodes before
although<00:04:44.710> in<00:04:45.040> free<00:04:45.280> for<00:04:45.550> what<00:04:45.730> I've<00:04:45.820> noticed

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
although in free for what I've noticed

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.150 
although in free for what I've noticed
is<00:04:46.450> that<00:04:46.510> people<00:04:46.900> don't<00:04:47.110> tend<00:04:47.470> to<00:04:47.560> use<00:04:47.830> any

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
is that people don't tend to use any

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.150 
is that people don't tend to use any
kind<00:04:48.700> of<00:04:48.940> concussions<00:04:49.840> or<00:04:50.110> flash<00:04:50.710> bangs<00:04:50.980> at

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
kind of concussions or flash bangs at

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.460 
kind of concussions or flash bangs at
all<00:04:51.340> really<00:04:51.700> so<00:04:52.300> tactical<00:04:52.690> mask<00:04:52.870> isn't<00:04:53.080> really

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
all really so tactical mask isn't really

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.080 
all really so tactical mask isn't really
needed<00:04:53.830> I<00:04:53.920> think<00:04:53.950> in<00:04:54.220> this<00:04:54.310> game<00:04:54.580> play<00:04:54.790> I

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
needed I think in this game play I

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.090 
needed I think in this game play I
didn't<00:04:55.690> even<00:04:55.780> get<00:04:55.960> stunned<00:04:56.350> or<00:04:56.590> flashed<00:04:56.950> or

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
didn't even get stunned or flashed or

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.610 
didn't even get stunned or flashed or
anything<00:04:57.340> like<00:04:57.370> that<00:04:57.490> once<00:04:57.880> so<00:04:58.210> if<00:04:58.840> you<00:04:59.080> really

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
anything like that once so if you really

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.020 
anything like that once so if you really

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
plays and dexterity if you're just

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.760 
plays and dexterity if you're just
trying<00:05:10.720> to<00:05:10.780> get<00:05:10.900> out<00:05:11.020> of<00:05:11.050> the<00:05:11.260> place<00:05:11.470> you<00:05:11.710> know

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
trying to get out of the place you know

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.900 
trying to get out of the place you know
trying<00:05:12.010> to<00:05:12.070> run<00:05:12.220> away<00:05:12.250> as<00:05:12.520> quick<00:05:12.730> as<00:05:12.790> you<00:05:12.880> can

trying to run away as quick as you can

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.970 
trying to run away as quick as you can
so<00:05:13.750> you<00:05:13.780> can<00:05:13.870> jump<00:05:14.170> up<00:05:14.380> and<00:05:14.530> get<00:05:14.650> out<00:05:14.800> of

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
so you can jump up and get out of

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.590 
so you can jump up and get out of
buildings<00:05:15.460> and<00:05:15.670> windows<00:05:15.970> and<00:05:16.210> things<00:05:16.360> so

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
buildings and windows and things so

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.750 
buildings and windows and things so
that's<00:05:17.110> what<00:05:17.350> I'd<00:05:17.440> use<00:05:17.740> but<00:05:17.770> that<00:05:18.340> is<00:05:18.490> pretty

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
that's what I'd use but that is pretty

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.940 
that's what I'd use but that is pretty
much<00:05:18.970> it<00:05:19.030> for<00:05:19.270> this<00:05:19.450> class<00:05:19.750> it<00:05:19.930> up<00:05:20.050> obviously

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
much it for this class it up obviously

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.710 
much it for this class it up obviously
we've<00:05:21.040> got<00:05:21.160> the<00:05:21.250> c4<00:05:21.730> and<00:05:21.760> the<00:05:21.970> concussion<00:05:22.510> but

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
we've got the c4 and the concussion but

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.600 
we've got the c4 and the concussion but
that<00:05:22.900> is<00:05:23.020> completely<00:05:23.380> down<00:05:23.560> to<00:05:23.800> you<00:05:23.950> that<00:05:24.460> the

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
that is completely down to you that the

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.430 
that is completely down to you that the
c-4<00:05:25.000> is<00:05:25.090> actually<00:05:25.360> very<00:05:25.390> useful<00:05:26.080> is<00:05:26.200> probably

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
c-4 is actually very useful is probably

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.370 
c-4 is actually very useful is probably
the<00:05:26.620> best<00:05:27.570> lethal<00:05:28.570> grenade<00:05:28.840> it<00:05:29.020> really<00:05:29.260> is

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
the best lethal grenade it really is

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.780 
the best lethal grenade it really is
because<00:05:29.590> you<00:05:29.740> can<00:05:29.860> throw<00:05:30.010> it<00:05:30.070> so<00:05:30.250> easily<00:05:30.520> and

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
because you can throw it so easily and

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.580 
because you can throw it so easily and
using<00:05:31.030> fast<00:05:31.270> hands<00:05:31.540> with<00:05:31.750> it<00:05:31.900> it's<00:05:32.290> just

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
using fast hands with it it's just

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.530 
using fast hands with it it's just
Imbrium<00:05:33.430> beatable<00:05:33.790> it<00:05:33.970> really<00:05:34.180> is<00:05:34.300> you<00:05:34.330> can

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
Imbrium beatable it really is you can

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.790 
Imbrium beatable it really is you can
just<00:05:34.690> throw<00:05:34.840> it<00:05:35.020> and<00:05:35.110> just<00:05:35.260> run<00:05:35.500> off<00:05:35.620> and

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
just throw it and just run off and

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.380 
just throw it and just run off and
detonate<00:05:36.460> it<00:05:36.490> halfway<00:05:36.820> cross<00:05:37.150> them<00:05:37.330> out

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
detonate it halfway cross them out

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.640 
detonate it halfway cross them out
that's<00:05:37.540> pretty<00:05:37.840> much<00:05:37.960> why<00:05:38.140> I<00:05:38.169> was<00:05:38.320> using<00:05:38.500> that

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
that's pretty much why I was using that

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.830 
that's pretty much why I was using that
so<00:05:39.520> anyway<00:05:39.760> that<00:05:39.970> is<00:05:40.000> it<00:05:40.270> for<00:05:40.300> this<00:05:40.570> week's
