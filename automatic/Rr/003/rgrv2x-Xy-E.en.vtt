comment that 96 Geo Metro made and I
thought<00:00:11.420> it<00:00:11.540> was<00:00:11.750> fantastic<00:00:12.200> and<00:00:12.800> I<00:00:12.860> wish<00:00:13.040> I

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
thought it was fantastic and I wish I

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.560 
thought it was fantastic and I wish I
had<00:00:13.309> brought<00:00:13.790> it<00:00:13.940> up<00:00:14.030> earlier

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
had brought it up earlier

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.190 
had brought it up earlier
he<00:00:15.380> stated<00:00:16.240> what<00:00:17.240> needs<00:00:17.450> to<00:00:17.540> be<00:00:17.689> learned<00:00:17.720> here

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
he stated what needs to be learned here

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.200 
he stated what needs to be learned here
is<00:00:18.349> that<00:00:18.650> a<00:00:18.710> small<00:00:19.040> rocket<00:00:19.340> stove<00:00:19.700> sometimes

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
is that a small rocket stove sometimes

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.390 
is that a small rocket stove sometimes
is<00:00:20.420> better<00:00:20.660> than<00:00:20.840> stoking<00:00:21.290> a<00:00:21.380> fire<00:00:21.410> place<00:00:21.860> just

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
is better than stoking a fire place just

old-fashioned cast iron cook stove

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.329 
old-fashioned cast iron cook stove
you've<00:00:56.570> got<00:00:56.780> to<00:00:56.929> heat<00:00:57.079> that<00:00:57.289> whole<00:00:57.620> mess<00:00:57.980> up

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
you've got to heat that whole mess up

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.049 
you've got to heat that whole mess up
we're<00:00:59.120> we're<00:00:59.300> so<00:00:59.899> focusing<00:01:00.620> this<00:01:00.829> fire<00:01:01.219> that

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
we're we're so focusing this fire that

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.780 
we're we're so focusing this fire that
it<00:01:03.050> requires<00:01:03.469> so<00:01:03.710> very<00:01:03.949> little<00:01:04.159> take<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:04.460> look

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
it requires so very little take a look

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.149 
it requires so very little take a look
at<00:01:04.909> how<00:01:05.089> much<00:01:05.269> material<00:01:05.510> we<00:01:05.930> burned<00:01:06.230> for<00:01:07.010> that

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
at how much material we burned for that

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:15.340 
at how much material we burned for that
breakfast<00:01:13.060> now<00:01:14.060> this<00:01:14.240> is<00:01:14.420> just<00:01:14.689> cut<00:01:14.930> from<00:01:15.200> a

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
breakfast now this is just cut from a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.789 
breakfast now this is just cut from a
old<00:01:15.590> pallet<00:01:16.579> that<00:01:16.610> I<00:01:16.759> had<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.329> it's<00:01:18.229> not<00:01:18.560> I

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
old pallet that I had and it's not I

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.260 
old pallet that I had and it's not I
made<00:01:19.250> certain<00:01:19.430> that<00:01:19.579> it<00:01:19.759> wasn't<00:01:19.909> pressure

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
made certain that it wasn't pressure

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.959 
made certain that it wasn't pressure
treated<00:01:20.689> but<00:01:21.290> it<00:01:21.680> just<00:01:21.920> burned<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.250> tips<00:01:22.549> look

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:22.969 
treated but it just burned the tips look

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:28.010 
treated but it just burned the tips look
how<00:01:23.090> little

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.570 

that's<00:01:29.020> one<00:01:29.230> of<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.410> reasons<00:01:29.770> why<00:01:29.920> World

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
that's one of the reasons why World

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.460 
that's one of the reasons why World
Health<00:01:30.940> Organization's<00:01:31.840> are<00:01:31.960> flocking<00:01:32.440> to

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
Health Organization's are flocking to

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.890 
Health Organization's are flocking to
the<00:01:32.680> stove<00:01:33.010> so<00:01:33.040> so<00:01:33.790> very<00:01:33.970> much<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:36.870> couple<00:01:37.870> of

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
the stove so so very much is a couple of

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.860 
the stove so so very much is a couple of
reasons<00:01:37.960> for<00:01:38.500> a<00:01:38.560> safety<00:01:38.950> reason<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:40.300> outside

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
reasons for a safety reason the outside

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.650 
reasons for a safety reason the outside
unless<00:01:41.170> you<00:01:41.350> cook<00:01:41.560> with<00:01:41.740> us<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:42.010> lot<00:01:42.610> it<00:01:43.300> doesn't

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
unless you cook with us a lot it doesn't

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.550 
unless you cook with us a lot it doesn't
get<00:01:44.110> even<00:01:44.530> warm<00:01:44.890> nor<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.640> bottom<00:01:46.050> so<00:01:47.050> children

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
get even warm nor the bottom so children

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.980 
get even warm nor the bottom so children
were<00:01:47.979> getting<00:01:48.310> burned<00:01:48.520> with<00:01:48.700> open<00:01:48.970> fires<00:01:49.240> this

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
were getting burned with open fires this

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.480 
were getting burned with open fires this
has<00:01:50.260> prevented<00:01:50.950> that

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
has prevented that

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.540 
has prevented that
another<00:01:52.240> reason<00:01:52.840> is<00:01:53.110> open<00:01:53.800> fires<00:01:54.040> inside<00:01:54.369> of

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
another reason is open fires inside of

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.070 
another reason is open fires inside of
those<00:01:54.700> homes<00:01:55.000> they<00:01:55.240> were<00:01:55.270> having<00:01:55.630> respiratory

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
those homes they were having respiratory

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.320 
those homes they were having respiratory
problems<00:01:56.530> this<00:01:57.280> burns<00:01:57.550> so<00:01:57.790> clean<00:01:58.000> I<00:01:58.030> still

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
problems this burns so clean I still

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.310 
problems this burns so clean I still
wouldn't<00:01:58.510> want<00:01:58.660> to<00:01:58.690> burn<00:01:58.869> it<00:01:59.020> inside<00:01:59.290> a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
wouldn't want to burn it inside a

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.100 
wouldn't want to burn it inside a
building<00:01:59.560> but<00:01:59.860> it<00:02:00.160> burns<00:02:00.399> so<00:02:00.640> clean<00:02:01.000> that<00:02:01.750> it's

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
building but it burns so clean that it's

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.780 
building but it burns so clean that it's
supposed<00:02:02.410> to<00:02:02.560> cut<00:02:02.770> down<00:02:02.979> on<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.250> respiratory

supposed to cut down on the respiratory
