00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
effective if you guessed it on yourself

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.940

so<00:00:45.000> i'm<00:00:45.149> going<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.420> show<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.600> guys<00:00:45.840> a

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
so i'm going to show you guys a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.440 
so i'm going to show you guys a
comparison<00:00:46.950> it's<00:00:47.520> now<00:00:47.700> with<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.969> pvp<00:00:48.420> power

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
comparison it's now with the pvp power

comparison it's now with the pvp power
buff<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.410> tender<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.039> can<00:00:50.219> see<00:00:50.460> it's

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
buff is just tender but you can see it's

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.840 
buff is just tender but you can see it's
double<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.149> amount<00:00:51.649> so<00:00:52.649> i<00:00:52.680> go<00:00:52.890> for<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> 51<00:00:53.640> k

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
double the amount so i go for a 51 k

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.920 
double the amount so i go for a 51 k
heal<00:00:54.180> then<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.719> tix<00:00:54.989> go<00:00:55.399> 48.6<00:00:56.399> k<00:00:56.730> okay<00:00:57.629> that's

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
heal then the tix go 48.6 k okay that's

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.549 
heal then the tix go 48.6 k okay that's
per<00:00:58.170> second<00:00:58.739> now<00:00:59.280> imagine<00:01:00.149> if<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.629> was<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> pvp

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
per second now imagine if this was a pvp

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.130 
per second now imagine if this was a pvp
scenario<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> twenty-five

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
scenario and you have the twenty-five

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.440 
scenario and you have the twenty-five
percent<00:01:04.320> more<00:01:04.769> heels<00:01:05.159> okay<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.330> would

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
percent more heels okay so that would

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.219 
percent more heels okay so that would
mean<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:07.439> tick<00:01:07.740> from<00:01:08.070> 10<00:01:08.400> k<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.820> 12<00:01:09.000> k<00:01:09.390> okay<00:01:10.080> now

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
mean but tick from 10 k to 12 k okay now

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.289 
mean but tick from 10 k to 12 k okay now
this<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.860> PTR<00:01:11.220> take<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> look<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.430 
know but I think after the 5.2 it's
going<00:01:37.250> to<00:01:37.310> be<00:01:37.490> really<00:01:37.729> viable<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:38.659> this<00:01:39.200> leads

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
going to be really viable and this leads

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.830 
going to be really viable and this leads
me<00:01:39.650> to<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.070> next<00:01:40.100> big<00:01:40.670> change<00:01:40.970> I<00:01:41.330> think<00:01:41.720> it's

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
me to the next big change I think it's

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.020 
me to the next big change I think it's
amazing<00:01:42.110> for<00:01:42.380> survivability<00:01:43.280> for
