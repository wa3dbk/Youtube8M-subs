00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.560
 question of the day happened to us yesterday 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.700
 hardly evening the kindle ended she 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.620
 comes from them abdulahi who we 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.180
 ask if installed yosemite is going 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.340
 obligatorily delete the data from 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.660
 his hard drive not at all but 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.640
 like every new version of mac 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.840
 of course there are the precautions to 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.130
 take first one must make a 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.989
 backup with time machine 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.790
 this will allow you to either reinstall a 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.959
 mac bones all clean and picks and the 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.820
 data you want to recover 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.260
 to restore and look at each other 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.209
 of the installation of yosemite it is 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.890
 quite simple if you choose to install bones 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.630
 10 yosemite over mavericks without 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.010
 have made backup that will find 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.120
 all of your files at the same 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.650
 place but it's still 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.420
 strongly advised to do a 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.890
 backup before because some 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.870
 applications might not work 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.130
 with yosemite or not yet are you 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.260
 might therefore need to come back 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.820
