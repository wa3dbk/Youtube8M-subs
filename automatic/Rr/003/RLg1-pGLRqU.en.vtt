00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.809

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.000

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.640

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.620
 In the comments for me, you can always

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.280

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.600
 well this tip is very simple consists of a 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.840
 business that you thugs and horse 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.600

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.550
 horse with the easiest of the world 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.979
 You'll end up killing bandits. 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.780

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.850
 You realized you're going to end up 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.369
 doing it but it's is earlier 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:24.810
 good cross as soon as you find it is Ã© 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.670
 one of the lepers together they can and 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.590
 Can you put them one close to the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.479
 another during the explosion you finish 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.210
 eliminating the cylinder I discovered 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.430
 this was in the strong occurred a review 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.789
 before and I discovered this last of 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.340
 A cool way is you'll see, said 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.850
 I ended up giving a lot together went well. 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.850
 funny 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:54.570
 Cross nildene needs to be destroyed good and 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.060
 now let's go to the icing on the cake 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.759
 customer these lots will be this bug 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.429
 Good money, you gotta live in this 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.810
 City here, sorry and ran away from her name. 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.369
 here now from that square 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.780
 you will find someone in the center and 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.610
 You'll have to see this guy who 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.430
 affectionately referred to as a seller of 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.160
 sausages for what he has there behind the 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.200
 stool one will you buy it and 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.060
 these first two things they have here 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.670
 what are these two stones that are there 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.970
 in front you buy her and she is well 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.349
 And you'll see that it's just there. 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.050
 that you bought from very 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.660
 money but if you want more 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.720
 it's just you talk to him again that the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.720
 things are backed up nothing is a 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.910
 amazing thing looks like this one from 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.300
 project she did it because he does not have 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.620
 as expensive she made birds for wanting good 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.680
 As soon as you get these things you 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.709
 goes to the blacksmith who is also there on the side 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.860
 and you will do the simplest thing of the 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.620
 world that is dismounting you go in the 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.720
 bathroom 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.430
 and asks to dismount and you will get 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.040
 a pearl and with that you indicate you 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.890
 sell the pearl she is to educate you will 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.569
 spend 40 kind of coins to do everything 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.909
 this process will sell the pearl for 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.739
 one hundred and eighty okay that the fig tree 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.659
 have a limited amount of money 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.700
 but it's only you in other fairs that they 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.180
 pay I think it 's the same thing if I do not 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.060
 mistake 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.489
 then it is the easiest way that you tend to 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.819
 making money is umbu and I do not 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.500
 I know man this, I do not like it much 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.450
 these things because it spoils me 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.920
 Totally the grace of the game, I only tried 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.090
 record even not repeating and face the game 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.340
 single player 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.040
 Then it was said, 'Do you think it's cool to do? 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.489
 This is because the game is more fun. 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.019
 is it's not like you to intervene in 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.290
 other games by other online people 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:54.400
 as it does not have in the game then leaves 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.349
 I tried to meditate here to see if the 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.989
 Dude, you come back with money, but it's over. 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.950
 that does not come back then it was just a test 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.950
 easy even 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:11.200
 Good, the video is staying by 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.840

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.730
