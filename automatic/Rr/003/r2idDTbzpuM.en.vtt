00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:01.835
Guilherme,
hand me the flour.

00:00:02.927 --> 00:00:04.442
Dad, mom,

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.035
we need to talk.

00:00:08.648 --> 00:00:10.984
You know that I'm 30.

00:00:12.072 --> 00:00:14.183
And I still live with you.

00:00:14.184 --> 00:00:17.870
At my age, all my friends
start making plans,

00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:20.420
some conclude plans.

00:00:20.421 --> 00:00:21.667
Family,

00:00:21.668 --> 00:00:24.121
work, work promotion...

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:25.484
And I started thinking:

00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:28.808
"Guilherme, shouldn't you
get these bricks and build

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:32.386
the road you will follow
for the rest of your life?"

00:00:32.387 --> 00:00:34.935
So I thought...

00:00:36.098 --> 00:00:37.896
it's time you leave home.

00:00:37.897 --> 00:00:38.996
We?

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:42.071
-Yes, dad, we are old for that.
-I don't get it.

00:00:42.072 --> 00:00:44.210
Mom,
your baby has grown up.

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:46.935
Sometimes I feel bad
bringing a girl here,

00:00:46.936 --> 00:00:48.796
because it's embarassing.

00:00:48.797 --> 00:00:50.385
Girl on short clothes...

00:00:50.386 --> 00:00:53.221
-But we don't want to leave.
-Do you think I do?

00:00:53.222 --> 00:00:55.447
I'm doing this
because it's better for me.

00:00:55.448 --> 00:00:56.772
But why don't you leave?

00:00:56.773 --> 00:00:59.284
How? I have no job,
no money...

00:00:59.285 --> 00:01:01.447
You are settled.

00:01:01.448 --> 00:01:03.772
You must have savings.
You are strong.

00:01:03.773 --> 00:01:04.845
You are cool.

00:01:04.846 --> 00:01:07.384
You can rent a taxi,

00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:09.520
work during dawn,
do something.

00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:12.571
Didn't you want to live
on the beach? Go to the beach!

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:15.970
I think you can find
a better place to live.

00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:17.147
-Better than this?
-Yes.

00:01:17.148 --> 00:01:18.522
How can I get
a better place?

00:01:18.523 --> 00:01:21.976
Here everything is near,
drugstore, market, gym...

00:01:21.977 --> 00:01:23.077
All walking distance.

00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:25.777
We can help you
find another apartment.

00:01:25.778 --> 00:01:26.901
No, mom.

00:01:26.902 --> 00:01:28.676
I got used to here.

00:01:28.677 --> 00:01:30.951
Besides all mailing,
changing registrations,

00:01:30.952 --> 00:01:32.666
it's a mess.

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:34.489
Guilherme, we won't leave.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.639
Dad,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.627
you are making the hard think
impossible.

00:01:38.628 --> 00:01:40.101
My heart is broken.

00:01:40.102 --> 00:01:42.314
Son, but why do you
want us to leave here?

00:01:42.315 --> 00:01:44.201
Don't say like that, mom.

00:01:44.202 --> 00:01:45.451
It seems I'm a monster.

00:01:45.452 --> 00:01:47.213
I don't want you
to leave like that.

00:01:47.214 --> 00:01:51.049
The door will be
always open to you.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.214
Not literally.
You call and say:

00:01:53.215 --> 00:01:56.476
"Son, I thought of
making you beans."

00:01:56.477 --> 00:01:58.801
What's that face?
Cheer up!

00:01:58.802 --> 00:02:01.292
Don't do that.
We are family.

00:02:02.736 --> 00:02:03.952
We are family.

00:02:03.953 --> 00:02:06.129
What do you want?
Do you want a week?

00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:08.089
Fine. One week.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.376
I will sacrifice for you,
because that's what sons do.

00:02:11.377 --> 00:02:12.463
&lt;i&gt;Mr. Guilherme,&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:12.464 --> 00:02:13.676
&lt;i&gt;bathtub is full.&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:13.677 --> 00:02:14.950
Thank you, Solange!

00:02:14.951 --> 00:02:17.525
By the way, Solange
has not been paid.

00:02:17.526 --> 00:02:19.763
Maybe you should deposit it
in my account

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:23.652
and I can pay her cash.

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:31.047
-Goodbye, my son!
-Goodbye, dad!

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.239
It doesn't even seem
30 years have gone by.

00:02:38.552 --> 00:02:40.750
Take a coat, mom.
Don't...

00:02:40.751 --> 00:02:43.801
Call me when you get there.
I am worried.

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.025
My God!

00:02:46.026 --> 00:02:48.112
I love you very much!

00:02:48.113 --> 00:02:51.550
-Son, wouldn't it be better...?
-I can get over it! I can!
