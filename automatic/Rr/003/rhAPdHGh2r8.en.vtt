called the hexitonic scale and I showed
you<00:00:19.529> how<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.920> take<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> major<00:00:20.550> scale<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.570> remove

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
you how to take a major scale you remove

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.489 
you how to take a major scale you remove
the<00:00:22.140> fourth<00:00:22.500> step<00:00:22.919> and<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:24.179> get<00:00:24.419> G<00:00:25.259> major

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:25.499 
the fourth step and you get G major

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.040 
the fourth step and you get G major
hexitonic<00:00:26.429> and<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.300> now<00:00:27.539> what<00:00:27.779> I'm<00:00:27.900> going<00:00:27.929> to

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
hexitonic and so now what I'm going to

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.620 
hexitonic and so now what I'm going to
show<00:00:28.259> you<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.679> lick<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.369> utilizes<00:00:29.910> that

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
show you is a lick that utilizes that

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.510 
show you is a lick that utilizes that
sound<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.679> again<00:00:31.919> I'm<00:00:32.070> not<00:00:32.279> necessarily

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
sound so again I'm not necessarily

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.510 
sound so again I'm not necessarily
thinking<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.900> scale<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:35.130> more<00:00:35.310> of<00:00:35.430> a

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
thinking of it as a scale but more of a

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.900 
thinking of it as a scale but more of a
sound<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.270> can<00:00:36.510> dial<00:00:36.810> up<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.890> here's<00:00:38.610> some

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
sound that I can dial up so here's some
