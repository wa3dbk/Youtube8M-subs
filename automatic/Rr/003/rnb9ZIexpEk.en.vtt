 let's install in this is called m 4 the 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.569
 play store 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.750
 The first thing we have to do is press 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.750
 about the market of xiao ming 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.770
 and we are going to look for the application that is 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.690
 necessary for the first time 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.450
 we started the phone will ask us 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.020
 what kind of keyboard will we choose English 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.020
 m 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.970
 and we search the word google 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.250
 like the search engine once they load 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.980
 the results we have the first one that is 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.720
 the one that interests us 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.720
 and we will give you to install 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:53.500
 we can see the bar and also from here 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.360
 of the process to know more or less about 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.970
 what point is it worth and the installation has 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.110
 to finish this button will become 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.110
 green and we can run the application 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.430
 is already installing 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.170
 we throw 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.560
 here we have when I load the list 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.310
 the google apps that we 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.100
 allows to install this application 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.740
 dance 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.729
 the wifi signal is quite far 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.759
 of the phone so sometimes it does not arrive 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.290
 with good ease we search google play 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.460
 which is what interests us in the rest 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.340
 of applications we can install them 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.460
 asks us 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.740
 and that does not rather inform us that 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.310
 requires the google service framework 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.929
 to work press ok and warn us 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.609
 of those applications that will have to 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.069
 install these three are dependencies of 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:50.320
 we give you to install all and 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.970
 continue 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.479
 as it is the first time that we started the 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.180
 phone we do not have to accept 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.920
 the unknown sources the origins 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.720
 unknown therefore software 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.420
 warns us that with the configuration 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.940
 are we can not install it but giving it 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.720
 to the lic band we can install it 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.720
 we can install 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.430
 and be careful because when you finish a 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.490
 installation the filis button that is the one 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.550
 you have to press is just above the 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.580
 cancer of the previous of the following 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.130
 so 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.600
 under my advice is to wait for it 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.310
 all the windows are appearing 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.720
 because that way we can give it if we give it 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.370
 very quickly it is likely that in some 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.360
 of them give us where we owe 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.360
 we give you to install 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.349
 finish 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.349
 I sent him new install 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.380
 and they go 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.730
 all applications are ok 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.840
 installed so 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.840
 on the desk 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:09.459
 we have our reader installed 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.490
 if we press it in some cases it is 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.850
 I wanted to see 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.940
 it closes we give you if this is your case the 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.710
 way 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.130
 we have read several solutions we are going to 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.900
 try first to uninstall we go back to 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.110
 enter the application that we have 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.720
 previously installed 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.850
 and install again 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.850
 and if this does not work also with a 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.700
 restart can be solved 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.560
 in principle in our case with the 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.660
 reinstallation on other phones has 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.660
 operated so we're going to try 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.540
 to see if in this case 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.370
 As you can see, the problem is solved like this 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.200
 that this is all from the guide to 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.239
 able to install the play story station and 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.379
 m4 that has sent us to the people of 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.379
 cheerful buy puntocom
