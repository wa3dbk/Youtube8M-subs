00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 let's put things so rocksteady knew 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.810
 to offer us what remains today 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.339
 still as one of the best 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.390
 Derivatives in video games is known 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.130
 the bald man with both

 first arcana intense games 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.340
 people with missing may 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.320
 to be a great heroic musical theme and 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.120
 finally let's go it's in 2011 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.500
 at the batman arkham city out that roxy 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.910

 hero story maybe about me on 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.390
 something else to lens then warner that a 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.189
 new studio based in montreal either at the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.840
 charge a new batman opus that gets 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.310
 targue we narrated the origins of the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.269
 super hero vaka ancestral techniques 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.050
 rocksteady 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.050
 the bet is he held the question arises 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.610
 release of October 25, 2013 on ps3 360 pc 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.080
 and wii or batman arkam origins it's a 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.250
 eric holmes game of the word rats 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.180
 the prototypes know I will treat 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.410
 majorque in which you play a 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.120
 hero without the personality that makes 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.040
 things without interest happened by 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.090
 ben matiz the man who never has anything 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.140
 product better than some bad 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.370
 persia surf price under good 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.080
 Music christophe to Drake 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.670
 all this is based on the writing of 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.570
 korea but the man from a delay of 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.770
 some young no it was not the 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.300
 strong point as the first assassin's 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.190
 creed or the very forgettable 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.600
 army of two and that makes absolutely sense 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.710
 paul dini does not seem to be writing 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.270
 of history bouzin and so of a 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.400
 incredible weakness of a truly 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.310
 no interest like everything else in the game 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.600
 in love bow celebration exists a weak title 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.729
 which allows to tell the origins 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.930
 of the hero does absolutely nothing they 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.490
 are content truth to propose us 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.530
 to confront some evil figures 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.940
 majors of the universe of bob kane sans 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.140
 great connection between two years after the 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.850
 first appearance of batman gotham 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.710
 with script springs without 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.660
 interest ignoring the promise 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.700
 announced by the institute of the game the 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.990
 narrative very mediocre life bitchy by 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.190
 a breezy round trip week and 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.149
 to experience real construction 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.710
 climax hic 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.090
 the very one that would drive up the 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.340
 tension to keep the player in 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.360
 wake up all in a game that lives 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.530
 months after their release is still 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.970
 strewn with bugs of all kinds 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.920
 revealing even of what is arkham 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.360
 origins a shabby attempt and not 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.740
 finished capitalizing on a license that 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.240
 works the tango rock steady 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.770
 think about the loved ones could not 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.360
 while refusing the project a pen that 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.280
 never did anything else come out of his life 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.260
 that the adaptation wii or the previous 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.670
 opus a studio that happens to be so 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.350
 not made up of the best assets 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.220
 possible 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.870
 narratively who would be drunk 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.709
 of inconsistencies I say batman can 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.209
 do things so if he was 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.170
 unable in previous at most 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.780
 that is happening 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.160
 chronologically after this one take 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.569
 for example the improved grapple that 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.520
 we get in the middle of arkham city 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.810
 here we have it from the very beginning take the 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.760
 detective word that tends to pass 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.590
 batman for a total fool they 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.180
 were not present before or after 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.170
 in history and then the worst in 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.640
 all this is that it's a title that 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.230
 bring nothing and do not even try 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.240
 to bring cauxois from 9 in relation to 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.160
 his gautama predecessors never been 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.750
 also can embody and fade so much she 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.340
 scooped the salt of arkham city the value of 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.319
 pretext of oba the city is filled that 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.300
 less wicked because paul vi 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.920
 is not there the whole thing is boring and the 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.240
 boss remains very unsuccessful with 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.379
 Repetitive boundaries and clashes 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.549
 without inventiveness 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.590
 finally after the exquisite game that was 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.790
 batman arkham asylum arkham city art 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.170
 as origin it seems like a pure 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.209
 unhealthy capitalist attempt to 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.920
 get rich a little safer and rocky and 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.989
 it is crazy enough to say but managed 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.670
 become totally anecdotal after the 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.359
 rigor of arkham asylum she succeeded 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.099
 from arkham city 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.930
 this opus only shows us 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.980
 the inability of amateurs to cut 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.930
 nature is correctly and 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.760
 conscientiously the original creator 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.629
 because do not be mistaken do you 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.909
 look like dadis origin 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.439
 insignificant less good the iteration than 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.060
 50 cent interesting know-how and 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.319
 especially without love he does not even 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.629
 the attraction of developing the characters 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.859
 of batman has come to trivialize as much 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.379
 aero as exciting as 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.430
 bat ben I would be tempted to 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.700
 to say it's a crime 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.700
 still 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.510
 and 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.710
 Furthermore
