curve with an orient on the wrist bone

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.540 
curve with an orient on the wrist bone
here<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.519> can<00:00:15.360> wave

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
editor you need to select your drive

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.779 
editor you need to select your drive
object<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.970> you're<00:00:24.660> driven<00:00:25.230> object<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.640> what

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
the nerve circle then I shift left-click

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.430 
the nerve circle then I shift left-click
on<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.219> bone<00:00:32.640> now<00:00:33.570> I'm<00:00:33.690> going<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.050> go<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
on the bone now I'm going to go to the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.400 
on the bone now I'm going to go to the
connection<00:00:34.920> editor<00:00:35.660> which<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.809> just<00:00:37.079> have<00:00:37.230> here

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
connection editor which I just have here

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.740 
connection editor which I just have here
on<00:00:37.530> my<00:00:37.680> tool<00:00:37.890> shelf<00:00:38.160> but<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.180> can<00:00:39.360> find<00:00:39.570> it

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
on my tool shelf but you can find it

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.010 
on my tool shelf but you can find it
underneath<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:41.239> believe<00:00:42.239> just<00:00:42.600> windows

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
underneath I believe just windows

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.080 
underneath I believe just windows
general<00:00:46.280> connection<00:00:47.280> editor<00:00:47.610> right<00:00:47.789> there

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.639 

alright<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.360> since<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.719> had<00:00:51.930> my<00:00:52.079> selection

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
alright so since I had my selection

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.279 
alright so since I had my selection
correct<00:00:53.149> when<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.180> open<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.780> connection

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
correct when I open up the connection

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.049 
correct when I open up the connection
editor<00:00:55.379> it'll<00:00:55.949> load<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.520> both<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.789> my

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
editor it'll load up both of my

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.910 
editor it'll load up both of my
selections<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:58.079> way<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.230> wanted<00:00:58.620> to

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
selections the way I wanted to

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.670 
selections the way I wanted to
so<00:00:59.399> my<00:00:59.609> driver<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> side<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.140> my

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
so my driver is on the side and my

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.179 
so my driver is on the side and my
driven<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.430> side<00:01:03.080> so<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.500> don't<00:01:05.070> have

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
driven is on this side so I don't have

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.980 
driven is on this side so I don't have
any<00:01:05.430> custom<00:01:05.820> attributes<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.750> guess<00:01:06.900> I

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
any custom attributes for this I guess I

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.440 
any custom attributes for this I guess I
could<00:01:07.110> make<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.409> really<00:01:07.590> fast<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.760> do<00:01:09.270> that

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
could make it really fast so you do that

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.560 
could make it really fast so you do that
by<00:01:09.750> clicking<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.040> control<00:01:11.430> curve<00:01:11.640> going

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
by clicking on the control curve going

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.469 
by clicking on the control curve going
up<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.960> edit<00:01:13.260> add<00:01:13.920> attribute<00:01:14.880> under<00:01:15.330> the

say<00:01:18.770> my<00:01:19.770> at<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:22.460> float<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.700> keyable<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.180> good

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
say my at and float and keyable is good

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.740 
say my at and float and keyable is good
just<00:01:24.720> gonna<00:01:25.020> click<00:01:25.200> OK<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.880> then<00:01:26.880> with<00:01:27.299> the

just gonna click OK and then with the
control<00:01:28.080> curve<00:01:28.229> selected<00:01:28.650> I'm<00:01:28.740> gonna<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
control curve selected I'm gonna like a

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.520 
control curve selected I'm gonna like a
reload<00:01:29.700> left<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:31.560> will<00:01:31.710> reload<00:01:32.130> my<00:01:32.369> act<00:01:33.530> I'm

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530

notice that I click this and then this
so<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.380> actually<00:01:43.799> loads<00:01:44.070> both<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.880> side

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
so it actually loads both on this side

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.539 
so it actually loads both on this side
so<00:01:45.720> at<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.960> top<00:01:46.140> will<00:01:46.350> be<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.829> NURBS<00:01:47.310> circle

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
so at the top will be the NURBS circle

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.170 
so at the top will be the NURBS circle
and<00:01:47.909> if<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.270> scroll<00:01:48.840> down<00:01:49.549> you'll<00:01:50.549> see<00:01:50.640> joint

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
and if you scroll down you'll see joint

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.010 
and if you scroll down you'll see joint
o<00:01:51.329> 9<00:01:51.659> or<00:01:52.020> joint<00:01:52.619> 9<00:01:53.210> joint<00:01:54.210> 9<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.659> what<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:54.869> want

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
o 9 or joint 9 joint 9 is what we want

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.450 
o 9 or joint 9 joint 9 is what we want
to<00:01:55.110> affect<00:01:55.200> we<00:01:55.560> don't<00:01:55.710> want<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.100> our

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
to affect we don't want to have our

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.969 
to affect we don't want to have our
NURBS<00:01:57.060> circle<00:01:57.329> driving<00:01:58.290> another<00:01:58.619> attribute

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
NURBS circle driving another attribute

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.399 
NURBS circle driving another attribute
in<00:01:59.219> our<00:01:59.310> NURBS<00:01:59.700> circle<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.210> would<00:02:00.299> be<00:02:00.450> that'd

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
in our NURBS circle that would be that'd

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.429 
in our NURBS circle that would be that'd
be<00:02:01.500> interesting<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:02.430> say<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.579> least

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
be interesting to say the least

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.330 
be interesting to say the least
alright<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.909> there<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> rotation<00:02:07.340> which

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
alright so there is the rotation which

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.889 
alright so there is the rotation which
way<00:02:08.550> do<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:08.729> want<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.209> go<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.539> want<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.810> to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
way do we want this to go I want it to

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.380 
way do we want this to go I want it to
go<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.170> Z<00:02:10.440> alright<00:02:11.129> so<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.370> have<00:02:11.610> my<00:02:11.670> at<00:02:12.060> and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
go on the Z alright so I have my at and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.880 
go on the Z alright so I have my at and
I'm<00:02:12.930> going<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.200> link<00:02:13.500> it

I'm going to link it

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.070 
I'm going to link it
to<00:02:14.400> rotate<00:02:14.880> Z<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.230> means<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:17.400> when<00:02:17.970> I

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
to rotate Z so that means that when I

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.660 
to rotate Z so that means that when I
scroll<00:02:19.080> this<00:02:19.290> back<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.620> forth<00:02:19.709> like<00:02:20.280> increase

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
scroll this back and forth like increase

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.240 
scroll this back and forth like increase
or<00:02:20.819> decrease<00:02:20.940> its<00:02:21.270> value<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:22.260> will<00:02:22.530> be<00:02:22.590> a

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
or decrease its value it will be a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.610 
or decrease its value it will be a
one-to-one<00:02:23.670> link<00:02:24.150> with<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.750> rotate<00:02:25.200> Z<00:02:25.440> of

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
one-to-one link with the rotate Z of

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.350 
one-to-one link with the rotate Z of
this<00:02:25.770> bone<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.819> can<00:02:26.940> see<00:02:27.120> right<00:02:27.330> here

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
this bone and you can see right here

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.520 
this bone and you can see right here
that<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:28.050> has<00:02:28.290> made<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.650> link<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:30.290> let's<00:02:31.290> see

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
that it has made the link so let's see

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.000 
that it has made the link so let's see
if<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.770> actually<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.490> so<00:02:33.209> I<00:02:33.240> have<00:02:33.570> a<00:02:33.600> little

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
if it actually that so I have a little

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.610 
if it actually that so I have a little
hyper<00:02:35.010> graph<00:02:35.310> connections<00:02:35.880> editor<00:02:36.270> here<00:02:36.620> so

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
hyper graph connections editor here so

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:45.199 
hyper graph connections editor here so
here<00:02:37.800> we<00:02:37.860> go<00:02:40.010> yep<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:43.310> guess<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.700> guess<00:02:45.090> I'll

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
here we go yep I guess I guess I'll

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.120 
here we go yep I guess I guess I'll
explain<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.540> really<00:02:45.750> quickly<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.770> this<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.100> a

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
explain that really quickly so this is a

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.010 
explain that really quickly so this is a
little<00:02:47.370> connection<00:02:47.640> editor<00:02:47.910> for<00:02:48.450> everything

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
little connection editor for everything

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.740 
little connection editor for everything
that<00:02:49.230> is<00:02:49.820> connected<00:02:50.820> with<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.180> object<00:02:51.360> so<00:02:51.630> I

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
that is connected with this object so I

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.290 
that is connected with this object so I
have<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.769> previous<00:02:53.190> bone<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.970> then<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.120> have

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
have the previous bone and then I have

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.810 
have the previous bone and then I have
the<00:02:54.480> bone<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:54.870> this<00:02:55.080> is<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.260> parent<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.310> in

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
the bone that this is a parent of and in

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.460 
the bone that this is a parent of and in
the<00:02:56.910> middle<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.209> have<00:02:57.360> joint<00:02:57.720> one<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.050> then<00:02:58.440> I

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
the middle I have joint one and then I

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.930 
the middle I have joint one and then I
have<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.830> NURBS<00:02:59.040> circle<00:02:59.310> right<00:02:59.519> here<00:02:59.580> which

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
have the NURBS circle right here which

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.390 
have the NURBS circle right here which
is<00:02:59.970> driving<00:03:00.720> one<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.019> attributes<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.709> it

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
is driving one of the attributes and it

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.150 
is driving one of the attributes and it
will<00:03:02.519> tell<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:02.970> right<00:03:03.390> here<00:03:03.959> which<00:03:04.560> attribute

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
will tell you right here which attribute

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.610 
will tell you right here which attribute
it's<00:03:05.340> driving<00:03:06.060> most<00:03:06.239> of<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.420> time<00:03:06.660> but<00:03:07.560> I

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
it's driving most of the time but I

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.030 
it's driving most of the time but I
don't<00:03:07.890> think<00:03:08.040> I've<00:03:08.130> my<00:03:08.459> little<00:03:08.820> popups<00:03:09.180> on<00:03:10.040> all

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
don't think I've my little popups on all

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.780 
don't think I've my little popups on all
right<00:03:11.220> so<00:03:11.400> let's<00:03:11.610> give<00:03:12.120> us<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.269> little<00:03:12.390> test<00:03:13.790> so

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
right so let's give us a little test so

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.530 
right so let's give us a little test so
as<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.269> increase<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:16.560> value<00:03:16.680> goes<00:03:17.640> up<00:03:17.700> they

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
as I increase the value goes up they

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.440 
as I increase the value goes up they
decrease<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.900> value<00:03:19.380> goes<00:03:19.709> down<00:03:20.360> that<00:03:21.360> would

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
decrease the value goes down that would

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.789 
decrease the value goes down that would
be<00:03:21.510> kind<00:03:21.660> of<00:03:21.690> awkward<00:03:21.870> for<00:03:22.079> an<00:03:22.260> animator<00:03:22.620> but

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
be kind of awkward for an animator but

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.199 
be kind of awkward for an animator but
that's<00:03:23.070> that's<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.489> whole<00:03:23.610> other<00:03:23.670> thing<00:03:23.910> with

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
that's that's a whole other thing with

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.060 
that's that's a whole other thing with
joint<00:03:24.540> orientations<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:25.769> won't<00:03:25.950> cover

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
joint orientations and I won't cover

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.069 
joint orientations and I won't cover
that<00:03:26.360> so<00:03:27.360> that<00:03:27.959> is<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.400> quick<00:03:29.400> run<00:03:29.880> over<00:03:30.269> of<00:03:30.540> how

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
that so that is a quick run over of how

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:36.100 
that so that is a quick run over of how
to<00:03:31.140> set<00:03:31.560> up<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:32.180> connection<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:34.280> guess<00:03:35.280> I<00:03:35.430> will

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
to set up a connection I guess I will

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.500 
to set up a connection I guess I will
just<00:03:37.110> do<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.530> couple<00:03:37.769> more<00:03:37.920> just<00:03:38.450> for<00:03:39.450> good

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
just do a couple more just for good

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.479 
just do a couple more just for good
measure<00:03:42.079> so<00:03:43.079> let's<00:03:43.410> create<00:03:43.799> another<00:03:44.280> one

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
measure so let's create another one

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:54.080 
measure so let's create another one
we'll<00:03:45.239> call<00:03:45.450> this<00:03:47.209> mid<00:03:48.209> finger<00:03:50.120> a1<00:03:51.769> add<00:03:53.090> big

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
we'll call this mid finger a1 add big

ad bid finger oh three okay alright so I
have<00:04:06.230> three<00:04:06.530> new<00:04:06.650> attributes<00:04:07.099> I'm<00:04:07.400> going<00:04:07.940> to

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
have three new attributes I'm going to

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.479 
have three new attributes I'm going to
load<00:04:10.280> up<00:04:10.310> those<00:04:11.150> attributes<00:04:12.129> all<00:04:13.129> right<00:04:13.340> and

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
load up those attributes all right and

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.740 
load up those attributes all right and
then<00:04:13.790> I<00:04:13.819> want<00:04:14.150> my<00:04:14.299> middle<00:04:14.750> finger<00:04:16.510> I'll<00:04:17.510> load

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
then I want my middle finger I'll load

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.060 
then I want my middle finger I'll load
that<00:04:18.019> up<00:04:18.049> I'm<00:04:19.010> gonna<00:04:19.100> click<00:04:19.699> this<00:04:20.620> and<00:04:21.620> you

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
that up I'm gonna click this and you

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.360 
that up I'm gonna click this and you
notice<00:04:22.340> that<00:04:22.370> this<00:04:22.699> shifted<00:04:23.120> so<00:04:24.370> what

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
notice that this shifted so what

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.670 
notice that this shifted so what
happened<00:04:25.699> when<00:04:25.880> I<00:04:25.910> clicked<00:04:26.300> this<00:04:27.169> attribute

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
happened when I clicked this attribute

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.010 
happened when I clicked this attribute
is<00:04:27.889> that<00:04:27.949> I<00:04:28.400> had<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:28.940> NURBS<00:04:29.150> circle<00:04:29.419> and<00:04:29.720> the

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
is that I had the NURBS circle and the

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.990 
is that I had the NURBS circle and the
joint<00:04:30.260> loaded<00:04:30.590> on<00:04:30.680> this<00:04:30.889> side<00:04:31.100> and<00:04:31.370> when<00:04:31.970> I

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
joint loaded on this side and when I

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.379 
joint loaded on this side and when I
click<00:04:32.300> this<00:04:32.479> it<00:04:33.080> just<00:04:33.280> shifted<00:04:34.280> away<00:04:34.400> all<00:04:34.880> the

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
click this it just shifted away all the

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.469 
click this it just shifted away all the
NURBS<00:04:35.600> curve<00:04:35.870> stuff<00:04:36.199> so<00:04:36.470> just<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:37.070> joints

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
NURBS curve stuff so just the joints

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.090 
NURBS curve stuff so just the joints
attributes<00:04:38.479> were<00:04:38.600> here<00:04:38.840> so<00:04:39.590> if<00:04:39.710> I<00:04:39.800> scroll<00:04:40.010> up

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
attributes were here so if I scroll up
