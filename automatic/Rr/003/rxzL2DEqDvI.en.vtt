00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.880
 and hi to all and axel of tests 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.240
 mobile.fr we are at las vegas and 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.059
 I have in hand the lenovo at 859 that a 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.180
 device that a 5 inch 1280 screen by 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.390
 720 an 8 megapixel camera to 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.910
 the rear 1.6 in the front is a 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.609
 media library quad core with 3 giguÃ¨re 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.500
 this is a bet under android 4.2.2 jelly 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.250
 bean for now and that makes 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.570
 just 9.2 mm thick so this 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.309
 which is interesting is carnivorous and 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.489
 yeah and besides it's dual sim 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.870
 this is not insignificant what 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.170
 is to note that it is a device 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.690
 which is not very expensive 219 dollars so 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.730
 under 200 euros and that is available 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.870
 since january 2014 so that's 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.870
 now what is he doing 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.489
 go out I do not know the markets do not 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.199
 do not know if he arrives in France would 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.879
 that lenovo usually in France for 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.140
 the moment we do not see them very much and 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.280
 it's too bad because it's 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.050
 terminals that are often very 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.930
 interesting we have a lot of plastic 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.940
 but with finishes that are that which me 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.040
 seems rather successful 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.250
 so there for example here we are at the camera 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.340
 frontal in the front the keys here on 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.880
 the bar a little design like that with a 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.460
 angle that goes down that way on 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.009
 the right one has the volume knob of 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.500
 lock unlock right here I 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:32.180
 zoome is a little bit 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.180
 the jack 3.5 nothing on the left 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:40.520
 here we go to the camera the flash 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.869
 led the micro usb speaker 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.720
 we will quickly turn on the interface 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.070
 to see finally good it's the same as if 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.380
 you have a look at our video of the lease 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.150
 if we are on something very, very 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.830
 very close 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.270
 so here we see there an interface a 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.509
 little bit as we have it i'm sure and 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.250
 motion yoyo and huawei we really 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.979
 something we do not already have we have not 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.899
 of applications menu and we have some 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.670
 thing that is pretty uncluttered but that is 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.200
 aesthetic I like a lot I like 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.630
 a lot the rendering there for example we have 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.250
 round corners ten years to the kind of 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.770
 little trick that's it can not details 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.560
 but I think it does not really 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.540
 well there is ahead of google now google 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.400
 search 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.280
 there we can open quickly so it's 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.910
 what's that hd I was gonna freak out so this 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.330
 and docks 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.920
 any 9th naples clause ok okay that 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.750
 it's the menu of applications all 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.920
 just finally multitasking that's it 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.330
 can quickly close applications 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.900
 that way we have the keyboard 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.950
 and here I think so here he is using the 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.950
 default android keyboard 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.580
 I see if we have another keyboard not 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.290
 available here is not this about 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.370
 there is not much to say so 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.690
 devices anyway we go to 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.340
 priori he will be able to test this 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.340
 really more out of curiosity I want 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.240
 to say and I still like it 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.180
 that they do that in saran it's okay 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:09.680
 typically interfaces like that 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.810
 it's clean what finally short that's it 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.820
 it says for a quick overview on the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:19.060
 lenovo at 859 at the 6th las vegas in 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.060
 soon
