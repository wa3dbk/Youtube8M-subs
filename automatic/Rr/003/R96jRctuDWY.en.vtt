00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hi all the guys are z uil hicks 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.609
 today they are small, type a nikon 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.120
 rooster or how to go north of acton 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.370
 or the snowy area that you find at 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.320
 first mission and enter his bank 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.460
 always that of the first mission su 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.369
 online trips 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.260
 obviously in this area you can find 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.600
 also the cemetery that I am not a 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.480
 explain what it is because otherwise later 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.789
 spoiler people tell me you spoilers 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.650
 having said the story this is what I say 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.650
 only that there is also that cemetery 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.420
 that many of you think 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.540
 let's start right away with the match first 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.540
 what will you have to start the very first 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.879
 mission to match the mission 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.340
 main and prologue once this is done 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.230
 you will have to be part of the mission e 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.750
 you will have to play that mission up to 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.670
 that you will not leave the bank while you 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.699
 you are doing this your friend 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.320
 will have to create an invitation only session ed 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.579
 obviously expect you until you do 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.370
 would have left the bank 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.230
 when you are out of the bank then vi 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.570
 have invites into the session 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.670
 only invitations and if you want that also lost 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.990
 load this map will have to do the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.460
 same thing him 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.540
 but you will have to wait for it in the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.930
 session that he lived there 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.430
 practically invites you to enter later 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.320
 he leaves the game 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.900
 you are always a session where you are 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.430
 invited expect it, invite e 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.670
 so both of you will have the map 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.890
 loaded I then ok of course not 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.479
 I showed it completely 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.009
 process so I only tell you 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.860
 also because it would have been 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.810
 useless it seems to me a simple thing 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.350
 so once you are all ready 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.060
 and two 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.340
 all three all four etc. 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.840
 etc. to take a helicopter is the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.820
 easiest way is to call 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.590
 but the web to ask for a lift 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.460
 in helicopter it is therefore to kill the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.759
 driver driving 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.060
 the helicopter and then did this 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.820
 you will have to open less than break then go 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.210
 in the map issue an indicator in 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.439
 bottom right bottom bottom in 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.000
 lower right 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.159
 you see it anyway even in the video where 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.090
 place the map marker one 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.250
 once you have positioned the indicator 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.289
 follow it follow on the radar and in 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.629
 distance if you see textures 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.420
 strange you did correctly i 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.220
 glitch 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.739
 and you obviously went to meet 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.349
 these textures meet these 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.739
 texture you obviously got into these 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.080
 texture without problems and going again 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.500
 forward beyond the textures you should see 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.330
 a kind of snowy town e 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.430
 the one north of anton 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.190
 as for the glitch 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.530
 of the bank you must go north of north 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.510
 trento novero of the citizen really the 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.900
 direction you went with this 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.900
 click 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.040
 following a kind of desolate road 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.080
 you doors this will take you to three buildings 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.130
 attacked one high one low middle and 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.530
 that will be the bank anyway 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.780
 it is a bit distant indeed as you see 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.420
 had to speed up video so not 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.019
 let go in the path because sooner or later 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.049
 appear these three buildings is a 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.450
 Once you are this bank you should 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.430
 find a garage door with 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.730
 written keep clear you pass it 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.230
 without problems there is no sight done 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.750
 to pass as if it were a 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.920
 object is visible then once that 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.070
 you are inside 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.650
 you have to go right up into a 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.530
 corner and call someone to make you 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.690
 give an activity when it arrives 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.730
 when the activity will appear you have it 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.690
 started and once exits started 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.570
 immediately start and then exit e 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.959
 so you should appear in there 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.910
 bank 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.230
 having said that if you go and have a look 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.060
 to the links channel and I found it in 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.440
 description left i like c1 la 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.239
 our mind two seconds to click that 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.980
 blue button let me also like the 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.870
 facebook page you can always find it 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.280
 in description how you go if you have 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.230
 required dubious questions I will try to

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.069
