been it's you know the biggest college
it's<00:00:40.040> a<00:00:40.100> lot<00:00:40.280> of<00:00:40.340> people<00:00:40.670> I<00:00:40.910> mean<00:00:41.180> here<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:41.809> one

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
it's a lot of people I mean here the one

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.360 
it's a lot of people I mean here the one
hot<00:00:42.230> plans<00:00:42.470> I<00:00:42.650> still<00:00:42.830> feel<00:00:43.040> like<00:00:43.070> I<00:00:43.190> may<00:00:43.340> have

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
hot plans I still feel like I may have

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.670

made met some really great people and I

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.890 
made met some really great people and I
also<00:00:45.830> think<00:00:46.010> Trinity<00:00:46.360> doesn't<00:00:47.360> always<00:00:47.510> feel

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
also think Trinity doesn't always feel

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.310 
also think Trinity doesn't always feel
as<00:00:48.379> big<00:00:49.309> as<00:00:49.430> it<00:00:49.550> is<00:00:49.690> that<00:00:50.690> it's<00:00:50.870> done<00:00:51.050> it's

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
as big as it is that it's done it's

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.140 
as big as it is that it's done it's
obviously<00:00:51.710> got<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:51.920> well<00:00:52.850> one<00:00:53.000> of<00:00:53.089> the

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
obviously got the well one of the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.610 
obviously got the well one of the
biggest<00:00:53.330> number<00:00:53.839> of<00:00:53.900> undergraduate<00:00:54.230> so<00:00:54.500> it

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
biggest number of undergraduate so it

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.049 
biggest number of undergraduate so it
really<00:00:54.800> doesn't<00:00:55.040> feel<00:00:55.070> like<00:00:55.280> that<00:00:55.430> it's<00:00:55.970> a

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
really doesn't feel like that it's a

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.970 
really doesn't feel like that it's a
really<00:00:56.360> easy<00:00:56.600> place<00:00:56.930> to<00:00:57.260> make<00:00:57.410> friends<00:00:57.440> and

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
great about Trinity is that it's quite a

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.280 
great about Trinity is that it's quite a
big<00:01:22.640> year<00:01:22.790> group<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:23.810> can<00:01:23.960> really<00:01:24.170> get

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
big year group and so you can really get

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.950 
big year group and so you can really get

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
to know lots of people and Trinity is

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.450

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.400 
also very international which is great
then<00:01:28.940> I<00:01:29.030> decided<00:01:29.360> on<00:01:29.570> Trinity<00:01:29.750> ultimately

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
then I decided on Trinity ultimately

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.990 
then I decided on Trinity ultimately
because<00:01:30.770> it's<00:01:30.920> one<00:01:31.100> of<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.280> largest<00:01:31.550> colleges

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
because it's one of the largest colleges

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.940 
because it's one of the largest colleges
as<00:01:32.150> well<00:01:32.180> as<00:01:32.390> it<00:01:32.600> attracts<00:01:32.930> a<00:01:33.110> substantial

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
as well as it attracts a substantial

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.530 
as well as it attracts a substantial
amount<00:01:34.190> of<00:01:34.370> international<00:01:34.940> students<00:01:35.330> and<00:01:35.420> so

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
amount of international students and so

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.870 
amount of international students and so
I<00:01:35.570> wanted<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:36.020> feel<00:01:36.680> that<00:01:36.920> you<00:01:37.430> know<00:01:37.550> there

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
I wanted to feel that you know there

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.980 
I wanted to feel that you know there
would<00:01:38.060> be<00:01:38.090> a<00:01:38.210> lot<00:01:38.420> of<00:01:38.480> people<00:01:38.660> that<00:01:38.720> I<00:01:38.780> would<00:01:38.840> be

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
would be a lot of people that I would be

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.780 
would be a lot of people that I would be
able<00:01:39.050> to<00:01:39.170> relate<00:01:39.410> to<00:01:39.590> but<00:01:40.100> definitely<00:01:40.580> in

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
able to relate to but definitely in

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.240
