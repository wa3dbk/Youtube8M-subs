25-percent down to twenty percent and be

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.670 
25-percent down to twenty percent and be
able<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.090> better<00:01:15.420> rate<00:01:15.780> instead<00:01:16.500> of

able to get a better rate instead of

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.140 
able to get a better rate instead of
four<00:01:16.890> percent<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.369> probably<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.820> able<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.000> get

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
four percent you probably be able to get

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.050 
four percent you probably be able to get
2.8<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.080> 2.9<00:01:19.650> somewhere<00:01:20.640> around<00:01:20.729> that

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
2.8 to 2.9 somewhere around that

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.450 
2.8 to 2.9 somewhere around that
ballpark<00:01:21.530> which<00:01:22.530> makes<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.860> property<00:01:23.280> even

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
ballpark which makes this property even

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.070 
ballpark which makes this property even
better<00:01:23.759> because<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.210> cash<00:01:24.360> flow<00:01:24.390> situation

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
better because your cash flow situation

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.870 
better because your cash flow situation
increases<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.340> that's<00:01:26.520> one<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> things

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
increases so that's one of the things

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.980 
increases so that's one of the things
that<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.420> keep<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.720> mind<00:01:27.869> when

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
that you have to keep in mind when

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.330 
that you have to keep in mind when
you're<00:01:28.080> looking<00:01:28.350> at<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> analyses<00:01:29.070> take<00:01:29.310> a

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
you're looking at the analyses take a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.499 
you're looking at the analyses take a
look<00:01:29.549> at<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.729> numbers<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.090> see<00:01:30.329> if<00:01:30.420> it

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
look at the numbers and see if it

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.810 
look at the numbers and see if it
actually<00:01:30.540> makes<00:01:30.990> sense<00:01:31.259> for<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.700> looking<00:01:32.700> at

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
actually makes sense for you looking at

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.270 
actually makes sense for you looking at
the<00:01:33.030> expense<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.750> swear<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.380> expense<00:01:35.070> side

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
the expense I swear this is expense side

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.300 
the expense I swear this is expense side
first<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.270> for<00:01:36.390> 2012<00:01:37.079> taxes<00:01:37.590> 4785

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
first this is for 2012 taxes 4785

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.060 
first this is for 2012 taxes 4785
insurance<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.270> 21<00:01:39.659> 15<00:01:40.110> which<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.710> little<00:01:40.890> bit

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
insurance is 21 15 which is a little bit

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.289 
insurance is 21 15 which is a little bit
low<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:41.220> these<00:01:41.549> are<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.790> numbers<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.090> are

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
low but these are the numbers that are

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.539 
low but these are the numbers that are
provided<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:42.869> I'm<00:01:42.960> basing<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.770> gas<00:01:44.490> is

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
provided so I'm basing it on that gas is

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.200 
provided so I'm basing it on that gas is
21<00:01:45.119> hundred<00:01:45.210> dollars<00:01:45.689> water<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.140> 1100<00:01:46.890> and

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
21 hundred dollars water is 1100 and

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.280 
21 hundred dollars water is 1100 and
hydro<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.420> saying<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.720> separately<00:01:49.049> metered

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
hydro it's saying is separately metered

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.039 
hydro it's saying is separately metered
then<00:01:49.979> specify<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.490> actually<00:01:50.939> if<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.450> tenants

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
then specify it actually if the tenants

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.450 
then specify it actually if the tenants
are<00:01:52.140> actually<00:01:52.409> paying<00:01:52.619> for<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.009> or<00:01:53.100> not<00:01:53.250> but

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
are actually paying for it or not but

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.460 
are actually paying for it or not but
it's<00:01:53.670> zero<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.210> I'm<00:01:54.299> assuming<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:55.079> tenants

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
it's zero so I'm assuming the tenants

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.899 
it's zero so I'm assuming the tenants
are<00:01:55.560> paying<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:55.950> their<00:01:56.070> own<00:01:56.100> hydro<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:56.790> you

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
are paying for their own hydro so you

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.550 
are paying for their own hydro so you
have<00:01:57.030> three<00:01:57.329> meters<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.750> each<00:01:57.869> building<00:01:58.259> on

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
have three meters on each building on

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.679 
have three meters on each building on
the<00:01:59.100> income<00:01:59.369> side<00:01:59.579> there<00:02:00.119> are<00:02:00.240> two<00:02:00.390> upper

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
the income side there are two upper

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.219 
the income side there are two upper
levels<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.799> one<00:02:01.950> bedrooms<00:02:02.310> up<00:02:02.460> top<00:02:03.329> both

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229
