first way that many people would first
taking<00:00:21.510> they<00:00:21.600> mean<00:00:21.720> can<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:21.900> use<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.410> cedar

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
taking they mean can we use the cedar

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.870 
taking they mean can we use the cedar
and<00:00:22.859> key<00:00:23.100> will<00:00:23.880> be<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.090> open<00:00:24.480> their<00:00:24.869> minds<00:00:25.199> eye

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
and key will be to open their minds eye

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.060 
and key will be to open their minds eye
or<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.939> third<00:00:27.300> eye

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
or a third eye

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.700 
or a third eye
it's<00:00:29.490> very<00:00:29.640> common<00:00:31.880> but<00:00:33.320> most<00:00:34.320> people<00:00:34.559> want

it's very common but most people want
their<00:00:35.010> they<00:00:35.160> want<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> make<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> keep<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:35.910> when

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
their they want to make a keep on when

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.610 
their they want to make a keep on when
you<00:00:36.329> write<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.750> air<00:00:36.840> visible<00:00:37.230> world<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.440> didn't

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
you write the air visible world I didn't

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.990 
you write the air visible world I didn't
have<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.860> use<00:00:37.980> your<00:00:38.129> mind<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.550> would<00:00:38.640> be<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.879> see

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
have to use your mind it would be to see

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.060 
have to use your mind it would be to see
for<00:00:39.180> themselves<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.780> for<00:00:40.530> other<00:00:40.710> kid<00:00:40.920> we've

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
for themselves and for other kid we've

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.060 
for themselves and for other kid we've
seen<00:00:41.899> so<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.100> simply<00:00:44.149> now<00:00:45.800> make<00:00:46.800> them<00:00:46.920> keep

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
seen so you simply now make them keep

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.439 
seen so you simply now make them keep
off<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.460> visible<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.420> very<00:00:48.930> difficult<00:00:50.449> for

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
off this visible is very difficult for

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.270 
off this visible is very difficult for
some<00:00:51.780> what<00:00:52.079> also<00:00:52.320> depends<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.739> your<00:00:52.860> training

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
some what also depends on your training

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.049 
some what also depends on your training
and<00:00:53.969> I'll<00:00:54.090> get<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.420> leader<00:00:55.760> so<00:00:57.140> I<00:00:59.059> just

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
and I'll get to that leader so I just

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.170 
and I'll get to that leader so I just
want<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.300> say<00:01:00.420> one<00:01:00.870> thing<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.260> morning<00:01:02.180> like

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
want to say one thing is a morning like

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.090 
want to say one thing is a morning like
when<00:01:03.449> when<00:01:03.719> using<00:01:04.110> attainment<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.769> got<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.040> be

when when using attainment you got to be

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.830 
when when using attainment you got to be
careful<00:01:05.280> because<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:06.000> mess<00:01:06.630> up<00:01:06.659> your

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
step spinning very fast that can speed

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.800 
step spinning very fast that can speed
frankly<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.670> fast<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.119> only<00:01:30.210> feel<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.659> it's

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
frankly so fast it only feel like it's

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.249 
frankly so fast it only feel like it's
moving<00:01:31.759> it<00:01:32.759> has<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.150> visualization<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.140> your

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
moving it has that visualization in your

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.410 
moving it has that visualization in your
head<00:01:34.500> headed<00:01:34.920> animation<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.549> name<00:01:35.759> your<00:01:36.210> mind

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
head headed animation you name your mind

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.859 
head headed animation you name your mind
once<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.290> have<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.700> then<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.740> want<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:41.869> have

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
once you have that then you want to have

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:43.630 
once you have that then you want to have
the<00:01:42.990> energy

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
the energy

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.690 
the energy
snap<00:01:44.640> into<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.570> loop<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.890> key<00:01:47.070> ball<00:01:47.280> to

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
snap into the loop of the key ball to

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.539 
snap into the loop of the key ball to
one<00:01:47.880> little<00:01:48.000> tiny<00:01:48.240> die<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.750> explode<00:01:49.460> and<00:01:50.460> you

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
one little tiny die and explode and you

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.580 
one little tiny die and explode and you
also<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> visual<00:01:51.479> visually<00:01:52.229> see<00:01:52.439> this

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
also have the visual visually see this

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.980 
also have the visual visually see this
in<00:01:52.710> your<00:01:52.799> mind<00:01:53.009> for<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.850> actually<00:01:54.090> work<00:01:54.270> and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
in your mind for to actually work and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.690 
in your mind for to actually work and
what<00:01:55.049> progress<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.979> will<00:01:56.009> actually<00:01:56.340> see<00:01:56.670> a

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
what progress you will actually see a

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.180 
what progress you will actually see a
spark<00:01:57.090> or<00:01:57.270> some<00:01:57.479> or

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
spark or some or

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.950 
spark or some or
glowing<00:01:59.190> mist<00:01:59.520> or<00:01:59.910> whatever<00:02:00.390> whatever<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
glowing mist or whatever whatever the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.140 
glowing mist or whatever whatever the
coding<00:02:01.290> key<00:02:01.440> is<00:02:01.620> where<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.430> see<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.760> happen

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
coding key is where you see that happen

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.120 
coding key is where you see that happen
that's<00:02:03.960> one<00:02:04.230> technique<00:02:06.500> there's<00:02:07.500> another<00:02:07.860> one

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
that's one technique there's another one

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.600 
that's one technique there's another one
that<00:02:08.970> involves<00:02:09.590> making<00:02:10.590> several<00:02:11.310> layers

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
that involves making several layers

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.450 
that involves making several layers
let's<00:02:12.330> say<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.540> have<00:02:12.720> five<00:02:12.960> layers<00:02:13.340> yeah

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
let's say I have five layers yeah

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.520 
let's say I have five layers yeah
the<00:02:15.030> core<00:02:17.330> first<00:02:18.330> are<00:02:18.480> we<00:02:18.600> our<00:02:18.900> outer<00:02:19.260> layer<00:02:19.500> is

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
the core first are we our outer layer is

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.580 
the core first are we our outer layer is
second<00:02:20.040> elder<00:02:20.220> layering<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.610> third<00:02:20.820> hour<00:02:21.000> later

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
second elder layering a third hour later

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.700 
second elder layering a third hour later
your<00:02:22.590> fourth<00:02:23.100> outer<00:02:23.400> layer<00:02:23.700> it's<00:02:24.390> this<00:02:24.710> now

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
your fourth outer layer it's this now

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.090 
your fourth outer layer it's this now
the<00:02:26.340> trick<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.670> flaring<00:02:27.230> like<00:02:28.230> whether<00:02:28.560> the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
the trick to flaring like whether the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.060 
the trick to flaring like whether the
layers<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.550> that<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:31.020> smaller<00:02:31.380> layer<00:02:31.740> the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
layers of that the smaller layer the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.600 
layers of that the smaller layer the
faster<00:02:32.520> is<00:02:32.640> spin<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.200> core<00:02:34.650> just<00:02:35.430> like<00:02:35.520> I

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
faster is spin so the core just like I

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.740 
faster is spin so the core just like I
said<00:02:35.760> first<00:02:36.030> thing<00:02:36.210> that<00:02:36.330> you<00:02:36.390> want<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
said first thing that you want the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.050 
said first thing that you want the
quarters<00:02:37.050> spin<00:02:37.710> so<00:02:37.860> fast<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:38.430> seem<00:02:38.640> like<00:02:38.760> it's

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
quarters spin so fast to seem like it's

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.820 
quarters spin so fast to seem like it's
not<00:02:39.150> spinning<00:02:39.480> at<00:02:39.660> all<00:02:39.810> therefore<00:02:40.530> secondly

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
not spinning at all therefore secondly

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.800 
not spinning at all therefore secondly
spend<00:02:41.340> almost<00:02:41.490> as<00:02:41.760> fast<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.360> third<00:02:42.570> almost

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
spend almost as fast and a third almost

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.540 
spend almost as fast and a third almost
as<00:02:43.020> fast<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.830> forth

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
as fast and forth

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.450 
as fast and forth
fast<00:02:45.150> but<00:02:45.360> not<00:02:45.420> too<00:02:45.570> fast<00:02:46.200> in<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.800> fifth<00:02:47.040> bad

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
fast but not too fast in the fifth bad

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.420 
fast but not too fast in the fifth bad
or<00:02:47.760> slow<00:02:48.030> but<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.560> haven't<00:02:49.920> spent<00:02:50.160> different

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
or slow but it haven't spent different

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.580 
or slow but it haven't spent different
directions<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:53.250> then<00:02:53.370> as<00:02:53.490> you<00:02:53.580> do<00:02:53.730> that

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
directions and then as you do that

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.470 
directions and then as you do that
visualize<00:02:55.590> their<00:02:55.860> keep<00:02:56.040> while<00:02:56.220> going<00:02:56.490> it<00:02:57.330> is

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
visualize their keep while going it is

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.750 
visualize their keep while going it is
in<00:02:57.600> your<00:02:57.720> mind<00:02:57.960> see<00:02:58.740> a<00:02:58.770> glow<00:02:59.100> or<00:02:59.130> spark<00:02:59.670> the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
in your mind see a glow or spark the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.270 
in your mind see a glow or spark the
color<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.270> wish<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.860> then<00:03:01.860> we're<00:03:02.040> not

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
color that you wish and then we're not

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.840 
color that you wish and then we're not
training<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:04.110> are<00:03:04.380> have<00:03:05.190> one<00:03:05.459> keyboard

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
training you you are have one keyboard

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.620 
training you you are have one keyboard
or<00:03:05.940> sparkling<00:03:06.270> energy<00:03:06.810> ball<00:03:07.400> now<00:03:08.400> those<00:03:09.360> are

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
or sparkling energy ball now those are

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.120 
or sparkling energy ball now those are
two<00:03:09.810> techniques<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.440> make<00:03:10.590> your<00:03:10.650> keyboard

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
two techniques to make your keyboard

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.880 
two techniques to make your keyboard
visible<00:03:11.610> but<00:03:12.480> one<00:03:13.230> thing<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.560> will<00:03:13.620> really

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
visible but one thing I will really

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.020 
visible but one thing I will really
recommend<00:03:14.370> if<00:03:14.520> you're<00:03:14.640> really<00:03:14.730> going<00:03:14.910> to

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
recommend if you're really going to

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.580 
recommend if you're really going to
enter<00:03:15.209> your<00:03:15.360> visible<00:03:15.690> let's<00:03:16.170> go<00:03:16.380> take

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
enter your visible let's go take

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.070 
enter your visible let's go take
patience<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.130> practice<00:03:17.250> but<00:03:17.610> hey<00:03:17.780> because<00:03:18.780> I

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
patience and practice but hey because I

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.750 
patience and practice but hey because I
don't<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.680> thing<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.040> would<00:03:20.220> say<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.489> just

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
don't the thing I would say is just

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.160 
don't the thing I would say is just
practice<00:03:21.420> key

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
practice key

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.620 
practice key
constantly<00:03:23.070> that's<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.520> you<00:03:24.060> know<00:03:24.150> add-on

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
constantly that's it you know add-on

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.199 
constantly that's it you know add-on
technique<00:03:25.080> because<00:03:25.680> that's<00:03:25.950> most<00:03:26.940> people

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
technique because that's most people

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.610 
technique because that's most people
want<00:03:27.360> they<00:03:27.450> want<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.630> find<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.900> simple<00:03:28.230> way<00:03:28.350> to

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
want they want to find a simple way to

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.560 
want they want to find a simple way to
make<00:03:29.010> their<00:03:29.190> energy<00:03:29.520> visible<00:03:29.910> so<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.090> can<00:03:30.420> see

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
make their energy visible so you can see

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.949 
make their energy visible so you can see
a<00:03:30.600> sonic<00:03:30.780> see<00:03:31.020> for<00:03:31.200> yourselves

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
a sonic see for yourselves

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.880 
a sonic see for yourselves
did<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:34.020> say<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.260> best<00:03:34.440> thing<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.860> best

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
did I say the best thing the best

did I say the best thing the best
technique<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.700> lick<00:03:36.330> your<00:03:36.420> invisible<00:03:36.959> is<00:03:37.050> to

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
technique to lick your invisible is to

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.470 
technique to lick your invisible is to
properly<00:03:37.590> train<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:38.550> once<00:03:38.760> every<00:03:39.150> time<00:03:39.330> you

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
properly train and once every time you

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.199 
properly train and once every time you
practice<00:03:39.690> key<00:03:40.110> your<00:03:41.040> energy<00:03:41.430> level<00:03:41.700> increases

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
practice key your energy level increases

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.340 
practice key your energy level increases
every<00:03:43.020> time

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.610 

just<00:03:46.070> really<00:03:46.190> doing<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.640> my<00:03:46.850> energy<00:03:47.120> increases

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
just really doing it my energy increases

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.470 
just really doing it my energy increases
making<00:03:48.620> a<00:03:48.680> cue<00:03:48.860> ball<00:03:48.890> so<00:03:49.640> I'm<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:49.820> tiny<00:03:50.030> practice

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
making a cue ball so I'm a tiny practice

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.030 
making a cue ball so I'm a tiny practice
increase<00:03:51.380> your<00:03:51.590> kilo<00:03:51.860> so<00:03:52.210> that's<00:03:53.210> it<00:03:53.450> really

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
increase your kilo so that's it really

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.220 
increase your kilo so that's it really
surprises<00:03:55.420> if<00:03:56.420> you<00:03:56.540> don't<00:03:56.720> break<00:03:56.870> this<00:03:57.050> you

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
surprises if you don't break this you

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.010 
surprises if you don't break this you
won't<00:03:57.440> get<00:03:57.590> there<00:03:57.740> so<00:03:58.450> until<00:03:59.450> next<00:03:59.600> time<00:03:59.720> guys

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
won't get there so until next time guys
