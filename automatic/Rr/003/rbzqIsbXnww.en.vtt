00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello people welcome on a canal 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.780
 You see, there is a new video this time 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.400
 with information about sims 4 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.320
 So what can we learn from sims we wait 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.410
 first the general things we do 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.199
 must have heard already stood 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.720
 now the emotions in the foreground yes 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.519
 I'll talk more about that later 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.990
 enter 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.269
 Also, your sims will be several things 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.179
 at the same time, for example 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.730
 Talking at the dinner table and at the same time 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.770
 eat and thus they have less 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.239
 hunger and your social social desire 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.460
 Goes down a bit, too, yes then 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.770
 it will be remembered that is 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.079
 your sims will be old times 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.250
 can remember back and then yourself 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:54.090
 be happy or sad or just like that 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.170
 what kind of innovation for trading 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.059
 So how you can create your sims 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:05.610
 it will now be left and right-handed 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.409
 there you can adjust you will 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.830
 the sims have worked in detail 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.600
 can 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.979
 that means you become single 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.810
 enter body parts 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.100
 the old slider will not work 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.100
 give more that means for example can 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.299
 make your shoulders wider so you 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.030
 click on the shoulders then she does 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.869
 wider or deform your nose 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.979
 that will all go individually now 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.570
 You can also get the hairstyles and 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.189
 Combining headgear means you 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.380
 not only have and hat and could 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.689
 no longer see the hairstyle but her 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.170
 can also sit in Vienna so that 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.509
 you also take the hairstyle with you 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.189
 there will be more opportunities yours 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.700
 to change the voice is already the 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.740
 Sims 3 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.390
 a couple of options for that 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.829
 different voices but now it will 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.680
 even more variable also designed a 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.450
 another innovation in creative is the 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.610
 So his gait you can adjust 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.159
 as you go 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.729
 So we came to the construction mode of the construction mode 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.979
 according to mexes has been greatly revised her 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.450
 should now be able to turn whole rooms 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.700
 So if you create space then you can 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.500
 you turn that and everything in there is 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.110
 equal to 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.460
 So what if your chair and one 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.230
 then you have to turn the table in the room 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.710
 with you and you can place that 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.810
 where you want it will now be three 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.330
 be possible three floors plus roof 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.340
 to build a total of four floors 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.320
 and between the floors so if 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.020
 for example, on the first floor 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.120
 then have the lights in the 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.540
 Ground floor was a fall so far 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.100
 so that he is eg at a staircase or something 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.600
 so far it was that way a kind 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.310
 invisible wall depends that is if 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.170
 you had lights on the first floor 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.730
 Her on the ground floor was still there 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.489
 everything dark and have now 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:53.160
 can also improve finished 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:54.780
 be placed that was it 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.780
 actually come first to the construction mode 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.330
 we became emotions in the emotions 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.840
 as I said, as I said a very 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.310
 take a much bigger role so the 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.660
 So far there was not and 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.500
 this one really big now 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.060
 role-play 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.420
 So you really have to be careful 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.660
 Pay attention that the sims really are with theirs 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.549
 Emotions get along for example when 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.030
 you two German fabric on hang 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.170
 the Wall 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.720
 then your sims get pleasure to do so 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.190
 flirt or something like that or when 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.100
 sad pictures hanging on the wall or 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.570
 Somehow such tragic music then runs 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.239
 they will be so depressed or too 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.030
 similar and until then is still 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:40.350
 not too much to take care of emotions 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:43.079
 So this technology is known that 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.480
 smart sim is regulated with the emotions 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:48.600
 so called by this 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.110
 smartphone will make the sims smarter 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:56.820
 than ever before 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.769
 that at least according to mexes and this 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.480
 Emotions refer to whole lives 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.350
 that is, if you dare in childhood 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.079
 I'll wait or something like that 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:09.650
 the later you will become the later 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:12.079
 consequences therefore see the consequences 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.450
 I hope you liked it and we did 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:16.450
 See you next time 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.450
 ciao
