00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
camera skills you can clearly tell I did

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.609 
camera skills you can clearly tell I did
not<00:00:12.870> do<00:00:13.080> so<00:00:13.259> well<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.559> TV<00:00:13.830> production<00:00:15.260> in<00:00:16.260> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
not do so well in TV production in the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.220 
not do so well in TV production in the
camera<00:00:16.920> location<00:00:17.490> area<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.880> did<00:00:18.060> fine<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.660> yeah

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
camera location area I did fine and yeah

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.700 
camera location area I did fine and yeah
that's<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:19.830> move<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.210> just<00:00:21.210> take<00:00:21.510> forever<00:00:21.779> ok

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710

basically<00:00:23.550> as<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:24.029> can<00:00:24.150> see<00:00:24.330> i<00:00:24.570> have<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:25.140> Kimbo

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
basically as you can see i have a Kimbo

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.349 
basically as you can see i have a Kimbo
I<00:00:25.859> mean<00:00:26.099> dual<00:00:26.699> monitors<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:29.000> basically<00:00:30.000> if

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
I mean dual monitors and basically if

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.820 
I mean dual monitors and basically if
you<00:00:30.510> don't<00:00:30.689> know<00:00:30.779> what<00:00:30.900> dual<00:00:31.080> monitors<00:00:31.560> do

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
you don't know what dual monitors do

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.760 
you don't know what dual monitors do
they<00:00:32.040> let<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.279> do<00:00:32.489> cool<00:00:32.820> things<00:00:32.850> like<00:00:33.739> have<00:00:34.739> a

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
they let you do cool things like have a

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.720 
they let you do cool things like have a
window<00:00:35.250> open<00:00:35.640> over<00:00:35.910> here<00:00:36.649> over<00:00:37.649> here<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.370> then

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
window open over here over here and then

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.959 
window open over here over here and then
have<00:00:39.800> something<00:00:40.800> else<00:00:40.920> my<00:00:41.070> up<00:00:41.250> we're<00:00:41.760> going<00:00:41.910> to

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
have something else my up we're going to

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.430 
have something else my up we're going to
have<00:00:42.059> my<00:00:42.180> recycle<00:00:42.690> bin<00:00:42.719> over<00:00:43.079> here<00:00:43.260> for

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
have my recycle bin over here for

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.090 
have my recycle bin over here for
whatever<00:00:43.649> reason<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.629> you<00:00:45.629> can<00:00:45.780> see<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.980> know

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
whatever reason and you can see you know

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.880 
whatever reason and you can see you know
two<00:00:48.059> monitors<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:48.899> freely<00:00:49.320> move<00:00:49.469> my

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
two monitors I can freely move my

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.130 
two monitors I can freely move my
windows<00:00:50.340> back<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.940> forth<00:00:51.800> and<00:00:53.719> yeah<00:00:54.719> that's

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
windows back and forth and yeah that's

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.529 
windows back and forth and yeah that's
it<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.340> basically<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:56.910> are<00:00:57.059> going<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.420> learn

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
it so basically we are going to learn

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.490 
it so basically we are going to learn
how<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.500> set<00:00:58.890> them<00:00:59.039> up<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.750> if<00:01:00.750> my<00:01:00.899> camera<00:01:01.320> is

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
how to set them up and if my camera is

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500 
how to set them up and if my camera is
randomly<00:01:02.039> goes<00:01:02.460> off<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.910> side<00:01:03.149> because<00:01:03.390> I

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
randomly goes off to the side because I

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.960 
randomly goes off to the side because I
don't<00:01:03.660> realize<00:01:03.960> what<00:01:04.140> I'm<00:01:04.260> doing<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.970> apologize

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
don't realize what I'm doing I apologize

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.730 
don't realize what I'm doing I apologize
I'll<00:01:06.600> try<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.960> do<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.260> as<00:01:07.350> little<00:01:07.650> as

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
I'll try to do that as little as

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.420 
I'll try to do that as little as
possible<00:01:08.360> now<00:01:09.360> basically<00:01:10.130> we<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.250> go<00:01:11.400> over

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
possible now basically we can go over

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.710 
possible now basically we can go over
here<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.820> see<00:01:12.270> not<00:01:12.479> only<00:01:12.510> my<00:01:12.990> statue<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:14.720> cod

computer tower and I've really should

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.190 
computer tower and I've really should
have<00:01:23.189> cleaned<00:01:23.400> up<00:01:23.580> before<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.909> did<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.240> but

have cleaned up before I did this but
yeah<00:01:25.619> here<00:01:25.799> computer<00:01:26.070> tower<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:27.240> yes<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.720> a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
yeah here computer tower and yes have a

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.890 
yeah here computer tower and yes have a
graphics<00:01:28.259> card<00:01:28.350> with<00:01:29.070> two<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:30.060> output

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
graphics card with two in output

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.740 
graphics card with two in output
locations<00:01:31.530> for<00:01:31.680> me<00:01:31.799> i'm<00:01:31.890> using<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.189> DVI<00:01:32.600> to<00:01:33.600> my

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
locations for me i'm using a DVI to my

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.630 
locations for me i'm using a DVI to my
20<00:01:34.079> inch<00:01:34.200> monitor<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.220> VGA<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:36.000> my<00:01:37.549> what<00:01:38.549> i'm

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
20 inch monitor and a VGA to my what i'm

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.719 
20 inch monitor and a VGA to my what i'm
going<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.939> assume<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.750> 15<00:01:40.590> inch<00:01:40.829> monitor<00:01:41.340> since

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
going to assume is 15 inch monitor since

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.109 
going to assume is 15 inch monitor since
it<00:01:41.909> says<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.780> s15<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> front<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.310> re

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
it says the s15 on the front of it re

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.899 
it says the s15 on the front of it re
anyway<00:01:46.460> basically<00:01:47.460> take<00:01:47.939> two<00:01:48.210> cables<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.909> run

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
anyway basically take two cables and run

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.289 
anyway basically take two cables and run
them<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.619> input<00:01:52.920> for<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.759> two<00:01:53.939> monitors

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
them to the input for the two monitors

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.679 
them to the input for the two monitors
if<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.720> can<00:01:55.280> figure<00:01:56.280> out<00:01:56.430> what<00:01:57.180> i'm<00:01:57.270> doing<00:01:57.540> and

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
if you can figure out what i'm doing and

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.910 
if you can figure out what i'm doing and
understand<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.509> have<00:02:00.509> them<00:02:00.719> both<00:02:00.960> connected

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
understand and have them both connected

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.100 
understand and have them both connected
at<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.189> same<00:02:02.729> time<00:02:04.280> like<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.060> then<00:02:06.930> have

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
at the same time like so and then have

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.589 
at the same time like so and then have
the<00:02:07.229> power<00:02:07.409> cables<00:02:08.090> go<00:02:09.090> into<00:02:09.300> your<00:02:09.390> power

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
the power cables go into your power

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.300 
the power cables go into your power
strict<00:02:10.110> or<00:02:10.860> whatever<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.250> hughes

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
strict or whatever you hughes

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.240 
strict or whatever you hughes
and<00:02:12.840> then<00:02:13.840> once<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:14.500> have<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:14.650> all<00:02:14.950> set<00:02:15.220> up

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
and then once you have that all set up

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.030 
and then once you have that all set up
and<00:02:15.520> they're<00:02:15.640> both<00:02:15.790> connected<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.920> if<00:02:17.920> I

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
and they're both connected and if I

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.070 
and they're both connected and if I
wanted<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.459> I<00:02:18.970> could<00:02:19.840> have<00:02:19.959> actually<00:02:20.110> used<00:02:20.410> my

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
wanted to I could have actually used my

my computer screen as usual sorry had to
change<00:03:12.549> it<00:03:12.730> up<00:03:13.109> to<00:03:14.109> do<00:03:14.439> this<00:03:14.650> properly<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.430> was

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
change it up to do this properly it was

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.059 
change it up to do this properly it was
it<00:03:15.790> was<00:03:15.909> a<00:03:15.939> bit<00:03:16.120> hard<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.389> do<00:03:16.569> it<00:03:16.719> right<00:03:17.079> alright

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
so now you should have your two monitors

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.379 
so now you should have your two monitors
hooked<00:03:19.689> up<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.109> now<00:03:20.260> either<00:03:20.879> your<00:03:21.879> secondary

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
hooked up and now either your secondary

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:25.140 
hooked up and now either your secondary
monitor<00:03:22.689> which<00:03:23.109> mine<00:03:23.349> is<00:03:23.650> smaller<00:03:24.129> or<00:03:24.459> your

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
monitor which mine is smaller or your

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.059 
monitor which mine is smaller or your
primary<00:03:25.599> monitor<00:03:25.870> will<00:03:26.379> be<00:03:27.299> displaying<00:03:28.299> stuff

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
primary monitor will be displaying stuff

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.949 
primary monitor will be displaying stuff
so<00:03:30.069> if<00:03:30.430> you're<00:03:30.579> on<00:03:30.700> Windows<00:03:30.730> 7<00:03:31.450> right<00:03:31.719> click

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
so if you're on Windows 7 right click

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.229 
so if you're on Windows 7 right click
and<00:03:32.139> hit<00:03:33.060> screen<00:03:34.060> resolution<00:03:34.749> I<00:03:34.840> think<00:03:35.879> but<00:03:36.879> we

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
and hit screen resolution I think but we

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.289 
and hit screen resolution I think but we
will<00:03:37.510> go<00:03:37.750> through<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.290> control<00:03:38.709> panel<00:03:40.319> go<00:03:41.319> to

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
will go through the control panel go to

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.849 
will go through the control panel go to
adjust<00:03:43.299> screen<00:03:43.930> resolution<00:03:44.879> and<00:03:46.680> you'll<00:03:47.680> now

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859

adjust screen resolution and you'll now
be<00:03:48.040> at<00:03:48.129> a<00:03:48.159> screen<00:03:48.489> like<00:03:48.519> this<00:03:48.909> let<00:03:49.150> me<00:03:49.239> see<00:03:49.359> if<00:03:49.419> I

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
be at a screen like this let me see if I

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.890 
be at a screen like this let me see if I
can<00:03:49.629> make<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:50.049> stuff<00:03:50.290> bigger<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:51.689> guess<00:03:52.689> not

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
can make the stuff bigger I guess not

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.110 
can make the stuff bigger I guess not

going to want to adjust them to their
highest<00:04:06.790> resolution<00:04:07.919> they<00:04:08.919> may<00:04:09.250> when<00:04:09.879> you

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
highest resolution they may when you

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.789 
highest resolution they may when you
first<00:04:10.239> plug<00:04:10.540> both<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.989> men<00:04:11.139> be<00:04:11.349> at<00:04:11.439> a<00:04:11.470> small

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
first plug both the men be at a small

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.189 
first plug both the men be at a small
resolution<00:04:12.519> so<00:04:13.299> put<00:04:13.479> them<00:04:13.629> both<00:04:13.750> up<00:04:13.959> to<00:04:14.079> their

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:14.199 
resolution so put them both up to their

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.170 
resolution so put them both up to their
native<00:04:14.409> resolution<00:04:14.739> my<00:04:15.310> secondary<00:04:15.879> monitor

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
native resolution my secondary monitor

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.770 
native resolution my secondary monitor
is<00:04:16.479> 1024<00:04:17.139> x<00:04:17.289> 768<00:04:17.919> and<00:04:18.750> my<00:04:19.919> primary<00:04:20.919> monitor<00:04:21.159> is

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
is 1024 x 768 and my primary monitor is

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.520 
is 1024 x 768 and my primary monitor is
1600<00:04:22.780> x<00:04:22.930> 900<00:04:24.210> so<00:04:25.210> now<00:04:25.449> make<00:04:26.020> sure<00:04:26.199> they're<00:04:26.380> both

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
1600 x 900 so now make sure they're both

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.770 
1600 x 900 so now make sure they're both
set<00:04:26.830> to<00:04:26.979> landscape<00:04:27.550> or<00:04:27.820> if<00:04:28.300> you<00:04:28.419> have<00:04:28.509> them<00:04:28.690> on

their sides for whatever reason portrait

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.480 
their sides for whatever reason portrait
set<00:04:32.139> them<00:04:32.289> up<00:04:32.349> to<00:04:32.470> the<00:04:32.560> orientation<00:04:33.130> that

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
set them up to the orientation that

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.100 
set them up to the orientation that
fixes<00:04:33.970> fits<00:04:34.449> you<00:04:35.250> now<00:04:36.599> what<00:04:37.599> you<00:04:37.690> want<00:04:37.870> to<00:04:37.930> do

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
will make them both the same but that

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.029 
will make them both the same but that
would<00:05:05.830> be<00:05:05.860> just<00:05:06.159> simply<00:05:06.520> to<00:05:06.639> do<00:05:07.770> so<00:05:08.770> we're

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
would be just simply to do so we're

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.339 
would be just simply to do so we're
going<00:05:09.130> to<00:05:09.250> extend<00:05:09.789> these<00:05:10.180> displays<00:05:10.780> that's
