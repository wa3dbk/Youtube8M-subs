not<00:03:39.950> only<00:03:40.250> because<00:03:40.639> it's<00:03:40.969> so<00:03:41.389> expensive<00:03:42.189> I

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:43.189 
not only because it's so expensive I

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.360 
not only because it's so expensive I
bought<00:03:43.340> this<00:03:43.969> a<00:03:44.359> couple<00:03:45.109> of<00:03:45.319> months<00:03:45.650> ago<00:03:45.889> when

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
bought this a couple of months ago when

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.689 
bought this a couple of months ago when
I<00:03:46.430> was<00:03:46.989> just<00:03:47.989> starting<00:03:48.169> to<00:03:48.530> rebuild<00:03:48.980> my<00:03:49.099> makeup

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
I was just starting to rebuild my makeup

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:55.240 
I was just starting to rebuild my makeup
collection<00:03:50.239> again<00:03:50.719> and<00:03:51.549> I<00:03:53.829> wanted<00:03:54.829> the<00:03:54.949> best<00:03:55.069> I

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
collection again and I wanted the best I

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.809 
collection again and I wanted the best I
could<00:03:55.310> get<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:57.620> I<00:03:57.980> still<00:03:58.250> think<00:03:58.430> this<00:03:58.519> is<00:03:58.579> the

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
could get and I still think this is the

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.009 
could get and I still think this is the
best<00:03:58.969> for<00:03:59.269> what<00:03:59.389> it<00:03:59.480> does<00:03:59.659> so<00:04:01.269> if<00:04:02.269> you're

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
best for what it does so if you're

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.449
