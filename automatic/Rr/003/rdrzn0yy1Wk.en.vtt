aluminum tubing and they do use a push
button<00:00:30.269> handle<00:00:30.599> system<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.140> locks<00:00:31.380> at<00:00:31.590> a

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
button handle system and it locks at a

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.370 
button handle system and it locks at a
few<00:00:31.859> different<00:00:32.160> levels<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:33.110> so<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.350> a

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
few different levels and so you have a

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.010 
few different levels and so you have a
couple<00:00:34.590> different<00:00:34.710> heights<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.730> does<00:00:35.940> go<00:00:36.899> all

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
couple different heights it does go all

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.720 
couple different heights it does go all
the<00:00:37.079> way<00:00:37.110> down<00:00:37.350> locks<00:00:37.649> down<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.100> zips<00:00:38.370> up<00:00:38.520> into

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
the way down locks down and zips up into

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.440 
the way down locks down and zips up into
this<00:00:38.850> compartment<00:00:39.809> back<00:00:40.110> here<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:44.329> that's<00:00:45.329> how

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
this compartment back here so that's how

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.619 
this compartment back here so that's how
that<00:00:45.510> works

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
that works

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.479 
that works
do<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> also<00:00:49.410> grab<00:00:49.680> handle<00:00:50.160> here<00:00:50.370> as

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
do you have a also grab handle here as

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.090 
do you have a also grab handle here as
well<00:00:50.840> and<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> bottom<00:00:52.410> grab<00:00:52.590> handle<00:00:53.010> as

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
well and then a bottom grab handle as

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.979 
well and then a bottom grab handle as
well<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.000> easier<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.300> lift<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:54.629> put<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
well so it's easier to lift up put on a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.299 
well so it's easier to lift up put on a
bed<00:00:55.230> or<00:00:55.530> into<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> trunk<00:00:56.719> they<00:00:57.719> do<00:00:57.780> have<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
bed or into a trunk they do have a

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.790 
bed or into a trunk they do have a
smaller<00:00:59.309> pocket<00:00:59.609> here<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.449> put

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
smaller pocket here so you can put

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.049 
smaller pocket here so you can put
documents<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:02.309> only<00:01:02.430> goes<00:01:02.640> down<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:02.940> right

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
documents it only goes down and right
