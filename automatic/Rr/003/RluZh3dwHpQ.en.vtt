as you'll see at the end of the video as
you<00:00:17.490> can<00:00:17.609> see<00:00:17.789> at<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.000> start<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.390> fairly<00:00:18.690> slow

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
you can see at the start is fairly slow

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.510 
you can see at the start is fairly slow
to<00:00:19.109> build<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.500> first<00:00:19.680> couple<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:20.100> layers<00:00:20.279> of

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
to build the first couple of layers of

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.160 
to build the first couple of layers of
the<00:00:20.580> building<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.150> then<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.449> speeds<00:00:21.720> up<00:00:21.900> as<00:00:22.050> it

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
the building and then it speeds up as it

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.820 
the building and then it speeds up as it

minutes<00:00:26.189> long<00:00:26.400> now<00:00:26.880> shortened<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.420> down<00:00:27.480> by<00:00:27.840> x

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
minutes long now shortened it down by x

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.370

in<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.349> by<00:00:28.519> 999<00:00:29.570> so<00:00:30.570> now<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.779> cliff<00:00:31.260> is

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
in it by 999 so now the cliff is

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.080 
in it by 999 so now the cliff is
actually<00:00:31.800> two<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.130> three<00:00:32.309> minutes<00:00:32.579> long<00:00:32.790> as

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
actually two to three minutes long as

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.430 
actually two to three minutes long as
you<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.390> see<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.690> builds<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> lighthouse

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
you can see it builds the lighthouse

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.250 
you can see it builds the lighthouse
from<00:00:34.620> bottom<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:34.980> top<00:00:35.690> when<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.809> start<00:00:37.110> this

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
from bottom to top when you start this

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.959 
from bottom to top when you start this
plugin<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:38.070> have<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.280> make<00:00:38.430> sure<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
plugin you have to make sure that the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.280 
plugin you have to make sure that the
builder<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.660> middle<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.989> where<00:00:40.170> you

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
builder is in the middle of where you

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.290 
builder is in the middle of where you
want<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> object<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.040> start<00:00:41.340> because<00:00:42.149> it

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
want the object to start because it

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.119 
want the object to start because it
starts<00:00:42.600> from<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.809> middle<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.230> building

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
starts from the middle of the building

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.860 
starts from the middle of the building
to<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.579> outside<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.149> building<00:00:45.270> as<00:00:45.600> you

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
to the outside of the building as you

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.479 
to the outside of the building as you
can<00:00:45.930> see<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.469> first<00:00:46.710> couple<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.070> layers<00:00:47.219> are

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
can see the first couple of layers are

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.029 
can see the first couple of layers are
slow<00:00:47.789> as<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.059> said<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.230> will<00:00:49.410> speed<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:49.890> as

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
slow as I said that you will speed up as

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.910 
slow as I said that you will speed up as
it<00:00:50.129> goes<00:00:50.160> along<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:51.410> think<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.469> plugin<00:00:52.739> would

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
it goes along I think this plugin would

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.770 
it goes along I think this plugin would
be<00:00:53.010> really<00:00:53.219> good<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.610> multiplayer<00:00:54.000> servers<00:00:54.600> I

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
be really good on multiplayer servers I

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.660 
be really good on multiplayer servers I
can<00:00:55.079> imagine<00:00:55.260> players<00:00:55.739> logging<00:00:56.100> into<00:00:56.250> online

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
can imagine players logging into online

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.689 
can imagine players logging into online
servers<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.390> seeing<00:00:57.660> an<00:00:57.840> NPC<00:00:58.739> creating<00:00:59.550> these

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
servers and seeing an NPC creating these

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.760 
servers and seeing an NPC creating these
buildings<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.359> think<00:01:01.020> it'd<00:01:01.109> be<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.230> really<00:01:01.469> fun

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
buildings I think it'd be a really fun

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.130 
buildings I think it'd be a really fun
experience<00:01:01.890> for<00:01:02.280> players<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.640> see<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.180> also

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
experience for players to see I also

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.630 
experience for players to see I also
think<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.559> plugin<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:04.979> great<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.339> do<00:01:05.460> little

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
think the plugin is great to do little

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.550 
think the plugin is great to do little
videos<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.420> showing<00:01:06.810> an<00:01:07.020> object<00:01:07.380> being

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
videos like this showing an object being

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.490 
videos like this showing an object being
built<00:01:07.830> from<00:01:07.979> bottom<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.610> top<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:09.510> quick<00:01:10.140> speed

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
built from bottom to top in quick speed

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.399 
built from bottom to top in quick speed
I<00:01:10.740> think<00:01:11.130> they're<00:01:11.250> quite<00:01:11.400> enjoyable<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.000> watch

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
I think they're quite enjoyable to watch

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.960 
I think they're quite enjoyable to watch
although<00:01:13.409> my<00:01:13.799> building<00:01:14.189> isn't<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.580> best<00:01:14.760> in

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
although my building isn't the best in

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.580 
although my building isn't the best in
the<00:01:15.060> world<00:01:15.150> i<00:01:15.390> must<00:01:15.600> admit<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.560> show

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
the world i must admit is just to show

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.800 
the world i must admit is just to show
the<00:01:16.920> plugin<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.520> show<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:18.000> working

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the plugin and to show a working

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.050 
the plugin and to show a working
lighthouse<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.380> effect<00:01:19.710> i'm<00:01:20.520> sure<00:01:20.790> if<00:01:20.939> you

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
lighthouse in effect i'm sure if you

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.789 
lighthouse in effect i'm sure if you
spent<00:01:21.299> more<00:01:21.360> time<00:01:21.479> creating<00:01:22.049> an<00:01:22.290> epic<00:01:22.530> build

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
spent more time creating an epic build

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.740 
spent more time creating an epic build
it<00:01:23.220> would<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.369> really<00:01:23.610> enjoyable<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.210> watch<00:01:24.240> as

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
it would be really enjoyable to watch as

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.719 
it would be really enjoyable to watch as
i<00:01:25.259> say<00:01:25.470> i<00:01:25.500> didn't<00:01:25.830> spend<00:01:25.890> too<00:01:26.070> long<00:01:26.340> building

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
i say i didn't spend too long building

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.700 
i say i didn't spend too long building
this<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.420> quick<00:01:27.600> demo<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.290> show<00:01:28.320> what

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
this it's just a quick demo to show what

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.890 
this it's just a quick demo to show what
the<00:01:28.860> plugin<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.310> actually<00:01:29.610> do<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.780> can

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
the plugin can actually do as you can

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.870 
the plugin can actually do as you can
see<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.470> build<00:01:31.770> doors<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.610> build

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
see it can build doors it can build

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.270 
see it can build doors it can build
switches<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.840> build<00:01:34.110> redstone<00:01:34.860> which

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
switches and it can build redstone which

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.039 
switches and it can build redstone which
is<00:01:35.460> really<00:01:35.850> good<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.479> plugin<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.869> be<00:01:36.960> able

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
is really good for the plugin to be able

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.109 
is really good for the plugin to be able
to<00:01:37.170> do<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:38.070> only<00:01:38.100> thing<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.520> can't<00:01:38.759> do<00:01:39.000> is

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
to do the only thing it can't do is

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.300 
to do the only thing it can't do is
paintings<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.990> little<00:01:40.170> bits<00:01:40.320> like<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.740> but

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
paintings and little bits like that but

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.639 
paintings and little bits like that but
the<00:01:41.850> developer<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.659> actually<00:01:43.140> working<00:01:43.350> on

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
the developer is actually working on

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.819 
the developer is actually working on
this<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.009> one<00:01:44.189> day<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.430> will<00:01:44.610> be<00:01:44.670> able<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.030> i

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
this so one day it will be able to i

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.109 
this so one day it will be able to i
didn't<00:01:46.829> actually<00:01:46.950> spend<00:01:47.430> too<00:01:47.700> long<00:01:47.880> making

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
didn't actually spend too long making

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.999 
didn't actually spend too long making
this<00:01:48.479> because<00:01:48.750> as<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.049> say<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.350> was<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.799> for<00:01:49.950> a

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
this because as I say it was just for a

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.069 
this because as I say it was just for a
demo<00:01:50.280> if<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.030> had<00:01:51.210> haven't<00:01:51.450> spent<00:01:51.689> loads<00:01:51.899> of

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
demo if I had haven't spent loads of

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.050 
demo if I had haven't spent loads of
time<00:01:52.259> making<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.680> I'd<00:01:52.829> have<00:01:52.860> also<00:01:53.220> fitted<00:01:53.939> out

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
time making it I'd have also fitted out

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.660 
time making it I'd have also fitted out
the<00:01:54.180> inside<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.960> lighthouse<00:01:55.280> as<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.579> is

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the inside of the lighthouse as it is

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.399 
the inside of the lighthouse as it is
just<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.030> demonstration<00:01:57.299> purpose<00:01:58.200> I

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
just for a demonstration purpose I

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.080 
just for a demonstration purpose I
filled<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.740> with<00:01:58.770> all<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.070> redstone<00:01:59.520> circuits

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
filled it with all the redstone circuits

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.700 
filled it with all the redstone circuits
to<00:02:00.270> make<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.540> nice<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.899> easy<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.350> just<00:02:01.439> did

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
to make it nice and easy and just did

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.649 
to make it nice and easy and just did
them<00:02:01.829> literally<00:02:02.159> all<00:02:02.460> over<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.939> inside<00:02:03.060> as

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
them literally all over the inside as

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.630 
them literally all over the inside as
you'll<00:02:04.350> see<00:02:04.380> when<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.770> finishes<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.189> will<00:02:05.430> show

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
you'll see when it finishes I will show

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.980 
you'll see when it finishes I will show
you<00:02:05.700> what<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.060> finished<00:02:06.180> product<00:02:06.630> does<00:02:06.780> look

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
you what the finished product does look

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.920 
you what the finished product does look
like<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.469> turning

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
like and it turning

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.499 
like and it turning
and<00:02:08.020> off<00:02:08.759> obviously<00:02:09.759> if<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:10.000> have<00:02:10.149> spent<00:02:10.390> more

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
and off obviously if I have spent more

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.850 
and off obviously if I have spent more
time<00:02:10.570> and<00:02:10.990> I<00:02:11.020> could<00:02:11.290> have<00:02:11.410> fitted<00:02:11.650> out<00:02:11.830> with

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
time and I could have fitted out with

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.070 
time and I could have fitted out with
stairs<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.580> made<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.820> interior<00:02:13.330> smooth<00:02:13.690> so

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
stairs and made the interior smooth so

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.690 
stairs and made the interior smooth so
you<00:02:14.440> just<00:02:14.620> saw<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.890> inside<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.490> lighthouse

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
you just saw the inside the lighthouse

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.030 
you just saw the inside the lighthouse
as<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.120> normal<00:02:16.480> lighthouse<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.620> made<00:02:17.770> it<00:02:17.950> an

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
as a normal lighthouse and made it an

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.280 
as a normal lighthouse and made it an
operational<00:02:18.580> building<00:02:18.960> but<00:02:19.960> I<00:02:20.020> can<00:02:20.170> imagine

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
operational building but I can imagine

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.350 
operational building but I can imagine
this<00:02:20.560> being<00:02:20.620> used<00:02:21.070> on<00:02:21.280> online<00:02:21.640> service<00:02:22.120> for

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
this being used on online service for

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.390 
this being used on online service for
things<00:02:22.660> such<00:02:22.960> as<00:02:23.020> houses<00:02:23.650> I<00:02:23.860> can<00:02:24.280> have<00:02:24.370> a

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
things such as houses I can have a

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.430 
things such as houses I can have a
starter<00:02:24.910> house<00:02:25.090> saved<00:02:25.420> as<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.660> schematic<00:02:26.170> file

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
starter house saved as a schematic file

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.620 
starter house saved as a schematic file
then<00:02:27.310> when<00:02:27.459> players<00:02:27.760> come<00:02:28.030> into<00:02:28.270> your<00:02:28.390> server

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
then when players come into your server

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.360 
then when players come into your server
you<00:02:28.810> can<00:02:28.840> just<00:02:29.170> create<00:02:29.440> them<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.680> new<00:02:29.800> house<00:02:30.070> by

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
you can just create them a new house by

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.030 
you can just create them a new house by
starting<00:02:30.760> off<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.030> Builder<00:02:31.890> there'll<00:02:32.890> be<00:02:32.920> a

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
starting off the Builder there'll be a

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.710 
starting off the Builder there'll be a

this plugin such as the commands and the

this plugin such as the commands and the
basic<00:02:41.830> uses<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:43.870> almost<00:02:44.110> at<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.410> top<00:02:44.470> now<00:02:44.800> so

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
basic uses it's almost at the top now so

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.830 
basic uses it's almost at the top now so
he's<00:02:45.220> almost<00:02:45.340> done<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:46.300> only<00:02:46.510> thing<00:02:46.720> I've

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
he's almost done the only thing I've

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.479 
he's almost done the only thing I've
realized<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:47.440> they<00:02:47.590> do<00:02:47.650> struggle<00:02:48.100> on<00:02:48.340> is

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
realized that they do struggle on is

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.160 
realized that they do struggle on is
fence<00:02:48.820> posts<00:02:49.390> they<00:02:49.600> seem<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.959> struggle

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
fence posts they seem to struggle

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.320 
fence posts they seem to struggle
putting<00:02:50.530> these<00:02:50.770> out<00:02:51.040> seems<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.880> take<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.120> little

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
putting these out seems to take a little

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.500 
putting these out seems to take a little
bit<00:02:52.480> longer<00:02:52.630> than<00:02:52.930> other<00:02:53.080> block<00:02:53.320> type<00:02:53.670> oaks<00:02:54.670> as

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
bit longer than other block type oaks as

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.590 
bit longer than other block type oaks as
you<00:02:55.690> can<00:02:55.810> see<00:02:56.020> it's<00:02:56.170> finished<00:02:56.500> now<00:02:57.540> I'll<00:02:58.540> just

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
you can see it's finished now I'll just

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.360 
you can see it's finished now I'll just
quickly<00:02:58.959> go<00:02:59.110> around<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.620> whole<00:02:59.739> thing<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:00.280> you

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
quickly go around the whole thing so you

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.190 
quickly go around the whole thing so you
can<00:03:00.400> see<00:03:00.700> every<00:03:01.000> side<00:03:01.209> is<00:03:01.450> symmetrical<00:03:02.080> and

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
can see every side is symmetrical and

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.710 
can see every side is symmetrical and
all<00:03:02.380> looks<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.650> same<00:03:03.090> as<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.239> can<00:03:04.360> see<00:03:04.540> the

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
all looks the same as you can see the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.540 
all looks the same as you can see the
lights<00:03:04.930> are<00:03:05.170> in<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.320> windows<00:03:05.650> so<00:03:06.040> as<00:03:06.280> it's

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
lights are in the windows so as it's

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.830 
lights are in the windows so as it's
night<00:03:06.730> time<00:03:06.760> you'll<00:03:07.209> be<00:03:07.330> able<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.540> see<00:03:07.720> the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
night time you'll be able to see the

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.680 
night time you'll be able to see the
lights<00:03:08.050> light<00:03:08.320> up<00:03:09.209> quickly<00:03:10.209> just<00:03:10.420> go<00:03:10.600> around

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
lights light up quickly just go around

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.650 
lights light up quickly just go around
the<00:03:10.900> whole<00:03:10.989> things<00:03:11.320> that<00:03:11.560> you<00:03:11.650> see<00:03:12.299> if<00:03:13.299> I<00:03:13.420> fly

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
the whole things that you see if I fly

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.270 
the whole things that you see if I fly
down<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.110> bottom<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.620> show<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.190> the

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
down to the bottom and show you the

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.580 
down to the bottom and show you the
front<00:03:15.489> door<00:03:17.250> there's<00:03:18.250> a<00:03:18.370> pathway<00:03:19.290> as<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:20.440> can

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
front door there's a pathway as you can

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.830 
front door there's a pathway as you can
see<00:03:20.799> there's<00:03:21.549> the<00:03:21.670> lighthouse<00:03:23.700> so<00:03:24.750> there<00:03:25.750> you

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
see there's the lighthouse so there you

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.180 
see there's the lighthouse so there you
go<00:03:25.900> use<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.320> switch<00:03:26.739> and<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.040> door<00:03:27.220> shuts<00:03:29.190> so

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
go use the switch and the door shuts so

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.280 
go use the switch and the door shuts so
it's<00:03:30.310> got<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.489> working<00:03:30.700> door<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.360> switch<00:03:31.630> and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
it's got a working door and switch and

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.479 
it's got a working door and switch and
then<00:03:32.410> you<00:03:32.560> can<00:03:32.680> see<00:03:32.830> all<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:32.980> redstone

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
then you can see all the redstone

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.580 
then you can see all the redstone
circuits<00:03:34.030> on<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.209> inside<00:03:34.630> as<00:03:34.959> I<00:03:35.080> say<00:03:35.260> I<00:03:35.290> could

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
circuits on the inside as I say I could

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.840 
circuits on the inside as I say I could
have<00:03:35.709> hidden<00:03:35.890> these<00:03:36.130> if<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:36.430> spent<00:03:36.670> more<00:03:36.820> time

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
have hidden these if I spent more time

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.060 
have hidden these if I spent more time
doing<00:03:37.360> it<00:03:37.450> as<00:03:38.380> it<00:03:38.590> was<00:03:38.620> just<00:03:38.890> for<00:03:38.980> a

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
doing it as it was just for a

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.090 
doing it as it was just for a
demonstration<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:39.880> didn't<00:03:40.120> worry<00:03:40.269> as<00:03:40.920> you<00:03:41.920> saw

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
demonstration I didn't worry as you saw

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.039 
demonstration I didn't worry as you saw
the<00:03:42.160> Builder<00:03:42.880> was<00:03:43.030> back<00:03:43.450> in<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.690> middle<00:03:43.930> it

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
the Builder was back in the middle it

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.900 
the Builder was back in the middle it
starts<00:03:44.440> where<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.709> spawned<00:03:45.040> at<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.340> start<00:03:45.640> and

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
starts where it spawned at the start and

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.970 
starts where it spawned at the start and
if<00:03:46.840> i<00:03:46.959> turn<00:03:47.019> it<00:03:47.260> off<00:03:47.380> you<00:03:47.620> can<00:03:47.739> see<00:03:47.860> all<00:03:47.920> the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
if i turn it off you can see all the

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.640 
if i turn it off you can see all the
lights<00:03:48.160> go<00:03:48.310> off<00:03:48.690> then<00:03:49.690> on<00:03:49.810> again<00:03:49.870> they<00:03:50.260> turn<00:03:50.470> on

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
lights go off then on again they turn on

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.690 
lights go off then on again they turn on
again<00:03:51.570> so<00:03:52.570> it<00:03:52.660> works<00:03:52.900> properly<00:03:53.430> so<00:03:54.430> quickly

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
again so it works properly so quickly

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.160 
again so it works properly so quickly
just<00:03:54.850> changed<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.209> time<00:03:55.390> tonight<00:03:55.720> so<00:03:55.959> you<00:03:56.049> can

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
just changed the time tonight so you can

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.500 
just changed the time tonight so you can
see<00:03:56.380> it<00:03:56.500> so<00:03:57.430> you<00:03:57.519> can<00:03:57.640> see<00:03:57.820> all<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.000> lights<00:03:58.299> are

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
see it so you can see all the lights are

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.160 
see it so you can see all the lights are
off<00:03:58.650> no<00:03:59.650> lights<00:03:59.890> on<00:04:00.100> at<00:04:00.220> all

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
off no lights on at all

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.640 
off no lights on at all
every<00:04:02.130> single<00:04:02.520> torch<00:04:02.760> is<00:04:02.970> off<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:04.200> if<00:04:04.290> I<00:04:04.410> flick

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
every single torch is off and if I flick

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.600 
every single torch is off and if I flick
it<00:04:04.770> back<00:04:04.800> on<00:04:05.360> you<00:04:06.360> see<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.630> light<00:04:06.810> up<00:04:07.550> there<00:04:08.550> you

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
it back on you see it light up there you

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.520 
it back on you see it light up there you
go<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:09.569> see<00:04:09.750> it's<00:04:09.989> lighting<00:04:10.319> up<00:04:10.380> the

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
go and see it's lighting up the

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.820 
go and see it's lighting up the
surrounding<00:04:11.010> area<00:04:11.720> as<00:04:12.720> I<00:04:12.900> said<00:04:13.140> this<00:04:13.440> was<00:04:13.650> just

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
surrounding area as I said this was just

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.470 
surrounding area as I said this was just
a<00:04:13.920> quick<00:04:14.130> building<00:04:14.550> so<00:04:14.730> it's<00:04:14.849> not<00:04:15.000> so<00:04:15.239> great

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
a quick building so it's not so great

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.210 
a quick building so it's not so great
but<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:16.049> think<00:04:16.260> it's<00:04:16.380> still<00:04:16.470> turned<00:04:16.799> out<00:04:16.950> fairly

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
but I think it's still turned out fairly

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.129 
but I think it's still turned out fairly
well<00:04:17.400> if<00:04:18.269> you<00:04:18.419> have<00:04:18.510> more<00:04:18.660> time<00:04:18.870> you<00:04:19.049> could

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
well if you have more time you could

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.750 
well if you have more time you could
obviously<00:04:19.380> create<00:04:19.799> a<00:04:19.829> more<00:04:20.040> epic<00:04:20.190> building

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
obviously create a more epic building

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.500 
obviously create a more epic building
and<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.239> would<00:04:21.329> be<00:04:21.359> really<00:04:21.630> fun<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:21.959> watch<00:04:22.200> back

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
and it would be really fun to watch back

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.580 
and it would be really fun to watch back
as<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.630> say<00:04:24.810> they'll<00:04:24.990> be<00:04:25.080> links<00:04:25.380> in<00:04:25.500> the

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
as I say they'll be links in the

as I say they'll be links in the
