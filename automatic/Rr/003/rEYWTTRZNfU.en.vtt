wood finishing goes way back and it

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.270 
wood finishing goes way back and it
involved<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:06.120> lot<00:00:06.270> of<00:00:06.830> chemistry<00:00:07.830> but<00:00:08.160> they

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
involved a lot of chemistry but they

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.680 
involved a lot of chemistry but they
didn't<00:00:08.639> know<00:00:08.790> it<00:00:08.970> didn't<00:00:09.389> know<00:00:09.480> enough<00:00:09.630> about

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
didn't know it didn't know enough about

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.940 
didn't know it didn't know enough about
chemistry<00:00:10.139> Noah's<00:00:10.590> chemistry<00:00:11.450> so<00:00:12.450> was<00:00:12.929> it's<00:00:13.830> a

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
chemistry Noah's chemistry so was it's a

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.220 
chemistry Noah's chemistry so was it's a
mystical<00:00:14.519> voodoo<00:00:14.910> sometimes<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:15.990> works

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
mystical voodoo sometimes it works

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.740 
mystical voodoo sometimes it works
sometimes<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.890> doesn't<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.609> don't<00:00:18.420> know<00:00:18.539> why

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
sometimes it doesn't I don't know why

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.130 
sometimes it doesn't I don't know why
but<00:00:19.730> Alfred<00:00:20.730> yo<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.180> think<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.600> my<00:00:21.779> students

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
but Alfred yo I think that my students

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.420 
but Alfred yo I think that my students
are<00:00:22.199> setting<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.560> standard<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.100> what<00:00:23.250> you're

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
are setting the standard of what you're

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.009 
are setting the standard of what you're
supposed<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.939> know<00:00:24.140> so<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:26.119> demystify<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
supposed to know so to demystify the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.279 
supposed to know so to demystify the
finishing<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.650> wood<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.539> just<00:00:30.539> like<00:00:30.779> use<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
finishing of wood I just like use the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.000 
finishing of wood I just like use the
word<00:00:31.470> using<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.800> word<00:00:31.980> tricks<00:00:32.510> nice<00:00:33.510> trick
