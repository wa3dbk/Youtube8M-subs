 God chose us, ours chose 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:28.020
 good people this question is almost obvious 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.840
 Sometimes people forget and 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.110
 they have a manual of our evil is 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.040

 our bible of John in 15 and 16 days 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.150
 like this 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.910
 You did not choose me 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.010
 This God asking you. 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.880
 but he says instead I 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.940
 I have chosen other inputs assigned to 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.860
 who are green and fruitful and your fruit 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.590
 remain 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.470
 It means then that God who chooses 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.200
 you do not have to reap my god 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.030

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:48.739
 God, I chose this every day already. 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:53.760
 I died to my memory, life gave you 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:58.769

 I would ask everyone to have 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.090
 health opportunity 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.500

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.650
 complicated you understand why everyone 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.710
 yes we are yes accepted by god us all 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.260
 neither being salvation but to deserve the 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.289
 salvation you need a thing stay 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.410

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:42.750
 there is no way you live for them in 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.990

 work reflects a people thinks a little 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:08.330
 and sometimes you will see that the 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:08.330
 salvation is if you are sensitive 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:17.750

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.240
