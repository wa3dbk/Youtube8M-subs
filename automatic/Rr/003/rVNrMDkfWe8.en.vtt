sometimes<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.289> is<00:02:03.380> random<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:03.830> that's<00:02:04.069> why<00:02:04.220> it

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
sometimes it is random so that's why it

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.190 
sometimes it is random so that's why it
is<00:02:04.369> worth<00:02:04.610> checking<00:02:04.970> what<00:02:05.239> the<00:02:05.390> ID<00:02:05.750> is<00:02:05.899> first

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
is worth checking what the ID is first

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.979 
is worth checking what the ID is first
via<00:02:06.679> the<00:02:06.860> step<00:02:07.099> previously<00:02:07.789> to<00:02:08.390> exit<00:02:08.690> console

in<00:02:51.049> some<00:02:51.230> cases<00:02:51.439> I<00:02:51.620> believe<00:02:51.650> because<00:02:52.280> I<00:02:52.609> have

tons<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.180> mods<00:02:53.390> enabled<00:02:53.840> could<00:02:54.170> be<00:02:54.260> wrong<00:02:54.439> but

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
tons of mods enabled could be wrong but

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.259 
tons of mods enabled could be wrong but
I<00:02:54.709> believe<00:02:54.769> that's<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.430> reason<00:02:55.700> why<00:02:55.849> and<00:02:56.090> as<00:02:56.239> a

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
I believe that's the reason why and as a

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.699 
I believe that's the reason why and as a
side<00:02:56.540> note<00:02:56.569> someone<00:02:57.079> asked<00:02:57.290> me<00:02:57.349> to<00:02:57.530> kiss
