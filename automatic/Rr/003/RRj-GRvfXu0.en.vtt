00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.370
 we go another the mode folder next Tuesday 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.730
 we enter the tlc resurgence 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.920
 we are a folder 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.920

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:27.289

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:30.159
 to this letter 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.559
 this score 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:34.559
 0 0 0 0 in total are 16 zeros 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.019
 and here we are going to do 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.419
 drag 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.599
 peking and we have known from the stimuli folder we are going to show 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.599
 this folder 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.400
 we drag and do not wait for a moment what caracas 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.099
 I for my face flakes the video 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:57.589
 coke 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:58.899
 already in office 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:03.629
 this is that the race l load the file takes between a minute and 2 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.169
 at most 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.169
 three minutes I think 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:15.309
 now we say this does not advance dexter deeper the folders let's click 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:18.309
 here 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.649
 here 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:26.769
 the alias the goat we want more loans those are the maps stimuli 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:31.619
 now we are going to go back and the Vincentian voice expressed them jensen 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.059
 and we are going to click on this poster 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:37.729
 and in that too 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:39.209
 cora is active 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.949
 let's pose for cam 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.749
 and we wait for a while 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:45.749
 I promise that I will pose for life 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.309
 spock touch from here we already have the two files that does not pass stimuli and 

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:52.479
 the pse-ee resurfaced 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.519
 or how they pronounce 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.519
 this we have done this 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:59.629
 well 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:01.939
 we have finished 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.039
 the tutorial 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:06.499
 you have to leave a trail of cargo 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:09.309
 muddy are not going to damage the archives 

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:11.419
 already entered the 10 seconds 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.609
 rose art 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.909
 that was all 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.100
 but 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.469
 before I leave 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:20.890
 I will explain them in 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.809
 xbox tutorial 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:25.809
 when for maps to work 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.650
 recite 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.650
 I catch fire that supposes only muriano 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.999
 started the game with normally 

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:41.469
 and then opens the rival eclac appeared the new member that is not going to vote 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:44.779
 in the session 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:45.870
 of the s 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.360
 the Mexican with the s1 goes to a good Mexican 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.240
 vÃ©lez goes month and songs 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.870
 I believe that this is achieved 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.319
 of the 202 that will appear 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:59.969
 ok so you can see the maps 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:04.339
 nor season open the session of the 1st the mexiquense start of the game 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.339
 and close them 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:11.069
 and April to the profile of the second profile of the 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.189
 2 goes the Mexican 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:15.710
 and then serrano 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.069
 and he already opens his profile 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:19.719
 Why are we doing this 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.800
 public that we open the profiles are loaded the maps 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.400
 because if we do not open the profiles 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.400
 I never know what I will do or not because we can not play 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:34.009
 what we do I'm about to play but sprint I love doing it we're talking 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.620
 all sides and let's play like maps this is one of the disadvantages 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.870
 we open the profiles every so often to see the maps 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.900
 the advantage is that you saved san marcos or sports 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.150
 after three a lot of may his poetry 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.309
 and a lot of money or what 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:53.520
 well, tha's all 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.719
 james maya forgets something 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:00.939
