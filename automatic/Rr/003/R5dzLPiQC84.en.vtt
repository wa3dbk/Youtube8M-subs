trips<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.029> Martha's<00:00:24.330> Vineyard<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.869> and

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
trips to Martha's Vineyard on it and

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.290 
trips to Martha's Vineyard on it and
tuck<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.740> other<00:00:25.859> places<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.460> but

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
tuck it in other places like that but

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.429 
tuck it in other places like that but
mainly<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.599> keep<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.019> pleasant<00:00:28.349> Bay

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
mainly we keep it in pleasant Bay

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.080 
mainly we keep it in pleasant Bay
because<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.010> shallow<00:00:29.220> draft<00:00:29.609> boat<00:00:29.880> which

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
because it's a shallow draft boat which

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.669 
because it's a shallow draft boat which
you'll<00:00:30.240> see<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.510> second<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.320> ideal

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
you'll see in a second it's ideal

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.020 
you'll see in a second it's ideal
because<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.099> doesn't<00:00:32.309> bounce<00:00:32.369> off<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.730> bottom

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
because it doesn't bounce off the bottom

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.940 
because it doesn't bounce off the bottom
at<00:00:33.120> low<00:00:33.270> tide<00:00:33.540> although<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.380> do<00:00:34.500> run<00:00:34.770> aground
