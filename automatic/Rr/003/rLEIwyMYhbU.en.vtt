Russ raise it a hundred percent and I'll

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.159

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
say that I out of my pictures it makes

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.230 
say that I out of my pictures it makes
for<00:04:45.289> a<00:04:45.349> very<00:04:45.410> coherent<00:04:45.979> theme<00:04:46.340> um<00:04:46.729> it<00:04:47.120> makes

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
for a very coherent theme um it makes

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.059 
for a very coherent theme um it makes
them<00:04:47.449> all<00:04:47.660> very<00:04:47.930> similar-looking<00:04:48.349> and<00:04:49.009> I

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:49.069 
them all very similar-looking and I

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:50.230 
them all very similar-looking and I
think<00:04:49.310> that<00:04:49.430> it<00:04:49.520> gives<00:04:49.669> like<00:04:49.880> the<00:04:49.970> photo<00:04:50.150> a

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
think that it gives like the photo a

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.719 
think that it gives like the photo a
very<00:04:50.599> nice<00:04:50.870> touch<00:04:51.110> so<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:52.250> cropping<00:04:52.490> is<00:04:52.699> a

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
very nice touch so the cropping is a

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:53.950 
very nice touch so the cropping is a
little<00:04:52.940> off<00:04:53.000> on<00:04:53.180> this<00:04:53.270> but<00:04:53.479> I'm<00:04:53.569> also<00:04:53.720> holding

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960
