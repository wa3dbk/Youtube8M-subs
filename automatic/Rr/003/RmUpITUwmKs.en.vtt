00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
right here from the little clip I put

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.249 
right here from the little clip I put
together<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:38.970> drift<00:01:39.180> very<00:01:39.420> nicely<00:01:39.659> if<00:01:40.110> you

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
the PC so that way I can drift properly

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.920 
the PC so that way I can drift properly

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
the portion this game is called the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.160 
the portion this game is called the
comet<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.060> course<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.509> lot<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.840> people<00:02:07.079> would

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070
