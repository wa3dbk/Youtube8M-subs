00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 they are all boys and welcome to this 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.279
 new ones that I have to show you one 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.560
 really interesting thing indeed 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:12.960
 the other day on the site and on the canal 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:16.650
 site youtube nine to fail mac.com is 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.410
 a video appeared showing it 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.260
 a seemingly hidden menu of ayo 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.880
 s7 this menu really is something that 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.420
 never seen in ios why 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.750
 it allows to modify the whole system 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.989
 operational to customize everything to 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.420
 our pleasure and therefore precisely 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.309
 since it is not shown how to activate 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.140
 this menu is immediately thought by those who thought of 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.090
 a fake because it would be kind of 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.520
 jailbreak incorporated ie not really 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.640
 a jailbreak and because we will have it anyway 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.110
 same limitations however we will have gods 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.059
 very broad limits 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.219
 in fact then when I will show you the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.050
 video sees to the action what we can 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.699
 do with this menu and it would have to have 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.230
 a fantastic thing 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.960
 but precisely because as already said not 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.820
 shows how to activate it 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.670
 many have thought that this actually 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.490
 were better than the market with the theme 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.950
 of rs7 apart from that I have regarded myself 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.580
 the video 40 times to try to understand 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.560
 if there is something that could be ajo 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.930
 s60 deceived they forgot about 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.380
 hide it but this really looks like 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.159
 in all respects ajo s 7 beta 1 e 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.329
 then anyway the nine to fail company 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.369
 mac is perhaps one of the American sites and then 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.829
 most important in the world 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.470
 in fact, let's not forget that line to 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.250
 five mac had managed to take possession 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.140
 of the beta 1 of ayo s7 well seven hours 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.030
 first of all the others do not 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.770
 I had asked Apple herself 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.960
 however, she had managed to take possession 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.100
 of beta 1 say if you are before 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.899
 all the others 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.200
 and on its website published some 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.210
 screenshot of ios and 7 beta 1 that were 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.630
 been given for fakes and instead later 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.850
 sector after c if there were all noticed 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.619
 which actually were true so why 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.740
 no in tufail mac a company 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.170
 very important should falsify its own 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.750
 now and especially on this topic 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.660
 I really don't see the reason anyway 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.709
 if there were any developments 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.569
 personally i am trying in all 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.739
 ways to unlock this menu but I think 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.020
 that I will never succeed 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.870
 however if there should be developments 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.239
 on this less hidden and so on 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.790
 surely I will keep you informed now vi 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.540
 I leave the video that I slightly 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.690
 modified to make it a little more 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.970
 pleasant but I remind you that if the video 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.280
 you liked it I got it from knight two 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.680
 face mac.com the link can be found in 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.580
 description having said this I greet you 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.580
 good video
