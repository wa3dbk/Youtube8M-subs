yesterday<00:05:04.310> one<00:05:04.550> of<00:05:04.580> my<00:05:04.730> kills<00:05:04.970> how<00:05:05.210> much<00:05:05.360> who

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
yesterday one of my kills how much who

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.300 
yesterday one of my kills how much who
dad<00:05:05.750> that<00:05:05.960> was<00:05:06.200> pretty<00:05:06.470> decent<00:05:06.650> I<00:05:06.920> think<00:05:07.190> I

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
dad that was pretty decent I think I

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.760 
dad that was pretty decent I think I
mean<00:05:07.460> I'm<00:05:08.000> absolute<00:05:08.840> at<00:05:08.960> bbm<00:05:09.410> so<00:05:09.620> if<00:05:09.710> I

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
mean I'm absolute at bbm so if I

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.680 
mean I'm absolute at bbm so if I
can<00:05:09.980> do<00:05:10.100> it<00:05:10.250> that<00:05:10.430> much<00:05:10.610> I'm<00:05:11.150> not<00:05:11.180> a<00:05:11.330> food<00:05:11.600> I

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
can do it that much I'm not a food I

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.570 
can do it that much I'm not a food I
think<00:05:11.870> anyone<00:05:12.140> can<00:05:12.320> do<00:05:12.410> it<00:05:12.530> though<00:05:13.220> I<00:05:13.250> was

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
think anyone can do it though I was

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.490 
think anyone can do it though I was
using<00:05:13.790> super<00:05:14.180> prayers<00:05:14.420> which<00:05:14.630> like<00:05:14.810> 40<00:05:15.170> K<00:05:15.290> each

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
using super prayers which like 40 K each

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.610 
using super prayers which like 40 K each
GL<00:05:16.250> I<00:05:16.520> would<00:05:17.450> see<00:05:17.630> exactly<00:05:17.720> how<00:05:18.170> many<00:05:18.230> I<00:05:18.410> have

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
melee method is a lot quicker but twelve

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.680 
melee method is a lot quicker but twelve
minutes<00:05:28.190> and<00:05:28.310> forty<00:05:28.640> seconds<00:05:29.060> in<00:05:29.210> combat<00:05:29.660> not

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
then Rises six will be the same and then

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.200 
then Rises six will be the same and then
once<00:06:18.530> I<00:06:18.680> have<00:06:18.710> those<00:06:19.100> out<00:06:19.340> of<00:06:19.370> the<00:06:19.520> way<00:06:19.550> and<00:06:19.880> I

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:53.879 
through or bands that is currently my

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:56.629 
through or bands that is currently my
statics<00:06:54.270> piece<00:06:54.479> so<00:06:54.750> it<00:06:55.470> was<00:06:55.590> at<00:06:55.710> 23<00:06:56.250> millage

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 
statics piece so it was at 23 millage

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:58.040 
statics piece so it was at 23 millage
twenty<00:06:56.879> three<00:06:57.030> point<00:06:57.270> something<00:06:57.419> mail<00:06:57.810> from

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
twenty three point something mail from
