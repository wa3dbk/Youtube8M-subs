00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.920
 other by let's start sn2 it more 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.520
 most like a traditional 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.009
 official joystick which 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.319
 shipped playstation is made in 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.020
 some black buttons 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.429
 coloring that is, they are labeled 1234 then 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.740
 There is a computer in games for a while 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.340
 very handy there sometimes in tips on 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.579
 receptions 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.340
 It is the numbers that they are drawing pictures 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:03.319
 claire button home button start turbo 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:05.420

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.209
 r2 here connector 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.030
 Charging here indicator joystick 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.370
 works fine or to connect 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.959
 will need it for example a computer 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.590
 connect extra without uranium and 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.980
 connect named yuizbi 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.620
 the next joystick is defender n 2 or 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.630
 1 he has such a pig bone 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.340
 roughly talking about joysticks both 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.709
 equally on both will be the same 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.239
 battery lasts about a day 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.430
 games just grab ie curls don't 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.200
 need on the second day I recommend 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.500
 all the same from his pages fierce 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.290
 fights 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.390
 all the same put the joystick charges 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.650
 so that there is no problem action 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.390
 the elements are all the same that is they 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.940
 repeat a little changed button 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.299
 and here the indicator is displayed so all 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.950
 element levels are the same for both 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.410
 joystick looks quite impressive 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.569
 good lessons and soft-touch coverage 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.209
 no discomfort of the hand 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.510
 sweat enjoy playing to the full 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.430
 possible but i think sit and listen 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.799
 idle chatter in me is so interesting 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.709
 let's try running mortal kombat 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:12.019
 and try to play this joystick 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.200
 compare which one is more convenient which are 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.200
 features 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.140
 naturally we already test it 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.140
 now we will continue 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.109
 we can 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.099

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.470
 until we have hair 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:25.150

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.660

 A little softer opportunity feature 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.860
 many models even refused softer 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.580
 so graceful and gamut that external 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.910

 Dzhoseki performed excellent creaking and backlash 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.500
 There are no details for working and playing with 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.560
 these joysticks no problems running 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.060
