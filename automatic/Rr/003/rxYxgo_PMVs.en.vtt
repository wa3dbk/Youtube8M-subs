there's another take the other pad this

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:32.750 
there's another take the other pad this
one<00:00:56.390> firm<00:00:57.800> matching

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:40.020 

that's<00:01:33.760> one<00:01:35.790> ticket<00:01:36.790> on<00:01:38.640> find<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.790> crew

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030

that's<00:01:40.570> right<00:01:40.780> yeah<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:43.150> put<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.950> edge

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.410 

and<00:01:54.040> you<00:01:54.190> start<00:01:54.520> to<00:01:54.670> rotate<00:01:54.850> it<00:01:59.970> okay<00:02:00.970> when<00:02:01.330> it

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
and you start to rotate it okay when it

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.750 
and you start to rotate it okay when it
gets<00:02:01.540> kind<00:02:01.780> of<00:02:01.810> tough<00:02:02.020> you<00:02:02.220> pull<00:02:03.220> in<00:02:03.400> a<00:02:03.430> little

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
gets kind of tough you pull in a little

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.469 
gets kind of tough you pull in a little
bit<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.160> idea<00:02:06.400> is<00:02:06.460> it's<00:02:06.640> on<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:10.209> change

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
bit and the idea is it's on just change

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.410 
bit and the idea is it's on just change
the<00:02:10.630> pads<00:02:11.430> stop

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.660 

took<00:02:16.960> a<00:02:17.050> minute<00:02:17.290> in<00:02:17.380> 43<00:02:17.800> seconds<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.460> wasn't

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
took a minute in 43 seconds and I wasn't

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.430 
took a minute in 43 seconds and I wasn't
even<00:02:18.910> really<00:02:19.120> going<00:02:19.510> fast<00:02:19.810> because<00:02:20.080> I<00:02:20.290> got<00:02:20.410> a

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
even really going fast because I got a

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.340 
even really going fast because I got a
camera<00:02:20.740> sitting<00:02:21.190> right<00:02:21.310> in<00:02:21.340> front<00:02:21.460> of<00:02:21.700> me<00:02:21.790> so

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
camera sitting right in front of me so

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.170 
camera sitting right in front of me so

they're really firm actually they're
deeper<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.890> like<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.790> other<00:02:54.910> video<00:02:55.180> shows

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
deeper and like the other video shows

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.900 
deeper and like the other video shows
they<00:02:55.660> really<00:02:55.959> they<00:02:56.890> vibrate<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.280> lot<00:02:57.459> they're

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910

recommend the pad change
one<00:03:04.090> other<00:03:04.240> note<00:03:05.730> this<00:03:06.730> cable<00:03:07.300> is<00:03:08.020> probably

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
one other note this cable is probably

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.050 
one other note this cable is probably
the<00:03:08.860> nicest<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.459> I've<00:03:09.580> seen<00:03:11.490> on<00:03:12.490> any<00:03:12.700> set<00:03:12.940> of

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
the nicest that I've seen on any set of

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.720 
the nicest that I've seen on any set of
headphones<00:03:13.209> I<00:03:13.690> mean<00:03:14.080> high<00:03:14.230> end<00:03:14.470> ones<00:03:14.620> too

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
headphones I mean high end ones too

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.210 
headphones I mean high end ones too
but<00:03:16.090> reading<00:03:16.360> on<00:03:16.630> how<00:03:16.870> they<00:03:17.050> made<00:03:17.290> it<00:03:17.590> they<00:03:18.010> did

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
but reading on how they made it they did

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.030 
but reading on how they made it they did
a<00:03:18.250> special<00:03:18.690> way<00:03:19.690> of<00:03:19.720> heating<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.260> metals<00:03:20.709> when

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
a special way of heating the metals when

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.070 
a special way of heating the metals when
they<00:03:21.160> put<00:03:21.370> this<00:03:21.519> together<00:03:21.700> so<00:03:22.269> I<00:03:22.480> think<00:03:22.959> the

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
they put this together so I think the

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.410 
they put this together so I think the
possibility<00:03:23.680> for<00:03:23.830> this<00:03:23.980> kinking<00:03:24.610> becoming

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
possibility for this kinking becoming

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.920 
possibility for this kinking becoming
damages<00:03:26.110> a<00:03:26.769> little<00:03:27.340> higher<00:03:27.580> than<00:03:27.940> in<00:03:28.690> regular

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
damages a little higher than in regular

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.560 
damages a little higher than in regular
cords<00:03:29.530> so<00:03:29.890> I<00:03:29.920> think<00:03:30.190> it's<00:03:30.489> outstanding<00:03:30.730> but

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
cords so I think it's outstanding but

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.390 
cords so I think it's outstanding but
pay<00:03:31.750> attention<00:03:32.200> don't<00:03:32.350> roll<00:03:32.620> over<00:03:32.650> this<00:03:33.190> thing

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
pay attention don't roll over this thing

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.890 
pay attention don't roll over this thing
or<00:03:33.580> anything<00:03:33.760> like<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.450> would<00:03:34.720> be<00:03:34.780> a

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
or anything like that that would be a

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.670 
or anything like that that would be a
huge<00:03:35.110> problem<00:03:35.489> these<00:03:36.489> are<00:03:36.640> beautiful<00:03:36.970> cans<00:03:37.209> I

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
huge problem these are beautiful cans I

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.710 
huge problem these are beautiful cans I
test<00:03:38.680> them<00:03:38.769> out<00:03:38.860> all<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:39.250> time<00:03:39.430> against<00:03:40.420> all

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
test them out all the time against all

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.840 
test them out all the time against all
kinds<00:03:41.080> of<00:03:41.140> cans<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:41.709> you<00:03:42.640> know<00:03:45.000> April<00:03:46.739> 29th

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
kinds of cans and you know April 29th

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.259 
kinds of cans and you know April 29th
2014

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
2014

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.190 
2014
these<00:03:49.420> are<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:49.690> kings<00:03:49.900> of<00:03:50.140> bass<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:53.019> don't

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
these are the kings of bass you don't

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:02.930 
these are the kings of bass you don't
gotta<00:03:53.410> like<00:03:53.709> it<00:03:53.980> but<00:03:54.209> that's<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.420> way<00:03:55.570> it<00:03:55.720> is

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.940 

why
