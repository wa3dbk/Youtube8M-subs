that use jig saws that they can produce

some pretty appalling cuts in terms of

some pretty appalling cuts in terms of
wavy<00:01:40.950> sided<00:01:41.610> cuts<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.479> some<00:01:42.689> cases<00:01:42.930> this

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
wavy sided cuts and in some cases this

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.020 
wavy sided cuts and in some cases this
can<00:01:43.290> even<00:01:43.500> mean<00:01:43.829> scrapping<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.460> perfectly<00:01:44.880> good

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
can even mean scrapping a perfectly good

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.200 
can even mean scrapping a perfectly good
wood<00:01:45.270> worktop<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.380> example<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:48.030> course

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
wood worktop for example and of course

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.389 
wood worktop for example and of course
that<00:01:48.600> all<00:01:48.720> costs<00:01:48.930> money<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.500> if<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.220> can<00:01:50.369> just

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
that all costs money so if I can just

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.740 
that all costs money so if I can just
show<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:50.909> gearbox<00:01:51.180> from<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.759> 135<00:01:53.759> we've

teeth<00:01:57.390> on<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.469> cut<00:01:59.369> myself<00:01:59.490> and

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
teeth on it so that I cut myself and

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.450 
teeth on it so that I cut myself and
well<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.229> show<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.469> what<00:02:01.860> happens<00:02:02.250> then

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
well just show you what happens then

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.670 
well just show you what happens then
when<00:02:02.610> we<00:02:02.729> insert<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.210> blade<00:02:03.390> if<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.200> simply

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
when we insert the blade if we simply

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.550 
when we insert the blade if we simply
plug<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.520> blade<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.060> SDS<00:02:07.020> system<00:02:07.409> which

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
plug the blade in the SDS system which

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.499 
plug the blade in the SDS system which
everyone<00:02:07.920> loves<00:02:07.950> now<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.789> pretty<00:02:08.970> common

tool<00:02:13.810> free<00:02:14.410> blade<00:02:14.920> installation<00:02:15.670> system<00:02:16.060> is

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
tool free blade installation system is

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.660 
tool free blade installation system is
that<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:17.230> do<00:02:17.440> tend<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.770> get<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.190> little<00:02:18.370> bit<00:02:18.580> of

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
that you do tend to get a little bit of

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.070 
that you do tend to get a little bit of
movement<00:02:18.940> in<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:19.390> blade<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:19.810> think<00:02:19.990> you

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
movement in the blade and I think you

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.500 
movement in the blade and I think you
can<00:02:20.230> see<00:02:20.410> that<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:20.950> blade<00:02:21.130> is<00:02:21.460> able<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.880> waggle

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
can see that the blade is able to waggle

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.810 
can see that the blade is able to waggle
back<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:22.840> forth<00:02:23.050> quite<00:02:23.350> a<00:02:23.380> bit<00:02:23.650> even<00:02:23.920> in<00:02:24.550> spite

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
back and forth quite a bit even in spite

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.580 
back and forth quite a bit even in spite
of<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.060> roller<00:02:25.270> guide<00:02:25.480> without<00:02:26.290> any

for and this now limits the movement of
the<00:03:05.650> blade<00:03:06.750> considerably<00:03:07.750> there<00:03:08.260> are<00:03:08.380> other

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
the blade considerably there are other

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.110 
the blade considerably there are other
systems<00:03:08.950> on<00:03:09.100> the<00:03:09.190> market<00:03:09.220> like<00:03:09.700> this<00:03:09.880> which

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
systems on the market like this which

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.910 
systems on the market like this which
normally<00:03:10.480> involved<00:03:10.840> very<00:03:11.080> small<00:03:11.350> allen<00:03:11.709> key

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
normally involved very small allen key

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.550 
normally involved very small allen key
but<00:03:12.850> very<00:03:13.330> quickly<00:03:13.540> leads<00:03:14.080> to<00:03:14.230> a<00:03:14.260> sense<00:03:14.440> of

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
but very quickly leads to a sense of

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.020 
but very quickly leads to a sense of
human<00:03:14.800> failure<00:03:15.130> on<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.430> part<00:03:15.459> of<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.820> user

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
human failure on the part of the user

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.060 
human failure on the part of the user
and<00:03:16.420> they<00:03:16.989> stop<00:03:17.200> they<00:03:17.470> stop<00:03:17.709> using<00:03:17.890> that

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
and they stop they stop using that

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.810 
and they stop they stop using that
system<00:03:18.400> so<00:03:19.269> it's<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.600> pretty<00:03:20.200> much<00:03:20.489> user<00:03:21.489> proof

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
system so it's a pretty much user proof

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.000 
system so it's a pretty much user proof
very<00:03:22.480> easy<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.870> use<00:03:23.050> just<00:03:23.080> press<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.590> button<00:03:23.709> and

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
very easy to use just press a button and

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.160 
very easy to use just press a button and
then<00:03:24.670> you've<00:03:24.820> got<00:03:25.030> precision<00:03:25.840> control

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
then you've got precision control

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.710 
then you've got precision control
working<00:03:26.560> for<00:03:26.739> you<00:03:26.830> on<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.400> GST<00:03:28.090> 135
