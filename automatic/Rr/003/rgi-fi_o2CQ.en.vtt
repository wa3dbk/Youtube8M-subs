00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
chapters some of them have been named

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.389 
chapters some of them have been named
some<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.420> them<00:00:30.539> haven't<00:00:30.779> been<00:00:30.869> named<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.529> now

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
some of them haven't been named I now

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.670 
some of them haven't been named I now
need<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.700> make<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:32.969> lot<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.329> menus<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.170> link<00:00:34.410> up

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
need to make a lot of menus to link up

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.299 
need to make a lot of menus to link up
to<00:00:35.219> those<00:00:35.430> chapters<00:00:36.230> now<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.260> could<00:00:37.649> drag<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.219> a

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
to those chapters now I could drag in a

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.369 
to those chapters now I could drag in a
menu<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.730> then<00:00:38.879> do<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.120> one<00:00:39.270> at<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> time<00:00:39.809> but

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
menu and then do it one at a time but

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.080 
menu and then do it one at a time but
there's<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.620> nicer<00:00:40.890> way<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.399> doing<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.850> and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
there's a nicer way of doing it and

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.729 
there's a nicer way of doing it and
that's<00:00:43.050> by<00:00:43.260> using<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.930> create<00:00:45.930> chapter

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
that's by using this create chapter

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.369 
that's by using this create chapter

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
caused a couple of problems because in

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.750 
caused a couple of problems because in
changing<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:19.330> words<00:05:20.310> it's<00:05:21.310> made<00:05:21.490> the<00:05:21.580> buttons

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
changing the words it's made the buttons

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.340 
changing the words it's made the buttons
a<00:05:21.940> bit<00:05:22.060> bigger<00:05:22.300> and<00:05:22.900> I've<00:05:23.020> got<00:05:23.170> some

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
a bit bigger and I've got some

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.200 
a bit bigger and I've got some
collisions<00:05:23.890> here<00:05:24.160> on<00:05:24.400> certain<00:05:24.910> buttons

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
collisions here on certain buttons

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.230 
collisions here on certain buttons
because<00:05:25.540> those<00:05:25.690> words<00:05:25.870> have<00:05:26.080> got<00:05:26.230> bigger<00:05:26.440> so

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
because those words have got bigger so

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.170 
because those words have got bigger so
maybe<00:05:28.240> I<00:05:28.330> need<00:05:28.390> to<00:05:28.570> select<00:05:28.810> those<00:05:29.140> buttons<00:05:30.180> go

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
maybe I need to select those buttons go

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.480 
maybe I need to select those buttons go
and<00:05:31.540> change<00:05:31.960> the<00:05:32.290> type<00:05:32.500> style<00:05:32.800> to<00:05:33.100> something

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
and change the type style to something

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.290 
and change the type style to something
else<00:05:33.880> a<00:05:34.680> bit<00:05:35.680> smaller<00:05:36.010> maybe<00:05:36.280> once<00:05:37.180> you've

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
else a bit smaller maybe once you've

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.030 
else a bit smaller maybe once you've
created<00:05:37.510> all<00:05:37.900> these<00:05:38.020> menus<00:05:38.470> you<00:05:38.650> really<00:05:38.920> do

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
created all these menus you really do

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.880 
created all these menus you really do
have<00:05:39.190> to<00:05:39.310> go<00:05:39.430> through<00:05:39.640> and<00:05:39.730> look<00:05:39.850> at<00:05:39.970> them<00:05:40.890> just

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
have to go through and look at them just

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.020 
have to go through and look at them just
in<00:05:41.980> case<00:05:42.040> something<00:05:42.520> like<00:05:42.550> that<00:05:42.700> has<00:05:43.000> happened

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
in case something like that has happened

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.670 
in case something like that has happened
you<00:05:43.480> know<00:05:43.540> buttons<00:05:43.900> have<00:05:44.050> been<00:05:44.080> colliding<00:05:44.620> or

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
you know buttons have been colliding or

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.650 
you know buttons have been colliding or
so<00:05:44.860> on<00:05:44.980> but<00:05:45.760> it's<00:05:45.940> a<00:05:45.970> very<00:05:46.120> easy<00:05:46.210> way<00:05:46.510> of

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
so on but it's a very easy way of
