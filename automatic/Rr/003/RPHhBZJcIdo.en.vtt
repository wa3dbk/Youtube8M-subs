this that I believe is actually really
cool<00:02:30.510> from<00:02:30.690> touch'<00:02:30.959> is<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.500> even<00:02:32.069> though<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
cool from touch' is that even though the

cool from touch' is that even though the
packaging<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.239> smaller<00:02:33.599> it's<00:02:34.260> still<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.980> same

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
because it it's designed in a way that

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.530 
because it it's designed in a way that
it<00:02:53.010> won't<00:02:53.280> like<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.670> powder<00:02:53.880> won't<00:02:54.209> leak

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
it won't like the powder won't leak

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.180 
it won't like the powder won't leak
everywhere<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.140> will<00:02:55.230> spill<00:02:55.530> every<00:02:55.769> anywhere

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
everywhere and will spill every anywhere
