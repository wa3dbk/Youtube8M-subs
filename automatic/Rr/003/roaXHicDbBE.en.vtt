different<00:00:18.779> shape<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.170> first<00:00:19.410> couple<00:00:19.590> ones

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800

that<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.100> did<00:00:20.279> kind<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.180> look<00:00:21.240> like<00:00:21.359> eggs<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.199> I

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
that it did kind of look like eggs and I

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.710 
that it did kind of look like eggs and I
was<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.830> guess<00:00:22.859> going<00:00:23.220> through<00:00:23.340> my<00:00:23.580> my<00:00:24.119> pre

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
was I guess going through my my pre

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
kind of a round thing here and I just

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.990 
kind of a round thing here and I just

actually<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.010> rounded<00:00:44.460> edge<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
actually is this rounded edge on the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.840 
actually is this rounded edge on the
bottom<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.780> file<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.140> flat<00:00:46.440> here<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.950> had<00:00:47.730> to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
bottom the file it flat here I had to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.700 
bottom the file it flat here I had to
heal<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> nice<00:00:48.809> sharp<00:00:49.289> cutting

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.090 
heal so I have a nice sharp cutting
point<00:00:51.379> but<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:52.890> honed<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:53.670> sharp<00:00:54.239> and

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
point but it's honed and it's sharp and

demo<00:00:57.780> here<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:59.190> lathe<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.760> set<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.059> run<00:01:00.149> at<00:01:00.329> 500

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
demo here the lathe is set to run at 500

demo here the lathe is set to run at 500
rpm<00:01:01.469> not<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:01.980> fast<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.550> we'll<00:01:03.539> see<00:01:03.690> if<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.899> can

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
rpm not so fast and we'll see if I can

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.399 
rpm not so fast and we'll see if I can
do<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.229> without<00:01:04.500> getting<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:05.070> catch<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:09.409> always

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
do this without getting a catch I always

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.870 
do this without getting a catch I always
seem<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.860> have<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.159> biggest<00:01:11.280> problem<00:01:11.580> with

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
seem to have the biggest problem with

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.060 
seem to have the biggest problem with
catches<00:01:12.270> when<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.420> first<00:01:12.750> present<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> tool<00:01:13.799> to

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
catches when I first present the tool to

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.910 
catches when I first present the tool to
the<00:01:14.189> legs<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.700> I'm<00:01:15.210> trying<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.140> do<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.740> by

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
the legs so I'm trying to do that by

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.859 
the legs so I'm trying to do that by
presenting<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.430> much<00:01:17.580> higher<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.210> rubbing

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
presenting it much higher and rubbing

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.969 
presenting it much higher and rubbing
much<00:01:19.080> more<00:01:19.619> before<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.210> swing<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.330> down<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:22.830> get

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
much more before I swing it down and get

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.050 
much more before I swing it down and get
that<00:01:23.009> he'll<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.580> contact

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
that he'll to contact

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.639 
that he'll to contact
I'm<00:01:25.119> telling<00:01:25.479> animation<00:01:26.110> you<00:01:26.320> how<00:01:26.470> we'll

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
I'm telling animation you how we'll

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.969 
I'm telling animation you how we'll
catch<00:01:26.920> a<00:01:27.070> nice<00:01:27.430> shading<00:01:27.909> one<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:29.020> then<00:01:29.829> you

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
catch a nice shading one and then you

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.170 
catch a nice shading one and then you
try<00:01:30.220> to<00:01:30.250> keep<00:01:30.460> a<00:01:30.610> soon<00:01:34.439> going<00:01:35.439> like<00:01:35.680> that

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
try to keep a soon going like that

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
bloody position for me is always a

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.380 
bloody position for me is always a
problem<00:01:38.799> that<00:01:38.920> i<00:01:39.009> built<00:01:39.490> my<00:01:39.670> latest<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.210> with

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
problem that i built my latest and with

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.609 
problem that i built my latest and with
one<00:01:40.539> of<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.720> legs<00:01:40.869> kind<00:01:41.259> of<00:01:41.380> in<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.530> way

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
one of the legs kind of in the way

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.260 
one of the legs kind of in the way
didn't<00:01:42.280> realize<00:01:42.549> that<00:01:42.729> when<00:01:42.850> they<00:01:42.939> built<00:01:43.149> the

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
didn't realize that when they built the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:53.720 
didn't realize that when they built the
stand<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:45.090> gotta<00:01:46.090> step<00:01:46.450> around

practice<00:02:31.170> this<00:02:32.170> is<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.970> incredibly<00:02:33.970> useful

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
practice this is a incredibly useful

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.450 
practice this is a incredibly useful
tool<00:02:34.660> but<00:02:34.960> it<00:02:35.080> does<00:02:35.260> take<00:02:35.500> there<00:02:35.980> is<00:02:36.100> a<00:02:36.130> bit<00:02:36.370> of

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
tool but it does take there is a bit of

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.580 
tool but it does take there is a bit of
a<00:02:36.520> learning<00:02:36.640> curve<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.240> but<00:02:37.510> biggest<00:02:38.470> thing

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
a learning curve to it but biggest thing

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.110 
a learning curve to it but biggest thing
I<00:02:38.680> found<00:02:38.860> is<00:02:39.070> just<00:02:39.250> not<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.520> be<00:02:39.640> afraid<00:02:39.820> of<00:02:39.940> it

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
I found is just not to be afraid of it

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.930 
I found is just not to be afraid of it
and<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:41.410> catches<00:02:41.800> aren't<00:02:42.040> so<00:02:42.160> dramatic<00:02:42.670> in<00:02:42.820> my

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
and the catches aren't so dramatic in my

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.790 
and the catches aren't so dramatic in my
opinion<00:02:43.270> because<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.870> just<00:02:44.020> bounces<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.620> tool

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
opinion because it just bounces the tool

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.190 
opinion because it just bounces the tool
back<00:02:45.070> away<00:02:45.760> from<00:02:45.820> me<00:02:46.090> not<00:02:46.630> like<00:02:46.780> on<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:46.990> bowl

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
back away from me not like on a bowl

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.500 
back away from me not like on a bowl
when<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.590> tool<00:02:47.830> can<00:02:48.010> go<00:02:48.910> up<00:02:49.030> like<00:02:49.270> this<00:02:49.450> and

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
when the tool can go up like this and

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.140 
when the tool can go up like this and
ball<00:02:50.200> comply<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.680> pieces<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.640> find<00:02:52.000> that

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
ball comply the pieces and I find that

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.150 
ball comply the pieces and I find that
the<00:02:52.600> catches<00:02:52.990> on<00:02:53.140> rear<00:02:53.380> while<00:02:53.560> exciting

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
the catches on rear while exciting

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.780 
the catches on rear while exciting
aren't<00:02:54.370> nearly<00:02:54.610> as<00:02:54.730> dangerous<00:02:55.620> yet<00:02:56.620> anyway

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:07.400
