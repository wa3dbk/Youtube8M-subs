00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.830 
he's actually changing the hose from one
of<00:00:20.770> our<00:00:20.860> liquid<00:00:21.250> nitrogen<00:00:21.610> tanks<00:00:22.119> here<00:00:22.300> to

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
of our liquid nitrogen tanks here to

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.300 
of our liquid nitrogen tanks here to
another<00:00:23.080> one<00:00:23.380> so<00:00:23.619> you<00:00:23.710> can<00:00:23.740> see<00:00:24.099> he<00:00:24.279> is

employing all of the highest technology
safety<00:00:29.189> procedures<00:00:30.189> that<00:00:30.610> would<00:00:31.210> be<00:00:31.419> used<00:00:31.689> for

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
safety procedures that would be used for

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.520 
safety procedures that would be used for
a<00:00:32.230> procedure<00:00:33.160> like<00:00:33.310> this<00:00:34.200> including<00:00:35.200> very

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
a procedure like this including very

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.479 
a procedure like this including very
large<00:00:35.829> oven<00:00:36.220> mitts<00:00:36.430> on<00:00:36.730> one<00:00:37.420> of<00:00:37.630> his<00:00:37.750> hands<00:00:38.489> his

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
large oven mitts on one of his hands his

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.430 
large oven mitts on one of his hands his
left<00:00:39.850> hand<00:00:41.579> all<00:00:42.579> right<00:00:42.820> so<00:00:43.090> he<00:00:43.239> is<00:00:43.440> unscrewing

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
left hand all right so he is unscrewing

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.069 
left hand all right so he is unscrewing
the<00:00:44.649> hose<00:00:45.040> with<00:00:45.640> a<00:00:45.670> crescent<00:00:46.239> wrench<00:00:46.300> that<00:00:46.929> he

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
the hose with a crescent wrench that he

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.959 
the hose with a crescent wrench that he
is<00:00:47.170> applying<00:00:47.559> the<00:00:47.949> second<00:00:48.429> glove<00:00:48.670> and

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
is applying the second glove and

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:50.729 
is applying the second glove and
unscrewing<00:00:49.870> it<00:00:50.019> the<00:00:50.170> rest<00:00:50.350> of<00:00:50.500> the<00:00:50.590> way<00:00:50.710> by

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
unscrewing it the rest of the way by

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.319 
unscrewing it the rest of the way by
hand<00:00:51.929> so<00:00:52.929> maybe<00:00:53.769> when<00:00:54.010> alex<00:00:54.339> is<00:00:54.519> done<00:00:54.850> changing

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
hand so maybe when alex is done changing

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.840 
hand so maybe when alex is done changing
the<00:00:55.480> hose<00:00:55.629> I<00:00:55.870> can<00:00:56.079> ask<00:00:56.289> him<00:00:56.589> whether<00:00:57.370> we've

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
the hose I can ask him whether we've

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.989 
the hose I can ask him whether we've
finished<00:00:58.420> one<00:00:58.960> tank<00:00:59.320> and<00:00:59.589> we<00:01:00.100> still<00:01:00.399> have<00:01:00.670> our

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:00.999 
finished one tank and we still have our

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:03.450 
finished one tank and we still have our
two<00:01:01.449> tanks<00:01:01.839> and<00:01:02.260> we<00:01:02.440> still<00:01:02.649> have<00:01:02.829> four<00:01:03.129> tanks

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
two tanks and we still have four tanks

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.600 
two tanks and we still have four tanks
to<00:01:03.609> go<00:01:04.170> or<00:01:05.170> whether<00:01:05.440> it<00:01:05.650> is<00:01:05.800> for<00:01:06.070> tanks<00:01:06.460> that

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
to go or whether it is for tanks that

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.180 
to go or whether it is for tanks that
were<00:01:06.760> through<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:07.330> two<00:01:07.990> tanks<00:01:08.320> left<00:01:08.500> to<00:01:08.710> go<00:01:08.860> so

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
were through and two tanks left to go so

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.710 
were through and two tanks left to go so
actually<00:01:09.880> it<00:01:09.940> should<00:01:10.000> be<00:01:10.150> pretty<00:01:10.270> easy<00:01:10.390> to

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
actually it should be pretty easy to

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.930 
actually it should be pretty easy to
tell<00:01:10.750> yeah<00:01:11.350> that<00:01:11.530> seems<00:01:11.710> full<00:01:12.010> okay<00:01:12.670> so<00:01:12.730> it

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
tell yeah that seems full okay so it

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.390 
tell yeah that seems full okay so it
looks<00:01:13.120> like<00:01:13.180> we're<00:01:13.510> on<00:01:13.630> to<00:01:13.930> tank<00:01:14.590> number<00:01:15.040> three

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
looks like we're on to tank number three

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.030 
looks like we're on to tank number three
and<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.810> is<00:01:16.960> for<00:01:17.140> all<00:01:17.200> these<00:01:17.470> guys<00:01:17.740> to

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
and that is for all these guys to

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.730 
and that is for all these guys to
continue<00:01:18.610> their<00:01:18.820> liquid<00:01:19.240> nitrogen

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740
