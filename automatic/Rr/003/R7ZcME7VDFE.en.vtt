00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
one's about forty megabytes let's see so

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.600 
one's about forty megabytes let's see so
you<00:01:54.990> once<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.350> download<00:01:55.679> that<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:56.399> have<00:01:56.490> to

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
you once you download that you have to

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.460 
you once you download that you have to
download<00:01:56.759> them<00:01:57.179> all<00:01:57.329> before<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.929> can<00:01:58.170> do<00:01:58.289> this

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
download them all before you can do this

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.469 
download them all before you can do this
because<00:01:58.770> then<00:01:59.100> once<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.369> strip<00:01:59.759> extract<00:02:00.299> it

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
because then once you strip extract it

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.010 
because then once you strip extract it

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
they'll put it all together so then once

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.679 
they'll put it all together so then once
you<00:02:04.170> do<00:02:04.289> that<00:02:04.319> you<00:02:04.679> do<00:02:04.890> have<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.189> ssh<00:02:05.689> people

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
you do that you do have to ssh people

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.210 
you do that you do have to ssh people
know<00:02:06.750> how<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.840> do<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.020> refer<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.890> one<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.160> my

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
know how to do that refer to one of my

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.559 
know how to do that refer to one of my
other<00:02:08.310> videos<00:02:08.690> so<00:02:09.950> what<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.069> do<00:02:11.250> it's<00:02:12.060> located
