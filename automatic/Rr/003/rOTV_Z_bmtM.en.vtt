00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.200
 collecting care and storage e 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.570
 useful to keep at home in a vase or the 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.700
 garden oregano plants here I explain the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.560
 care you need this perennial 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.920
 appreciated for its characters 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.289
 medicinal and spice a plant 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.539
 oregano can be productive for about 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.760
 five years for which I recommend you that 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.980
 divide and four-year-old insole when 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.199
 lost to have another with them 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.010
 features as there are around 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.530
 20 varieties oregano supports need the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.140
 sun and frost even if the leaves can 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.820
 become red from the cold 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.420
 Origanum irrigation does not require much 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.850
 water 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.399
 if the water may seem excessive mushrooms 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.500
 and rotting vegetable waste so 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.079
 don't go with water when you are 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.539
 look at the withered leaves 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.030
 bevilacqua attention clay soils 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.609
 in sos load it is planted in 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.649
 garden pot so that the water in 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.760
 excess from the bottom hole and not yes 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.500
 accumulates there the oregano bonato is not 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.049
 too demanding in terms of 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.090
 fertilization but it is recommended to do 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.460
 a couple of questions a year if 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.560
 planted in the ground to recover later 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.320
 strong collections 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.600
 the recommended and the wind release if 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.180
 you use potting soil is possible 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.659
 use every month from early spring 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.909
 at the end of September at the time of mass 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.090
 abode should also improve the 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.540
 soil with manure with post compost 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.299
 sleep manure or other organic fertilizers 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.390
 if you use the burrows incorporates medium 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.460
 kg per square meter collected e 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.829
 preservation of oregano for dry 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.710
 frozen picks up and preferably 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.320
 leaves in summer when grown 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.149
 commercially they are between one and three cuts 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.390
 per year between late spring and 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.759
 the beginning of autumn is possible 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.070
 cut with scissors or almost kill 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.340
 half the ground floor of flowers and of 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.590
 regrow everything after the material 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.910
 dried is cut to extract 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.040
 moisture and ensure its conservation 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.680
 prepare in clusters 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.750
 spend upside down in a ventilated area 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.719
 and shaded provided that the 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.480
 chosen position is less than 35 degrees 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:25.700
 celsius that if exceeded will lose 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.219
 some of their re ecsin charles then 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.590
 when it is very dry shredded e 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:33.370
 stored in containers sealed in 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.439
 a cool, dry place 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.480
 multiplication of oregano oregano 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:41.090
 can be multiplied by three 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.260
 seed or such seed methods and kills 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:49.280
 all three are very easy to do 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:52.609
 first dividing tuft and the most comfortable e 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.799
 easy to reach new copies e 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:57.470
 separate the mother plant into pieces 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:00.530
 each carrying a portion of roots 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.169
 with land must be done with 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.359
 slightly damp soil in order not to 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:08.930
 collapse the root and the roots can 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.310
 be peeled to make the division e 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.750
 practiced in autumn 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:17.120
 at the beginning of spring by cuttings in 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.870
 spring it is possible to cut into pieces 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.409
 copper about 15 centimeters long 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.840
 radical to make them invaded and trays 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:31.790
 once caught transplanted into jars 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.040
 single and half or third from seeds the offspring 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.260
 may be progenia and may not have 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.540
 the good qualities that the mother plant is 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.169
 they are therefore more desirable to others 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.169
 two methods
