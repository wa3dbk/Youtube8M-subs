00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.450
 welcome to renovate your bathroom 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.860
 and like all words I am in the bathroom 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.440
 a very small old bathroom without it 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.170
 tiling on the floor may live in salty 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.390
 as is still a lot and often 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.250
 apartments and it is also a whole 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.960
 small bathroom 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.380
 will try to give a small impression 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.710
 my stunt is difficult because it is so small 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.529
 is 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:35.340
 but here I see an old path with 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:39.300
 a very very showerhead and here in the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.980
 The sink is so small that it is 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.230
 bathroom 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.870
 and if you had such a bathroom and you wanted it 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.020
 something with it then something must happen with it 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.879
 You finally do this in three ways 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.820
 they have bathroom buildings and that has three 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.590
 very different cost center and there 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.530
 then this article ibook about we a 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.289
 video by you hopes 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.449
 if you find this bathroom really too small it 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.939
 and your robot and walk-in shower and a bathtub 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.140
 and a toilet and we really like this space 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.869
 too small and then you have to look for 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.260
 another room in the house to a new one 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.869
 make bathroom and that is one 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.119
 proper intervention that does not go alone 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.140
 organize this space in my demolition 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.740
 as 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.030
 very small well fight room 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.590
 maybe a dressing room one 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.509
 walk-in-closet because that is it on the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.509
 good floor to his bedroom 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.930
 but then you have the cost of it 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.430
 demolish this bathroom 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.369
 I have to go to a different place 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.700
 houses bedroom on offroad seem to 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.730
 make the bathroom there after then one 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.190
 piece and 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.040
 so have a bedroom less in the house 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.380
 with a possible sale later you have 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.970
 really less yield as a result 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.100
 look that bath new bathroom can do a lot 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.480
 must make but the state an hour from 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.850
 all 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.760
 for example 3 room home instead 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.220
 from 4 room home in a fair 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.890
 bedroom home 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.970
 so that would be a big drawback 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.070
 other items will very well 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.990
 bathroom lasted and especially for yourself 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.000
 it can be very luxurious 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.180
 add warts on its own then so small 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.950
 bathroom itself as hot well that piece the 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.260
 most expensive variants really need piping 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.910
 we will drag and everything new and 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.500
 apply to the other spaces and 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.520
 probably you have to floor that 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.160
 below too 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.540
 pipe duct now make water supply 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.020
 have one 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.900
 and sewage drain if you have something less 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.490
 do expensive then you go a bathroom 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.510
 these renovate 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.580
 that means now new tile work 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.860
 now toilet and if it's all on 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.200
 the same place is the one 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.370
 reasonable to oversee the headline costs 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.940
 of course you are already going to a new tile 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.760
 put on the floor and I assume and bring it 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.920
 piping concealed in the wall here 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.840
 sit walking 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.040
 well that is the middle variant and the 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.810
 cheapest variant really one 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.670
 budget variant 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.860
 I would advise immediately but as one 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.230
 for little money to build can 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.760
 be a solution to the tiles 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.550
 Paint 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.040
 so just clean it properly on your there 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:22.140
 sometimes and there are leaks that are straight 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:26.110
 keep on on hand rules for how long 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.989
 that yes on the buses 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.690
 stand mine from a few years to 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.040
 more than 10 years 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.950
 I now have two years to 10 years of experience 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.980
 really remains beautiful but we know the 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.800
 the technology advances you and the 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.120
 plastic technology too and if you like that 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.160
 does then i would like choosing 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.710
 a counter for 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.000
 on the ground to get your all their child away 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.700
 to get 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.690
 that guidance by insight and the bath and 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.510
 a toilet are everywhere 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.720
 functional the sticker then had to do 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.370
 and therefore the most inexpensive variant 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.650
 so basically it with three choices for it 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.080
 renovating your bathroom with all 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.720
 three very different price tags 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.190
 well and i will explain this article 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.970
 what is involved with all three 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.970
 variants
