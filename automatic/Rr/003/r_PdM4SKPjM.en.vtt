00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
flow it together you're kind of like a

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.750 
flow it together you're kind of like a
like<00:03:35.380> a<00:03:35.410> manufacturer<00:03:36.130> you<00:03:36.250> want<00:03:36.430> to<00:03:36.520> make<00:03:36.640> it

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760

like a manufacturer you want to make it
a<00:03:36.849> big<00:03:37.420> process<00:03:37.690> so<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.530> it<00:03:38.650> goes<00:03:38.770> real<00:03:38.950> well

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
a big process so and it goes real well

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.580 
a big process so and it goes real well
like<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:39.340> so<00:03:39.910> and<00:03:40.180> then<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.959> painting<00:03:41.380> and

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
like that so and then the painting and

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
like that so and then the painting and
then<00:03:41.709> from<00:03:41.890> painting<00:03:42.280> it<00:03:42.370> goes<00:03:42.580> to<00:03:42.880> to<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:43.959> I

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
then from painting it goes to to the I

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.130 
then from painting it goes to to the I
guess<00:03:45.610> you<00:03:45.730> could<00:03:45.880> call<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.239> pretty<00:03:46.870> part

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
guess you could call the pretty part
