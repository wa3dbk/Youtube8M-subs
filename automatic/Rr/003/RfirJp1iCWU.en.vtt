00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.199 
again very very simple add-on very
brilliant<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.780> use<00:02:26.959> now<00:02:27.680> one<00:02:28.610> thing<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:28.910> didn't

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
brilliant to use now one thing I didn't

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.550 
brilliant to use now one thing I didn't
point<00:02:29.450> out<00:02:29.770> which<00:02:30.770> is<00:02:30.920> really<00:02:31.069> useful<00:02:31.640> is<00:02:31.849> a

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
point out which is really useful is a

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.860 
point out which is really useful is a
function<00:02:33.560> that<00:02:33.890> automatically<00:02:34.610> detects<00:02:35.120> what

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
function that automatically detects what

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.410 
function that automatically detects what
to<00:02:36.050> do<00:02:36.200> with<00:02:36.380> an<00:02:36.500> item<00:02:36.830> when<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.069> for<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:37.520> so<00:02:38.180> we

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
to do with an item when you for it so we

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.800 
to do with an item when you for it so we
get<00:02:38.510> some<00:02:38.750> more<00:02:39.250> silver<00:02:40.250> leaf<00:02:40.610> just<00:02:40.910> for<00:02:41.720> this

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
get some more silver leaf just for this

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.570 
get some more silver leaf just for this
example<00:02:42.200> again<00:02:42.470> so<00:02:42.920> much<00:02:43.100> about<00:02:43.340> another

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
example again so much about another

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.190 
example again so much about another
stack<00:02:43.880> is<00:02:44.120> less<00:02:44.330> than<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.569> goal<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:45.170> we<00:02:46.959> run<00:02:47.959> down

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
stack is less than a goal so we run down

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.610 
stack is less than a goal so we run down
to<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.560> mailbox<00:02:51.790> open<00:02:52.790> up<00:02:52.880> that<00:02:53.030> sort<00:02:53.300> I<00:02:53.630> see

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
to the mailbox open up that sort I see

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.660 
to the mailbox open up that sort I see
at<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.739> bottom<00:02:54.890> it<00:02:55.459> says<00:02:55.489> varied<00:02:56.090> app<00:02:56.330> now

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
at the bottom it says varied app now

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.720 
at the bottom it says varied app now
what<00:02:58.670> this<00:02:58.790> will<00:02:58.850> quite<00:02:59.180> often<00:02:59.390> say<00:02:59.810> on

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
what this will quite often say on

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.660 
what this will quite often say on
prospector<00:03:01.730> or<00:03:02.260> deed<00:03:03.260> greens<00:03:03.769> etc<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.549> will
