00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
that side to over here where the lower

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.770 
that side to over here where the lower
garden<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.640> those<00:00:36.300> chicks<00:00:36.600> can

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
garden is so that the those chicks can

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.270 
garden is so that the those chicks can
run<00:00:36.930> around<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.350> eat<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.649> weeds<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.100> eat<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
run around and eat the weeds and eat the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.490 
run around and eat the weeds and eat the
seeds<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.820> scratch<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.300> up<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.200> it

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
seeds and scratch it up and and it

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.479 
seeds and scratch it up and and it
because<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.770> still<00:00:40.890> going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.070> be<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> couple

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
because it still going to be a couple

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.400 
because it still going to be a couple
probably<00:00:42.390> at<00:00:42.480> least<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.690> week<00:00:42.870> maybe<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:43.290> can

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
probably at least a week maybe we can

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.430 
probably at least a week maybe we can
have<00:00:43.559> before<00:00:43.829> i<00:00:43.860> can<00:00:44.040> plant<00:00:44.960> and<00:00:45.960> tell<00:00:46.289> it

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
have before i can plant and tell it

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.770 
have before i can plant and tell it
because<00:00:46.710> it's<00:00:46.829> still<00:00:46.980> too<00:00:47.129> damp<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.579> hill<00:00:47.820> so

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
because it's still too damp the hill so

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.720 
because it's still too damp the hill so
i<00:00:48.809> figured<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:50.039> would<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.399> set<00:00:50.579> them

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
i figured that we would just set them

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.100 
i figured that we would just set them
chickens<00:00:51.059> loose<00:00:51.239> out<00:00:51.420> there<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.840> let<00:00:51.989> them

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
chickens loose out there and let them

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.840 
chickens loose out there and let them
eat<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.440> grass<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.010> eat<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> weeds<00:00:53.399> and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
eat the grass and eat the weeds and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.090 
eat the grass and eat the weeds and
scratch<00:00:54.149> around<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.800> clean<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.920> up<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.070> little

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
scratch around and clean it up a little

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.849 
scratch around and clean it up a little
bit<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.520> us<00:00:56.670> before<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:57.719> go<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.350> planting<00:00:58.739> down

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
bit for us before we go to planting down

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.729 
bit for us before we go to planting down
there<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.399> hopefully<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.300> going<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.510> work

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
there so hopefully it's going to work

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.290 
there so hopefully it's going to work
and<00:01:01.739> as<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.460> can<00:01:02.609> see<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.879> chickens<00:01:03.180> are

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
and as you can see the chickens are

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.660 
and as you can see the chickens are
getting<00:01:03.539> there<00:01:03.750> getting<00:01:03.780> pretty<00:01:04.110> big<00:01:04.670> it

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
getting there getting pretty big it

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.240 
getting there getting pretty big it
won't<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.689> won't<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.900> much<00:01:07.560> much<00:01:07.830> longer<00:01:08.100> i

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
won't be it won't be much much longer i

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.370 
won't be it won't be much much longer i
hope<00:01:08.580> before<00:01:09.390> they're<00:01:09.720> going<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> be<00:01:10.229> big

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
hope before they're going to be big

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.330 
hope before they're going to be big
enough<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.650> where<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.830> start<00:01:11.130> butchering

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
enough to where we can start butchering

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.780 
enough to where we can start butchering
them<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.729> put<00:01:11.880> them<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.119> freezer<00:01:13.790> three

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
them and put them in the freezer three

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.969 
them and put them in the freezer three
or<00:01:14.880> four<00:01:15.030> weeks<00:01:15.380> we're<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.619> kind<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.799> playing

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
or four weeks we're just kind of playing

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.859 
or four weeks we're just kind of playing
about<00:01:17.159> here<00:01:17.340> i<00:01:17.369> don't<00:01:17.430> know<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:18.479> i<00:01:18.600> said<00:01:18.750> this

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
about here i don't know like i said this

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.359 
about here i don't know like i said this
is<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.049> first<00:01:19.229> time<00:01:19.380> I've<00:01:19.590> ever<00:01:19.619> raised<00:01:20.040> black

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.480 
is the first time I've ever raised black
australorp<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:22.170> I'm<00:01:22.710> not<00:01:22.890> real<00:01:23.070> familiar<00:01:23.100> with

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
australorp so I'm not real familiar with

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.980 
australorp so I'm not real familiar with
how<00:01:23.580> fast<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:24.030> grow<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.450> they<00:01:24.570> seem<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.810> be

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
how fast they grow but they seem to be

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.300 
how fast they grow but they seem to be
growing<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.590> doing<00:01:25.799> good<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.159> getting

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
growing and doing good and getting

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.340 
growing and doing good and getting
bigger<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:27.000> see<00:01:27.180> compared<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.780> their<00:01:27.930> water

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
bigger you see compared to their water

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.370 
bigger you see compared to their water
kanameer<00:01:29.250> feed<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.960> you<00:01:30.960> know<00:01:31.049> how<00:01:31.170> much

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
kanameer feed can you know how much

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.899 
kanameer feed can you know how much
bigger<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.770> they<00:01:31.890> are<00:01:32.070> there<00:01:32.490> they're

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
bigger that they are there they're

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.050 
bigger that they are there they're
probably<00:01:33.200> maybe<00:01:34.200> two<00:01:34.560> pounds<00:01:34.799> right<00:01:35.220> now<00:01:35.250> so

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
probably maybe two pounds right now so

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.420 
probably maybe two pounds right now so
hopefully<00:01:37.009> another<00:01:38.009> couple<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.310> weeks

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
hopefully another couple of weeks

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.130 
hopefully another couple of weeks
they'll<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:38.790> up<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.600> know<00:01:39.659> four<00:01:40.020> and

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
they'll be up to the you know four and
