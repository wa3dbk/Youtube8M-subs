00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.059 

I<00:00:02.060> think<00:00:03.060> Kool<00:00:03.330> Herc<00:00:03.689> when<00:00:04.589> he<00:00:04.710> started

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
I think Kool Herc when he started

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.450 
I think Kool Herc when he started
bringing<00:00:05.670> his<00:00:05.940> house<00:00:06.210> jams<00:00:06.839> out<00:00:07.370> into<00:00:08.370> the

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
bringing his house jams out into the

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.970 
bringing his house jams out into the
street<00:00:08.880> where<00:00:09.870> everybody<00:00:10.320> could<00:00:10.530> enjoy<00:00:10.559> the

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
street where everybody could enjoy the

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.740 
street where everybody could enjoy the
music<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.550> everybody<00:00:12.150> could<00:00:12.269> enjoy<00:00:12.330> that

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
music and everybody could enjoy that

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.369 
music and everybody could enjoy that
type<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.110> atmosphere<00:00:13.730> it<00:00:14.730> became<00:00:15.150> more<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:16.170> a

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
type of atmosphere it became more of a

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.990 
type of atmosphere it became more of a
community<00:00:16.830> coming<00:00:17.190> together<00:00:17.460> than<00:00:17.910> a

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
community coming together than a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
community coming together than a
community<00:00:18.180> being<00:00:18.660> divided<00:00:19.080> we<00:00:19.980> didn't<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:20.460> a

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
community being divided we didn't have a

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.120 
community being divided we didn't have a
place<00:00:22.020> where<00:00:22.199> we<00:00:22.260> could<00:00:22.470> all<00:00:22.650> come<00:00:22.890> together

place where we could all come together

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:32.540 
place where we could all come together
and<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.880> think<00:00:24.119> that's<00:00:24.300> what<00:00:24.449> hip-hop<00:00:24.689> did<00:00:31.550> we

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
and I think that's what hip-hop did we

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.479 
and I think that's what hip-hop did we
will<00:00:32.700> go<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> our<00:00:33.030> clubs<00:00:33.360> which<00:00:33.660> was<00:00:34.020> no<00:00:34.890> YMCA
