00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hey people yes here is hunting again 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.490
 pc and I have with you today 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.790
 little interesting and that is 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.200
 you know the drill in response has been 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.269
 since there were already the first 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.700
 Challenges where the players are so 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.890
 have done with glitches and what it 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.380
 everything bike or did it continue then 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.990
 one thought only with melee only with 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.390
 Full is only with the worst weapon 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.699
 or without weapons and so on and that 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.800
 Whole does not take an end 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.599
 because next player has something very good again 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.940
 made very interesting and talk 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.950
 I'm not even aware that the endboss 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.480
 level 35 within a minute 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.750
 No, that's not what I mean 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.820
 but the ndr 420 he did it 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.010
 the arena level 34 with a level 33 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.000
 solo to clear the ball 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.750
 in the end I think 37 or 38 times 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.390
 died 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.879
 at 39 smarts then worked out but now 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.160
 really completely solo made with level 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.960
 33 as he has the show this time 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.770
 corresponding 34er greed for that 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.439
 to try at all 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.689
 march he has managed it 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.790
 original video thank you of course 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.960
 that you are allowed to use it 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.880
 of course, in the description below 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.159
 just look at it 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.869
 He showed in there in the video there 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.670
 Of course he runs the whole thing 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.259
 and he also shows that 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.360
 reward he got and that 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.299
 equipment used that was 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.189
 especially raid greed of trotha good 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.729
 that's what most of them are running with 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.400
 rum 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.650
 In any case , one can only say 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.970
 incredible skills so really strong 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.500
