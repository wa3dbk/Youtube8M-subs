playing this groove you want to get the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.530 
playing this groove you want to get the
feel<00:01:29.930> of<00:01:29.960> it<00:01:30.170> down<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:30.920> learn<00:01:31.100> it<00:01:31.310> count<00:01:32.000> it<00:01:32.150> 1

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.370 
into 2 pinda once you get the feel no
more<00:01:35.120> counting

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
more counting

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.529 
more counting
I<00:01:39.369> included<00:01:40.369> two<00:01:40.579> optional<00:01:41.119> hi-hat

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
I included two optional hi-hat

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.260 
I included two optional hi-hat
variations<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.469> and<00:01:43.130> B<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.579> the<00:01:43.729> reason<00:01:43.820> I<00:01:44.060> did

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
variations a and B and the reason I did

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.480 
variations a and B and the reason I did
that<00:01:44.299> is<00:01:44.689> because<00:01:45.200> some<00:01:45.740> people<00:01:45.770> might<00:01:46.220> be<00:01:46.399> at

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
that is because some people might be at

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.950 
that is because some people might be at
a<00:01:46.520> level<00:01:46.850> where<00:01:46.970> they<00:01:47.119> can<00:01:47.360> play<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.930> a

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
a level where they can play the a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.100 
a level where they can play the a
variation<00:01:48.890> some<00:01:49.429> people<00:01:49.700> might<00:01:49.850> be<00:01:50.110> not

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
variation some people might be not

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.630 
variation some people might be not
comfortable<00:01:51.500> with<00:01:51.590> that<00:01:51.770> and<00:01:51.979> B<00:01:52.130> would<00:01:52.369> work

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
comfortable with that and B would work

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.149 
comfortable with that and B would work
and<00:01:52.880> even<00:01:53.720> include<00:01:54.170> a<00:01:54.259> C<00:01:54.470> which<00:01:54.740> I<00:01:54.860> guess<00:01:55.039> would

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
and even include a C which I guess would

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.279 
and even include a C which I guess would
be<00:01:55.220> no<00:01:55.340> hi-hat<00:01:56.030> with<00:01:56.329> the<00:01:56.450> left<00:01:56.630> foot<00:01:56.840> at<00:01:56.929> all

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
be no hi-hat with the left foot at all

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.190 
be no hi-hat with the left foot at all
don't<00:01:58.039> let<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:59.299> hi-hat<00:01:59.689> stop<00:01:59.960> you<00:02:00.110> from

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
don't let the hi-hat stop you from

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.539 
don't let the hi-hat stop you from
playing<00:02:00.380> these<00:02:00.590> groups<00:02:00.920> so<00:02:01.189> if<00:02:01.280> you<00:02:01.340> want<00:02:01.490> to

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
playing these groups so if you want to
