00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.340
 hello and welcome to this new 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.630
 test this week it's greg that's getting 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.280
 ready for exercise hello agde 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.710
 hello the manual and who takes the 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.660
 flying new mercedes sl 350 with 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.660
 its 306 horsepower v6 engine 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.860
 first sight is ethically beautiful 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.900
 beautiful cars finishes a priori must 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.890
 see her in details now I am 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.169
 very attached to detail 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.110
 I really like the incrustations of 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:37.890
 chrome 1 which are listed on the on the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.480
 hood it gives him the racy side a very 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.170
 sporty that I love when people you 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.739
 rather classic almost already seen well 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.540
 that certainly re design and beautiful 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.910
 mercedes way rims how do you 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.440
 find the drawing of the back part 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.260
 I find well mercedes who has not 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.140
 changed to my eyes the back a little 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.739
 a little bit of a mess it played well that the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.360
 lights are well redraw beautiful little 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.030
 volume output anyway we consequent 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.270
 put a suitcase for 2 what so 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.000
 it's pretty good impression 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.330
 beautiful finish 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.220
 I really like aerators we will be a 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.130
 little in a plane with good visibility on 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:28.440
 the on the screen the navigation well 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.880
 pretty well comfortable seat adjustment 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.789
 we reach by hand very easily 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.310
 so on this model we have the pack 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.330
 roadster that includes the cards that 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.630
 you can have hot air in the 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.759
 neck 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.410
 a small net anti swirl that goes up and 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.300
 which goes down by electric control and 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.310
 then the panoramic roof offset a 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.580
 very good idea the little hot wind in 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.509
 the neck there especially when we roll a 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.770
 maybe in winter because it's worth 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.920
 still the shot I think to roll 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.209
 convertible even in winter to the mails 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:02.069
 contacts it's gone we feel that there is 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:03.390
 something to what then 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.000
 how is the handling of 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.989
 those and his 306 horses then 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.560
 306 horses 

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:13.250
 if they tell me not very honestly I 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.840
 the senses not I would say a good sedan 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.770
 rather than sporty nice car for 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.989
 go for a walk with madame and when 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.819
 I go into sport mode it's rather 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:28.230
 dynamic but we still feel the weight 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.700
 a point that is one of 300 kg of 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.830
 less would have been interesting it's going to be 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.510
 hard to remove them at two speeds which 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.170
 responds well as in mercedes and 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.930
 mercedes 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.190
 I already had the opportunity to roll that 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.570
 responds well it's pretty dynamic 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.220
 to conclude that is what you have 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.350
 less is the most appreciated about this is 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.290
 of 350 and manu is what I have least 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.120
 appreciated is the weight I have the most 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.650
 appreciated is the extraordinary comfort 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.330
 of this car very well thank you for 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.290
 your participation and the week 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.290
 next for a new try
