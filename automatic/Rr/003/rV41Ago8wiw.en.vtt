00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.729 

so<00:00:38.719> first<00:00:38.960> of<00:00:39.109> all<00:00:39.170> all<00:00:39.230> right

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
so first of all all right

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.899 
so first of all all right
and<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.940> it<00:00:41.539> starts<00:00:41.929> off<00:00:42.109> with<00:00:42.530> an<00:00:43.070> E<00:00:43.339> and<00:00:43.579> it

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:43.909 
and and it starts off with an E and it

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:53.459 
and and it starts off with an E and it
goes<00:00:44.089> II<00:00:44.500> see<00:00:45.530> f<00:00:45.949> c/e<00:00:46.760> f<00:00:47.690> FC<00:00:48.699> 2<00:00:49.699> rakaat

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.420 

if<00:00:54.430> they<00:00:54.640> hook<00:00:54.850> up

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.970 

so<00:00:59.120> we<00:00:59.210> keep<00:00:59.420> it<00:00:59.600> in<00:00:59.630> this<00:00:59.870> sea<00:01:00.110> and<00:01:00.380> we<00:01:00.770> just

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
so we keep it in this sea and we just

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:10.510 
so we keep it in this sea and we just
roll<00:01:01.160> down<00:01:03.370> between<00:01:04.370> these<00:01:04.520> other

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.390 

at<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.610> same<00:01:11.820> time<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:12.210> app<00:01:12.330> about<00:01:12.980> these<00:01:13.980> two

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
at the same time as app about these two

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.710 
at the same time as app about these two
keys<00:01:14.730> they'd<00:01:15.150> be<00:01:15.450> flat<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
keys they'd be flat and the a

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.790 
keys they'd be flat and the a
alternating<00:01:18.720> as<00:01:18.870> we're<00:01:19.020> doing<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.350> or<00:01:19.560> going

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
alternating as we're doing this or going

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:29.590 
alternating as we're doing this or going
the<00:01:25.190> same<00:01:26.190> time<00:01:26.400> is

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.760 

we<00:01:29.900> roll<00:01:30.140> down<00:01:30.320> these<00:01:30.500> five<00:01:30.800> so<00:01:31.040> that

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.410 

and<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:37.010> can<00:01:37.160> just<00:01:37.370> roll<00:01:37.730> up<00:01:37.880> a<00:01:37.970> see<00:01:38.180> if<00:01:38.300> you

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
and you can just roll up a see if you

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:49.280 
and you can just roll up a see if you
light<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:40.390> then<00:01:41.390> soak<00:01:42.230> up

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.010 

I'm<00:01:50.290> gonna<00:01:50.770> stay<00:01:50.950> live<00:01:51.160> it<00:01:51.310> and<00:01:52.150> then<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.690> next

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
I'm gonna stay live it and then the next

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.570 
I'm gonna stay live it and then the next
section<00:01:53.230> there's<00:01:53.800> got<00:01:53.980> the<00:01:54.070> same<00:01:54.250> sort<00:01:54.520> of

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
section there's got the same sort of

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:04.410 
section there's got the same sort of
pattern<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.990> sir<00:01:56.230> goes<00:01:57.660> so<00:01:58.660> good<00:02:03.120> so<00:02:04.120> look<00:02:04.270> at

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
pattern this sir goes so good so look at

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:13.380 
pattern this sir goes so good so look at
the<00:02:06.270> G<00:02:07.270> F<00:02:07.979> B<00:02:08.979> flat<00:02:09.009> F<00:02:11.040> then<00:02:12.040> we've<00:02:12.220> got<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:12.850> B

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
the G F B flat F then we've got the a B

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:26.300 
the G F B flat F then we've got the a B
flat<00:02:13.690> B<00:02:13.990> flat<00:02:14.020> F<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:16.840> that

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.970 

so<00:02:27.310> after<00:02:27.550> there<00:02:29.550> I've<00:02:30.550> got<00:02:30.610> them<00:02:31.000> me<00:02:31.960> I<00:02:32.200> mean<00:02:32.560> D

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
so after there I've got them me I mean D

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:56.730 
so after there I've got them me I mean D
laughs<00:02:40.680> mother<00:02:41.680> B<00:02:42.310> flat<00:02:42.640> F<00:02:44.970> C<00:02:45.970> F<00:02:46.870> so

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.410 

on<00:02:57.740> the<00:02:57.860> left-hand<00:02:58.190> -<00:02:58.400> that<00:02:58.550> fits<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.150> same

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
on the left-hand - that fits the same

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.320 
on the left-hand - that fits the same
similar<00:02:59.930> sort<00:03:00.680> of<00:03:00.830> pattern<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.460> the<00:03:02.120> first

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
similar sort of pattern to the first

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.780 
similar sort of pattern to the first
part<00:03:02.980> it's<00:03:03.980> got<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:06.830> same<00:03:07.070> time<00:03:07.310> is<00:03:07.550> we're

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
part it's got the same time is we're

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:20.300 
part it's got the same time is we're
doing<00:03:07.880> this

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:33.479 

so<00:03:21.310> although<00:03:21.489> in<00:03:21.760> E<00:03:22.800> flat<00:03:23.800> D<00:03:24.780> E<00:03:25.780> flat<00:03:26.020> D<00:03:32.099> I'm<00:03:33.099> get

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
so although in E flat D E flat D I'm get

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:52.649 
so although in E flat D E flat D I'm get
this<00:03:33.700> bit<00:03:33.880> will<00:03:34.030> go<00:03:37.080> go

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.360 

it's<00:03:53.659> wrong<00:03:53.840> if<00:03:54.049> I<00:03:54.170> get<00:03:54.379> really<00:03:54.590> slow<00:03:54.920> so<00:03:55.129> we

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
it's wrong if I get really slow so we

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:05.440 
it's wrong if I get really slow so we
got

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:20.640 

this<00:04:06.450> is<00:04:06.599> an<00:04:06.720> expert<00:04:07.170> to<00:04:07.500> Africa

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.610 

and<00:04:21.650> look<00:04:21.830> up<00:04:21.980> this<00:04:22.970> be<00:04:23.300> flap<00:04:23.630> than<00:04:24.170> the<00:04:24.440> D

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
and look up this be flap than the D

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
and look up this be flap than the D
together<00:04:28.870> then<00:04:29.870> we<00:04:29.990> go<00:04:30.170> D<00:04:30.680> F<00:04:31.010> G<00:04:33.400> we<00:04:34.400> drop<00:04:34.610> down

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
together then we go D F G we drop down

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:41.680 
together then we go D F G we drop down
to<00:04:35.240> the<00:04:35.930> a<00:04:35.960> so<00:04:36.500> it<00:04:36.650> will<00:04:39.430> keep<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.610> fgf<00:04:41.330> that

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
to the a so it will keep the fgf that

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:58.690 
to the a so it will keep the fgf that
will<00:04:41.810> change<00:04:41.990> that<00:04:42.140> to<00:04:42.320> C<00:04:42.700> so<00:04:43.700> there

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.600 

let's<00:04:59.700> do<00:04:59.880> it<00:04:59.940> again

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
let's do it again

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.090 
let's do it again
so<00:05:02.610> we've<00:05:02.760> got<00:05:03.000> on<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.050> left<00:05:04.260> hand

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:14.780 

yes<00:05:11.690> on<00:05:12.690> the<00:05:12.870> right<00:05:13.020> hand<00:05:13.280> at<00:05:14.280> the<00:05:14.310> same<00:05:14.550> time

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
yes on the right hand at the same time

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:24.570 
yes on the right hand at the same time
we<00:05:14.970> have<00:05:18.380> so<00:05:19.380> then<00:05:19.620> our<00:05:19.800> inverted<00:05:20.250> D<00:05:20.580> sus4

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:31.740 

they<00:05:25.580> were<00:05:25.759> for<00:05:26.059> the<00:05:26.119> whole<00:05:26.209> thing<00:05:26.449> too

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:44.400
