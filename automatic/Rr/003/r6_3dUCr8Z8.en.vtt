00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.949
 I want to ask an answer question yo 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.220
 I said that I will leave your questions 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.230
 there and well then to that we are going to notice already 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.900
 About two months ago, about the video 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.230
 the truth is too much but good 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.489
 late that's never as they say and good 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.430
 let's start now with the first 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.620
 questions our friend does not say but 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.840
 We are left, you tell me, you like chorizo 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.149
 long short the first thing I do not like the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.520
 Chorizo ​​has a very strange taste for me 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.469
 and the truth is that I do not like that much 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.160
 I like it, I'm like the long short one, 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.640
 I like nothing 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.410
 how old are you I have almost 15 what 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.000
 simple was August 5 and that 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.609
 Spain and from what part of Spain are you from? 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.320
 because I'm from a city called boss of 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.059
 the border of the province of Cádiz 7 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.820
 asking our friend says it 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.770
 jorge romo 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.920
 what advice would people give to improve 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.540
 the least vanguard so to improve in 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.030
 the warfare bread you have to play with 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.979
 try to keep a good rate for 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.930
 play with people better is worth listening 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.090
 this even though it seems 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.710
 context before day with better people 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.979
 learn more because these people by 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.810
 example makes of tron ​​south hampton all 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.450
 kind of things and you're seeing little to 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.460
 little what they are doing to improve your 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.490
 that's like in football basketball 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.229
 et cetera et cetera et cetera no and good if 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.300
 they put the market in the vanguard farc 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.369
 Well, they're not going to get it, so the 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.720
 teeth for 'they're not going to get me 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.110
 I would change hell for college in 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.640
 street and the truth is that not hell 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.649
 I have much appreciation in fact it is the only 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.060
 weapon that he used lately good 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.610
 lately because I do not play anymore it's almost 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.350
 Carlos 10 and power fans but already already from 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.940

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.619
 Question now says our friend sir

 iphone an ipad I have never had but 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.700
 I have thought to buy the iphone 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.780
 in which already in the future quite a 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.180

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.700
 Well, I'm left with a used one for now 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.030

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.780
 bus reader that looks a little bit 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.090

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.500
 it's the blond but only some videos do not 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.780
 but that is referring to blogs and 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.220
 some nonsense that he does and of 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.959
 gameplays so it's grown little more and 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.299

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.269

 all the people of Latin America that messi 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.640
 that follows me too much or I want to 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.470
 more Spaniards than Latin Americans but 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.240
 I think it 's the other way around but not good 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.020
 let's ask what you like most about 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.330
 youtube then the freedom you have for 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.550
 upload videos although already as 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.860
 has many subscribers like that if 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.510
 up is something own this kind one thing 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.270
 different from your channel like I do not 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.860
 they support what they should but good 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.780
 little by little it is getting better 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.050
 and you're already surpassing youtube and going to 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.969
 get more people more more of everything not 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.830
 I hope you have understood me next 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:58.990
 new question says Alejandro 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.300
 clear believe you think it exists 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.520
 illuminatis avalanches of cádiz you want that 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.219
 there are enlightened and men 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.889
 those are old conspiracies of the 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:11.830
 Maya and everything so I do not have very 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.900
 studied that subject but I suppose that 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.180
 it is clear that there is something there but it is not 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.639
 know do not have seven questions says 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.090
 andrew oviedo inspired youtube a 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:24.099
 I salute crack for it inspired me a lot 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.509
 that instructed me people say nothing to me 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:29.889
 inspired and willy kings inspired me vegeta 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.139
 666 inspired me and what we do in 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:36.009
 how much I really started on youtube 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:38.710
 because I like I like to go up to do 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:41.020
 videos I like to comment I like to avoid 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.029
 as I said before but I do not like it 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.669
 Take it as very close to my chest I do not know 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:48.069
 like to take it as something 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:51.009
 necessary because you end up with the government 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:53.380
 really good next question the 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:55.690
 says oscar 0 2 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.570
 in the next car you prefer with this 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:01.240
 suit or if the big exodus is for 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.530
 this question is old so it's very 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.900
 easy and say it because they have 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.700
 not confirmed but if I had 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.290
 asked if he had answered in that 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.870
 time I would have told you without that suit 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.790
 no doubt because to me the ex or suit is 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.370
 some things from the warfare bread kim not me 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.710
 they like nothing at all or it's okay that they do not 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.930
 you see a bit and such but you have innovated 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.180
 too much for this year to my opinion 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:25.660
 no and well then we go next but 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.700
 as a greeting and says vice verses how much 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.870
 was what they had acted warfare adn 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.690
 greeting forgiveness 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:36.040
 Greetings uncle how fierce to wear 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:38.710
 16 17 and since DNA is like about six 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.420
 few more takes very little really 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.740
 because it's that they only dedicate to 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.390
 beginning of the game I'm already leaving 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.210
 a little sideways but it was trying 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:49.620
 give him cane through we go to sack 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.620

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.530
 Fuck I'll never know how to say this name 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.110
 I mean seriously 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.480
 cris strokes says how many do we have 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:04.150
 I've said it before 15 and when thousands 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:06.130

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.740
 I do not know either I have it very calculated 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.360

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:39.710
