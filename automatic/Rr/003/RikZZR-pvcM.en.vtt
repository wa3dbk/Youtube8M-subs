00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.860
 my accident because I came fast 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.290
 seeing a speed that I had 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.840
 slowly it would not have happened then 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.610

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.350

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.250

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.680
 small fault unfortunately the tank 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.460

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.920
 this space that the slide warped right there 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.380
 it was not the droid he did he protected 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.630
 in a way that he did not break and did not 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.549

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.149
 there is little damage to the tank 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.530
 here the amazon on top the handlebar came to 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.710
 hit the pedal on the shift pedal 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.570

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.649

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.330

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.600

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.450
 did not do anything else will not help 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:24.180
 nÃ© motorcycle counted very strong and aac 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.050
 whole life in the surroundings of the 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.710
 moto 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.890
 This reason will tell you my brother. 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:36.990

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:41.100

 did not it lovely time tattoo 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.030
 the tattoo was strongly the helmet 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.930
 Another important thing is that we 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.730
 highlight the helmet here as it was 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.430
 Another thing, my luck was glove. 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.780
 I had forgotten to glove on 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:16.280
 lift to find glove and look only gives 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.860

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:24.720

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:28.050
 ossinho and acer and in the palm also right 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.870
 the two gloves spoke in the palm quite 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.989
 or the glove proved that it is super 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.470
 efficient my hands perfect 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.540
 only that I was the right jacket joe then 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.060
