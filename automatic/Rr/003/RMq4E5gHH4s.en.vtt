00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.539 

I'm<00:00:03.360> going<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.810> be<00:00:03.959> replicating<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.130> design<00:00:05.520> I

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
I'm going to be replicating a design I

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.390 
I'm going to be replicating a design I
saw<00:00:05.870> online<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:06.899> little<00:00:07.170> while<00:00:07.319> ago<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.770> one<00:00:08.280> of

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
saw online a little while ago of one of

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.790 
saw online a little while ago of one of
the<00:00:08.519> professional<00:00:09.450> ones<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:09.750> guess<00:00:09.929> I'm<00:00:10.590> not

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
the professional ones I guess I'm not

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.070 
the professional ones I guess I'm not
exactly<00:00:10.860> sure<00:00:11.550> what<00:00:11.670> brand<00:00:11.880> it's<00:00:12.120> made<00:00:12.599> by<00:00:12.750> but

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
exactly sure what brand it's made by but

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.799 
exactly sure what brand it's made by but
I<00:00:13.469> guess<00:00:13.650> here's<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.889> picture<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.509> and<00:00:15.509> it

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
I guess here's a picture of it and it

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.779 
I guess here's a picture of it and it
looks<00:00:16.020> just<00:00:16.109> super<00:00:16.650> simple<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.070> relatively

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
looks just super simple and relatively

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.910 
looks just super simple and relatively
easy<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.090> make<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:18.779> don't<00:00:19.260> this<00:00:19.619> doesn't

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
easy to make and you don't this doesn't

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.929 
easy to make and you don't this doesn't
even<00:00:20.039> look<00:00:20.160> like<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.400> need<00:00:20.520> any<00:00:20.699> machine

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
even look like you need any machine

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.970 
even look like you need any machine
tools<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.359> make<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.750> just<00:00:21.900> need<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.320> clamp

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
tools to make it you just need a clamp

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.679 
tools to make it you just need a clamp
or<00:00:23.189> some<00:00:23.369> sort<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.580> vice<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.119> can<00:00:24.240> bend<00:00:24.449> a

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
or some sort of vice that you can bend a

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.750 
or some sort of vice that you can bend a
chunk<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.140> aluminum<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.830> that's<00:00:26.609> what<00:00:26.699> I

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
chunk of aluminum in and that's what I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.330 
chunk of aluminum in and that's what I
picked<00:00:27.000> up<00:00:27.090> yesterday<00:00:28.010> it's<00:00:29.010> just<00:00:29.220> this

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
picked up yesterday it's just this

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.790 
picked up yesterday it's just this
three-foot<00:00:30.240> long<00:00:30.269> chunk<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.199> guess

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
three-foot long chunk of I guess

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.990

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.170 
one-inch wide
aluminum<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.809> then<00:00:34.260> for<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.530> weights<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:35.180> just

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
aluminum and then for the weights I just

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.840 
aluminum and then for the weights I just
went<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> hardware<00:00:36.780> store<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.079> picked<00:00:37.290> up

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
went to the hardware store and picked up

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.639 
went to the hardware store and picked up
half<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.000> kilo<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.899> cheapest<00:00:40.230> washers<00:00:40.559> I

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
half a kilo of the cheapest washers I

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.970 
half a kilo of the cheapest washers I
could<00:00:40.800> find<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.420> I'm<00:00:42.420> also<00:00:42.570> using<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:43.680> user

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
could find and I'm also using just user

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.380 
could find and I'm also using just user
just<00:00:44.280> really<00:00:44.550> standard<00:00:44.879> bolts<00:00:45.149> these<00:00:45.239> are

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
just really standard bolts these are

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.959 
just really standard bolts these are
quarter-inch<00:00:46.230> 20<00:00:47.070> threads<00:00:47.399> per<00:00:47.550> inch<00:00:47.610> and

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
quarter-inch 20 threads per inch and

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.690 
quarter-inch 20 threads per inch and
this<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.750> actually<00:00:49.020> what<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.829> little<00:00:50.100> tripod

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
this is actually what the little tripod

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.119 
this is actually what the little tripod
mounts<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> underside<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.770> cameras

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
mounts on the underside that the cameras

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.830 
mounts on the underside that the cameras
use<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.969> go<00:00:54.090> along<00:00:54.270> with<00:00:54.300> those<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.690> got<00:00:54.809> a

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
use and to go along with those I got a

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.869 
use and to go along with those I got a
bunch<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.079> wing<00:00:55.260> nuts<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.739> bunch<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.550> wing<00:00:56.699> nuts

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
bunch of wing nuts a bunch of wing nuts

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.029 
bunch of wing nuts a bunch of wing nuts
they're<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.300> few<00:00:57.899> bolts<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.350> then<00:00:58.800> for<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
they're a few bolts and then for the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.410 
they're a few bolts and then for the
actual<00:00:59.340> pivoting<00:00:59.850> system<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.329> bottom

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
actual pivoting system on the bottom

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.029 
actual pivoting system on the bottom
because<00:01:00.629> that's<00:01:00.780> what<00:01:00.989> really<00:01:01.140> matters<00:01:01.530> I've

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
because that's what really matters I've

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.529 
because that's what really matters I've
decided<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.489> try<00:01:03.059> out<00:01:03.180> one<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.390> these

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
decided to try out one of these

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.690 
decided to try out one of these
universal<00:01:04.110> joints<00:01:04.379> from<00:01:04.769> an<00:01:04.890> RC<00:01:05.189> car<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.519> mine

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
universal joints from an RC car of mine

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.850 
universal joints from an RC car of mine
and<00:01:05.909> with<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.990> combination<00:01:07.500> with<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.710> few

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and with this in combination with a few

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.719 
and with this in combination with a few
bearings<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.369> end<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.760> will<00:01:09.390> get<00:01:09.720> a

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
bearings on the end I will get a

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.679 
bearings on the end I will get a
basically<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> joint<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.150> will<00:01:12.330> pivot<00:01:12.630> around

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
basically a joint that will pivot around

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.330 
basically a joint that will pivot around
in<00:01:12.960> all<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> different<00:01:13.409> directions<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.979> spin

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
in all the different directions and spin

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.120 
in all the different directions and spin
at<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> same<00:01:14.790> time<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.619> should<00:01:16.920> work

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
at the same time so this should work

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.600 
at the same time so this should work
just<00:01:17.509> perfectly<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:19.259> here's<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.740> general

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
just perfectly so here's the general

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.340 
just perfectly so here's the general
design<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:21.060> figure<00:01:21.420> I'll<00:01:21.509> have<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> 4-inch<00:01:22.049> chunk

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
design a figure I'll have a 4-inch chunk

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.140 
design a figure I'll have a 4-inch chunk
down<00:01:22.500> here<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> handle<00:01:23.700> will<00:01:23.820> sit<00:01:24.000> on

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
down here that the handle will sit on

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.300 
down here that the handle will sit on
one<00:01:24.960> inch<00:01:25.080> chunks<00:01:25.229> separating<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> handle

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
one inch chunks separating the handle

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.179 
one inch chunks separating the handle

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
right on the top off here I'm just gonna

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.429 
right on the top off here I'm just gonna
throw<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.380> 1/8<00:01:32.250> inch<00:01:32.280> radius<00:01:32.670> circle<00:01:33.210> of

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
throw a 1/8 inch radius circle of

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.660 
throw a 1/8 inch radius circle of
aluminum<00:01:34.439> until<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.950> ends<00:01:37.220> as<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.340> was<00:01:38.460> bending

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
aluminum until it ends as I was bending

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.920 
aluminum until it ends as I was bending
it<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.060> vise<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.450> trying<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> give<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.900> a

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
it in the vise and trying to give it a

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.780 
it in the vise and trying to give it a
very<00:01:40.110> sharp<00:01:40.380> corner<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.890> heard<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.369> crunching

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
very sharp corner I heard this crunching

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.980 
very sharp corner I heard this crunching
noise<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.119> just<00:01:42.270> didn't<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.600> sound<00:01:42.720> very

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
noise it just didn't really sound very

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.020 
noise it just didn't really sound very
good<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.229> I've<00:01:43.320> decided<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.790> clamp<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.909> down<00:01:44.939> a

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
good so I've decided to clamp it down a

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.219 
good so I've decided to clamp it down a
bit<00:01:45.240> under<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.600> piece<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.869> wood<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.079> just

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
bit under this piece of wood and just

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.749 
bit under this piece of wood and just
bend<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.500> over<00:01:46.590> top<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.340> should<00:01:47.490> give<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.700> a

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
bend it over top and it should give it a

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.300 
bend it over top and it should give it a
sort<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.299> slightly<00:01:48.540> rounder<00:01:49.049> edge<00:01:49.770> give

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
sort of a slightly rounder edge give

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.719 
sort of a slightly rounder edge give
this<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.520> shot<00:01:51.799> no<00:01:52.799> don't<00:01:53.640> break<00:01:55.369> for<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.430> big<00:01:56.579> 8

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
this a shot no don't break for the big 8

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.100 
this a shot no don't break for the big 8
inch<00:01:56.759> radius<00:01:57.060> chunk<00:01:57.450> I'm<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:57.689> gonna<00:01:57.810> bend<00:01:57.990> it

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
inch radius chunk I'm just gonna bend it

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.080 
inch radius chunk I'm just gonna bend it
around<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.439> outside<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:58.890> pot<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.340> that

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
around the outside of this pot and that

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.470 
around the outside of this pot and that
should<00:02:00.240> give<00:02:00.390> me<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> nice<00:02:00.719> curve

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:11.780 

I<00:02:09.890> just<00:02:10.890> marked<00:02:11.070> out<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.190> bunch<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.490> holes<00:02:11.640> at

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
I just marked out a bunch of holes at

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.070 
I just marked out a bunch of holes at
the<00:02:11.940> permanent<00:02:12.660> marker

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
the permanent marker

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.390 
the permanent marker
they<00:02:13.470> were<00:02:13.560> spaced<00:02:13.770> about<00:02:13.920> an<00:02:14.130> inch<00:02:14.250> apart

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
they were spaced about an inch apart

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.680 
they were spaced about an inch apart
from<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.820> I<00:02:14.880> have<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.030> couple<00:02:15.210> really<00:02:15.450> close

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
from that I have a couple really close

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.420 
from that I have a couple really close
together<00:02:15.990> there<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.230> I'll<00:02:16.410> show<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.100> what<00:02:17.220> my

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
together there and I'll show you what my

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.400 
together there and I'll show you what my
plans<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:17.940> those<00:02:18.030> are<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.660> little<00:02:19.050> bit<00:02:19.230> later

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
plans for those are a little bit later

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.680 
plans for those are a little bit later
and<00:02:19.980> I've<00:02:20.130> got<00:02:20.490> some<00:02:20.640> more<00:02:20.730> up<00:02:20.880> here<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.540> can

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
and I've got some more up here so I can

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.750 
and I've got some more up here so I can
put<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.840> weight<00:02:22.020> out<00:02:22.170> front<00:02:22.560> if<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.770> need<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.070> then

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
put a weight out front if I need to then

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.220 
put a weight out front if I need to then
a<00:02:23.970> bunch<00:02:24.090> back<00:02:24.300> here<00:02:24.570> for<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.870> handle

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
a bunch back here for the handle

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.270 
a bunch back here for the handle
mounting<00:02:25.920> position<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.510> similarly<00:02:27.510> for<00:02:27.750> the

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
mounting position and similarly for the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.880 
mounting position and similarly for the
actual<00:02:29.280> camera<00:02:30.030> itself<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:31.110> again<00:02:31.710> I<00:02:31.740> have

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
actual camera itself and again I have

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:32.960 
actual camera itself and again I have
another<00:02:32.070> couple<00:02:32.310> holes<00:02:32.520> there<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.790> I'll<00:02:32.850> show

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
another couple holes there and I'll show

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.280 
another couple holes there and I'll show
you<00:02:33.000> what<00:02:33.150> I'm<00:02:33.240> using<00:02:33.390> those<00:02:33.570> for<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.110> little

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
you what I'm using those for in a little

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.100 
you what I'm using those for in a little
while<00:02:34.440> but<00:02:35.180> just<00:02:36.180> gonna<00:02:36.330> take<00:02:36.510> this<00:02:36.630> nail<00:02:36.840> and

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
while but just gonna take this nail and

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.210 
while but just gonna take this nail and
make<00:02:37.380> some<00:02:37.560> marks<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:37.920> drill<00:02:38.070> these<00:02:38.160> holes

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
make some marks and drill these holes

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:59.420 
make some marks and drill these holes
out

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.059 

I<00:02:59.870> said<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:01.170> would<00:03:01.379> explain<00:03:01.650> with<00:03:01.829> these<00:03:01.920> two

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
I said I would explain with these two

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.619 
I said I would explain with these two
little<00:03:02.219> holes<00:03:02.430> down<00:03:02.579> there<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.000> these<00:03:03.569> two

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
little holes down there and these two

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.229 
little holes down there and these two
corresponding<00:03:04.290> ones<00:03:04.469> up<00:03:04.620> top<00:03:04.739> or<00:03:04.950> four<00:03:05.099> and<00:03:05.400> I

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
corresponding ones up top or four and I

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.970 
corresponding ones up top or four and I
was<00:03:06.569> sort<00:03:06.689> of<00:03:06.750> thinking<00:03:06.870> about<00:03:07.049> this<00:03:07.319> quite<00:03:07.890> a

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
was sort of thinking about this quite a

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.280 
was sort of thinking about this quite a
bit<00:03:08.129> and<00:03:08.390> I'm<00:03:09.390> thinking<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:09.900> if<00:03:10.019> I<00:03:10.140> have<00:03:10.260> a

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
bit and I'm thinking that if I have a

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.660 
bit and I'm thinking that if I have a
bunch<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.650> weights<00:03:10.799> down<00:03:10.980> here<00:03:11.219> and<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.519> weight

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
bunch of weights down here and a weight

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.580 
bunch of weights down here and a weight
up<00:03:11.790> here<00:03:11.969> and<00:03:12.180> I'm<00:03:12.900> moving<00:03:13.140> this<00:03:13.290> thing<00:03:13.349> around

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
up here and I'm moving this thing around

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.199 
up here and I'm moving this thing around
from<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.129> handle<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:14.640> could<00:03:14.909> start<00:03:15.150> to

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
from the handle it could start to

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.240 
from the handle it could start to
balance<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.689> flex<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.989> little<00:03:16.170> bit<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:16.530> my

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
balance and flex a little bit so my

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.490 
balance and flex a little bit so my
solution<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.719> throw<00:03:19.139> a<00:03:19.200> piece<00:03:19.349> of

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
solution to that is to throw a piece of

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.209 
solution to that is to throw a piece of
paracord<00:03:20.900> through<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.349> top<00:03:22.560> two<00:03:22.739> holes<00:03:22.950> like

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:23.219 
paracord through the top two holes like

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:26.690 
paracord through the top two holes like
this<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:24.709> through<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.739> bottom<00:03:25.920> two<00:03:26.189> as<00:03:26.310> well

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
this and through the bottom two as well

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.250 
this and through the bottom two as well
and<00:03:26.790> then<00:03:27.480> I'll<00:03:27.569> put<00:03:27.689> it<00:03:27.780> in<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:27.900> bit<00:03:27.989> of<00:03:28.049> tension

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
and then I'll put it in a bit of tension

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.089 
and then I'll put it in a bit of tension
like<00:03:28.829> that<00:03:29.010> sort<00:03:29.219> of<00:03:29.310> like<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.459> bow<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.700> now<00:03:31.099> it

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
like that sort of like a bow and now it

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.129 
like that sort of like a bow and now it
doesn't<00:03:32.280> flex<00:03:32.549> nearly<00:03:33.299> as<00:03:33.389> much<00:03:35.870> it<00:03:36.870> may<00:03:36.989> look

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
doesn't flex nearly as much it may look

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.449 
doesn't flex nearly as much it may look
like<00:03:37.200> I've<00:03:37.409> done<00:03:37.530> a<00:03:37.590> lot<00:03:37.739> since<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.159> last<00:03:38.310> saw

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
like I've done a lot since you last saw

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.550 
like I've done a lot since you last saw
it<00:03:38.609> but<00:03:38.849> it's<00:03:39.000> actually<00:03:39.299> pretty<00:03:39.930> basic<00:03:40.169> I'll

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
it but it's actually pretty basic I'll

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.500 
it but it's actually pretty basic I'll
show<00:03:41.549> you<00:03:41.639> from<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.879> top<00:03:42.000> down<00:03:42.209> basically

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
show you from the top down basically

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.789 
show you from the top down basically
just<00:03:42.720> using<00:03:42.900> those<00:03:43.169> bolts<00:03:43.439> I<00:03:43.500> showed<00:03:43.680> you

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
just using those bolts I showed you

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.949 
just using those bolts I showed you
earlier<00:03:43.859> a<00:03:44.310> wing<00:03:44.519> nut<00:03:44.609> and<00:03:44.669> a<00:03:44.790> bolt<00:03:44.959> in

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
earlier a wing nut and a bolt in

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.629 
earlier a wing nut and a bolt in
combination<00:03:46.530> with<00:03:46.650> some<00:03:46.799> washers<00:03:47.189> and<00:03:47.430> some

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
combination with some washers and some

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.129 
combination with some washers and some
rubber<00:03:47.790> o-rings<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:48.450> found<00:03:48.659> it<00:03:48.870> in<00:03:48.930> my<00:03:48.959> basement

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
rubber o-rings I found it in my basement

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.229 
rubber o-rings I found it in my basement
and<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:50.250> couple<00:03:50.430> strips<00:03:50.669> of<00:03:50.819> electrical<00:03:51.209> tape

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
and a couple strips of electrical tape

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.559 
and a couple strips of electrical tape
up<00:03:51.480> top<00:03:51.659> just<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:52.260> make<00:03:52.409> a<00:03:52.439> camera<00:03:52.980> mount<00:03:53.579> the

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
up top just to make a camera mount the

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:55.190 
up top just to make a camera mount the
camera<00:03:54.750> itself

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
camera itself

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.559 
camera itself
and<00:03:55.349> then<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.219> attached<00:03:56.579> my<00:03:56.819> little<00:03:57.030> universal

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
and then I attached my little universal

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.920 
and then I attached my little universal
access<00:03:58.169> to<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:59.700> underside<00:04:00.060> of<00:04:00.120> this<00:04:00.359> thing

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
access to the underside of this thing

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.959 
access to the underside of this thing
and<00:04:01.109> just<00:04:01.919> to<00:04:02.250> have<00:04:02.370> it<00:04:02.400> set<00:04:02.609> up<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.849> way<00:04:02.939> I

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:02.969 
and just to have it set up the way I

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.180 
and just to have it set up the way I
showed<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.299> earlier<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.229> what<00:04:04.889> I've<00:04:04.979> done<00:04:05.069> is

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
showed you earlier and what I've done is

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.800 
showed you earlier and what I've done is
I<00:04:05.220> grabbed<00:04:05.430> some<00:04:05.609> electrical<00:04:06.030> tape<00:04:06.060> around

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
I grabbed some electrical tape around

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.449 
I grabbed some electrical tape around
the<00:04:06.989> joint<00:04:07.409> itself<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:08.040> put<00:04:08.190> some<00:04:08.310> rubber

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
the joint itself and put some rubber

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.099 
the joint itself and put some rubber
bands<00:04:08.699> around<00:04:08.879> there<00:04:09.150> this<00:04:09.659> just<00:04:09.870> gives<00:04:10.019> you

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
bands around there this just gives you

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.689 
bands around there this just gives you
some<00:04:10.319> kind<00:04:10.620> of<00:04:10.709> rotational<00:04:11.159> control<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:11.609> some

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
some kind of rotational control and some

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:13.159 
some kind of rotational control and some
side-to-side<00:04:12.030> control<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.750> just<00:04:12.780> stiffens

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
side-to-side control it just stiffens

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.210 
side-to-side control it just stiffens
everything<00:04:13.500> up<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.650> little<00:04:13.799> bit<00:04:13.979> so<00:04:14.129> I<00:04:14.159> can

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
everything up a little bit so I can

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.210 
everything up a little bit so I can
actually<00:04:14.609> move<00:04:14.699> it<00:04:14.849> back<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.150> forth<00:04:15.359> like

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
actually move it back and forth like

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.219 
actually move it back and forth like
that<00:04:17.220> and<00:04:17.609> I've<00:04:18.239> also<00:04:18.419> put<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.720> little<00:04:18.870> piece<00:04:19.139> of

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
that and I've also put a little piece of

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.229 
that and I've also put a little piece of
paracord<00:04:19.500> across<00:04:20.280> here<00:04:20.579> just<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.849> cinch<00:04:21.060> this

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
paracord across here just to cinch this

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.409 
paracord across here just to cinch this
up<00:04:21.419> so<00:04:21.599> I<00:04:21.630> don't<00:04:21.780> get<00:04:22.049> any<00:04:22.199> motion<00:04:23.130> like<00:04:23.970> that<00:04:24.000> I

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
up so I don't get any motion like that I

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.939 
up so I don't get any motion like that I
ran<00:04:24.659> out<00:04:24.780> of<00:04:24.810> nuts<00:04:25.020> and<00:04:25.199> bolts<00:04:25.289> so<00:04:25.590> I<00:04:25.620> just<00:04:25.800> had

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
ran out of nuts and bolts so I just had

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.189 
ran out of nuts and bolts so I just had
to<00:04:25.979> tape<00:04:26.310> on<00:04:26.490> some<00:04:26.729> weights<00:04:26.909> out<00:04:27.150> front<00:04:27.539> which

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
to tape on some weights out front which

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.629 
to tape on some weights out front which
seemed<00:04:28.409> to<00:04:28.500> work<00:04:28.590> pretty<00:04:28.650> well<00:04:28.949> just<00:04:29.220> doesn't

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
seemed to work pretty well just doesn't

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.240 
seemed to work pretty well just doesn't
look<00:04:29.729> very<00:04:29.759> good<00:04:30.030> and<00:04:30.270> then<00:04:31.050> what<00:04:31.860> I<00:04:31.889> had<00:04:32.070> to<00:04:32.159> do

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
look very good and then what I had to do

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.219 
look very good and then what I had to do
here<00:04:32.490> is<00:04:33.060> I<00:04:33.180> totally<00:04:33.479> neglected<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.020> fact

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
here is I totally neglected the fact

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:35.420 
here is I totally neglected the fact
that<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.440> camera<00:04:34.620> is<00:04:34.830> probably<00:04:35.159> going<00:04:35.310> to<00:04:35.370> be

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
that the camera is probably going to be

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.300 
that the camera is probably going to be
sort<00:04:36.270> of<00:04:36.360> thought<00:04:36.599> I<00:04:36.900> guess

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
sort of thought I guess

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.589 
sort of thought I guess
the<00:04:38.310> center<00:04:38.880> of<00:04:38.909> gravity<00:04:38.970> if<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.360> camera

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
the center of gravity if the camera

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.089 
the center of gravity if the camera
itself<00:04:39.810> is<00:04:39.960> going<00:04:40.080> to<00:04:40.139> be<00:04:40.229> off<00:04:40.320> center<00:04:40.560> and

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
itself is going to be off center and

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.399 
itself is going to be off center and
it's<00:04:41.669> somewhere<00:04:41.970> over<00:04:42.030> here<00:04:42.449> and<00:04:42.599> the<00:04:43.110> actual

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.409 
it's somewhere over here and the actual

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.439 
it's somewhere over here and the actual
tripod<00:04:43.889> mount<00:04:44.070> in<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:44.250> camera<00:04:44.550> is<00:04:44.610> right<00:04:44.759> in

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
tripod mount in the camera is right in

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.930 
tripod mount in the camera is right in
line<00:04:45.659> at<00:04:45.780> the<00:04:45.870> lens<00:04:46.080> so<00:04:46.320> make<00:04:47.099> sense<00:04:47.340> it's<00:04:47.849> a

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
line at the lens so make sense it's a

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.610 
line at the lens so make sense it's a
little<00:04:48.120> bit<00:04:48.210> off-center<00:04:48.630> but<00:04:48.659> I<00:04:48.780> didn't<00:04:49.500> take

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
little bit off-center but I didn't take

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.379 
little bit off-center but I didn't take
that<00:04:49.650> into<00:04:49.949> account<00:04:49.979> so<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.340> had<00:04:50.490> to<00:04:50.580> make<00:04:50.759> a<00:04:50.940> I

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
that into account so I had to make a I

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.719 
that into account so I had to make a I
just<00:04:51.720> cut<00:04:51.840> this<00:04:51.930> thing<00:04:52.020> out<00:04:52.229> of<00:04:52.320> wood<00:04:52.470> I<00:04:52.740> didn't

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
just cut this thing out of wood I didn't

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.010 
just cut this thing out of wood I didn't
have<00:04:53.849> any<00:04:54.000> aluminum<00:04:54.150> left<00:04:54.539> so<00:04:54.720> that's<00:04:54.900> why

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
have any aluminum left so that's why

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.629 
have any aluminum left so that's why
this<00:04:55.169> is<00:04:55.259> made<00:04:55.409> out<00:04:55.440> of<00:04:55.530> wood<00:04:55.740> it<00:04:56.310> doesn't<00:04:56.550> look

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
this is made out of wood it doesn't look

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.790 
this is made out of wood it doesn't look
too<00:04:56.759> bad<00:04:56.909> though<00:04:57.120> and<00:04:57.360> I<00:04:58.139> just<00:04:58.380> threw<00:04:58.770> some

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
too bad though and I just threw some

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.950 
too bad though and I just threw some
weights<00:04:59.099> out<00:04:59.220> there<00:04:59.430> and<00:04:59.699> this<00:05:00.150> chord<00:05:00.570> here<00:05:00.630> is

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
weights out there and this chord here is

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.659 
weights out there and this chord here is
again<00:05:01.259> just<00:05:01.440> to<00:05:01.500> prevent<00:05:01.710> it<00:05:01.889> from<00:05:01.919> vibrating

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
again just to prevent it from vibrating

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.279 
again just to prevent it from vibrating
too<00:05:02.849> much<00:05:03.030> because<00:05:03.270> I'm<00:05:03.539> quickly<00:05:03.780> finding

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
too much because I'm quickly finding

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.129 
too much because I'm quickly finding
that<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:05.039> one<00:05:05.340> flaw<00:05:05.610> with<00:05:05.880> this<00:05:06.210> design<00:05:06.870> here

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
that the one flaw with this design here

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.140 
that the one flaw with this design here
is<00:05:07.199> the<00:05:07.590> material<00:05:08.010> I<00:05:08.070> made<00:05:08.219> it<00:05:08.370> out<00:05:08.430> of<00:05:08.610> this

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
is the material I made it out of this

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.790 
is the material I made it out of this
aluminum<00:05:09.630> of<00:05:09.690> stuff<00:05:09.870> really<00:05:10.110> likes<00:05:10.380> to<00:05:10.529> flex

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
aluminum of stuff really likes to flex

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.580 
aluminum of stuff really likes to flex
back<00:05:11.039> and<00:05:11.070> forth

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
back and forth

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930 
so inside at the other side here's the

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.469 
so inside at the other side here's the
course<00:06:48.139> let's<00:06:48.349> see<00:06:48.530> how<00:06:48.740> those<00:06:48.919> look<00:06:49.240> so<00:06:50.240> what

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 
course let's see how those look so what

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.839 
course let's see how those look so what
I<00:06:50.509> will<00:06:50.690> say<00:06:50.840> about<00:06:50.870> this<00:06:51.229> is<00:06:51.520> it<00:06:52.520> definitely

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:52.849 
I will say about this is it definitely

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:54.100 
I will say about this is it definitely
did<00:06:53.030> stabilize<00:06:53.419> the<00:06:53.569> footage<00:06:53.840> you<00:06:53.930> can't

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
did stabilize the footage you can't

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.290 
did stabilize the footage you can't
argue<00:06:54.289> that<00:06:54.440> fact<00:06:54.740> and<00:06:55.520> it<00:06:55.759> looked<00:06:55.970> pretty

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300 
argue that fact and it looked pretty

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.570 
argue that fact and it looked pretty
nice<00:06:56.449> you<00:06:56.840> know<00:06:56.960> when<00:06:57.770> I<00:06:57.800> was<00:06:57.979> running<00:06:58.400> and

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:58.580 
nice you know when I was running and

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.339 
nice you know when I was running and
jumped<00:06:58.880> over<00:06:58.910> that<00:06:59.030> fence<00:06:59.300> and<00:06:59.539> stuff<00:06:59.720> it<00:07:00.199> was

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:00.349 
jumped over that fence and stuff it was

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:03.279 
jumped over that fence and stuff it was
a<00:07:00.410> little<00:07:00.650> bit<00:07:00.770> shaky<00:07:00.949> at<00:07:01.310> some<00:07:01.880> points<00:07:02.509> and<00:07:02.660> I

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:03.289 
a little bit shaky at some points and I

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:05.710 
a little bit shaky at some points and I
true<00:07:03.500> attribute<00:07:04.160> most<00:07:04.340> of<00:07:04.490> that<00:07:04.580> to<00:07:04.759> the<00:07:04.880> like

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 
true attribute most of that to the like

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.600 
true attribute most of that to the like
the<00:07:05.870> rotation<00:07:06.349> of<00:07:06.470> everything<00:07:07.039> like<00:07:07.130> up<00:07:07.370> top

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610 
the rotation of everything like up top

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.100 
the rotation of everything like up top
here<00:07:07.849> the<00:07:08.000> camera<00:07:08.300> will<00:07:08.449> bounce<00:07:08.660> back<00:07:08.810> and

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.110 
here the camera will bounce back and

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.870 
here the camera will bounce back and
forth<00:07:09.169> a<00:07:09.410> little<00:07:09.440> bit<00:07:09.620> so<00:07:10.310> if<00:07:10.430> I<00:07:10.520> was<00:07:10.669> to<00:07:10.789> make

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 
forth a little bit so if I was to make

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.150 
forth a little bit so if I was to make
another<00:07:11.120> one<00:07:11.300> the<00:07:11.419> things<00:07:11.599> I<00:07:11.750> would<00:07:11.810> do<00:07:12.160> has

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.160 
another one the things I would do has

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.219 
another one the things I would do has
I'd<00:07:13.310> use<00:07:13.460> a<00:07:13.490> thicker<00:07:14.030> piece<00:07:14.150> of<00:07:14.300> aluminum<00:07:14.720> here

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:15.229 
I'd use a thicker piece of aluminum here

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:17.379 
I'd use a thicker piece of aluminum here
I'd<00:07:15.530> make<00:07:15.770> the<00:07:15.889> camera<00:07:16.070> mounting<00:07:16.490> a<00:07:16.699> spot<00:07:17.210> a

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:17.389 
I'd make the camera mounting a spot a

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:20.170 
I'd make the camera mounting a spot a
little<00:07:17.630> bigger<00:07:17.780> and<00:07:18.460> probably<00:07:19.460> try<00:07:19.849> and<00:07:20.030> join

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.180 
little bigger and probably try and join

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.120 
little bigger and probably try and join
this<00:07:20.389> up<00:07:20.539> to<00:07:20.660> the<00:07:20.780> top<00:07:20.960> in<00:07:21.380> some<00:07:21.410> way<00:07:21.830> just<00:07:22.070> to

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.130 
this up to the top in some way just to

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.490 
this up to the top in some way just to
keep<00:07:22.250> it<00:07:22.340> from<00:07:22.460> flexing<00:07:22.849> at<00:07:23.030> all<00:07:23.180> but<00:07:23.750> I<00:07:24.259> think

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:24.500 
keep it from flexing at all but I think

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.540 
keep it from flexing at all but I think
that's<00:07:24.680> about<00:07:24.770> it<00:07:24.889> you<00:07:25.070> can<00:07:25.190> make<00:07:25.220> up<00:07:25.400> your<00:07:25.430> own

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:25.550 
that's about it you can make up your own

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.890 
that's about it you can make up your own
mind<00:07:25.820> as<00:07:25.970> to<00:07:26.000> whether<00:07:26.150> it's<00:07:26.360> worth<00:07:26.479> making<00:07:26.690> one

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:26.900 
mind as to whether it's worth making one

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.870 
mind as to whether it's worth making one
of<00:07:26.990> these<00:07:27.080> or<00:07:27.199> not<00:07:27.820> yeah<00:07:28.820> thanks<00:07:29.509> for<00:07:29.539> watching
