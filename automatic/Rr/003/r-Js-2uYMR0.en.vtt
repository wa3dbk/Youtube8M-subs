00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
servers gonna have four Nick's so I'm

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.010 
servers gonna have four Nick's so I'm
not<00:01:18.960> quite<00:01:19.200> sure<00:01:19.229> how<00:01:19.560> I'm<00:01:19.619> gonna<00:01:19.710> do<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:19.920> yet

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
not quite sure how I'm gonna do that yet

not quite sure how I'm gonna do that yet
something<00:01:22.020> else<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.229> showing<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.530> outside

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
something else is showing the outside

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.570 
something else is showing the outside
along<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.259> side<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> case<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:26.130> both<00:01:26.280> sides

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
along the side of the case on both sides

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.539 
along the side of the case on both sides
you've<00:01:27.270> got<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.570> piece<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.810> plastic<00:01:28.320> here

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
you've got this piece of plastic here

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.850 
you've got this piece of plastic here
now<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:30.509> purpose<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.409> hide<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
now the purpose of this is to hide the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.330 
now the purpose of this is to hide the
wires<00:01:32.220> for<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.390> power<00:01:34.259> button<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.130> USB

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
wires for the power button and the USB

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.850 
wires for the power button and the USB
port<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> other<00:01:36.450> side<00:01:36.659> they<00:01:37.500> go<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
port on the other side they go on the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.880 
port on the other side they go on the
outside<00:01:38.220> inside<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:38.880> plastic<00:01:39.860> into<00:01:40.860> a

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
outside inside of this plastic into a

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.310 
outside inside of this plastic into a
hole<00:01:41.189> inside<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.970> case<00:01:43.790> not<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.909> cleanest

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
hole inside the case not the cleanest

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.889 
hole inside the case not the cleanest
but<00:01:46.320> I'm<00:01:46.530> pretty<00:01:46.770> sure<00:01:46.860> once<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.659> rails<00:01:48.659> are

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
but I'm pretty sure once the rails are

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:49.969 
but I'm pretty sure once the rails are
on<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:48.990> don't<00:01:49.290> really<00:01:49.409> see<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> problem<00:01:49.770> with

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
on I don't really see a problem with

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.160 
on I don't really see a problem with
that<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:51.000> top<00:01:51.210> covers<00:01:51.570> held<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:51.869> with<00:01:51.990> four

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
that the top covers held on with four

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.179 
that the top covers held on with four
screws<00:01:52.350> two<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.770> each<00:01:52.920> side

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
screws two on each side

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.300 
screws two on each side
once<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.149> remove<00:01:54.299> them<00:01:54.509> who<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:55.100> find<00:01:56.100> it

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
once you remove them who just find it

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.649 
once you remove them who just find it
and<00:01:56.490> that's<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.700> away<00:01:57.229> that's<00:01:58.229> out<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.560> way

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
and that's it away that's out of the way

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.510 
and that's it away that's out of the way
and<00:02:00.020> now<00:02:00.590> we<00:02:00.649> are<00:02:00.890> inside<00:02:03.070> you<00:02:04.070> can<00:02:04.189> see<00:02:04.310> there

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
and now we are inside you can see there

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.559
