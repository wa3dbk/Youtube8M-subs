something that I have a problem with I

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.730 
something that I have a problem with I
think<00:01:25.590> they<00:01:25.740> need<00:01:25.950> more<00:01:25.979> fumble<00:01:26.850> recovery

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
think they need more fumble recovery

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.910 
think they need more fumble recovery
animations<00:01:28.740> at<00:01:28.950> least<00:01:29.369> three<00:01:30.180> can<00:01:30.450> be<00:01:30.600> done<00:01:30.920> we

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
animations at least three can be done we

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.920 
animations at least three can be done we
kind<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.250> see<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.670> same<00:01:33.000> one<00:01:33.270> over<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.719> over

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
kind of see this same one over and over

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.800 
kind of see this same one over and over
again<00:01:34.140> we're<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.490> guys<00:01:35.640> pick<00:01:35.969> up<00:01:36.119> act<00:01:36.509> like

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810

they<00:01:36.960> pick<00:01:37.140> up<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.469> football<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.909> kind

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
they pick up the football and just kind

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.149 
they pick up the football and just kind
of<00:01:39.180> carry<00:01:39.479> on<00:01:39.750> with<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.170> animation<00:01:40.710> even

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
of carry on with this animation even

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.069 
of carry on with this animation even
even<00:01:41.700> though<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.939> doesn't<00:01:42.060> fit<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.869> runs

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
even though it doesn't fit and it runs

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.959 
even though it doesn't fit and it runs
too<00:01:43.350> long<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:43.860> watch<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.340> football<00:01:44.579> right

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
too long but watch the football right

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.109 
too long but watch the football right
here<00:01:45.289> it's<00:01:46.289> going<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.829> kind<00:01:47.609> of<00:01:47.729> get<00:01:47.850> kicked

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
here it's going to kind of get kicked

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.200 
here it's going to kind of get kicked
around<00:01:48.649> then<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:49.829> going<00:01:50.039> to<00:01:50.159> motion<00:01:50.850> shift

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
around then it's going to motion shift

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.139 
around then it's going to motion shift
slightly<00:01:52.200> into<00:01:52.859> the<00:01:52.979> hands<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.369> number<00:01:53.700> 58

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
slightly into the hands of number 58

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.469 
slightly into the hands of number 58
here<00:01:54.420> but<00:01:54.719> as<00:01:55.070> we<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.250> clearly<00:01:56.579> see<00:01:56.969> his<00:01:57.210> left

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
here but as we can clearly see his left

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.899 
here but as we can clearly see his left
foot<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.869> out<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.049> bounds<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:59.310> problem<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.880> have

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
games not only did the challenge option

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.230 
games not only did the challenge option
come<00:04:03.080> up<00:04:03.260> more<00:04:03.440> frequently<00:04:03.650> but<00:04:04.580> you<00:04:04.730> had<00:04:04.940> more

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
come up more frequently but you had more

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.140 
come up more frequently but you had more
options<00:04:05.870> of<00:04:06.080> what<00:04:06.710> you<00:04:06.860> could<00:04:07.130> challenge<00:04:07.490> you

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
options of what you could challenge you

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.710 
options of what you could challenge you
can<00:04:08.300> see<00:04:08.480> Ratcliffe<00:04:08.990> hits<00:04:09.290> Drew<00:04:09.680> Brees<00:04:09.860> and

can see Ratcliffe hits Drew Brees and

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.990 
can see Ratcliffe hits Drew Brees and
clearly<00:04:11.720> this<00:04:12.050> is<00:04:12.260> a<00:04:12.290> fumble<00:04:12.860> drew<00:04:13.820> Brees

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
clearly this is a fumble drew Brees

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.720 
clearly this is a fumble drew Brees
doesn't<00:04:14.390> even<00:04:14.510> get<00:04:14.660> his<00:04:14.810> arm<00:04:15.020> only<00:04:15.410> back

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
doesn't even get his arm only back

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.060 
doesn't even get his arm only back
clearly<00:04:16.730> this<00:04:16.880> is<00:04:17.060> a<00:04:17.090> fumble<00:04:17.859> whether<00:04:18.859> or<00:04:18.980> not

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
clearly this is a fumble whether or not

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.610 
clearly this is a fumble whether or not
the<00:04:19.280> refs<00:04:19.549> actually<00:04:20.210> rule<00:04:20.480> this<00:04:20.750> as<00:04:21.020> a<00:04:21.049> fumble

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
the refs actually rule this as a fumble

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.580 
the refs actually rule this as a fumble
or<00:04:22.400> an<00:04:22.610> incomplete<00:04:23.150> pass<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:24.110> option<00:04:24.560> to

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
or an incomplete pass the option to

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.760 
or an incomplete pass the option to
review<00:04:25.190> it<00:04:25.370> I<00:04:25.720> think<00:04:26.720> should<00:04:26.990> be<00:04:27.170> there<00:04:27.590> and

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
review it I think should be there and

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.190 
review it I think should be there and
again<00:04:28.640> in<00:04:28.820> most<00:04:29.030> cases<00:04:29.330> the<00:04:29.600> option<00:04:29.990> isn't

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
again in most cases the option isn't

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.330 
again in most cases the option isn't
even<00:04:30.710> available<00:04:32.380> all<00:04:33.380> right<00:04:33.590> this<00:04:33.770> is<00:04:33.800> a<00:04:33.980> third

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
even available all right this is a third

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.870 
even available all right this is a third
and<00:04:34.610> final<00:04:35.180> clip<00:04:36.160> it<00:04:37.160> is<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.900> same<00:04:39.110> gain<00:04:39.470> it<00:04:40.250> is

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
and final clip it is the same gain it is

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.770 
and final clip it is the same gain it is
344<00:04:41.750> left<00:04:42.050> and<00:04:42.290> a<00:04:42.410> sack

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
344 left and a sack

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.770 
344 left and a sack
and<00:04:43.310> you<00:04:44.310> can<00:04:44.460> see<00:04:44.639> in<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:44.940> coaching<00:04:45.300> options

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
and you can see in the coaching options

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.710 
and you can see in the coaching options
there<00:04:46.020> is<00:04:46.170> no<00:04:46.730> option<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:48.060> challenge<00:04:48.540> and

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
there is no option the challenge and

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.350 
there is no option the challenge and
they<00:04:48.810> register<00:04:49.500> play<00:04:49.680> je<00:04:49.920> sais<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:50.639> it<00:04:51.030> ended

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
they register play je sais and it ended

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.990 
they register play je sais and it ended
interception<00:04:52.260> and<00:04:52.680> again<00:04:53.130> I<00:04:53.280> know<00:04:53.340> that<00:04:53.790> if

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
interception and again I know that if

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.750 
interception and again I know that if
you<00:04:54.030> go<00:04:54.330> to<00:04:54.389> the<00:04:54.660> replay<00:04:55.190> you<00:04:56.190> can't<00:04:56.460> challenge

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
you go to the replay you can't challenge

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.540 
you go to the replay you can't challenge
it<00:04:57.120> so<00:04:58.400> let's<00:04:59.690> again<00:05:00.860> as<00:05:01.860> you<00:05:01.980> can<00:05:02.130> see<00:05:02.280> there

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
it so let's again as you can see there

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.890 
it so let's again as you can see there
is<00:05:02.580> no<00:05:02.910> option<00:05:03.300> to<00:05:03.540> challenge<00:05:04.290> not<00:05:05.250> in<00:05:05.460> any

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
is no option to challenge not in any
