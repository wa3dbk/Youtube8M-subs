00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
for me for sure is trying to figure out

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.440 
for me for sure is trying to figure out
who<00:02:12.950> each<00:02:13.190> person<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:13.790> because<00:02:14.150> when<00:02:14.330> they're

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
who each person is because when they're

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.780

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
and their alias sometimes is very it's

and their alias sometimes is very it's
supposed<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.430> be<00:02:19.550> reminiscent<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.240> who<00:02:20.510> they

story and it's all wrapped around him

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.349 
story and it's all wrapped around him
which<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.069> great<00:02:46.370> because<00:02:46.549> the<00:02:46.849> actor<00:02:47.120> sells
