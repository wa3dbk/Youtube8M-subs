00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.610
 hello everyone, fox with you today we are 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.650
 learn how to put them compresses 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.600
 you will need these components 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.720
 who are in my quick panel 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.240
 access to start collect 3 cube by 3 and 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.480
 for machine cases which we will manufacture 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.029
 from solid steel we collect like this 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.660
 the way the natural middle is left 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:34.230
 built an empty space you and where 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.000
 in this way now 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.399
 Of course you can not collect this 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.710
 cube and otherwise, that is optional 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:45.010
 you only need to collect this cube 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.199
 use these components here to me 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.539
 so it is more convenient therefore I collect like this 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.140
 here is the way to use the input 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:55.239
 shona then the output bus use that 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.629
 use at least 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:02.309
 broker who's here 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.309
 after that we use mountens 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.620
 installed that is, that's it for them 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.010
 should the compressor is almost ready left 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:13.370
 fix it after this file 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.090
 energy i will supply energy with 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.719
 using mpm 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.250
 to show you what if we 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:24.009
 use a transformer and 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.780
 energy storage due to industrial 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.049
 we must insert 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.819
 back to back if we use wires even 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.939
 show you how it will look 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:36.250
 let's use industrial wires 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.530
 we use for example these here 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.180
 fiber or copper 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.549
 even if she remove as we see 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.770
 one of the wires connect to this 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.320
 Transformers will not therefore we can 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.159
 only use these here this cartilage 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.070
 but 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:59.500
 used all butt 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:01.270
 so everything seems to work but so they 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.200
 Here's the wire course will 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.390
 because they are 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.800
 from the industrial itself so paste here 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.500
 so you start the player 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.830
 pump up energy gradually m fairy 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.900
 your storage 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.740
 its buffer replenishes energy while 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.440
 Of course, this e-mail immediately gives 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:28.830
 some energy in this buffer 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:33.850
 transformer and now it has 1536 y or 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:38.020
 1536 voltage so everything works remains 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.750
 just feed some of those materials 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.200
 which will be recycled in this in 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.830
 This is the car left to go moss-1 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.360
 Keep in mind when you are 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.430
 build them should you compressor 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.500
 have to use 1 bus second and 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.269
 level three i.e. level one 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.430
 will not work because they are only 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.430
 single slot 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.120
 it must compressor used two 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.180
 the subject 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.719
 we insert here kink and n.d. 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.209
 further industrial tnt after that 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:12.060
 Used in the Humvee turn on the machine 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.250
 works quietly 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:19.540
 quietly spent what they have something 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.340
 these elements and then we get here 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.319
 these are the items that should 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.359
 turn at the exit they should 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.860
 the compressor in this case slept 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:31.040
 get iridium play 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.340
 all and login compressor 21 recipes for 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.060
 this every recipe consume some 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.160
 the amount of energy is exactly 600 while 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.840
 processing time one second each 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.690
 subject and maximum energy can 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.520
 serve to set this 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:55.510
 worked 30 per tick 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:58.700
 so if we serve even come up 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:02.720
 how much will we file here if we file 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.830
 here 128 per tick is natural time 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.860
 processing will be halved i.e. 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:14.650
 in order to process one iridium l 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:18.620
 a n d a n g we need 0.5 seconds 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:21.230
 like this I say goodbye to you all 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.530
 thanks for watching good luck and up to the new 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.530
 meeting
