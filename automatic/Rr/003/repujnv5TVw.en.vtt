them sometimes into the programming of

somewhere saw a picture of him teaching
the<00:03:06.319> PEC<00:03:06.620> fly<00:03:06.860> in<00:03:07.340> this<00:03:07.700> manner<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.299> manner

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
the PEC fly in this manner the manner

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.449 
the PEC fly in this manner the manner
that<00:03:08.630> we<00:03:08.780> do<00:03:09.049> it<00:03:09.200> in<00:03:09.319> the<00:03:09.410> built<00:03:09.620> last<00:03:09.920> program

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
that we do it in the built last program

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.910 
that we do it in the built last program
and<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:11.480> it<00:03:11.660> made<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:11.840> lot<00:03:12.049> of<00:03:12.109> sense<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.500> me<00:03:12.620> and

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
mentioned pecs our internal rotators so

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.880 
mentioned pecs our internal rotators so
when<00:04:55.320> we're<00:04:55.500> going<00:04:55.530> to<00:04:55.950> contract<00:04:56.490> by<00:04:57.890> turning

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
when we're going to contract by turning

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.590 
when we're going to contract by turning
the<00:04:59.010> thumbs<00:04:59.310> towards<00:04:59.670> each<00:04:59.910> other<00:05:00.060> our<00:05:00.300> palms

forward internally rotating you are

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.110 
forward internally rotating you are
going<00:05:04.260> to<00:05:04.320> get<00:05:04.440> a<00:05:04.470> better<00:05:04.770> contraction<00:05:05.640> on<00:05:05.790> the

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
going to get a better contraction on the

going to get a better contraction on the
pecs

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
pecs

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.690

so<00:05:07.020> externally<00:05:07.800> rotate<00:05:08.190> in<00:05:08.370> the<00:05:08.460> stretch

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
so externally rotate in the stretch

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.570 
so externally rotate in the stretch
position<00:05:09.770> internally<00:05:10.770> rotate<00:05:11.190> when<00:05:11.400> we're

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
position internally rotate when we're

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.110 
position internally rotate when we're
trying<00:05:11.700> to<00:05:11.910> get<00:05:12.060> that<00:05:12.210> nice<00:05:12.540> peak<00:05:13.410> contraction

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
trying to get that nice peak contraction

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.330 
trying to get that nice peak contraction
to<00:05:15.120> develop<00:05:15.540> those<00:05:15.690> pecs<00:05:16.080> so<00:05:16.770> I'll<00:05:17.010> show<00:05:17.310> you

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
to develop those pecs so I'll show you

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.020 
to develop those pecs so I'll show you
five<00:05:17.850> reps<00:05:18.270> and<00:05:18.600> pay<00:05:19.590> attention<00:05:19.620> to<00:05:20.070> those<00:05:20.370> key

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
five reps and pay attention to those key

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:35.840 
five reps and pay attention to those key
pointers

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.120 

and<00:05:36.480> you'll<00:05:36.660> notice<00:05:36.900> I'm<00:05:37.140> not<00:05:37.170> smashing<00:05:38.040> the

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
and you'll notice I'm not smashing the

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.240 
and you'll notice I'm not smashing the
dumbbells<00:05:38.550> at<00:05:38.790> the<00:05:38.910> top

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
dumbbells at the top

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.060 
dumbbells at the top
I'm<00:05:41.250> keeping<00:05:42.120> tension<00:05:42.360> on<00:05:42.660> the<00:05:42.810> muscle<00:05:43.070> right

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
I'm keeping tension on the muscle right

00:05:44.070 --> 00:06:11.150 
I'm keeping tension on the muscle right
before<00:05:44.460> they<00:05:44.580> touch<00:05:44.820> and<00:05:45.270> then<00:05:45.990> back<00:05:46.200> down

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.720 

so<00:06:12.160> that<00:06:13.000> is<00:06:13.240> how<00:06:13.420> we<00:06:13.480> coach<00:06:13.900> the<00:06:14.770> PEC<00:06:15.100> fly<00:06:15.340> in

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 
so that is how we coach the PEC fly in

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.100 
so that is how we coach the PEC fly in
the<00:06:15.880> built<00:06:16.060> class<00:06:16.300> program<00:06:16.750> that's<00:06:16.960> how<00:06:17.050> I

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
the built class program that's how I

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.130 
the built class program that's how I
coach<00:06:17.470> it<00:06:17.680> generally<00:06:18.340> most<00:06:18.640> of<00:06:18.850> the<00:06:18.910> time<00:06:19.270> when

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
coach it generally most of the time when

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.070 
coach it generally most of the time when
I<00:06:20.170> prescribe<00:06:20.860> it<00:06:21.070> for<00:06:21.280> the<00:06:22.060> reasons<00:06:22.540> mentioned

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
I prescribe it for the reasons mentioned

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.650 
I prescribe it for the reasons mentioned
earlier<00:06:23.910> definitely<00:06:24.910> give<00:06:25.060> it<00:06:25.090> a<00:06:25.210> shot

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
earlier definitely give it a shot

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.550 
earlier definitely give it a shot

the one thing I forgot to mention was

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.530 
the one thing I forgot to mention was
you<00:06:34.930> are<00:06:35.080> going<00:06:35.380> to<00:06:35.500> have<00:06:35.650> to<00:06:35.800> cut<00:06:35.980> your<00:06:36.130> weight

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:36.540 
you are going to have to cut your weight

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.360 
you are going to have to cut your weight
almost<00:06:37.540> in<00:06:37.780> half<00:06:38.080> if<00:06:38.470> you're<00:06:38.920> used<00:06:39.130> to<00:06:39.190> doing

I was bench pressed in 400 pounds 405 on

I was bench pressed in 400 pounds 405 on
the<00:07:08.169> bar<00:07:08.380> if<00:07:08.650> I<00:07:08.800> could<00:07:08.980> get<00:07:09.100> four<00:07:09.340> or<00:07:09.430> five<00:07:09.640> for

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:09.910 
the bar if I could get four or five for

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.290 
the bar if I could get four or five for
one<00:07:10.120> I'm<00:07:10.450> not<00:07:11.110> going<00:07:11.380> to<00:07:11.470> do<00:07:11.650> more<00:07:12.460> than<00:07:12.820> forty

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.300 
one I'm not going to do more than forty

one I'm not going to do more than forty
pound<00:07:13.540> dumbbells<00:07:14.020> or<00:07:14.140> say<00:07:14.350> 410<00:07:15.280> percent<00:07:15.580> of

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:15.640 
pound dumbbells or say 410 percent of

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.500 
pound dumbbells or say 410 percent of
400<00:07:15.850> is<00:07:16.360> 40<00:07:17.070> 40<00:07:18.070> pounds<00:07:18.610> in<00:07:18.760> each<00:07:18.940> hand<00:07:19.300> and

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:19.510 
400 is 40 40 pounds in each hand and

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.420 
400 is 40 40 pounds in each hand and
this<00:07:19.600> exercise<00:07:20.050> is<00:07:20.440> actually<00:07:20.650> pretty<00:07:21.220> heavy

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:21.430 
this exercise is actually pretty heavy

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.880 
this exercise is actually pretty heavy
so<00:07:22.300> if<00:07:22.419> you're<00:07:22.540> a<00:07:22.600> 300<00:07:23.140> pound<00:07:23.290> venture

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:23.890 
so if you're a 300 pound venture

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.680 
so if you're a 300 pound venture
probably<00:07:24.760> not<00:07:24.850> going<00:07:25.000> to<00:07:25.060> go<00:07:25.150> much<00:07:25.180> heavier

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:25.690 
probably not going to go much heavier

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.510 
probably not going to go much heavier
than<00:07:25.750> 30<00:07:26.200> pounds<00:07:26.680> so<00:07:26.830> use<00:07:27.100> that<00:07:27.310> as<00:07:27.490> a

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 
than 30 pounds so use that as a

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.840 
than 30 pounds so use that as a
guideline<00:07:27.910> as<00:07:28.360> far<00:07:28.600> as<00:07:28.690> weight<00:07:28.960> don't<00:07:29.260> think

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:29.850 
guideline as far as weight don't think

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.490 
guideline as far as weight don't think
you<00:07:30.850> know<00:07:30.940> you're<00:07:31.120> going<00:07:31.450> to<00:07:31.630> like<00:07:31.900> if<00:07:32.140> you<00:07:32.169> do

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:32.500 
you know you're going to like if you do

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.780 
you know you're going to like if you do
them<00:07:32.680> right<00:07:32.950> and<00:07:33.190> do<00:07:33.340> them<00:07:33.430> the<00:07:33.520> way<00:07:33.550> I<00:07:33.669> just

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:33.790 
them right and do them the way I just

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.659 
them right and do them the way I just
mentioned<00:07:34.450> ten<00:07:35.260> percent<00:07:35.740> of<00:07:35.890> your<00:07:35.919> max<00:07:36.310> bench

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:36.669 
mentioned ten percent of your max bench

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:38.520 
mentioned ten percent of your max bench
in<00:07:36.940> each<00:07:37.120> hand<00:07:37.450> is<00:07:37.630> actually<00:07:37.840> a<00:07:38.080> really<00:07:38.410> really

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:38.530 
in each hand is actually a really really

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.030 
in each hand is actually a really really
good<00:07:38.979> number<00:07:39.430> for<00:07:39.580> this<00:07:40.060> exercise<00:07:40.630> to<00:07:41.020> get<00:07:41.229> in

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:42.040 
good number for this exercise to get in

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.330 
good number for this exercise to get in
that<00:07:42.310> 8<00:07:42.580> to<00:07:42.790> 10<00:07:43.030> rep<00:07:43.630> range<00:07:43.930> with<00:07:44.200> so<00:07:44.590> I'll<00:07:44.950> use

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:45.340 
that 8 to 10 rep range with so I'll use

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.210 
that 8 to 10 rep range with so I'll use
that<00:07:45.520> as<00:07:45.669> a<00:07:45.700> guideline<00:07:46.050> give<00:07:47.050> these<00:07:47.290> a<00:07:47.560> try<00:07:47.620> and

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:48.220 
that as a guideline give these a try and

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.060 
that as a guideline give these a try and
hopefully<00:07:48.460> we<00:07:48.760> have<00:07:48.910> some<00:07:49.390> a<00:07:49.690> lot<00:07:50.470> more<00:07:50.740> not<00:07:51.040> so

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:51.070 
hopefully we have some a lot more not so

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.219 
hopefully we have some a lot more not so
PEC<00:07:51.700> less<00:07:51.940> people<00:07:52.390> out<00:07:52.600> there
