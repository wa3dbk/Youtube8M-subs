00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.850
 We try to keep friends here. 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.429
 and how are we going to make this item? 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.460
 the first thing that runs that we go 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.330
 to use here in Brazil is possible 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.910
 find on this rope and so on nine 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.160
 baratin wants to pay the 40 70 cents 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.619
 meters depending on the local thickness 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.619
 you will easily buy found 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.970
 in camping fishing shops and archives of 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.179
 work safety 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.160
 Finally, unfortunately, in Brazil, there is no 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.510
 we have access to the light switch for 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.730
 cut 550 ac still when found one 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.860
 30-meter roller will not leave for less 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.290
 of sixty reais off freight 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.840
 while in the United States I get the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.610
 goal of 30 meters for 10 dollars 8 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.500
 dollars 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.440
 then we will leave for cutting lalo 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.050
 will have another video in which I speak of him 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.699
 and here we will use this one even though 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.780
 with our purpose is to serve without 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.290
 some problem 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:09.689
 so let's also use the ones that are 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:14.880
 here it is the opposite and try 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.310
 no issue that is without locking them up 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.630
 two depending on using another goes 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.860
 depend on the situation 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.049
 then it is up to each and every one to 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:33.960
 People would make me come here. 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:37.049
 with those who are here today 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.090
 however no other way to do I 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.380
 I have been using it for many years 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.200
 more interesting and brings some 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.479
 Advantages that we will make will 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.420
 make a loop here on the tip 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.509
 for this it used the name of loops that 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.840
 is quite simple to make 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.840
 do it here 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.049
 I step here 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.750
 It is best to see here that we 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.410
 inside 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.410
 over there 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.240
 the mall 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.020
 already did 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.720
 very resistant in traffic, but I 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:30.580
 I do not like fixed tip here so we 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.110
 will give a finish brings some 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.720
 advantages also gives the finishing with the 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:40.930
 Favorite on this tip here 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:47.370
 whoever is with the help of a 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.370
 squirrel there 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.360
 none because it burns because of the way 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.360
 It was a little head for some reason. 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.060
 rope running would hardly happen 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.930
 she lock iac then giving more 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.930
 safety 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.610
 the same on the other side always cutting 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:21.230
 so the rope in the size you 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:21.230
 need to first go inside 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:41.500
 The perfect fixed kitchen garden again gives a 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:41.500
 Finish here is done there do not burn 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:04.349
 let's go both ends because I say 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:07.080
 To make a simple bond, let's go because 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:13.910
 you do not have a carabiner you have 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:18.299
 Do yourself here with yourself 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:21.979
 there because it holds clear without music is 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.979
 such beauty 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:38.870
 the accent hello same can be done is 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:39.469
 in a carabiner loop came in without problem 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.340
 some 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:46.550
 Why did not you learn music then? 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.400
 one that would be for some reason you 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.909
 hbo need the music then you come 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.340
 here and use this collation item as already 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:58.069
 I will show you do not lose the utility of this 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.919
 item being that if you got mooring 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:02.930
 mosquitoes that this would not be possible 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.689
 always has knowledge that makes your 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.210
 be multifunctional items you carry 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:10.520
 no less the equipment will load 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.789
 little equipment and you will get 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.639
 thus cover a large amount of 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.710
 needs this is very important 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.159
 this is something we always look for in 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.159
 simple
