00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
found these new VCRs are a little too

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.810 
found these new VCRs are a little too
smart<00:01:49.469> for<00:01:49.560> their<00:01:49.799> own<00:01:49.829> good<00:01:49.920> they're<00:01:50.549> packed

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
smart for their own good they're packed

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.700 
smart for their own good they're packed
with<00:01:50.939> sensors<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.719> will<00:01:51.810> detect<00:01:52.049> any<00:01:52.259> speed

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710

change<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.369> motor<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.969> that'll<00:01:54.509> stop

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
change in this motor and that'll stop

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.660 
change in this motor and that'll stop
things<00:01:55.110> from<00:01:55.170> running<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.740> we're<00:01:56.310> gonna<00:01:56.399> have

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
things from running so we're gonna have

it's been given a nice coat of paint for

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.520 
it's been given a nice coat of paint for
looks<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.480> drilled<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.780> hole<00:02:42.810> through<00:02:42.990> it<00:02:43.260> so

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
looks and I drilled a hole through it so

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.530 
looks and I drilled a hole through it so
that<00:02:43.560> we<00:02:43.710> could<00:02:43.830> mount<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.310> bolt<00:02:44.580> as<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:45.090> axle

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
that we could mount a bolt as the axle

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.320 
that we could mount a bolt as the axle
this<00:02:46.530> has<00:02:46.740> some<00:02:47.100> nice<00:02:47.310> bearings<00:02:47.820> in<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.210> we

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
this has some nice bearings in it so we

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.720 
this has some nice bearings in it so we
shouldn't<00:02:48.600> have<00:02:48.810> too<00:02:48.990> much<00:02:49.110> friction<00:02:49.730> down

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
shouldn't have too much friction down

is the moment of truth I'm worried about

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.760 
is the moment of truth I'm worried about
this<00:03:15.030> guy<00:03:15.210> spinning<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.990> little<00:03:16.320> slow<00:03:16.590> and

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
this guy spinning a little slow and

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.140 
this guy spinning a little slow and
shutting<00:03:17.040> off<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.190> system<00:03:17.670> let's<00:03:17.820> see<00:03:17.940> how<00:03:18.060> it

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
shutting off the system let's see how it

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.030 
shutting off the system let's see how it
works<00:03:18.360> so<00:03:19.140> I'm<00:03:19.230> going<00:03:19.380> to<00:03:19.410> bring<00:03:19.680> this<00:03:19.830> up<00:03:19.890> to

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
works so I'm going to bring this up to

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.370 
works so I'm going to bring this up to
speed<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:22.410> we<00:03:22.860> can<00:03:23.010> listen<00:03:23.220> for<00:03:23.490> that<00:03:23.640> motor

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
speed and we can listen for that motor

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.860 
speed and we can listen for that motor
there<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.500> comes<00:03:26.300> okay<00:03:27.300> it's<00:03:27.450> getting<00:03:27.630> there

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
there it comes okay it's getting there

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.010 
there it comes okay it's getting there
and<00:03:31.070> yes<00:03:32.070> this<00:03:33.000> thing<00:03:33.060> is<00:03:33.300> really<00:03:33.600> going<00:03:33.750> now

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
and yes this thing is really going now

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.040 
and yes this thing is really going now
this<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.380> great<00:03:34.620> but<00:03:35.580> this<00:03:36.210> is<00:03:36.450> running<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.810> bit

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
this is great but this is running a bit

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.690 
this is great but this is running a bit
fast<00:03:37.410> so<00:03:37.770> I'm<00:03:37.860> probably<00:03:38.040> going<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.400> need<00:03:38.550> to

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
fast so I'm probably going to need to

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.340 
fast so I'm probably going to need to
build<00:03:38.820> a<00:03:39.000> couple<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.330> more<00:03:39.510> pulleys<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:40.110> slow

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
build a couple of more pulleys to slow

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.530 
build a couple of more pulleys to slow
the<00:03:40.470> whole<00:03:40.620> thing<00:03:40.830> down

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.930 
to gear this down for each large pulley
and<00:03:56.050> need<00:03:56.379> to<00:03:56.530> attach<00:03:56.739> a<00:03:56.890> small<00:03:57.040> pulley<00:03:57.459> so

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
and need to attach a small pulley so

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.850

all<00:04:19.860> right<00:04:20.250> we've<00:04:20.700> got<00:04:20.730> it<00:04:21.000> all<00:04:21.090> set<00:04:21.330> up<00:04:21.360> now

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
all right we've got it all set up now

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.140 
all right we've got it all set up now
with<00:04:22.560> my<00:04:22.710> motor<00:04:22.980> running<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.790> the<00:04:23.880> first

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
with my motor running to the first

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.980 
with my motor running to the first
pulley<00:04:24.480> then<00:04:25.080> to<00:04:25.290> a<00:04:25.320> PVC<00:04:25.850> second<00:04:26.850> pulley<00:04:27.030> PVC

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
pulley then to a PVC second pulley PVC

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.170 
pulley then to a PVC second pulley PVC
and<00:04:28.230> the<00:04:28.710> final<00:04:29.070> pulley<00:04:29.310> this<00:04:29.850> is<00:04:30.000> going<00:04:30.120> to

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
and the final pulley this is going to

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.410 
and the final pulley this is going to
reduce<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.720> speed<00:04:30.990> from<00:04:31.290> about<00:04:31.530> 1800<00:04:32.370> rpm<00:04:32.790> to

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
reduce the speed from about 1800 rpm to

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.110 
reduce the speed from about 1800 rpm to
thirty<00:04:33.690> rpm<00:04:34.200> with<00:04:34.560> lots<00:04:34.770> more<00:04:34.920> torque<00:04:35.400> so<00:04:35.970> now

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
thirty rpm with lots more torque so now

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.350 
thirty rpm with lots more torque so now
let's<00:04:36.510> check<00:04:36.690> it<00:04:36.810> out<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.050> see<00:04:37.170> how<00:04:37.320> it<00:04:37.350> runs

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
let's check it out and see how it runs

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:46.100 
let's check it out and see how it runs
bring<00:04:39.360> this<00:04:39.450> guy<00:04:39.630> up<00:04:39.660> to<00:04:39.960> speed<00:04:40.290> and<00:04:44.840> lift<00:04:45.840> off

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
bring this guy up to speed and lift off

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.020 
bring this guy up to speed and lift off
this<00:04:46.620> is<00:04:46.830> great<00:04:47.100> check<00:04:47.340> it<00:04:47.460> out<00:04:47.550> it's<00:04:47.700> turning

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
this is great check it out it's turning

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.610 
this is great check it out it's turning
it<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:48.330> I'm<00:04:48.750> not<00:04:48.900> tripping<00:04:49.290> any<00:04:49.410> of<00:04:49.560> the

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
it and I'm not tripping any of the

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.430 
it and I'm not tripping any of the
sensors<00:04:50.040> for<00:04:50.310> torque<00:04:50.580> in<00:04:50.730> the<00:04:50.820> VCR<00:04:51.320> so<00:04:52.320> the

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
sensors for torque in the VCR so the

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.800 
sensors for torque in the VCR so the
only<00:04:52.590> question<00:04:53.190> remaining<00:04:53.550> is<00:04:53.820> how<00:04:54.540> is<00:04:54.690> this

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
only question remaining is how is this

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.470 
only question remaining is how is this
thing<00:04:55.110> gonna<00:04:55.350> feed<00:04:55.710> a<00:04:55.740> cat<00:04:56.210> we<00:04:57.210> could<00:04:57.390> have

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
thing gonna feed a cat we could have

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.240 
thing gonna feed a cat we could have
used<00:04:57.690> a<00:04:57.900> meat<00:04:58.110> grinder<00:04:58.320> as<00:04:58.710> in<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.160> original

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
used a meat grinder as in the original

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.150 
used a meat grinder as in the original
design<00:05:00.230> but<00:05:01.230> we<00:05:01.320> wanted<00:05:01.560> to<00:05:01.680> keep<00:05:01.830> with<00:05:02.040> the

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
design but we wanted to keep with the

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.910 
design but we wanted to keep with the
wheel<00:05:02.370> motif<00:05:02.850> so<00:05:03.540> I<00:05:03.570> took<00:05:03.990> one<00:05:04.230> of<00:05:04.260> these<00:05:04.470> CD

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
wheel motif so I took one of these CD

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.680 
wheel motif so I took one of these CD
spindles<00:05:05.520> I've<00:05:05.730> been<00:05:05.850> waiting<00:05:06.150> to<00:05:06.210> use<00:05:06.240> one<00:05:06.600> of

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690
