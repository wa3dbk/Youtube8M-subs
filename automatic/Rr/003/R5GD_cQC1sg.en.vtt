with the monitor up the top here we've

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.229 
with the monitor up the top here we've
got<00:00:38.949> a<00:00:39.010> fifteen<00:00:39.399> point<00:00:39.640> four<00:00:39.940> in<00:00:40.089> of

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
got a fifteen point four in of

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.560 
got a fifteen point four in of
widescreen<00:00:40.690> LCD<00:00:41.579> now<00:00:42.579> as<00:00:42.820> for<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.120> keyboard

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
widescreen LCD now as for the keyboard

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.270 
widescreen LCD now as for the keyboard
it's<00:00:43.719> spill<00:00:44.079> resistant<00:00:44.710> which<00:00:44.890> means<00:00:45.100> if<00:00:45.219> you

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
it's spill resistant which means if you

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.739 
it's spill resistant which means if you
spill<00:00:45.519> a<00:00:45.550> bit<00:00:45.699> of<00:00:45.789> water<00:00:45.969> on<00:00:46.149> it<00:00:46.179> don't<00:00:46.510> worry

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:46.749 
spill a bit of water on it don't worry

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:48.720 
spill a bit of water on it don't worry
not<00:00:47.409> to<00:00:47.589> fret<00:00:47.800> there's<00:00:48.159> a<00:00:48.219> reason<00:00:48.489> why<00:00:48.579> they

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
not to fret there's a reason why they

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.130 
not to fret there's a reason why they
call<00:00:48.909> these<00:00:49.030> things<00:00:49.300> rugged<00:00:49.749> because<00:00:49.989> it's

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
call these things rugged because it's

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.569 
call these things rugged because it's
not<00:00:50.289> going<00:00:50.440> to<00:00:50.530> ruin<00:00:50.620> it<00:00:50.800> it's<00:00:50.980> actually<00:00:51.309> spill

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
not going to ruin it it's actually spill

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.669 
not going to ruin it it's actually spill
resistant<00:00:52.179> so<00:00:52.300> this<00:00:52.449> is<00:00:52.539> a<00:00:52.569> sealed<00:00:53.050> keyboard

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:53.679 
resistant so this is a sealed keyboard

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.649 
resistant so this is a sealed keyboard
so<00:00:54.219> any<00:00:54.370> water<00:00:54.640> that<00:00:54.699> gets<00:00:54.850> in<00:00:55.179> there<00:00:55.329> is<00:00:55.510> it

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
so any water that gets in there is it

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:57.209 
so any water that gets in there is it
going<00:00:55.809> to<00:00:55.870> harm<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.289> internals<00:00:56.800> and<00:00:56.890> it's<00:00:57.100> not

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
going to harm the internals and it's not

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:58.799 
going to harm the internals and it's not
going<00:00:57.370> to<00:00:57.429> harm<00:00:57.579> your<00:00:57.699> keyboard<00:00:58.120> as<00:00:58.239> well<00:00:58.269> and

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
going to harm your keyboard as well and

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.209 
going to harm your keyboard as well and
that<00:00:58.929> I'm<00:00:59.019> so<00:00:59.199> goes<00:00:59.409> for<00:00:59.559> the<00:00:59.649> trackpad<00:00:59.890> as

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
that I'm so goes for the trackpad as

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.219 
that I'm so goes for the trackpad as
well<00:01:00.399> that's<00:01:00.579> also<00:01:00.789> spill<00:01:01.239> resistant<00:01:01.809> now

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
well that's also spill resistant now

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.200 
well that's also spill resistant now
look<00:01:02.409> as<00:01:02.530> far<00:01:02.769> as<00:01:02.889> the<00:01:03.039> internals<00:01:03.519> inside<00:01:04.059> the

you've noticed that you've got these

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.670 
you've noticed that you've got these
little<00:01:22.060> cases<00:01:22.240> here<00:01:22.689> and<00:01:22.810> this<00:01:22.930> is<00:01:23.079> to<00:01:23.229> keep<00:01:23.439> it

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
little cases here and this is to keep it

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.440 
little cases here and this is to keep it
from<00:01:24.189> getting<00:01:24.310> any<00:01:24.610> dust<00:01:24.820> or<00:01:25.090> any<00:01:25.210> water

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
from getting any dust or any water

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.060 
from getting any dust or any water
getting<00:01:25.719> in<00:01:25.899> there<00:01:26.049> and<00:01:26.350> like<00:01:26.500> I<00:01:26.619> said<00:01:26.799> it<00:01:26.920> is

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
getting in there and like I said it is

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.740 
getting in there and like I said it is
rugged<00:01:27.340> which<00:01:27.640> means<00:01:27.880> that<00:01:28.060> it<00:01:28.149> does<00:01:28.299> work<00:01:28.539> in

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
rugged which means that it does work in

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.179 
rugged which means that it does work in
extreme<00:01:29.200> temperatures<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:29.979> extreme

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
extreme temperatures and extreme

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.550 
extreme temperatures and extreme
conditions<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.780> snow<00:01:32.200> rain<00:01:32.710> whatever

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
conditions so snow rain whatever

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.219 
conditions so snow rain whatever
case<00:01:33.799> maybe<00:01:34.340> this<00:01:35.090> unit<00:01:35.450> will<00:01:35.600> still<00:01:35.930> keep

case maybe this unit will still keep

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.899 
case maybe this unit will still keep
working<00:01:36.369> that's<00:01:37.369> why<00:01:37.460> they<00:01:37.670> call<00:01:37.880> them

handle up here at the top there's no

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.720 
handle up here at the top there's no
need<00:02:45.290> for<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.530> carrying<00:02:45.920> case<00:02:46.100> because<00:02:46.489> it<00:02:46.609> is

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
need for a carrying case because it is

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.979 
need for a carrying case because it is
rocket<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:47.269> you<00:02:47.329> don't<00:02:47.510> have<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:47.690> worry<00:02:47.900> about

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
rocket so you don't have to worry about

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.630 
rocket so you don't have to worry about
getting<00:02:48.260> any<00:02:48.500> knocks<00:02:48.829> and<00:02:49.069> scratches<00:02:49.459> because

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.580 
that I'm actually going to give it as a
drop<00:03:07.850> it<00:03:08.090> let's<00:03:08.329> say<00:03:08.510> about<00:03:08.720> chest<00:03:09.079> high<00:03:09.290> so

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
drop it let's say about chest high so

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.140 
drop it let's say about chest high so
this<00:03:09.739> is<00:03:09.859> probably<00:03:10.190> one<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.489> most<00:03:10.730> common

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
this is probably one of the most common

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.520 
this is probably one of the most common
reasons<00:03:11.569> that<00:03:11.630> people<00:03:11.810> need<00:03:12.109> to<00:03:12.139> replace

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
reasons that people need to replace

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.680 
reasons that people need to replace
their<00:03:12.769> notebooks<00:03:13.250> we<00:03:13.970> can<00:03:14.150> happen<00:03:14.359> sitting<00:03:14.569> on

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
their notebooks we can happen sitting on

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.569 
their notebooks we can happen sitting on
the<00:03:14.780> end<00:03:14.870> of<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.109> table<00:03:15.319> and<00:03:15.859> basically<00:03:16.310> it

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
the end of the table and basically it

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.370 
the end of the table and basically it
slides<00:03:16.940> off<00:03:17.239> from<00:03:17.510> breaks<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.079> there<00:03:18.200> goes

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
slides off from breaks and there goes

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.960 
slides off from breaks and there goes
you<00:03:18.560> want<00:03:18.739> to<00:03:18.799> know<00:03:18.920> you<00:03:19.220> just<00:03:19.430> better<00:03:19.609> off<00:03:19.790> I

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
you want to know you just better off I

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:36.280 
you want to know you just better off I
mean<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:20.299> know<00:03:20.480> well<00:03:21.109> with<00:03:21.290> this<00:03:35.079> so<00:03:36.079> another

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
mean you know well with this so another

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.629 
mean you know well with this so another
rugged<00:03:36.709> test<00:03:36.920> that<00:03:37.040> I'm<00:03:37.160> going<00:03:37.310> to<00:03:37.370> put<00:03:37.549> it

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
rugged test that I'm going to put it

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.940 
rugged test that I'm going to put it
through<00:03:37.819> is<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.420> spill<00:03:38.810> resistant<00:03:39.440> keyboard

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
through is the spill resistant keyboard

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.649 
through is the spill resistant keyboard
so<00:03:40.400> basically<00:03:40.760> I'm<00:03:40.910> going<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:41.150> do<00:03:41.299> here<00:03:41.540> is

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
so basically I'm going to do here is

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.420 
so basically I'm going to do here is
just<00:03:41.689> go<00:03:41.989> middle<00:03:42.349> water<00:03:42.530> I'm<00:03:43.069> just<00:03:43.129> going<00:03:43.370> to

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.860 
just go middle water I'm just going to
pull<00:03:43.610> this<00:03:43.700> straight<00:03:43.970> over<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.360> keyboard

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
pull this straight over the keyboard

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.199 
pull this straight over the keyboard
here<00:03:45.049> and<00:03:45.709> look<00:03:46.159> it<00:03:46.370> doesn't<00:03:46.700> affect<00:03:47.120> that

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209
