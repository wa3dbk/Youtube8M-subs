00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
you did this one or two weeks ago like

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.880 
you did this one or two weeks ago like
for<00:01:17.430> example<00:01:17.490> i<00:01:18.240> put<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.140> offer<00:01:19.380> for<00:01:19.710> my

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
for example i put in the offer for my

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.240 
for example i put in the offer for my
crush<00:01:20.159> nest<00:01:20.490> for<00:01:20.850> 5k<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:22.350> was<00:01:22.590> yesterday

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
crush nest for 5k and that was yesterday

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.899 
crush nest for 5k and that was yesterday
and<00:01:23.430> they're<00:01:23.670> already<00:01:23.880> up<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.140> 5.4<00:01:25.189> k<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.490> i

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
and they're already up to 5.4 k and i

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.670 
and they're already up to 5.4 k and i
just<00:01:27.270> checked<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.780> margin<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.290> them<00:01:28.470> and

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
just checked the margin on them and

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.399 
just checked the margin on them and
they're<00:01:28.890> at<00:01:29.040> 5.6<00:01:29.790> k<00:01:30.060> h<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.540> i<00:01:30.780> will<00:01:30.990> probably

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
they're at 5.6 k h so i will probably

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.760 
they're at 5.6 k h so i will probably
not<00:01:31.710> get<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:33.360> crush<00:01:34.290> nests<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:35.570> 5<00:01:36.570> KH<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.530> I'm

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
not get the crush nests for 5 KH so I'm

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.550 
not get the crush nests for 5 KH so I'm
like<00:01:38.329> what<00:01:39.329> else<00:01:39.479> can<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.720> use<00:01:39.900> these<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.350> and

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
like what else can I use these for and

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.700 
like what else can I use these for and
then<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.770> remembered<00:01:41.310> we're<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.670> go

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.199 
back and I've quickly done all my
calculations<00:03:35.640> so<00:03:36.640> I'm<00:03:36.880> just<00:03:37.030> going<00:03:37.150> to

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
calculations so I'm just going to

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.090 
calculations so I'm just going to
quickly<00:03:37.750> do<00:03:38.080> a<00:03:38.110> little<00:03:38.290> price<00:03:38.530> check<00:03:38.770> for<00:03:38.950> all

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
quickly do a little price check for all

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:46.290 
quickly do a little price check for all
you<00:03:39.280> guys<00:03:40.020> here

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:53.910 

and<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:47.470> comes<00:03:47.860> to<00:03:48.480> 250<00:03:50.520> 235<00:03:51.520> k<00:03:52.230> so<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.680> total

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
and that comes to 250 235 k so the total

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.460 
and that comes to 250 235 k so the total
cost<00:03:54.340> for<00:03:54.550> me<00:03:54.910> purchasing<00:03:55.570> all<00:03:55.780> those<00:03:56.080> mole

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
cost for me purchasing all those mole

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.920 
cost for me purchasing all those mole
skins<00:03:57.090> was<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:59.260> bought<00:04:00.250> them<00:04:00.400> at<00:04:00.520> 7.4<00:04:01.240> KH<00:04:01.630> so

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
skins was I bought them at 7.4 KH so

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.020 
skins was I bought them at 7.4 KH so
that<00:04:02.170> was<00:04:02.910> 210<00:04:03.910> k<00:04:04.300> so<00:04:05.050> we<00:04:05.170> basically<00:04:05.320> made<00:04:05.950> 26<00:04:06.700> k

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
that was 210 k so we basically made 26 k

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.080 
that was 210 k so we basically made 26 k
profit<00:04:07.830> doing<00:04:08.830> pretty<00:04:09.400> much<00:04:09.490> just<00:04:09.820> three

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
profit doing pretty much just three

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.390 
profit doing pretty much just three
minutes<00:04:10.270> work<00:04:10.630> and<00:04:10.960> the<00:04:11.950> best<00:04:12.190> thing<00:04:12.370> about

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
minutes work and the best thing about

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.030 
minutes work and the best thing about
this<00:04:12.640> it<00:04:13.030> this<00:04:13.480> actually<00:04:13.780> requires<00:04:14.350> it's<00:04:14.830> got

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
this it this actually requires it's got

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.280 
this it this actually requires it's got
no<00:04:15.190> requirements<00:04:15.910> so<00:04:16.360> that's<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.780> best<00:04:17.049> thing

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
no requirements so that's the best thing

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.000 
no requirements so that's the best thing
and<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:18.160> closer<00:04:18.549> this<00:04:19.150> gets<00:04:19.660> to<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.290> double

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
and the closer this gets to the double

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.140 
and the closer this gets to the double
XP<00:04:21.310> weekend<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:22.810> crush<00:04:23.200> nests<00:04:23.800> will<00:04:24.130> rise<00:04:24.490> so

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
XP weekend the crush nests will rise so

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.390 
XP weekend the crush nests will rise so
the<00:04:25.360> price<00:04:25.600> of<00:04:25.870> these<00:04:26.050> nests<00:04:26.560> will<00:04:26.860> keep<00:04:27.190> on

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
the price of these nests will keep on

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.970 
the price of these nests will keep on
rising<00:04:27.640> I'm<00:04:28.000> I'd<00:04:28.960> be<00:04:29.350> pretty<00:04:29.650> sure<00:04:29.950> that

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
rising I'm I'd be pretty sure that

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.660 
rising I'm I'd be pretty sure that
they're<00:04:30.250> going<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:30.460> reach<00:04:30.610> around<00:04:30.790> 7k<00:04:31.890> or<00:04:32.890> 7

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
they're going to reach around 7k or 7

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:39.630 
they're going to reach around 7k or 7
7.5<00:04:34.390> k<00:04:34.840> each<00:04:35.820> crush<00:04:36.820> nest<00:04:37.560> so<00:04:38.560> yeah<00:04:39.160> the<00:04:39.430> mole

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
7.5 k each crush nest so yeah the mole

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.390 
7.5 k each crush nest so yeah the mole
skins<00:04:40.000> they<00:04:40.450> shouldn't<00:04:40.930> rise<00:04:41.680> true<00:04:42.070> hi<00:04:42.250> I'm

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
skins they shouldn't rise true hi I'm

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.490 
skins they shouldn't rise true hi I'm
not<00:04:42.610> sure<00:04:42.940> how<00:04:43.540> many<00:04:43.810> people<00:04:44.200> are<00:04:44.290> going<00:04:44.410> to

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.530 
not sure how many people are going to
watch<00:04:44.650> this<00:04:44.830> video<00:04:45.100> so<00:04:45.640> if<00:04:45.850> you<00:04:45.970> get<00:04:46.090> in<00:04:46.240> quick

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
watch this video so if you get in quick

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.860 
watch this video so if you get in quick
and<00:04:46.920> purchase<00:04:47.920> all<00:04:48.100> your<00:04:48.370> mole<00:04:48.790> skins<00:04:49.150> I<00:04:49.420> would

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
and purchase all your mole skins I would

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.159 
and purchase all your mole skins I would
probably<00:04:50.140> hold<00:04:50.650> off<00:04:50.890> selling<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.669> actual

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
probably hold off selling the actual

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.010 
probably hold off selling the actual
nests<00:04:53.169> until<00:04:53.590> they<00:04:53.860> do<00:04:53.919> rise<00:04:54.310> to<00:04:54.520> about<00:04:54.610> 6k<00:04:55.300> but

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
nests until they do rise to about 6k but

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.530 
nests until they do rise to about 6k but
yeah<00:04:56.260> the<00:04:56.470> chance<00:04:56.770> of<00:04:57.010> draw<00:04:57.460> arm<00:04:57.700> getting<00:04:58.180> a

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
yeah the chance of draw arm getting a

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.320 
yeah the chance of draw arm getting a
good<00:04:59.230> seed<00:04:59.500> is<00:04:59.740> it's<00:05:00.310> pretty<00:05:00.640> decent<00:05:00.850> like<00:05:01.180> I
