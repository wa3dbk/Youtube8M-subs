called<00:00:30.929> native<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.480> a

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
called native and this is just a

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.420 
called native and this is just a
straight-up<00:00:33.899> creamy<00:00:34.469> lip<00:00:34.860> color<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.280> don't

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
straight-up creamy lip color I don't

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.819 
straight-up creamy lip color I don't
notice<00:00:35.730> any<00:00:36.000> shimmer<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.840> one<00:00:37.110> but<00:00:37.649> this

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
notice any shimmer in this one but this

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.520 
notice any shimmer in this one but this
is<00:00:37.890> definitely<00:00:38.219> like<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:38.879> peachy<00:00:39.780> pink<00:00:40.140> new

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
is definitely like that peachy pink new

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.229 
is definitely like that peachy pink new
so<00:00:40.680> there's<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.040> swatches<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.579> each<00:00:41.700> one<00:00:41.940> side

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
so there's the swatches of each one side

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.600 
so there's the swatches of each one side
by<00:00:42.450> side<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:43.170> see<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.710> lot<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.250> shine<00:00:44.579> in

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
by side you can see a lot of shine in

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.700 
by side you can see a lot of shine in
each<00:00:44.969> one<00:00:45.239> for<00:00:45.480> being<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.809> lipstick<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.469> think

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
each one for being a lipstick I think

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.459 
each one for being a lipstick I think
they're<00:00:46.890> decently<00:00:47.340> shiny<00:00:47.789> they<00:00:48.719> go<00:00:48.899> on<00:00:49.079> easily

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
they're decently shiny they go on easily

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.920 
they're decently shiny they go on easily
they<00:00:49.980> go<00:00:50.129> on<00:00:50.370> with<00:00:50.789> definitely<00:00:51.360> full<00:00:51.629> color

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
they go on with definitely full color

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.479 
they go on with definitely full color
you<00:00:52.199> know<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.379> don't<00:00:52.530> have<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.770> work<00:00:52.980> hard<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
you know you don't have to work hard to

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.970 
you know you don't have to work hard to
build<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.910> color<00:00:54.210> staying<00:00:54.840> power<00:00:55.140> wise<00:00:55.530> I

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
build that color staying power wise I

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.830 
build that color staying power wise I
feel<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.180> lighter<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> two

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
feel like the lighter of the two

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.830 
feel like the lighter of the two
disappears<00:00:58.739> much<00:00:59.100> much<00:00:59.399> more<00:00:59.579> quickly<00:00:59.760> on<00:01:00.270> my

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
disappears much much more quickly on my

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.720 
disappears much much more quickly on my
lips<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.770> may<00:01:01.980> just<00:01:02.160> be<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.399> nature<00:01:02.609> of

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
lips and it may just be the nature of

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.820 
lips and it may just be the nature of
the<00:01:02.820> color<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.329> know<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> lighter<00:01:03.780> shade<00:01:03.899> it's

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
first off from a line that is comparable

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.970 
first off from a line that is comparable
in<00:02:22.240> price<00:02:22.270> to<00:02:22.840> these<00:02:23.050> it<00:02:23.290> would<00:02:23.380> be<00:02:23.500> two-faced

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
in price to these it would be two-faced

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.220 
in price to these it would be two-faced
and<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.340> la<00:02:24.490> creme<00:02:24.760> lipsticks<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:25.540> really
