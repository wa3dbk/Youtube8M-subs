00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.900
 hello familiarize batelaan the guitarist of of the online music school 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.060
 I'm going to show you how to replace this rest of the guitar 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:14.499
 what do you need 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.499
 the cult was heavy for the best guitar player 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.130
 a leader 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.749
 a wire cutter 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:28.749
 and then stand in a row 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.650
 the first is to go in for decided think 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.650
 young line used for that 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.540
 you loosen the string 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.730
 the Romans turn to me 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.730
 if your lower tradition naturally comes loose 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.530
 at the head 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.030
 then you can release the strings 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.840
 so you usually get to release quickly by pushing the strings inside 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.090
 by the end of this year 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.160
 wasaar very well stuck then you can use young people during the very life 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.900
 weather 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.369
 and you can use that as a lever now it will come loose 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.070
 3 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
 and then you can go to the side 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.150
 grab from your new sets nada de dik a quick one and look for the way 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.040
 the number is indicated by the ball in the air 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.960
 8 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.880
 the pin comes in there 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.610
 this piece 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.430
 is with 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.530
 after half time 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.780
 9 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.150
 before you get on the first senna trick up until it hits the ball in it 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.800
 piece falls source 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.670
 the customer does not want me to be stuck 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.120
 then you only do a little against the Korean 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.380
 she does that here in the newspaper 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.380
 always to that hole of the support mechanism 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.340
 before the butcher is tense, we first have to make sure that we live a little tough there 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.859
 to have 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:13.859
 a hand so think if there is enough 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:16.669
 parents against 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.879
 and before that end of the taste under the taste 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:26.679
 then pull and there later 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:29.869
 and whose hand increases 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:31.539
 then you can do the strings 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:34.539
 on exciting 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.370
 that one has been moved is pressed down so that he does not sprint how 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.589
 that I let him go 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:43.949
 if the strings are someone's tension 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:46.949
 you can penalize with it 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:03.629
 New string can be displeased quickly because it stretches and sets when you get it 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.339
 fences you have that no longer 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:10.399
 if you keep these four fingers in the meantime you can attract me to the 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:11.099
 strings 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.339
 when you headwind with your thumb 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:15.559
 parkers on which 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:25.949
 so go your whole senna afc back and forth look 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.949
 and then the voters to again 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:38.339
 then we do the same thing twice more 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:45.629
 the bit to what still stands out 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.499
 we can cut with the nippers 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:49.230
 and do about 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.230
 until a centimeter tall vote and enjoy 

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:58.899
 so important to know that this is after a little incentive to properly 

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:00.489
 getting stuck 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.239
 both trainers to times better a few extra incentives in not properly tightening 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.569
 to get 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.029
 so you can also replace all other string aircraft 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:12.149
 If you don't have a voting device yourself then you can always vote for it 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:15.539
 of the site and that link can be found below 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:18.789
 good luck replacing liza and have fun playing
