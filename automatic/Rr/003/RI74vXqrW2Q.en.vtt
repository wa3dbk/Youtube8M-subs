according to if that member of 4chan is
correctly<00:01:27.659> either<00:01:27.990> way<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:29.100> was<00:01:29.250> news<00:01:29.460> that

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
correctly either way it was news that

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.160 
correctly either way it was news that
was<00:01:29.700> out<00:01:29.850> there<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.509> don't<00:01:30.570> think<00:01:30.780> I

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
was out there and I don't think I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.929 
was out there and I don't think I
haven't<00:01:31.409> seen<00:01:31.619> whether<00:01:31.890> it's<00:01:32.159> been<00:01:32.369> basically

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
haven't seen whether it's been basically

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.480 
haven't seen whether it's been basically
proven<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.509> be<00:01:33.600> true<00:01:33.840> or<00:01:33.990> false<00:01:34.020> or<00:01:34.530> or<00:01:35.009> not<00:01:35.280> so

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
proven to be true or false or or not so

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.410 
proven to be true or false or or not so
I<00:01:35.520> figured<00:01:35.759> I'd<00:01:35.850> at<00:01:35.939> least<00:01:36.060> share<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.240> with<00:01:36.329> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
I figured I'd at least share it with you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.490 
I figured I'd at least share it with you

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
guys because there hasn't been a lot of

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.590 
guys because there hasn't been a lot of
updates<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.159> if<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.000> real<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.450> could

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
updates and if it is real and that could

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.940 
updates and if it is real and that could
be<00:01:39.720> potentially<00:01:40.200> huge<00:01:40.500> if<00:01:40.650> we're<00:01:40.799> talking

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
be potentially huge if we're talking

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.520 
be potentially huge if we're talking
