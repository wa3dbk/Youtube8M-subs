business-wise is his business not what

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.209 
business-wise is his business not what
he<00:00:13.019> said<00:00:13.230> was<00:00:13.380> wrong<00:00:13.410> but<00:00:13.769> it's<00:00:13.889> his<00:00:14.009> business

he said was wrong but it's his business
well<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.790> think<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.420> if<00:00:15.570> if<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.350> regulations

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
well I think that if if the regulations

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.529 
well I think that if if the regulations
the<00:00:17.160> rules<00:00:17.340> say<00:00:17.550> he<00:00:17.699> can't<00:00:17.940> do<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.270> then<00:00:18.480> he

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
the rules say he can't do that then he

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.450 
the rules say he can't do that then he
shouldn't<00:00:18.779> do<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.050> cuz<00:00:19.619> he<00:00:19.710> did<00:00:19.920> get<00:00:20.070> caught<00:00:20.279> he

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
shouldn't do it cuz he did get caught he

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.920 
shouldn't do it cuz he did get caught he
didn't<00:00:20.640> come<00:00:20.789> out<00:00:20.820> saying<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:21.600> it's<00:00:21.810> a

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
didn't come out saying that so it's a

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.200 
didn't come out saying that so it's a
it's<00:00:22.109> an<00:00:22.529> interesting<00:00:22.740> thing<00:00:23.609> going<00:00:23.670> on<00:00:24.000> with

but<00:00:43.340> his<00:00:44.340> was<00:00:44.820> kind<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.719> light<00:00:46.050> at<00:00:46.260> this

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
but his was kind of in the light at this

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.740 
but his was kind of in the light at this
point<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.399> now<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:48.270> kind<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.539> know<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> little

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
point so now we kind of know a little

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.660 
point so now we kind of know a little
bit<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.140> truth<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.590> don't<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:50.399> just<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
bit of the truth I don't it's just the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.520 
bit of the truth I don't it's just the
energy<00:00:51.000> behind<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.510> do<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.750> want<00:00:51.960> somebody<00:00:52.199> to

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
energy behind it do you want somebody to

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.819 
energy behind it do you want somebody to
be<00:00:52.649> behind<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.280> energy<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.930> racist

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
be behind that the energy of that racist

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.090 
be behind that the energy of that racist
behavior<00:00:56.039> behind<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.940> company<00:00:57.329> absolutely<00:00:57.629> not
