confusing<00:01:05.549> numbers<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.600> three

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
confusing numbers you have three

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.929 
confusing numbers you have three
different<00:01:06.960> color<00:01:07.320> palettes<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.820> can

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
different color palettes so you can

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.240 
different color palettes so you can

the<00:01:13.950> nice<00:01:14.159> thing<00:01:14.400> about<00:01:14.490> six<00:01:14.939> colors<00:01:15.329> is<00:01:15.570> you

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
the nice thing about six colors is you

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.560 
the nice thing about six colors is you
can<00:01:15.840> get<00:01:15.960> real<00:01:16.650> detailed<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.579> like<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.270> see<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
can get real detailed I like to see the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.470 
can get real detailed I like to see the
gradual<00:01:19.229> taper<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.340> smaller<00:01:20.700> moving<00:01:21.300> the

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
gradual taper to smaller moving the

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.960 
gradual taper to smaller moving the
smallest<00:01:21.780> renting<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.590> brightest<00:01:23.010> and<00:01:23.220> all

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
smallest renting the brightest and all

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.660 
smallest renting the brightest and all
the<00:01:24.090> spectrum<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.659> between<00:01:24.690> I<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.100> see

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
the spectrum in between I like to see

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.940 
the spectrum in between I like to see
that<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.150> change<00:01:27.480> in<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.050> fish<00:01:28.260> size<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
that the change in the fish size and the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.750 
that the change in the fish size and the
size<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:30.300> bait<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.710> water<00:01:31.760> everything

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
size of the bait in the water everything

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.300 
size of the bait in the water everything
in<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.090> water<00:01:33.300> column<00:01:33.659> has<00:01:34.050> a<00:01:34.080> size<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:35.159> this

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
in the water column has a size and this

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.670 
in the water column has a size and this
helps<00:01:35.580> you<00:01:35.670> sort<00:01:35.940> it<00:01:36.030> out<00:01:36.150> really<00:01:36.390> fast<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:37.110> want

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
helps you sort it out really fast I want

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.560 
helps you sort it out really fast I want
to<00:01:37.770> see<00:01:37.920> what<00:01:38.159> what<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.580> where<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.120> plankton

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
to see what what the where the plankton

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.270 
to see what what the where the plankton
is<00:01:39.750> where<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.050> minerals<00:01:40.290> are<00:01:40.620> and<00:01:40.890> where<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
is where the minerals are and where the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.540 
is where the minerals are and where the
fish<00:01:41.490> are<00:01:41.700> that's<00:01:42.450> how<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.870> approach<00:01:43.550> the

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
fish are that's how I can approach the

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.990 
fish are that's how I can approach the
fish<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.300> can<00:01:45.630> come<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.640> drop<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
fish I can come in and drop it to the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.030 
fish I can come in and drop it to the

Bheema I've got I've got it on a white
angle<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.610> could<00:02:15.120> hit<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.420> right<00:02:15.599> here<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.230> go

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
angle I could hit it right here and go

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.530 
angle I could hit it right here and go
to<00:02:16.470> narrow<00:02:17.310> beam

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
of course a minute 28 feet and then it's

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.929 
of course a minute 28 feet and then it's
only<00:02:21.659> got<00:02:21.930> one<00:02:22.260> set<00:02:22.829> of<00:02:22.890> numbers<00:02:23.189> in<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.640> scale

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
only got one set of numbers in the scale

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.869 
only got one set of numbers in the scale
that<00:02:24.180> you're<00:02:24.360> at<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:25.019> winter<00:02:25.560> blaster<00:02:26.519> units

I<00:02:26.939> like<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.360> zoom<00:02:27.540> function<00:02:27.780> on<00:02:28.140> the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
I like the zoom function on the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.740 
I like the zoom function on the
hummingbird<00:02:28.650> because<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.909> could<00:02:30.090> dial<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.599> to

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
hummingbird because you could dial it to

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.319 
hummingbird because you could dial it to
any<00:02:30.930> part<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.739> water<00:02:31.950> column<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.579> zoom<00:02:33.090> in

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
any part of the water column and zoom in

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.830 
any part of the water column and zoom in
twice<00:02:33.989> as<00:02:34.230> detailed<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.879> can<00:02:36.060> see<00:02:36.299> up

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
twice as detailed so you can see up

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.990 
twice as detailed so you can see up
close<00:02:36.900> what<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.739> fish<00:02:38.010> are<00:02:38.159> really<00:02:38.400> doing<00:02:38.579> if

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
close what the fish are really doing if

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.190 
close what the fish are really doing if
they're<00:02:39.239> moving<00:02:39.450> around<00:02:39.690> or<00:02:39.989> if<00:02:40.049> they're

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
they're moving around or if they're

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.410 
they're moving around or if they're
holding<00:02:40.379> still<00:02:40.769> if<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.129> zoom<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.579> and<00:02:41.819> it's

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
holding still if you zoom in and it's

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.220

you know it's bait fish using the zoom
is<00:02:45.569> great<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.170> determine<00:02:46.859> what's<00:02:47.549> down<00:02:47.790> there

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
is great to determine what's down there

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
set the target line here's the target

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.449 
set the target line here's the target
line<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:52.109> like<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.590> use<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.099> set<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.430> to

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459
