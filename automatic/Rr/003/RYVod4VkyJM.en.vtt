was riding that bike I wanted to have a

bike in my life now at the time I just

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.540 
bike in my life now at the time I just
thought<00:03:26.650> we<00:03:26.740> probably<00:03:26.860> an<00:03:27.070> off-road<00:03:27.340> bike

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
thought we probably an off-road bike

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.490 
thought we probably an off-road bike
that<00:03:27.730> I'd<00:03:27.820> ride<00:03:28.000> around<00:03:28.240> places<00:03:28.900> but<00:03:29.050> then<00:03:29.200> to

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
that I'd ride around places but then to

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.700 
that I'd ride around places but then to
come<00:03:29.800> to<00:03:29.920> learn<00:03:30.040> that<00:03:31.410> there<00:03:32.410> isn't<00:03:32.650> many

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
come to learn that there isn't many

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.640 
come to learn that there isn't many
places<00:03:33.040> which<00:03:34.920> allow<00:03:35.920> you<00:03:35.980> to<00:03:36.250> do<00:03:36.370> that

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
round here and so it became road-based

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.600 
round here and so it became road-based
