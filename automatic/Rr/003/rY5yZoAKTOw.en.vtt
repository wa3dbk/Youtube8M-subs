00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.319 
on the right we have the bear the third
beast<00:02:32.159> that<00:02:32.430> comes<00:02:32.640> up<00:02:32.760> out<00:02:32.909> of<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.150> sea

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
beast that comes up out of the sea

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:38.089 
beast that comes up out of the sea
actually<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.140> second<00:02:34.890> beast<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:36.620> they<00:02:37.620> show

the<00:02:38.310> bear<00:02:38.849> as<00:02:39.170> larger<00:02:40.170> than<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.439> other<00:02:40.620> two

the bear as larger than the other two
animals<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.900> believe<00:02:43.230> that's<00:02:43.409> because<00:02:43.889> the

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
animals and I believe that's because the

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.729 
animals and I believe that's because the
bear<00:02:44.540> symbolizes<00:02:45.540> Russia<00:02:45.810> what's<00:02:46.530> really

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
bear symbolizes Russia what's really

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.190 
bear symbolizes Russia what's really
interesting<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.549> that<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.720> bear<00:02:48.959> does<00:02:49.170> not

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
interesting is that the bear does not

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.190 
interesting is that the bear does not
have<00:02:49.650> for<00:02:49.950> tolls<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.730> bear<00:02:50.970> has<00:02:51.209> five<00:02:51.629> toes<00:02:51.930> on

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
have for tolls the bear has five toes on

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.080 
have for tolls the bear has five toes on
this<00:02:52.379> paw<00:02:52.819> five<00:02:53.819> toes<00:02:54.209> on<00:02:54.450> this<00:02:54.659> paw<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:56.090> three

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
this paw five toes on this paw and three

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.869 
this paw five toes on this paw and three
on<00:02:57.359> one<00:02:57.840> of<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.079> feet<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.530> two<00:02:59.189> on<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.579> other

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
on one of the feet and two on the other

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.509 
on one of the feet and two on the other
feet<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.450> think<00:03:01.319> that<00:03:01.590> they<00:03:01.799> are<00:03:01.980> trying<00:03:02.250> to

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
feet I think that they are trying to

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.679 
feet I think that they are trying to
expropriate<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:04.260> number<00:03:04.879> 555<00:03:05.879> for<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.359> bear

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
expropriate the number 555 for the bear

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.619 
expropriate the number 555 for the bear
and<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.470> is<00:03:07.739> not<00:03:08.189> accurate<00:03:08.430> as<00:03:08.849> far<00:03:09.450> as

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
and that is not accurate as far as

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.159 
and that is not accurate as far as
prophecy<00:03:10.230> goals<00:03:10.669> so<00:03:11.669> yes<00:03:12.030> they<00:03:12.419> are<00:03:12.659> correct

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169

semi-circle<00:04:13.259> it's<00:04:13.799> quite<00:04:14.069> interesting

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:14.479 
semi-circle it's quite interesting

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:20.960 
semi-circle it's quite interesting
design<00:04:15.829> but<00:04:16.829> what<00:04:17.070> that<00:04:17.250> gives<00:04:17.519> us<00:04:17.789> is<00:04:18.409> 555<00:04:19.970> now

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
design but what that gives us is 555 now

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.240 
design but what that gives us is 555 now
I'm<00:04:21.150> not<00:04:21.180> sure<00:04:21.570> how<00:04:22.139> much<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.620> designers<00:04:23.219> of

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
were doing

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.930 
were doing
but<00:04:27.270> on<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.480> other<00:04:27.570> hand<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:29.040> numerology<00:04:29.760> of
