so<00:00:01.020> this<00:00:01.260> is<00:00:01.410> how<00:00:01.589> the<00:00:02.370> table<00:00:02.820> that<00:00:02.970> we<00:00:03.120> built

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
so this is how the table that we built

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.020 
so this is how the table that we built
is<00:00:03.570> it<00:00:03.959> looks<00:00:06.440> here<00:00:07.440> as<00:00:07.620> you<00:00:07.770> would<00:00:07.919> see<00:00:08.160> it<00:00:08.610> it

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
is it looks here as you would see it it

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.129 
is it looks here as you would see it it
is<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.809> same<00:00:10.260> material<00:00:11.450> from<00:00:12.450> our<00:00:12.660> flooring

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
is of same material from our flooring

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.439 
is of same material from our flooring
and<00:00:14.509> it's<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.660> quite<00:00:16.170> big<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.859> fact<00:00:17.130> 11<00:00:18.029> feet<00:00:18.270> by

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
and it's a quite big in fact 11 feet by

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.980 
and it's a quite big in fact 11 feet by
28<00:00:18.840> inches<00:00:19.970> finished<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.330> end<00:00:21.510> molding

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
28 inches finished with the end molding

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.550 
28 inches finished with the end molding
on<00:00:22.699> both<00:00:23.699> sides<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:26.150> at<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.420> edge<00:00:28.080> where<00:00:28.439> it

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
on both sides and at the edge where it

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.430 
on both sides and at the edge where it
meets<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:29.099> wall<00:00:30.980> we<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.520> cocked<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.030> nice<00:00:33.630> so

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
meets the wall we we cocked it nice so

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.549 
meets the wall we we cocked it nice so
it<00:00:34.739> looks<00:00:34.980> good<00:00:35.630> and<00:00:36.950> we<00:00:38.000> took<00:00:39.000> about<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:40.140> think

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
it looks good and we took about I think

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.510 
it looks good and we took about I think
enough<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.520> rows<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:42.059> laminate<00:00:42.989> pieces<00:00:43.379> and

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.130 

usually<00:00:47.520> these<00:00:47.760> laminate<00:00:48.300> pieces<00:00:48.629> are<00:00:48.809> alike

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
usually these laminate pieces are alike

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.240 
usually these laminate pieces are alike
a<00:00:49.170> snap<00:00:49.680> joint<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.270> it's<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.440> jigsaw

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
a snap joint so it's just like a jigsaw

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.920 
a snap joint so it's just like a jigsaw
puzzle<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:53.760> easily<00:00:54.239> join<00:00:54.480> them<00:00:54.750> and

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
puzzle you can easily join them and

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.400 
puzzle you can easily join them and
basically<00:00:55.610> only<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.090> worry<00:00:57.989> about<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
basically only have to worry about the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.130 
basically only have to worry about the
length<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.949> we<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> saw<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.899> could<00:01:01.079> be

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
length so we have a saw and we could be

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.560 
length so we have a saw and we could be
able<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.500> cut<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.789> desired<00:01:03.059> length

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
able to cut it to the desired length

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.670 
able to cut it to the desired length
make<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> desired<00:01:04.979> length<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.369> we<00:01:06.680> we

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
make it to the desired length and we we

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.219 
make it to the desired length and we we
decided<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.520> use<00:01:08.700> Levin<00:01:09.000> fit<00:01:09.180> because<00:01:09.540> we<00:01:09.869> use

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
decided to use Levin fit because we use

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.140 
decided to use Levin fit because we use
enough<00:01:10.619> space<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:10.920> two<00:01:11.490> people<00:01:11.729> to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
enough space for two people to

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.280 
enough space for two people to
comfortably<00:01:13.070> sit<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.310> work<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:16.640> also<00:01:17.640> we

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
comfortably sit and work and also we

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.830 
comfortably sit and work and also we
made<00:01:19.290> provision<00:01:20.070> for<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.520> cables<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:23.840> come

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
made provision for the cables to come

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.469 
made provision for the cables to come
out<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.130> one<00:01:26.369> place<00:01:26.640> where<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.030> did<00:01:27.360> it

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
out so this is one place where we did it

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.550 
out so this is one place where we did it
basically<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.680> square<00:01:29.009> shaped<00:01:29.479> hole<00:01:30.479> one<00:01:31.409> is

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
basically a square shaped hole one is

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.090 
basically a square shaped hole one is
here<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.479> other<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.200> next<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
here and other is it and next to the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.940 
here and other is it and next to the
docking<00:01:35.820> station<00:01:35.850> there<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.960> two<00:01:37.619> square

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
docking station there so two square

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.389 
docking station there so two square
shaped<00:01:38.189> holes<00:01:38.850> for<00:01:39.720> cables<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.619> come<00:01:41.400> out<00:01:41.549> and

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
shaped holes for cables to come out and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.200 
shaped holes for cables to come out and
that's<00:01:44.399> pretty<00:01:44.640> much<00:01:44.820> it

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
that's pretty much it

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.460 
that's pretty much it
let's<00:01:45.450> see<00:01:45.960> how<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.470> looks<00:01:46.680> from<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> bottom

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
let's see how it looks from the bottom

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.990 
let's see how it looks from the bottom

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
[Music]

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.630

so<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.630> have<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.710> wooden<00:01:53.689> bracket<00:01:54.689> that

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
so we have one wooden bracket that

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.880 
so we have one wooden bracket that
supports<00:01:56.640> at<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.909> end<00:01:57.259> we<00:01:58.259> use<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.740> wooden

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
supports at the end we use the wooden

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.520 
supports at the end we use the wooden
bracket<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.820> we<00:01:59.969> built<00:02:00.210> because<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:01.350> also

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
bracket we that we built because it also

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.910 
bracket we that we built because it also
takes<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:03.020> support<00:02:04.020> further<00:02:04.229> from<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.799> other

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
takes the support further from the other

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.449 
takes the support further from the other
wall<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:06.570> rest<00:02:06.780> remaining<00:02:07.530> we<00:02:07.890> use<00:02:08.039> total

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
wall and the rest remaining we use total

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.230 
wall and the rest remaining we use total
five<00:02:08.670> brackets<00:02:09.119> one<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.750> wood<00:02:09.929> at<00:02:10.860> the

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
five brackets one is the wood at the

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
and remaining for our metal brackets I

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.300 
and remaining for our metal brackets I
found<00:02:14.690> them<00:02:14.870> at<00:02:15.020> Lowe's<00:02:16.450> not<00:02:17.450> expensive<00:02:17.990> stuff

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
found them at Lowe's not expensive stuff

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
found them at Lowe's not expensive stuff
and<00:02:19.510> serves<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.690> purpose<00:02:21.020> so<00:02:21.820> four<00:02:22.820> or<00:02:22.970> four

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
brackets that that are giving the

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.280 
brackets that that are giving the
support<00:03:00.440> to<00:03:00.710> that<00:03:00.890> table<00:03:01.840> that's<00:03:02.840> pretty<00:03:03.140> much

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
support to that table that's pretty much

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.880 
support to that table that's pretty much
it<00:03:03.530> that's<00:03:03.740> that's<00:03:04.700> that's<00:03:05.360> all<00:03:05.570> it<00:03:05.900> it<00:03:06.560> has

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
it that's that's that's all it it has

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.510 
it that's that's that's all it it has
nothing<00:03:07.840> major<00:03:09.580> simple<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:10.700> straightforward

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
nothing major simple and straightforward

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.010 
nothing major simple and straightforward
easily<00:03:13.520> built<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:14.000> think<00:03:14.810> we<00:03:14.960> spent<00:03:15.760> roughly

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
easily built I think we spent roughly

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.340 
easily built I think we spent roughly
about<00:03:18.940> $80<00:03:19.940> because<00:03:20.180> we<00:03:20.720> already<00:03:20.900> have<00:03:21.320> the

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
about $80 because we already have the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.400 
about $80 because we already have the
laminate<00:03:22.090> all<00:03:23.090> I<00:03:23.150> think<00:03:23.480> we<00:03:23.900> spend<00:03:24.200> less<00:03:24.350> than

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
laminate all I think we spend less than

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.200 
laminate all I think we spend less than
$80<00:03:25.130> but<00:03:25.820> even<00:03:26.090> if<00:03:26.210> you<00:03:26.330> don't<00:03:26.600> have<00:03:26.900> a

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
$80 but even if you don't have a

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.640 
$80 but even if you don't have a
laminate<00:03:29.210> leftover<00:03:29.690> laminate<00:03:30.080> or<00:03:30.230> from<00:03:30.500> your

flooring<00:03:31.100> we<00:03:31.670> can<00:03:31.850> still<00:03:32.090> do<00:03:32.330> it<00:03:32.390> we<00:03:33.430> may<00:03:34.430> need

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
flooring we can still do it we may need

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:35.620 
flooring we can still do it we may need
a<00:03:34.610> couple<00:03:35.060> of<00:03:35.150> boxes

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630
