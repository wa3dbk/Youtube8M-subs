functions<00:00:23.850> what<00:00:24.390> they're<00:00:24.539> worried<00:00:24.900> about<00:00:24.960> is

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
functions what they're worried about is

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.720 
functions what they're worried about is
what<00:00:25.380> they<00:00:25.500> consider<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.949> be<00:00:26.039> unfair

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
what they consider to be unfair

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.150 
what they consider to be unfair
competition<00:00:27.090> uh<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.349> think<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.920> what<00:00:29.039> they're

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
competition uh I think that what they're

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.950 
competition uh I think that what they're
really<00:00:29.519> worried<00:00:29.760> about<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.119> just<00:00:30.150> competition

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
really worried about is just competition

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.630 
really worried about is just competition
but<00:00:31.320> they<00:00:31.410> say<00:00:31.560> unfair<00:00:31.890> for<00:00:32.160> their<00:00:32.279> for<00:00:32.550> their

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
but they say unfair for their for their

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.430 
but they say unfair for their for their
sake<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.630> problem<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:33.989> they<00:00:34.170> have<00:00:34.290> with

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
sake so the problem that they have with

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.290 
sake so the problem that they have with
Tesla<00:00:34.800> specifically<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.820> they<00:00:36.120> don't

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
dealers do I think that they've long

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.370

outlived<00:03:49.400> any<00:03:49.970> usefulness<00:03:50.570> that<00:03:50.600> they<00:03:50.870> have<00:03:51.140> I

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
outlived any usefulness that they have I

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.500 
outlived any usefulness that they have I
like<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:52.040> Tesla<00:03:52.430> is<00:03:52.579> innovating<00:03:53.209> uh

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
like the Tesla is innovating uh

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.830 
like the Tesla is innovating uh
and<00:03:54.140> unfortunately<00:03:55.100> uh<00:03:55.489> if<00:03:55.940> this<00:03:56.239> passes

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
and unfortunately uh if this passes

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.210 
and unfortunately uh if this passes
they'll<00:03:57.049> be<00:03:57.140> constrained<00:03:57.620> at<00:03:57.739> least<00:03:57.890> in<00:03:58.040> one

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
they'll be constrained at least in one

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.100 
they'll be constrained at least in one
state<00:03:58.549> I<00:03:58.760> have<00:03:59.120> a<00:03:59.150> feeling<00:03:59.630> that<00:03:59.720> this<00:03:59.840> will<00:04:00.019> be

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
state I have a feeling that this will be

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.199 
state I have a feeling that this will be
seen<00:04:00.320> to<00:04:00.350> be<00:04:00.470> unconstitutional<00:04:00.829> at<00:04:01.610> least

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
seen to be unconstitutional at least

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.540 
seen to be unconstitutional at least
that's<00:04:02.360> my<00:04:02.420> hope
