penny scent logo and then you got this

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.760

like<00:02:08.190> blue<00:02:08.610> kind<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.270> sole<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.750> guess<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.200> saw<00:02:10.649> in

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
like blue kind of sole I guess I saw in

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.800 
like blue kind of sole I guess I saw in
videos<00:02:11.039> like<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.459> prevent<00:02:11.760> yellowing<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.780> I

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
videos like to prevent yellowing so I

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.160 
videos like to prevent yellowing so I
guess<00:02:12.959> that's<00:02:13.080> why<00:02:13.260> they<00:02:13.410> did<00:02:13.560> this

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
guess that's why they did this

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.830 
guess that's why they did this
so<00:02:16.170> that's<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.470> underneath<00:02:16.800> of<00:02:16.950> them

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
so that's the underneath of them

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.040 
so that's the underneath of them
carbon-fiber

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
carbon-fiber

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.280
