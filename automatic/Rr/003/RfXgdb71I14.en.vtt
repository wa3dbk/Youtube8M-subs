00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
with this update let's go ahead and

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.980 
with this update let's go ahead and
start<00:00:11.910> off<00:00:12.030> with<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.210> first<00:00:12.330> thing<00:00:12.719> which<00:00:12.870> is

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
start off with the first thing which is

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.299 
start off with the first thing which is
the<00:00:13.080> most<00:00:13.200> obvious<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.950> that's<00:00:14.099> definitely

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
the most obvious and that's definitely

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.519 
the most obvious and that's definitely
the<00:00:14.610> new<00:00:14.759> defense<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.690> was<00:00:15.809> added<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.320> at

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
the new defense that was added in at

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.500 
the new defense that was added in at
Town<00:00:16.770> Hall<00:00:16.800> six<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.880> air<00:00:18.029> sweeper<00:00:18.449> is

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
Town Hall six so the air sweeper is

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.000 
Town Hall six so the air sweeper is
going<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.720> be<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> different<00:00:19.320> type<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.500> defense

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
going to be a different type of defense

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.980 
going to be a different type of defense
and<00:00:20.310> I'd<00:00:20.760> rather<00:00:20.910> than<00:00:21.150> dealing<00:00:21.390> damage<00:00:21.660> it

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
and I'd rather than dealing damage it

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.019 
and I'd rather than dealing damage it
actually<00:00:22.320> does<00:00:22.500> zero<00:00:22.890> damage<00:00:23.250> but<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.699> pushes

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
actually does zero damage but it pushes

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.300 
actually does zero damage but it pushes
air<00:00:24.420> troops<00:00:24.779> away<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.800> gives<00:00:25.980> your<00:00:26.099> other

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
air troops away and it gives your other

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.970 
air troops away and it gives your other
defenses<00:00:26.820> more<00:00:27.029> time<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.510> attack<00:00:27.980> especially

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
defenses more time to attack especially

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.800 
defenses more time to attack especially

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
little bit more time to attack so you

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.439 
little bit more time to attack so you
can<00:00:50.070> see<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.610> rotate<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.360> a

clan castle troop that's like 15 tiles
away<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:58.989> they<00:03:59.170> switch<00:03:59.440> their<00:03:59.650> target<00:03:59.980> from

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
away and they switch their target from

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.099 
away and they switch their target from
their<00:04:00.220> town<00:04:00.430> hall<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:01.120> that<00:04:01.269> single<00:04:01.600> Archer

that<00:04:02.260> is<00:04:02.380> just<00:04:02.560> hanging<00:04:02.799> out<00:04:03.010> doing

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
that is just hanging out doing

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.280 
that is just hanging out doing
absolutely<00:04:03.579> nothing<00:04:04.000> so<00:04:04.450> apparently<00:04:05.049> it

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
absolutely nothing so apparently it

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.080 
absolutely nothing so apparently it
seems<00:04:05.859> that<00:04:06.010> they<00:04:06.130> fix<00:04:06.430> that<00:04:06.640> to<00:04:06.850> where<00:04:06.970> the

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
seems that they fix that to where the

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.819 
seems that they fix that to where the
range<00:04:07.299> isn't<00:04:07.540> as<00:04:07.780> large<00:04:08.140> and<00:04:08.500> your<00:04:08.590> troops

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
range isn't as large and your troops

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.319 
range isn't as large and your troops
aren't<00:04:08.980> going<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.190> be<00:04:09.250> as<00:04:09.280> easily<00:04:09.579> distracted

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
aren't going to be as easily distracted

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.000 
aren't going to be as easily distracted
and<00:04:10.480> that's<00:04:11.200> something<00:04:11.440> that<00:04:11.560> I'm<00:04:11.769> definitely

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
and that's something that I'm definitely

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.349 
and that's something that I'm definitely
looking<00:04:12.310> forward<00:04:12.670> to<00:04:12.850> and<00:04:12.970> I'm<00:04:13.030> gonna<00:04:13.150> have<00:04:13.269> to

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:14.430 
looking forward to and I'm gonna have to
test<00:04:13.569> that<00:04:13.630> out<00:04:13.750> with<00:04:13.989> a<00:04:14.019> couple<00:04:14.230> of

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
test that out with a couple of

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.710 
test that out with a couple of
high-level<00:04:14.680> attacks<00:04:15.280> as<00:04:15.579> well<00:04:15.970> as<00:04:16.299> inside<00:04:16.479> of

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
eggs that i found but obviously that

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.100 
eggs that i found but obviously that
seems<00:04:33.950> like<00:04:34.070> something<00:04:34.250> pretty<00:04:34.610> good<00:04:34.850> to<00:04:35.030> me

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
seems like something pretty good to me

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.390 
seems like something pretty good to me
also<00:04:36.110> they<00:04:36.260> did<00:04:36.410> change<00:04:36.590> matchmaking<00:04:37.160> to

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
also they did change matchmaking to

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
also they did change matchmaking to
where<00:04:37.520> you're<00:04:37.610> going<00:04:37.730> to<00:04:37.790> be<00:04:37.880> finding<00:04:38.210> targets

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
where you're going to be finding targets

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.150 
where you're going to be finding targets
near<00:04:39.080> or<00:04:39.410> you're<00:04:39.650> going<00:04:39.770> to<00:04:39.830> find<00:04:39.950> more

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
near or you're going to find more

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.680 
near or you're going to find more
targets<00:04:40.550> that<00:04:40.610> are<00:04:40.670> closer<00:04:40.970> to<00:04:41.210> your<00:04:41.330> town

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.550 
hall level when you're searching for new
players<00:04:43.790> so<00:04:44.030> it<00:04:44.180> seems<00:04:44.480> like<00:04:44.660> they<00:04:44.870> change

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
players so it seems like they change

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.200 
players so it seems like they change
that<00:04:45.710> algorithm<00:04:46.010> just<00:04:46.400> a<00:04:46.490> little<00:04:46.730> bit<00:04:46.850> again

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
that algorithm just a little bit again

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.460 
that algorithm just a little bit again
I'm<00:04:47.360> gonna<00:04:47.480> have<00:04:47.600> to<00:04:47.690> test<00:04:47.870> that<00:04:47.990> a<00:04:48.050> little<00:04:48.350> bit

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
I'm gonna have to test that a little bit

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.560 
I'm gonna have to test that a little bit

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
level as mine that I find but overall

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.810 
level as mine that I find but overall
pretty<00:04:57.350> interesting<00:04:58.190> stuff<00:04:58.220> inside<00:04:58.640> of<00:04:58.760> this

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
pretty interesting stuff inside of this
