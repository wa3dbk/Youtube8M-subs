00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.369

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.770
 medication for hypertensive patients for 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.330
 lower the tension but as effects 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.310
 side effects of that medicine 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.500
 patients noticed that they grew a lot 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.180
 the hair on the head and elsewhere 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.279
 of the body then to see this effect 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.899
 in the patients decided 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.270
 market it as a hair grower the 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.430
 minoxidil is a vasodilator that is 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.380
 they make blood flow better by the 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.570
 Scalp ratomir acts 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.000
 stimulating the opening of the channels 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.670
 of potassium and preventing calcium 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.870
 that stops hair growth 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.150
 enter the cells of the leather 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.460
 scalp this most directed video so much

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.180
 men because when you start to 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.520
 present a little clear in the 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.210
 entries or in the crown of the head 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.299

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.520

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.290
 girls if you have a lot of hair and 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.120
 you start to see some clarillo for the 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.400
 stress hormonal changes or whatever 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.460
 and we will begin to grow between 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.650
 hair fred to fall and active as 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.690
 It grows that is the impressive thing about 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.520
 this product I am going to tell you my 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.280
 personal experience a couple of years ago 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.810
 I had a very strong stress period and I 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.210
 they started to come out a little bit of whites 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.210
 in the hair I tried everything good 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.310
 food relaxation pills 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.380
 vitamin pills and it did not make me 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.150
 absolutely nothing until it went to 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.330
 doctor to tell you my problem and I 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.280
 I open the minoxidil then throw me out and do not 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.190
 exist every day without exception 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.720
 for three months and already sergio see how 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.130
 in the places where there were no hairs 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.440
 small circuits where there was no 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.350
 hairs began to grow hair again 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.410
 gives a lot of hope because of course 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.940
 you think that that is not going to cure you 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.830
 then that you get hair makes you be 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.290
 more constant and more constant and more 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.140
 constant then first of all and 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.630
 The most fundamental thing is to take minoxidil 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.550
 the only problem areas is 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.320
 say not at all in all the leather 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.120
 scalp but in the zones 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.810
 problematic because the one that covers a lot 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.390
 little bit 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.770
 it's better to focus on those little ones 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.920
 pretty and then not every night is 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.319
 very important with a massage with a good 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.510
 1 minute massage which activates a massage 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.400
 circulation and that makes it penetrate the 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.459
 product I did not throw all the 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.810
 nights 1.5 milliliters normally the 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.400
 instructions says you have to lie down 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.650
 one milliliter in the morning and a 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.959
 milliliter at night it seemed to me 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.780
 very cumbersome and all that then I 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.970
 I said then I put 15 milliliters per 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.830
 the nights that I do a good massage and the 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.040
 I forget all day long you 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.049
 do what you want best video 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.810
 -If I use the brand of the 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.900
 concentration hing cob 5% there 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.840
 2% concentration of 5% I am a 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.310
 bit gross and I'm going to max out then 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.310
 5% concentration 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.940
 but you have to be careful the type 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.070
 tense you have low tension 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.290
 because this product lowers the 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.150
 tension I for example I am hypotensive 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.370
 I have tension always on the floor 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.790
 then starting at least a little bit to 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.830
 little by little to see if I got dizzy if 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.510
 anything happened, nothing happened to me 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.710
 also melody always at night 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.320
 when I do not have to do any 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.330
 important activity then you 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.770
 you are hypotensive trying a little 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.320
 before it should not be what happens any 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.240
 thing but usually nothing else happens 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.920
 important is that after giving you the 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.530
 you have to wash very well the 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.900
 hands because there have been cases that 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.090
 when giving the cob and not washing and not washing 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.270
 the hands start to come out hairs in the 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.120
 that is to say it is so strong that it is 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.280
 I mean it makes your hair grow where you 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.870
 what you put is to say is very strong so 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.000
 have a little bit of care do not go to 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.950
 be that you put it on your face because 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.980
 splash anything not key not 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.350
 you see it and we have a problem, though 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.580
 by itself the minoxidil is very effective 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.830
 I always help him with some 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.030
 nutritional supplement that helps me 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.650
 that effect is 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.989
 lasting I for example I'm taking in 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.210
 this parking money but you can take 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.760
 any nutritional supplement 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.560
 who have vitamin b are the ones who 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.380
 help growth and 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.270
 strengthening the root good up 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.220
 here the video today is constant if in 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.510
 three months you do not have the results os 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.510
 I assure you, see you later
