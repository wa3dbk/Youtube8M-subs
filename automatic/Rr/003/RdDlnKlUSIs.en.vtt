00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.560
 residents of a small village zuevka 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.450
 located between three 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.459
 reservoirs in the confluence of the river 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.930
 alders in the pot frankly not 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.760
 envy the fact that this 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.680
 the settlement has become the frontline zone 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.779
 with all the consequences 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.340
 entrenched kilometers 4 5 from the village 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.710
 units of the Ukrainian army without 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.720
 tired of firing at him given that 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.220
 an explosion will throw military objects understand what 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.380
 guided by Ukrainian gunners 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.510
 shelling that houses that objects 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.430
 infrastructure can sometimes be hard 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.649
 It seems that the Ukrainian military too 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.390
 sorry for the bluntness of your hands have grown not 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.969
 from there and they are utterly utter as they say 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.679
 Where God will send Tomin is hail shells 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.539
 or worse of a tornado now and then 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:43.940
 land in courtyards and residences 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:46.100
 got caught by a local mine cemetery 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.499
 82 caliber fallen almost in the center 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.539
 graveyard Radislav slivers a few graves 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:52.909
 at least 5 memorial sites 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.010
 the villagers did not understand what the fragments 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.929
 still prevented manicured graves of their 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.819
 deceased relatives of the Ukrainian army 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.319
 is it necessary to say what is happening 

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:01.789
 leaves an indelible soul scarf 

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:03.499
 literally every prong 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.479
 and then it is also surprising that the main 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:07.399
 the backbone of the militia fighting on the approaches 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.350

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.100
 after all, and even more so 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.259
 difficult to wash in the trenches 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.780

 everything has broken by fragments by a miracle 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.969
 rescued and a man living nearby 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.920
