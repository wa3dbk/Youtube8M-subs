has<00:04:47.130> to<00:04:47.310> do<00:04:47.430> with<00:04:47.730> what<00:04:48.180> we<00:04:48.270> saw<00:04:48.480> with<00:04:48.630> the

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
has to do with what we saw with the

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.990 
has to do with what we saw with the
yacht<00:04:48.990> this<00:04:49.710> is<00:04:49.920> an<00:04:50.040> assumption<00:04:50.400> here<00:04:50.670> because

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
yacht this is an assumption here because

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.240 
yacht this is an assumption here because
we<00:04:51.480> did<00:04:51.660> use<00:04:51.810> a<00:04:51.840> parachute<00:04:52.320> in<00:04:52.470> that<00:04:52.680> job<00:04:52.980> and

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
we did use a parachute in that job and

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.800 
we did use a parachute in that job and
that<00:04:53.460> is<00:04:53.610> probably<00:04:53.850> what<00:04:54.210> we're<00:04:54.390> doing<00:04:54.600> here

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
that is probably what we're doing here

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.170 
that is probably what we're doing here
not<00:04:55.230> exactly<00:04:55.440> sure<00:04:55.680> next<00:04:56.460> picture<00:04:56.640> we<00:04:56.820> have<00:04:56.970> is

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
not exactly sure next picture we have is

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.120 
not exactly sure next picture we have is
of<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.450> fourth<00:04:57.780> team<00:04:58.140> gear<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:58.590> this<00:04:58.980> is<00:04:59.100> a

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
of the fourth team gear and this is a

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.820 
of the fourth team gear and this is a
thermite<00:04:59.610> bomb<00:05:00.320> thermite<00:05:01.320> bomb<00:05:01.470> did<00:05:01.650> you<00:05:01.710> hear

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
thermite bomb thermite bomb did you hear

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
thermite bomb thermite bomb did you hear
that<00:05:02.930> now<00:05:03.930> that<00:05:04.110> is<00:05:04.200> a<00:05:04.230> leaked<00:05:04.680> weapon<00:05:05.670> or

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
that now that is a leaked weapon or

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.820 
that now that is a leaked weapon or
piece<00:05:06.270> of<00:05:06.420> artillery<00:05:06.720> that<00:05:07.350> I<00:05:07.380> talked<00:05:07.710> about

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
piece of artillery that I talked about

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.450 
piece of artillery that I talked about
months<00:05:08.610> ago<00:05:08.870> it's<00:05:09.870> finally<00:05:10.350> coming<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:10.830> we<00:05:11.040> we

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
months ago it's finally coming and we we

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.370 
months ago it's finally coming and we we
speculated<00:05:12.060> that<00:05:12.150> thermite<00:05:12.540> bomb<00:05:12.720> would<00:05:13.260> be

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
speculated that thermite bomb would be

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.770 
speculated that thermite bomb would be
coming<00:05:13.620> with<00:05:13.770> a<00:05:13.830> heist<00:05:14.100> dlc<00:05:14.280> and<00:05:14.730> damn<00:05:15.270> there

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
coming with a heist dlc and damn there

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.920 
coming with a heist dlc and damn there
it<00:05:15.900> is<00:05:15.960> boys<00:05:16.550> I'm<00:05:17.550> sir<00:05:17.910> I<00:05:18.120> told<00:05:18.630> you<00:05:18.750> this

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
it is boys I'm sir I told you this

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.390 
it is boys I'm sir I told you this
league<00:05:19.200> stuff<00:05:19.410> actually<00:05:19.650> comes<00:05:20.100> out<00:05:20.190> to<00:05:20.310> be

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
league stuff actually comes out to be

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.700 
league stuff actually comes out to be
true<00:05:20.580> eventually<00:05:21.090> it<00:05:21.540> just<00:05:21.600> takes<00:05:21.900> time<00:05:22.320> so

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
true eventually it just takes time so

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.260 
true eventually it just takes time so
the<00:05:22.800> thermite<00:05:23.130> bomb<00:05:23.310> basically<00:05:23.820> thermite<00:05:24.150> is

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
the thermite bomb basically thermite is

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.050 
the thermite bomb basically thermite is
I<00:05:24.420> think<00:05:24.810> it's<00:05:24.930> the<00:05:25.020> fastest<00:05:25.650> burning<00:05:26.520> type<00:05:26.820> of

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
I think it's the fastest burning type of

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.730 
I think it's the fastest burning type of
substance<00:05:27.480> that<00:05:27.900> can<00:05:27.990> burn<00:05:28.230> through<00:05:28.260> metal

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
substance that can burn through metal

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.440 
substance that can burn through metal
and<00:05:29.220> when<00:05:29.340> it<00:05:29.430> explodes<00:05:29.880> it<00:05:30.030> can<00:05:30.180> burn<00:05:30.420> through

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
and when it explodes it can burn through

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.840 
and when it explodes it can burn through
metal<00:05:30.930> very<00:05:31.140> fast<00:05:31.440> I<00:05:31.590> believe<00:05:32.100> I'm<00:05:32.670> not

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
metal very fast I believe I'm not

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.550 
metal very fast I believe I'm not
exactly<00:05:33.240> sure<00:05:33.480> but<00:05:33.840> it's<00:05:34.260> something<00:05:34.500> like

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
exactly sure but it's something like

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.050 
exactly sure but it's something like
that<00:05:34.770> it's<00:05:34.920> really<00:05:35.070> crazy<00:05:35.340> one<00:05:35.910> of<00:05:36.000> the

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
that it's really crazy one of the

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.770 
that it's really crazy one of the
fastest<00:05:36.840> heating<00:05:37.200> bombs<00:05:37.470> or<00:05:38.780> chemical

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
fastest heating bombs or chemical

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.900 
fastest heating bombs or chemical
compounds<00:05:40.380> that<00:05:40.620> exist<00:05:41.040> I'm<00:05:41.370> pretty<00:05:41.790> sure

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
compounds that exist I'm pretty sure

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.430 
compounds that exist I'm pretty sure
next<00:05:42.510> up<00:05:42.600> in<00:05:42.690> this<00:05:42.780> picture<00:05:43.080> we<00:05:43.260> have

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
next up in this picture we have

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.680 
next up in this picture we have
something<00:05:44.430> I<00:05:44.520> did<00:05:44.670> not<00:05:44.790> expect<00:05:44.940> to<00:05:45.240> see<00:05:45.480> and

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
something I did not expect to see and

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.230 
something I did not expect to see and
that<00:05:46.110> is<00:05:46.320> new<00:05:47.040> masks<00:05:47.520> and<00:05:47.640> the<00:05:47.670> far<00:05:47.940> right<00:05:48.120> you

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
that is new masks and the far right you

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.090 
that is new masks and the far right you
guys<00:05:48.330> can<00:05:48.510> see<00:05:48.630> there's<00:05:48.810> new<00:05:48.990> masks<00:05:49.410> in<00:05:49.530> the

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
guys can see there's new masks in the

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.830 
guys can see there's new masks in the
background<00:05:50.580> we<00:05:50.670> do<00:05:50.790> have<00:05:50.970> a<00:05:51.000> gun<00:05:51.330> not<00:05:51.540> exactly

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
background we do have a gun not exactly

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.300 
background we do have a gun not exactly
sure<00:05:51.930> if<00:05:52.020> that's<00:05:52.200> a<00:05:52.260> new<00:05:52.470> gun<00:05:52.680> or<00:05:52.830> an<00:05:52.920> old<00:05:53.100> gun

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
sure if that's a new gun or an old gun

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.490 
sure if that's a new gun or an old gun
but<00:05:53.760> nevertheless<00:05:53.970> it<00:05:54.030> does<00:05:54.750> look<00:05:55.020> nice<00:05:55.260> and

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
but nevertheless it does look nice and

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.560 
but nevertheless it does look nice and
then<00:05:55.800> we<00:05:55.890> also<00:05:56.100> have<00:05:56.310> to<00:05:56.610> cool<00:05:57.090> things<00:05:57.120> on<00:05:57.450> the

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
then we also have to cool things on the

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.840 
then we also have to cool things on the
screen<00:05:57.630> as<00:05:57.840> well<00:05:57.990> which<00:05:58.530> are<00:05:58.710> zip<00:05:59.010> ties<00:05:59.220> now<00:05:59.790> if

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
screen as well which are zip ties now if

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.220 
screen as well which are zip ties now if
you<00:05:59.910> guys<00:06:00.000> see<00:06:00.180> you<00:06:00.270> right<00:06:00.540> only<00:06:00.810> the<00:06:00.900> laptop

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
you guys see you right only the laptop

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.740 
you guys see you right only the laptop
right<00:06:01.440> below<00:06:01.680> it<00:06:01.710> we<00:06:02.010> have<00:06:02.160> zip<00:06:02.640> ties<00:06:02.670> now<00:06:03.420> in

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
right below it we have zip ties now in

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.930 
right below it we have zip ties now in
real<00:06:04.080> life<00:06:04.260> those<00:06:04.680> zip<00:06:04.980> ties<00:06:05.010> are<00:06:05.430> used<00:06:05.730> as

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
real life those zip ties are used as

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.940 
real life those zip ties are used as
handcuffs<00:06:06.570> when<00:06:06.960> you<00:06:07.050> don't<00:06:07.260> have<00:06:07.440> the<00:06:07.650> metal

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
handcuffs when you don't have the metal

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.860 
handcuffs when you don't have the metal
ones<00:06:08.160> you<00:06:08.520> put<00:06:08.700> behind<00:06:08.820> the<00:06:09.060> back<00:06:09.210> and<00:06:09.480> you<00:06:09.540> get

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
ones you put behind the back and you get

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.320 
ones you put behind the back and you get
zip<00:06:10.080> tied<00:06:10.260> so<00:06:10.800> if<00:06:10.890> we<00:06:11.040> can<00:06:11.190> zip<00:06:11.490> tie<00:06:11.670> hostages

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
zip tied so if we can zip tie hostages

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.630 
zip tied so if we can zip tie hostages
if<00:06:12.480> we<00:06:12.870> can<00:06:13.020> zip<00:06:13.230> tie<00:06:13.470> police<00:06:14.190> officers

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640 
if we can zip tie police officers

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.400 
if we can zip tie police officers
whatever<00:06:14.940> the<00:06:15.000> case<00:06:15.180> may<00:06:15.390> be<00:06:15.420> that<00:06:16.140> would<00:06:16.320> be

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
whatever the case may be that would be

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.830 
whatever the case may be that would be
really<00:06:16.710> really<00:06:16.980> cool<00:06:17.310> not<00:06:17.850> exactly<00:06:18.210> sure<00:06:18.420> what

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
really really cool not exactly sure what

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.270 
really really cool not exactly sure what
else<00:06:19.020> is<00:06:19.170> in<00:06:19.290> this<00:06:19.410> picture<00:06:19.740> we<00:06:19.770> have<00:06:19.950> a<00:06:19.980> lot<00:06:20.250> of

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
else is in this picture we have a lot of

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.130 
else is in this picture we have a lot of
things<00:06:20.520> like<00:06:21.150> maybe<00:06:21.810> those<00:06:22.020> are

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
things like maybe those are
