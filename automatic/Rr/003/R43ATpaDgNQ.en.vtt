00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.860
 Zapapanilos red sun 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.060
 The wood-grouse fell silent in the forest 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.440
 It came out to have fun on the pole 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.880
 Our Russian warriors 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.540
 Here Ilya is warming up a little 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.560
 And Dobrynya is already here 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.520
 Right now Alyosha will barely go down and come to the enemies of all kapuuuuut 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.940
 -Well, did you see? Now from your heroes only bones will remain 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.020
 You do not brag your friend with your strength, so that you do not whimper later 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.720
 We will fight for envy, we are beautiful. Break you half 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.240
 - Ilyusha! 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.140
 - Sweet! Watch out 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:22.780
 Only the wives are slightly worried, but we have told them more than once: let the enemies multiply even a hundred times - we will fill them with nostril kerosene! 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.480
 Bogatyr force behind the songs is not visible to us, as you can see 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.160
 We will act according to circumstances. If it comes out - give a cuff! 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.200
 -Finally! 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.220
 (Evil laugh) 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.480
 What are the demons you are sad? Have you become bored with our land? 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.800
 It would be nice to gain experience for you, to begin with, at least in a fitness club 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.740
 -I wanted to be curious! Is wheat expensive in Shamakhi? 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.000
 -Who is this? Well go from here! 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.580
 -What is the bag for? BUT? 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.240
 - What bag? 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.100
 - But for what! 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.020
 - Quiet, hold her! 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.720
 Yes let you go! 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.580
 -Bind it! 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.460
 -Yere, get off you, bespectacled 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.320
 Well? So who is the first hero in Russia? 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.560
 -WE!
