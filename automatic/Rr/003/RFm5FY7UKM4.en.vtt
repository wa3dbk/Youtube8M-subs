were<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.010> ones<00:03:32.190> that<00:03:32.400> are<00:03:32.489> shocked<00:03:32.790> and

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
were the ones that are shocked and

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.570 
were the ones that are shocked and
surprised<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:33.930> he<00:03:34.110> just<00:03:34.349> took<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.220> all<00:03:35.400> in

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
surprised and he just took it all in

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.699 
surprised and he just took it all in
stride<00:03:35.730> we<00:03:36.209> put<00:03:36.810> him<00:03:36.930> in<00:03:37.080> it<00:03:37.200> he<00:03:37.349> was<00:03:37.500> upright

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
stride we put him in it he was upright

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:48.540 
stride we put him in it he was upright
and<00:03:38.129> off<00:03:38.220> he<00:03:38.430> went

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.780 

the<00:03:48.970> first<00:03:49.210> setback<00:03:49.510> was<00:03:50.220> shortly<00:03:51.220> after<00:03:51.250> he'd

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
the first setback was shortly after he'd

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.300 
the first setback was shortly after he'd
learned<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.210> crawl<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:52.690> actually<00:03:53.080> get<00:03:53.290> up<00:03:53.980> on

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
learned to crawl and actually get up on

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.900 
learned to crawl and actually get up on
his<00:03:54.490> knees<00:03:54.520> and<00:03:55.180> crawl<00:03:55.480> versus<00:03:56.080> just<00:03:56.350> scooting

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
his knees and crawl versus just scooting

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.060 
his knees and crawl versus just scooting
he<00:03:57.910> had<00:03:58.000> a<00:03:58.030> growth<00:03:58.300> spurt<00:03:58.330> and<00:03:58.950> with<00:03:59.950> the

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
he had a growth spurt and with the

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.130 
he had a growth spurt and with the
growth<00:04:00.280> growth<00:04:00.820> spurt<00:04:01.180> comes<00:04:01.450> stretching<00:04:02.020> of

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
growth growth spurt comes stretching of

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.110 
growth growth spurt comes stretching of
all<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.380> muscles<00:04:02.700> when<00:04:03.700> you<00:04:03.820> stretch<00:04:04.090> a

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
all the muscles when you stretch a

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.010 
all the muscles when you stretch a
muscle<00:04:04.270> you<00:04:04.630> weaken<00:04:05.080> it<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.760> so<00:04:06.760> suddenly<00:04:07.209> he

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
muscle you weaken it and so suddenly he

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.680 
muscle you weaken it and so suddenly he
was<00:04:08.140> back<00:04:08.170> to<00:04:08.380> scooting<00:04:08.980> he<00:04:09.970> didn't<00:04:10.180> notice<00:04:10.450> it

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
was back to scooting he didn't notice it

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.470 
was back to scooting he didn't notice it
didn't<00:04:11.560> bother<00:04:11.680> him<00:04:11.980> one<00:04:12.190> bit<00:04:12.370> that<00:04:12.670> his<00:04:13.180> first

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
didn't bother him one bit that his first

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.349 
didn't bother him one bit that his first
setback<00:04:13.890> he<00:04:14.890> just<00:04:15.160> kept<00:04:15.400> right<00:04:15.640> on<00:04:15.670> going<00:04:15.790> I

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
setback he just kept right on going I

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.490 
setback he just kept right on going I
think<00:04:17.049> it<00:04:17.140> affected<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:18.340> humans<00:04:18.760> around<00:04:18.970> him

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
think it affected the humans around him

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.210 
think it affected the humans around him
more<00:04:20.500> than<00:04:20.650> it<00:04:20.709> affected<00:04:21.280> him

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.960 

his<00:04:26.050> second<00:04:27.050> setback<00:04:27.650> he<00:04:28.370> had<00:04:28.550> started

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
his second setback he had started

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.030 
his second setback he had started
getting<00:04:29.300> around<00:04:29.600> quite<00:04:29.930> a<00:04:29.960> bit<00:04:30.260> better<00:04:30.410> he<00:04:30.950> had

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
getting around quite a bit better he had

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.130 
getting around quite a bit better he had
just<00:04:31.280> started<00:04:31.580> being<00:04:32.090> able<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.510> walk<00:04:32.750> at<00:04:32.960> least

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
just started being able to walk at least

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.620 
just started being able to walk at least
very<00:04:33.380> short<00:04:33.710> distances<00:04:34.340> but<00:04:34.940> he<00:04:35.120> could<00:04:35.300> get

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
very short distances but he could get

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.110 
very short distances but he could get
from<00:04:35.930> laying<00:04:36.710> down<00:04:36.950> to<00:04:37.100> sitting<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:37.610> from

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
from laying down to sitting and from

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.030 
from laying down to sitting and from
sitting<00:04:38.510> to<00:04:38.660> standing<00:04:38.690> on<00:04:39.260> his<00:04:39.440> own<00:04:39.620> and<00:04:39.860> go<00:04:40.010> a

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
sitting to standing on his own and go a

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.610 
sitting to standing on his own and go a
few<00:04:40.340> a<00:04:40.580> few<00:04:40.640> little<00:04:41.270> feet<00:04:41.510> and<00:04:41.690> then<00:04:42.410> he<00:04:42.530> had

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
few a few little feet and then he had

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.610 
few a few little feet and then he had
another<00:04:42.710> growth<00:04:43.190> spurt<00:04:43.900> that<00:04:44.900> setback

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
another growth spurt that setback

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.570 
another growth spurt that setback
affected<00:04:46.430> us<00:04:46.780> but<00:04:47.780> it<00:04:48.130> dramatically<00:04:49.130> affected

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
affected us but it dramatically affected
