bouncing<00:01:03.430> what<00:01:04.360> about<00:01:04.600> is<00:01:04.870> is<00:01:05.230> it's<00:01:06.040> just<00:01:06.610> that

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
bouncing what about is is it's just that

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.550 
bouncing what about is is it's just that
it's<00:01:06.940> a<00:01:07.060> bounce<00:01:07.330> instead<00:01:08.110> of<00:01:08.200> coming<00:01:08.440> to<00:01:08.500> a

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
it's a bounce instead of coming to a

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.530 
it's a bounce instead of coming to a
nice<00:01:08.740> clean<00:01:09.300> stop<00:01:10.300> you<00:01:11.229> can<00:01:11.380> dance<00:01:11.590> with<00:01:11.740> it

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
nice clean stop you can dance with it

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.830 
nice clean stop you can dance with it
mmm<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.729> really<00:01:15.970> the<00:01:16.090> illusion<00:01:16.540> that<00:01:16.570> you're

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
mmm and really the illusion that you're

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.690 
mmm and really the illusion that you're
trying<00:01:17.080> to<00:01:17.110> achieve<00:01:17.260> is<00:01:17.710> if<00:01:17.920> you<00:01:18.040> were<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.160> take

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
trying to achieve is if you were to take

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.330 
trying to achieve is if you were to take
a<00:01:18.760> ball<00:01:19.000> and<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:20.650> it<00:01:20.800> bounce<00:01:21.040> on<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.310> ground

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
a ball and have it bounce on the ground

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.310 
a ball and have it bounce on the ground
you<00:01:22.119> want<00:01:22.270> to<00:01:22.360> do<00:01:22.450> that<00:01:22.630> but<00:01:22.869> with<00:01:22.990> your<00:01:23.140> body

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
you want to do that but with your body

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.280 
you want to do that but with your body
so<00:01:24.220> you've<00:01:24.400> got<00:01:24.760> to<00:01:24.940> kind<00:01:25.119> of<00:01:25.270> keep<00:01:25.840> in<00:01:26.050> mind

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
so you've got to kind of keep in mind

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.370 
so you've got to kind of keep in mind
where<00:01:26.590> your<00:01:26.770> initial<00:01:27.220> stop<00:01:27.880> was<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:28.510> don't

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
where your initial stop was and don't

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.130 
where your initial stop was and don't
bounce<00:01:29.710> through<00:01:30.220> that<00:01:30.490> stop<00:01:30.850> this<00:01:31.690> is<00:01:31.840> easier

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
bounce through that stop this is easier

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.390 
bounce through that stop this is easier
said<00:01:32.350> than<00:01:32.440> done<00:01:32.500> it's<00:01:32.979> gonna<00:01:33.070> take<00:01:33.250> a<00:01:33.280> little

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
right here and staying at that point you

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.490 
right here and staying at that point you
would<00:03:16.360> bounce<00:03:17.350> through<00:03:17.800> it<00:03:19.050> this<00:03:20.050> just<00:03:20.230> looks

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
would bounce through it this just looks

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.020 
would bounce through it this just looks
like<00:03:20.590> you're<00:03:20.830> just<00:03:20.860> going<00:03:21.340> kind<00:03:21.880> of<00:03:21.940> like
