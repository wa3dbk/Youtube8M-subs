00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
of it and then it's turned into this

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.440 
of it and then it's turned into this
thing<00:01:39.260> where<00:01:39.350> Golding<00:01:39.799> is<00:01:39.920> actually<00:01:40.310> like<00:01:40.490> the

god<00:01:41.690> of<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:42.080> scheme<00:01:42.380> it's<00:01:42.860> so<00:01:43.010> like<00:01:43.190> we<00:01:43.400> have

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
god of the scheme it's so like we have

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.290 
god of the scheme it's so like we have
to<00:01:43.790> balance<00:01:44.000> it<00:01:44.360> in<00:01:45.490> her<00:01:46.490> whenever<00:01:47.030> there's<00:01:47.210> an

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
to balance it in her whenever there's an

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.359 
to balance it in her whenever there's an
urban<00:01:47.479> legend<00:01:48.020> if<00:01:48.229> it<00:01:48.320> falls<00:01:48.560> in<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.770> water<00:01:48.860> on
