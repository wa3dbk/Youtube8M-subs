the traction control was an obvious

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:31.810 
the traction control was an obvious

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.710 

following<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.970> then<00:01:57.970> they're<00:01:58.210> there<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.479> stop

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
following it then they're there to stop

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.130 
following it then they're there to stop
it<00:02:00.479> he<00:02:01.479> got<00:02:01.659> him

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.400 

hammered<00:02:05.140> on<00:02:05.260> fly<00:02:06.540> ball<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:07.930> followed<00:02:08.259> it

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
hammered on fly ball it and followed it

hammered on fly ball it and followed it
I<00:02:08.500> was<00:02:08.679> thinking<00:02:08.979> oh<00:02:09.069> he's<00:02:09.100> not<00:02:09.459> gonna<00:02:09.550> take<00:02:09.819> it

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179

hard they'll leave you and then

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.830 
hard they'll leave you and then
certainly<00:03:23.000> when<00:03:23.150> you<00:03:23.239> catch<00:03:23.390> one<00:03:23.420> you'll

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
certainly when you catch one you'll

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.640
