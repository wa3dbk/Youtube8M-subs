water<00:02:02.450> off<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.630> back<00:02:02.960> that<00:02:03.140> happens<00:02:03.439> in<00:02:03.560> every

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
water off the back that happens in every

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.139 
water off the back that happens in every
other<00:02:03.890> ring<00:02:04.159> so<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.369> guess<00:02:04.549> this<00:02:04.700> will<00:02:04.880> just<00:02:04.969> be

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
other ring so I guess this will just be

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.200 
other ring so I guess this will just be
another<00:02:05.240> one<00:02:06.100> which<00:02:07.100> may<00:02:07.520> be<00:02:07.640> your<00:02:08.060> base

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
another one which may be your base

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.810 
another one which may be your base
memory<00:02:08.539> so<00:02:08.780> folk<00:02:08.990> playing<00:02:09.229> with<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.470> father's
