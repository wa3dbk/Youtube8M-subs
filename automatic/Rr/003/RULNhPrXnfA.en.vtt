00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.300 

all<00:00:23.010> right<00:00:23.220> playing<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.939> different<00:00:24.420> keys<00:00:25.310> on

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
all right playing in different keys on

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.210 
all right playing in different keys on
the<00:00:26.519> diatonic<00:00:27.119> harmonica<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.380> easiest

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
the diatonic harmonica the easiest

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.730 
the diatonic harmonica the easiest
solution<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.240> simply<00:00:30.960> owning<00:00:31.260> all

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
solution to that is simply owning all

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.410 
solution to that is simply owning all
your<00:00:32.189> different<00:00:32.579> home<00:00:32.700> owner<00:00:32.910> because<00:00:33.149> each

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
your different home owner because each

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.959 
your different home owner because each
diatonic<00:00:34.020> harmonica<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.710> set<00:00:34.980> up<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.340> one<00:00:35.640> key

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
diatonic harmonica is set up in one key

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.700 
diatonic harmonica is set up in one key
so<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.390> need<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.750> buy<00:00:36.960> 12<00:00:37.410> different

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
so you need to buy 12 different

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.549 
so you need to buy 12 different
harmonicas<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.910> different<00:00:39.660> keys<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.170> play<00:00:40.379> in

harmonica playing in different keys

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.869 
harmonica playing in different keys
becomes<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.620> little<00:00:52.800> more<00:00:53.039> complicated<00:00:53.460> you

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
becomes a little more complicated you

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.240 
becomes a little more complicated you
actually<00:00:54.270> have<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.570> learn<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.809> new<00:00:54.960> pattern<00:00:55.530> for

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
actually have to learn a new pattern for

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.860 
actually have to learn a new pattern for
each<00:00:56.520> key<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.300> if<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:58.020> learned<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:59.329> song<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
each key so if I learned a song in the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:09.679 
each key so if I learned a song in the
key<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:05.540> I<00:01:07.340> have<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.490> learn<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.700> completely

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
key of a I have to learn a completely

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.270 
key of a I have to learn a completely
different<00:01:09.869> pattern<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.560> play<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> key

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
different pattern to play it in the key

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.020 
different pattern to play it in the key
of<00:01:11.310> C

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.240 

so<00:01:16.630> you<00:01:16.720> notice<00:01:17.200> I<00:01:17.320> wasn't<00:01:17.620> pressing<00:01:18.160> the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
so you notice I wasn't pressing the

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.250 
so you notice I wasn't pressing the
slide<00:01:18.550> when<00:01:18.940> I<00:01:18.970> was<00:01:19.210> in<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.480> key<00:01:19.660> of<00:01:19.780> C<00:01:19.990> but<00:01:20.200> I

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
slide when I was in the key of C but I

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.710 
slide when I was in the key of C but I
was<00:01:20.530> for<00:01:20.830> a<00:01:21.040> you<00:01:21.610> can<00:01:21.790> also<00:01:21.940> play<00:01:22.330> in<00:01:22.570> different

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
was for a you can also play in different

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.440 
was for a you can also play in different
keys<00:01:22.960> on<00:01:23.440> the<00:01:23.710> same<00:01:24.010> diatonic<00:01:24.730> harmonica<00:01:25.300> so

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
keys on the same diatonic harmonica so

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.830 
keys on the same diatonic harmonica so
we<00:01:25.570> have<00:01:25.690> a<00:01:25.720> C<00:01:26.140> harmonica<00:01:26.830> here<00:01:27.280> in<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:28.180> key<00:01:28.690> of

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
we have a C harmonica here in the key of

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.630 
we have a C harmonica here in the key of
C<00:01:29.260> first<00:01:29.920> position<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:32.470> would<00:01:32.950> want<00:01:33.220> to<00:01:33.310> play

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
C first position you would want to play

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.680 
C first position you would want to play
mostly<00:01:34.180> blow<00:01:34.960> notes<00:01:35.200> resolving<00:01:36.010> to<00:01:36.690> one

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
mostly blow notes resolving to one

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.560 
mostly blow notes resolving to one
blow-for-blow<00:01:37.960> or<00:01:38.770> seven<00:01:39.130> ball<00:01:39.400> that<00:01:40.330> would

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
blow-for-blow or seven ball that would

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.200 
blow-for-blow or seven ball that would
be<00:01:40.660> your<00:01:40.810> tonic<00:01:41.140> if<00:01:41.500> you<00:01:42.190> wanted<00:01:42.550> to<00:01:42.730> play<00:01:42.970> in<00:01:43.120> a

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
be your tonic if you wanted to play in a

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.940 
be your tonic if you wanted to play in a
different<00:01:43.570> key<00:01:43.720> you<00:01:43.900> might<00:01:44.080> play<00:01:44.320> in<00:01:44.380> second

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
different key you might play in second

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.160 
different key you might play in second
position<00:01:45.040> all<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:45.580> positions<00:01:46.210> are<00:01:46.450> five

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
position all the positions are five

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.440 
position all the positions are five
notes<00:01:47.590> away<00:01:47.830> so<00:01:48.400> if<00:01:48.760> you're<00:01:48.940> on<00:01:49.090> a<00:01:49.119> scene

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
notes away so if you're on a scene

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.740 
notes away so if you're on a scene
harmonica<00:01:50.170> first<00:01:50.800> position<00:01:51.280> is<00:01:51.400> C<00:01:51.729> five<00:01:52.479> up

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
harmonica first position is C five up

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:03.810 
harmonica first position is C five up
from<00:01:52.990> that<00:01:53.170> c<00:01:54.040> d<00:01:54.520> e<00:01:54.820> f<00:01:55.240> g<00:02:02.220> you<00:02:03.220> could<00:02:03.400> also<00:02:03.520> play

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
from that c d e f g you could also play

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.359 
from that c d e f g you could also play
in<00:02:03.940> third<00:02:04.300> position<00:02:04.509> third<00:02:05.440> position<00:02:05.470> would

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
in third position third position would

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.699 
in third position third position would
be<00:02:06.400> five<00:02:06.880> notes<00:02:07.210> away<00:02:07.390> from<00:02:07.810> second<00:02:08.259> position

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
be five notes away from second position

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.880 
be five notes away from second position
second<00:02:09.369> position<00:02:09.399> was<00:02:09.910> G<00:02:10.270> on<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:11.050> C<00:02:11.260> harmonica

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
second position was G on the C harmonica

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.750 
second position was G on the C harmonica
so<00:02:12.100> that's<00:02:12.280> G<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.820> B<00:02:13.420> C<00:02:13.450> D<00:02:14.380> is<00:02:14.709> your<00:02:15.520> third

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
so that's G a B C D is your third

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:23.440 
so that's G a B C D is your third
position

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.059 

so<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.599> takes<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.930> little<00:02:25.080> more<00:02:25.290> work<00:02:25.349> to<00:02:25.830> play

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
so it takes a little more work to play

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.250 
so it takes a little more work to play
in<00:02:26.220> all<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.549> different<00:02:26.939> keys<00:02:27.390> or<00:02:27.750> positions
