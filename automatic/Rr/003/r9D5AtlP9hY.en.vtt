not I despised it I secretly imagined

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.880 
not I despised it I secretly imagined
that<00:03:31.690> maybe<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.890> heavenly<00:03:33.370> sword<00:03:33.750> was<00:03:34.750> just<00:03:35.739> a

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
that maybe the heavenly sword was just a

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.119 
that maybe the heavenly sword was just a
sword<00:03:36.220> not<00:03:37.209> sent<00:03:37.599> from<00:03:37.750> heaven<00:03:38.110> at<00:03:38.200> all<00:03:38.440> nor

sword not sent from heaven at all nor

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.160 
sword not sent from heaven at all nor
likely<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.610> be<00:03:39.700> claimed<00:03:40.030> by<00:03:40.180> some<00:03:40.540> grateful

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
likely to be claimed by some grateful

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.960 
likely to be claimed by some grateful
deity<00:03:41.680> that<00:03:41.799> would<00:03:41.920> make<00:03:42.129> everything<00:03:42.610> right

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
deity that would make everything right

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.430 
deity that would make everything right
again<00:03:43.890> if<00:03:44.890> that<00:03:45.160> was<00:03:45.310> so<00:03:45.840> then<00:03:46.840> I<00:03:46.959> was<00:03:47.170> not<00:03:47.410> a

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
again if that was so then I was not a

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.160 
again if that was so then I was not a
