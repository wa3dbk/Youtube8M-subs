00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.619
 that not all of us return again as 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.430
 tutorial and today we will learn how it is done 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.430
 with several hills 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:38.149
 good to do a bar in the 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.399
 tricks that you have to know is a gil 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.399
 flip and a French or beat or 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.920
 the position of your feet for a several 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.890
 giles lip will be the next forgiveness 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.840
 well the front foot will go in this 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.150
 position here and the rear train is going to 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.729
 go here well what are we going to do 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.280
 first of all what is going to be given is the 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.430
 pop actions are going to pop pop 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.340
 is going to hit the front goes here and 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.200
 we are going to drag this foot to here 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.420
 right at that moment is where the 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.490
 function of the front foot that is going to be 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.799
 the one to give the gil flip but we're going to 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.189
 find this part of here with this part 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.780
 of the foot we are going to scrape not diagonally 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.929
 backwards not forward we're going to 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.090
 scrape straight as well as scrape straight 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.759
 let's scrape this way observe 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.350
 let's give the pop right at that moment 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:49.439
 we are going to scrape here 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.299
 is going to give the bar the gil flip us 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.040
 let's try to stabilize us a 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.530
 little in the air try that the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.750
 skateboard turn below us 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.790
 trying not to make any mistakes 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.799
 Normally, when I chased the barrel, 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.440
 tried to fall it with both feet to 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.420
 same time and only one already found the 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.819
 style that is yours and location with 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.540
 the front foot with the rear foot well 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:16.020
 then I'm going to review they're going to put the 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.180
 back foot in this position and they go to 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.420
 put the foot of the club here we are going to paste 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.069
 the hobbit frontis forward the 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.340
 skateboard will be in this position here 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:30.140
 we are going to scrape straight normal so it's going to 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.780
 give elektra turn and we will fall 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.690
 and in some of the common mistakes for 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.940
 to make a see the film is that it 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.780
 does the gilip see but the skateboard 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.780
 is behind us 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.150
 to solve that problem what they 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.459
 I recommend that pop try to give it 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.500
 like that towards the bone front try 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.740
 throw the skateboard to the front because 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.810
 if they only give pop and you follow the 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.150
 skateboard is left behind you 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.090
 for the same speed depending which 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.400
 be they go fast slow well another one of 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.290
 the common mistakes is that they do not 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.840
 finishes giving the bar yalheel set 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.969
 how is that or paste in pop 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.120
 correctly but not scrape they are not 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:16.069
 scraping well because it works well in 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.959
 first place can make them not be 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.109
 scraping the right way or not 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.659
 are giving hip hop as it is then 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.939
 is here straight here look 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:29.390
 and a single then that's when it's going to 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:31.159
 wait for the turn is going to jump right in 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.400
 that moment you are going to say eye that 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:36.590
 sexy I already have the barrel repeat fall with 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.680
 everything if very extreme and if you want to already 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.180
 they pull three tiers good I hope them 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.000

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.639
 simple and do not forget to comment punctuate 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.859
