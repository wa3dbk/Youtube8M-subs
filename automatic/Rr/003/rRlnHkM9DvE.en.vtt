front of you and you play the drums by

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.769 
front of you and you play the drums by
by<00:00:29.160> striking<00:00:29.519> your<00:00:29.730> fingers<00:00:30.060> down<00:00:30.269> as<00:00:30.599> if

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
by striking your fingers down as if

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.089 
by striking your fingers down as if
there<00:00:30.929> were<00:00:31.019> an<00:00:31.109> actual<00:00:31.230> drum<00:00:31.590> set<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:31.920> front

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
there were an actual drum set in front

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.670 
there were an actual drum set in front
of<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.329> now<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.660> combining<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.559> these

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
of you now this this combining of these

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.990 
of you now this this combining of these
two<00:00:34.829> technologies<00:00:35.190> creates<00:00:35.730> really

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
two technologies creates really

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.430 
two technologies creates really
immersive<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.510> interesting<00:00:36.899> experience

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
immersive and interesting experience

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.750 
immersive and interesting experience
because<00:00:37.860> playing<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.370> drums<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.640> your

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
because playing the drums of your

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.160 
because playing the drums of your
fingers<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.270> pretty<00:00:39.480> intuitive<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.050> it's

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
fingers is pretty intuitive and it's

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.720 
fingers is pretty intuitive and it's
actually<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.469> lot<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.739> fun<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.430> then<00:00:41.550> when<00:00:41.670> you

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
actually a lot of fun but then when you

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.100 
actually a lot of fun but then when you
combine<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.239> with<00:00:42.300> with<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.809> 3d

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
combine that with with the 3d

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.650 
combine that with with the 3d
capabilities<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.100> oculus<00:00:44.489> rift<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:45.450> just

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
capabilities of the oculus rift it just

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.880 
capabilities of the oculus rift it just
makes<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.870> more<00:00:45.930> immersive<00:00:46.350> because<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.770> can

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
makes it more immersive because you can

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.319 
makes it more immersive because you can
look<00:00:47.039> down<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.370> actually<00:00:47.520> see<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> drumset

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
look down and actually see the drumset

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.400 
look down and actually see the drumset
around<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.840> feels<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.140> you're<00:00:49.260> actually

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
around you it feels like you're actually

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.650 
around you it feels like you're actually
there<00:00:49.770> I've<00:00:50.399> also<00:00:50.579> incorporated<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
there I've also incorporated the the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.119 
there I've also incorporated the the
voice<00:00:51.840> recognition<00:00:52.079> capabilities<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
voice recognition capabilities of the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.680 
voice recognition capabilities of the
camera<00:00:53.489> into<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> application<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.600> when

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
camera into the application so when

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.729 
camera into the application so when
you're<00:00:54.809> wearing<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.110> headset<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.590> don't

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
you're wearing the headset you don't

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.319 
you're wearing the headset you don't
have<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.920> hold<00:00:56.070> any<00:00:56.280> kind<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.489> controller<00:00:56.850> you

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
have to hold any kind of controller you

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.000 
have to hold any kind of controller you
can<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.629> yell<00:00:57.780> out<00:00:57.899> commands<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.590> activate

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
can just yell out commands to activate

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.790 
can just yell out commands to activate
several<00:00:59.370> features<00:00:59.699> within<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.629> application

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
several features within the application

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.860 
several features within the application
so<00:01:01.800> with<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.129> let's<00:01:02.820> let's<00:01:03.390> jump<00:01:03.600> right<00:01:03.660> in

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
so with that let's let's jump right in

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:34.710 
so with that let's let's jump right in
and<00:01:03.930> I'll<00:01:04.049> show<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.229> how<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.500> works

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:02:12.180 

play<00:01:35.720> one<00:01:45.520> play<00:01:46.520> to<00:01:51.250> show<00:01:59.530> garage<00:02:04.450> show<00:02:07.360> garage
