00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
start up with the right hand and it'll

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.740 
start up with the right hand and it'll
be<00:01:45.200> one<00:01:45.440> often<00:01:45.649> down<00:01:46.039> the<00:01:46.280> middle<00:01:46.490> C<00:01:46.819> and<00:01:47.090> then

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
be one often down the middle C and then

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.389 
be one often down the middle C and then
go<00:01:47.960> like<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.380> pattern<00:01:48.770> is<00:01:48.860> gonna<00:01:49.130> go<00:01:49.220> like

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
go like the pattern is gonna go like

a F G a G B C a B G a so that's the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.630 
a F G a G B C a B G a so that's the
pattern<00:02:49.060> you're<00:02:49.330> gonna<00:02:49.450> use<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.900> go<00:02:50.080> up<00:02:50.640> now

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
pattern you're gonna use to go up now

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.570 
pattern you're gonna use to go up now
that<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.660> one<00:02:52.810> from<00:02:52.960> the<00:02:53.080> turnaround<00:02:53.590> so<00:02:54.010> in

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
that the one from the turnaround so in

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.680 
that the one from the turnaround so in
middle<00:02:55.090> C<00:02:55.410> this<00:02:56.410> is<00:02:56.650> one<00:02:57.340> octave<00:02:57.730> famila<00:02:58.510> so

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
middle C this is one octave famila so

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.990 
middle C this is one octave famila so
you're<00:02:58.840> gonna<00:02:58.960> go<00:02:59.170> one<00:02:59.410> find<00:02:59.740> key<00:02:59.980> back<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.880> the

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
you're gonna go one find key back to the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.850 
you're gonna go one find key back to the
beam<00:03:01.210> and<00:03:01.870> it's<00:03:02.050> gonna<00:03:02.230> go<00:03:02.380> like<00:03:02.470> this<00:03:02.650> it's

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
beam and it's gonna go like this it's

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:22.490 
beam and it's gonna go like this it's
going<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.070> go<00:03:04.050> B<00:03:05.100> D<00:03:06.100> F<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:15.190> this<00:03:15.550> one's<00:03:15.760> going<00:03:16.060> G
