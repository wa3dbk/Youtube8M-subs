00:01:51.340 --> 00:02:00.380 

so<00:01:51.520> so<00:01:52.060> far<00:01:52.329> we<00:01:52.509> have

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.469 

and<00:02:01.200> then<00:02:01.650> we<00:02:02.010> have<00:02:02.040> another<00:02:02.220> chord<00:02:03.030> which<00:02:03.330> is

second<00:02:08.399> fret<00:02:08.429> 5th<00:02:09.360> string<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:11.340> then<00:02:12.110> third

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
second fret 5th string and then third

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:21.250 
second fret 5th string and then third
finger<00:02:13.530> on<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.980> fourth<00:02:14.400> string<00:02:18.470> that's<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.680> bee
