00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.610
 The new concert hall of the brand Bauer will know his drum before 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.039
 that's my drumming now 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.039
 who play in the preliminary report with UNIQA 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.310
 it looks like they have not been there anymore 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.829
 and l super guy 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.569
 as a right-back report a best of the water 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.820
 Right now maybe the best right-back 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.360
 and percent we have to go up and down the line 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.800
 Central defense Mehta 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.110
 Pujol 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.110
 and l Karin 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.760
 "I think both are different types and Ellwürden good with each other 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.370
 harmonize 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.020
 on the left I would kill ex-team players from me 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 he also has ROC alongside 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.610
 I think he every club just any age need Kafka intimate round he 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.580
 then fits in super 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.630
 I want to play with two "sixes" now 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.020
 what the Schweinsteiger 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.020
 and he offered this 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.230
 what the levels so miraculously played together 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.310
 the currently maybe the best six in Germany 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.320
 and he Bautista ripped age with game from Turkey sucking setter six 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.720
 Face and become more teenagers 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.390
 also a super type 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.390
 and percent on profit and as a rounding off me 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.360
 yes now I want with percent 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.190
 Three players behind a striker play 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.190
 I was 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.870
 so avenge percent Cristiano Ronaldo 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.870
 I'm setting myself up behind the inter-striker 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.200
 recently measure 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.200
 yes I think l3 technically good players at approx 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.590
 to the pure 3 0 73 4 that would be super fit 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:15.679
 As in the previous year, Sam reports 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:19.109
 the games are sturdy and can hold the balls so that the players 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.019
 can show up 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.019
 this region is on the 1 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:32.019
 It will be the mooring and for the first time allowed to move on 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.079
 this is my dream 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.079
 ran 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.809
 I am 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:53.229
 When we have a woman with the actual arrived there are many great names 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.000
 yes, so are the usual suspects 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.309
 he himself is just like that 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:02.009
 or behind the spies the Bremer set me up flanked by Messi and 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:03.979
 Percent Christiano Ronaldo 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:04.879
 Why 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.539
 That's certainly not bad 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:11.429
 also defense of course central defense with polio now with John Terry «That is 

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:13.399
 by itself worthy of honor 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:17.079
 Absolutely and Erhan Albayrak so that the company is off 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.069
 bitterfield-wolfen should have 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.369
 played very offensively but not from the then seemingly now 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:26.650
 with older age but then a bit far back to have been but 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:30.079
 if you understood us that way, or fewer lines of communication between the two 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.799
 otherwise it was well clear that spares repetition 2 percent there are the 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.969
 Player who sets up as good as new 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:39.969
 yes so ever will not quite want my dream wanted to do yet 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.909
 yes it's true as I already said you to the usual 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.069
 Suspects but of course now when you set yourself up and then 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.650
 advises in an advisory board and continues to support personal touches 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.650
 Therefore, I think it is quite OK 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.520
 Who would like to go to Feathers Years Winands Race Vienna? 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.830
 and of course a nice thank you to the Potsdam 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.040
 tv-spectators are you not even on it
