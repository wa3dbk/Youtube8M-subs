00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
yeah right now again he has not gotten a

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.960 
yeah right now again he has not gotten a
normal<00:03:25.260> build<00:03:25.500> Protoss<00:03:26.340> built<00:03:26.579> because<00:03:26.730> yes

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
normal build Protoss built because yes

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.940 
normal build Protoss built because yes
three<00:03:27.209> zealots<00:03:27.510> force<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.350> lot<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:28.650> he<00:03:28.709> actually

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
three zealots force a lot so he actually

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.099 
three zealots force a lot so he actually
did<00:03:29.220> do<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.549> gate<00:03:29.730> build<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.209> this<00:03:30.840> means

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
did do a to gate build and this means

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.599 
did do a to gate build and this means
well<00:03:31.500> it's<00:03:31.680> kind<00:03:31.859> of<00:03:31.890> ineffective<00:03:32.190> for<00:03:32.400> him

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
well it's kind of ineffective for him

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.069 
well it's kind of ineffective for him
because<00:03:32.790> I<00:03:32.940> blocked<00:03:33.329> off<00:03:33.480> my<00:03:33.690> front<00:03:33.840> and

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
because I blocked off my front and

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.890 
because I blocked off my front and
there's<00:03:34.200> no<00:03:34.320> way<00:03:34.440> for<00:03:34.500> him<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.739> attack<00:03:35.489> it<00:03:35.760> and

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
there's no way for him to attack it and

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.060 
there's no way for him to attack it and
so<00:03:36.900> yeah<00:03:37.079> it's<00:03:37.290> gonna<00:03:37.380> be<00:03:37.530> an<00:03:37.590> effective<00:03:37.799> for

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
so yeah it's gonna be an effective for

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.620 
so yeah it's gonna be an effective for
him<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.370> I'm<00:03:38.430> getting<00:03:38.700> for<00:03:38.910> vultures<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.450> ash

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
expansion and that's just more help from

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.230 
expansion and that's just more help from
me<00:06:19.169> and<00:06:19.380> again<00:06:19.620> dropship<00:06:20.219> skill<00:06:20.610> like<00:06:21.030> this

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
me and again dropship skill like this

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.670 
me and again dropship skill like this
map<00:06:21.449> that<00:06:21.719> it's<00:06:21.870> like<00:06:22.020> the<00:06:22.169> main<00:06:22.319> reason<00:06:22.620> is

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
map that it's like the main reason is

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.890 
map that it's like the main reason is
reg<00:06:22.889> dropships<00:06:23.370> kill<00:06:23.669> it<00:06:23.819> when<00:06:24.360> I<00:06:24.509> say<00:06:24.659> killed

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
reg dropships kill it when I say killed

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.870 
reg dropships kill it when I say killed
it<00:06:25.020> means<00:06:25.169> it<00:06:25.440> does<00:06:25.650> a<00:06:25.680> lock<00:06:25.949> a<00:06:25.979> lot<00:06:26.490> of<00:06:26.610> good<00:06:26.639> to

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
it means it does a lock a lot of good to

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.089 
it means it does a lock a lot of good to
it<00:06:27.000> as<00:06:27.150> you<00:06:27.360> can<00:06:27.479> see<00:06:27.630> I<00:06:27.840> he<00:06:28.650> does<00:06:28.800> have<00:06:28.919> it<00:06:29.009> to

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:30.050 
it as you can see I he does have it to
go<00:06:29.190> in<00:06:29.250> there<00:06:29.400> but<00:06:29.520> it's<00:06:29.669> not<00:06:29.699> going<00:06:29.880> to<00:06:30.030> i
