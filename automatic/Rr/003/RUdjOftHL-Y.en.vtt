00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
program you'll be building your program

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.970 
program you'll be building your program
and<00:00:16.090> flashing<00:00:17.020> the<00:00:17.200> program<00:00:17.590> to<00:00:17.860> the

write your program which is just a an

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.320 
write your program which is just a an

intellisense

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
intellisense

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.820 
intellisense
which<00:00:31.599> means<00:00:31.929> that<00:00:32.230> when<00:00:32.349> you<00:00:32.439> start<00:00:32.680> typing

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830 
which means that when you start typing

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.740 
which means that when you start typing
it'll<00:00:33.340> show<00:00:33.520> you<00:00:33.580> a<00:00:33.670> list<00:00:33.760> of<00:00:34.120> possible

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
it'll show you a list of possible

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.410 
it'll show you a list of possible
options<00:00:35.410> that<00:00:35.560> you<00:00:35.680> can<00:00:35.830> use<00:00:36.100> to<00:00:36.670> complete

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
options that you can use to complete

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.630 
options that you can use to complete
your<00:00:37.629> typing<00:00:37.989> an<00:00:38.170> IDE<00:00:38.620> will<00:00:38.950> also<00:00:39.219> connect<00:00:39.579> to

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
your typing an IDE will also connect to

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.450 
your typing an IDE will also connect to
the<00:00:39.789> compiler<00:00:40.750> so<00:00:41.260> it'll<00:00:41.440> take<00:00:41.739> the<00:00:41.920> code<00:00:42.160> and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
the compiler so it'll take the code and

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.959 
the compiler so it'll take the code and
it<00:00:42.730> will<00:00:43.469> convert<00:00:44.469> the<00:00:44.649> code<00:00:44.890> into<00:00:45.399> a<00:00:45.430> hex<00:00:45.699> file

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
it will convert the code into a hex file

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:48.299 
it will convert the code into a hex file
or<00:00:46.360> to<00:00:46.690> a<00:00:46.989> file<00:00:47.379> that<00:00:47.620> is<00:00:47.710> readable<00:00:47.980> by<00:00:48.129> the

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
or to a file that is readable by the

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.029 
or to a file that is readable by the
microcontroller<00:00:49.300> and<00:00:50.020> the<00:00:50.079> other<00:00:50.680> main

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
microcontroller and the other main

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.750 
microcontroller and the other main
feature<00:00:51.940> of<00:00:52.329> an<00:00:52.539> ID<00:00:52.750> is<00:00:53.289> to<00:00:53.920> be<00:00:54.070> able<00:00:54.160> to<00:00:54.280> flash

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
feature of an ID is to be able to flash

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.330 
feature of an ID is to be able to flash
that<00:00:55.300> compiled<00:00:56.079> code<00:00:56.410> to<00:00:56.890> the

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
that compiled code to the

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.250 
that compiled code to the
microcontroller<00:00:57.730> and<00:00:58.359> it<00:00:58.750> would<00:00:59.019> need<00:00:59.230> to

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
microcontroller and it would need to

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.920 
microcontroller and it would need to
connect<00:01:00.219> to<00:01:00.340> some<00:01:00.550> sort<00:01:00.969> of<00:01:01.030> program<00:01:01.510> that's

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
connect to some sort of program that's

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.569 
connect to some sort of program that's
able<00:01:02.109> to<00:01:02.260> do<00:01:02.440> that<00:01:02.620> so<00:01:02.980> first<00:01:03.190> we're<00:01:03.429> going<00:01:03.519> to

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
able to do that so first we're going to

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.640 
able to do that so first we're going to
set<00:01:03.789> up<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:04.000> IDE<00:01:04.360> then<00:01:04.960> we're<00:01:05.140> going<00:01:05.320> to<00:01:05.379> set

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
set up the IDE then we're going to set

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.539 
set up the IDE then we're going to set
up<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:06.010> or<00:01:06.400> install<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.270> compiler<00:01:08.020> and

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
up the or install the compiler and

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.460 
up the or install the compiler and
finally<00:01:09.549> we'll<00:01:09.759> install<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.570> program<00:01:10.900> that

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
finally we'll install the program that

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.990 
finally we'll install the program that
will<00:01:11.619> allow<00:01:11.950> you<00:01:12.009> to<00:01:12.130> flash<00:01:12.460> the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
will allow you to flash the

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.640 
will allow you to flash the
microcontroller<00:01:13.420> there<00:01:14.080> are<00:01:14.200> many<00:01:14.439> other

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
microcontroller there are many other

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.039 
microcontroller there are many other
features<00:01:14.860> of<00:01:15.100> this<00:01:15.490> IDE<00:01:15.820> or<00:01:16.180> of<00:01:16.420> IDE<00:01:16.750> is<00:01:16.900> in

development<00:01:59.439> environment<00:02:00.009> you<00:02:00.189> can<00:02:00.520> connect

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
development environment you can connect

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.539 
development environment you can connect
it<00:02:01.299> to<00:02:01.329> the<00:02:01.509> GCC<00:02:02.200> compiler<00:02:02.380> which<00:02:03.070> is<00:02:03.219> also<00:02:03.369> a

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
it to the GCC compiler which is also a

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.840 
it to the GCC compiler which is also a
open<00:02:04.509> source<00:02:04.780> compiler<00:02:05.590> so<00:02:06.430> you'll<00:02:06.579> be<00:02:06.759> able

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
open source compiler so you'll be able

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.730 
open source compiler so you'll be able
to<00:02:06.969> write<00:02:07.090> your<00:02:07.180> programs<00:02:07.570> without<00:02:08.440> needing

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
to write your programs without needing

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.020 
to write your programs without needing
to<00:02:08.770> pay<00:02:08.860> for<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.190> programming<00:02:09.520> environment

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
to pay for the programming environment

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.130 
to pay for the programming environment
so<00:02:10.300> let's<00:02:10.479> get<00:02:10.600> started

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140

go to project select tool chain path and

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.129 
go to project select tool chain path and
I've<00:04:21.160> already<00:04:21.400> done<00:04:21.549> it<00:04:21.669> here<00:04:21.880> but<00:04:22.090> you<00:04:22.330> would

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
I've already done it here but you would

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.189 
I've already done it here but you would
use<00:04:23.349> browse<00:04:24.330> go<00:04:25.330> to

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
where it's located where it was

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.650 
where it's located where it was
installed<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:29.710> select<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:31.360> version<00:04:32.360> number

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
installed and select the version number

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.530

in and press ok ok so far we've
installed<00:04:39.139> the<00:04:39.380> co<00:04:39.830> IDE<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:41.120> GCC

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
installed the co IDE and the GCC

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.719 
installed the co IDE and the GCC
compiler<00:04:41.930> there<00:04:42.710> anything<00:04:42.919> left<00:04:43.190> to<00:04:43.340> install

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
compiler there anything left to install

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.200 
compiler there anything left to install
now<00:04:43.940> is<00:04:44.180> our<00:04:44.900> programmer<00:04:45.530> driver<00:04:46.100> and<00:04:46.400> making

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
now is our programmer driver and making

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.850 
now is our programmer driver and making
sure<00:04:47.419> that<00:04:47.570> the<00:04:47.660> programmer<00:04:48.050> is<00:04:48.320> able<00:04:48.710> to

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
sure that the programmer is able to

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.520 
sure that the programmer is able to
flash<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.940> microcontroller<00:04:50.750> we<00:04:51.290> will<00:04:51.440> do

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
flash the microcontroller we will do

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.140 
flash the microcontroller we will do
that<00:04:51.650> in<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:51.889> next<00:04:52.100> video<00:04:52.340> thank<00:04:52.880> you<00:04:52.970> for
