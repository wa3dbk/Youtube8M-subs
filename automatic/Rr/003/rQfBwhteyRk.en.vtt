00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.340 
guys now we will take a more in-depth
look<00:00:18.730> at<00:00:18.970> the<00:00:19.090> frame<00:00:19.300> first<00:00:19.720> we<00:00:20.080> have<00:00:20.320> the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.350 
look at the frame first we have the

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.380 
look at the frame first we have the
carbon<00:00:20.890> fiber<00:00:21.070> canopy<00:00:21.550> rods<00:00:21.790> which<00:00:22.060> are<00:00:22.240> made

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
carbon fiber canopy rods which are made

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.900 
carbon fiber canopy rods which are made
out<00:00:22.540> of<00:00:22.570> solid<00:00:22.840> carbon<00:00:23.380> fiber<00:00:23.620> and<00:00:24.010> they

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
out of solid carbon fiber and they

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.850 
out of solid carbon fiber and they
should<00:00:25.540> hold<00:00:25.840> up<00:00:25.990> variable<00:00:26.410> in<00:00:26.530> a<00:00:26.620> crash

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860 
should hold up variable in a crash

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.560 
should hold up variable in a crash
because<00:00:27.100> they<00:00:27.310> are<00:00:27.490> salad<00:00:28.000> but<00:00:28.210> in<00:00:28.360> the<00:00:28.480> event

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
because they are salad but in the event

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.760 
because they are salad but in the event
that<00:00:28.780> you<00:00:28.900> do<00:00:29.140> break<00:00:29.350> them<00:00:29.590> they<00:00:29.740> are

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
that you do break them they are

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.339 
that you do break them they are

hold your broom plenty well okay now we
will<00:01:21.280> do<00:01:21.429> a<00:01:21.459> weight<00:01:21.880> comparison<00:01:22.569> to<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:22.810> two

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
will do a weight comparison to the two

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.139 
will do a weight comparison to the two
frames<00:01:23.380> first<00:01:23.740> we<00:01:24.039> have<00:01:24.219> a<00:01:24.429> stock<00:01:24.759> frame<00:01:24.999> that

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
frames first we have a stock frame that

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:26.550 
frames first we have a stock frame that
has<00:01:25.240> been<00:01:25.450> cut<00:01:25.689> out<00:01:25.840> for<00:01:26.109> a<00:01:26.139> brushless

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
has been cut out for a brushless

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.059 
has been cut out for a brushless
conversion<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:27.899> that<00:01:28.899> weighs<00:01:29.289> two<00:01:29.799> point

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
conversion and that weighs two point

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.669 
conversion and that weighs two point
three<00:01:30.130> grams<00:01:30.549> and<00:01:30.880> now<00:01:31.869> the<00:01:31.929> rack<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:32.380> halle

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
three grams and now the rack and halle

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.769 
three grams and now the rack and halle
frame<00:01:33.329> weighs<00:01:35.759> three<00:01:36.759> point<00:01:37.029> seven<00:01:37.329> grams

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:37.779

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
at the boom supports they are made out

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.090 
at the boom supports they are made out
of<00:01:42.639> solid<00:01:43.060> carbon<00:01:43.600> fiber<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:44.259> on<00:01:44.469> the<00:01:44.619> ends<00:01:44.950> we

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
of solid carbon fiber and on the ends we

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.559 
of solid carbon fiber and on the ends we
have<00:01:45.249> anodized<00:01:45.880> aluminum<00:01:46.599> and<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:49.119> mount<00:01:49.359> them
