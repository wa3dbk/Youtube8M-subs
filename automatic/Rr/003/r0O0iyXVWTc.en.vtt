here now if you wonder what this one

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.780 
here now if you wonder what this one
this<00:03:36.840> is<00:03:36.900> simply<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:37.830> say<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.220> this<00:03:38.370> pet<00:03:38.640> is

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
this is simply to say that this pet is

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.650 
this is simply to say that this pet is
no<00:03:38.970> longer<00:03:39.240> wanted<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.770> want<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.070> do<00:03:41.660> to

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
no longer wanted that you want to do to
