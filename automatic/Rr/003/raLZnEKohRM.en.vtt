00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:25.230
 What we need is a sponge cake 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.570
 the taste they want then a dish for 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.989
 to be able to present the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.410
 biscuit a spatula a knife 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:36.360
 saw to be able to cut it and our 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.760
 filling in this case we are going to occupy a 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.910
 chocolate cream toilet we look for 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.970
 part of the cake that is lower 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.190
 for example in this case it would be there as 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.920
 can see 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.559
 and let's just dial with the 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.590
 knife we hold on top 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.630
 and we mark dial is simply 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.480
 perform a saw movement 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.600
 agreement we are marking and turning to the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.760
 time 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.670
 and now that we're on the other side we're going 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.090
 to deepen the cut by the line that 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.090
 We perform 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.310
 and we have 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.280
 let's perform exactly the same 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:24.070
 same step but now to be able to mark 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.070
 and at our levels 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.400
 let's put a little water cream 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.730
 on the presentation plate 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.680
 and we are going to 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.680
 paste the cake to go around 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.690
 we focus well 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.470
 and with the same plate we are going to take out 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.470
 a level 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.979
 already with the cake there 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.490
 ready to fill in let's place the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.490
 toilet cream 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.190
 forever 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.190
 we do not watch a bit 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.520
 we place the next floor 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.410
 we take out what we have left 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.280
 and we keep filling 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:39.360
 and the last floor we put 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:43.850
 we are well check that it is 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.850
 well put the floors 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.320
 We put crime toilet the top 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:58.470
 we are stretching the with the toilet 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.470
 towards the shores 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.540
 always the movement of the spatula is 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.540
 do not lift it do not take off or drag 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.360
 in a vertical movement simply 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.480
 always going to support the toilet clip and the 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.700
 movement of going up and down is like going 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.180
 dancing with it with the spatula is 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.680
 simply a movement with the fingers 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.750
 here although it is the part where we are 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.069
 had fallen a bit of sponge cake with 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.220
 the same beat the time we're going to 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.910
 level and it does not go 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.910
 Let's see 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.030
 once completely covered 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.820
 cake we are going to level we are going to level 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:46.470
 placing the spatula stuck to the sponge cake 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.470
 and we are going to go spinning 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:53.160
 the rotating table 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.110
 we take out the excess and we continue 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.380
 once we have leveled the 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.320
 contours 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.620
 we place the spatula straight 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.510
 well and we do inwards all the 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.819
 spare toilet tim 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.180
 we go in and the excess what 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.180
 we clean 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.229
 once we have our ready and covered 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.229
 cake we can have two options or 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:23.270
 we cover it with fondant or on the other hand 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.270
 You can put it in the fridge for about 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.610
 15-20 minutes gives you a coat again 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.919
 of water cream and which allows you 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.590
 make a lÃ©ger cake and you can 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.930
 decorate with pastry bag 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.800
 good friends for now this would be the 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.800
 filling a sponge cake 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.360
 yes
