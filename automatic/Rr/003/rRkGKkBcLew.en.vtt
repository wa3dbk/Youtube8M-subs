 acai mock I saw the theme of the cheat master 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.810
 I saw on the channel about the code a new script 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.580
 who most likely did he will write 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.369
 I the fact that the author he in general the this mod 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:33.510
 gives you do so that is it cool 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.820

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.760

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.980

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.530

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.239

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.710
 Well, for this admins essentially will not bath 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.399
 because it is not 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.410
 how to say has no advantage over 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.400
 other players but in general you are now 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:09.590
 see it yourself so now we come down 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:15.119

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:19.400
 somewhere here and create yourself an elegy 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.400

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:40.940
 Well, by the way, I have long wanted myself 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.920
 see yes cameras don't turn around i 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.430
 I have long wanted essentially to script 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.080
 because i saw some people i don't 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.210
 I know what it's called, but before that 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.979
 called drift camera did everything 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.080
 be quiet before it was called vulture camera 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.420
 that is, she let me fix the camera 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.070

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.709
 drift camera and 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.290
 you can understand and suppose you want to 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.270
 and you drive to want to hang the bus 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.209
 Do not look at the type of solid for 1 bitch 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.459
 flips or you shoot machinima 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.330

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.300

 nowhere frayed and yes that's it 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.920
 Why convenient driving style but I know that 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.670

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.800

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.640
