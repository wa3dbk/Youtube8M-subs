00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:15.679
 hello welcome back today I want to show you 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.570
 how to make this placemat that 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.849
 can be a nice gift for a christmas 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.689
 little thought for a friend or for one 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.579
 aunt 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.650
 otherwise if we do it with color 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.130
 golden red can also be one 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.410
 placemat a centerpiece for Christmas 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.820
 we have to start with a ball in 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.950
 this case of cotton per core 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.250
 we will rest on our table for 50 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:42.079
 grams of about 125 meters with 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:45.079
 4 mm bits we have to start 40 knit 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.260
 therefore we use our method col 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:52.940
 thumb the little finger and calculate ten 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:56.120
 twenty thirty forty we do ours 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:00.860
 mobile loop and we start to start 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.170
 of the meshes we have to start them at 40 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.659
 if I do n't start some and I'll show you 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.700
 how to start what the border on 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.500
 two needles 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.020
 let's pretend that I'm done with 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.770
 start the 40 shirts we turn the work 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.190
 began to work on straight and this the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.100
 my first iron and I do it also for a 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:28.729
 second iron and at this point mine 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:30.710
 design will have this aspect and therefore 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.659
 we are ready to start with what 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.880
 it's the perforated part because we 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.060
 we will make a rectangle but once 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.260
 blocked thanks to all our work 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.510
 perforated will have this shape a lot 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.689
 original detail that with a vase of 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.570
 flowers and beautiful on the table then 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:52.400
 let's start we have to make two 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:55.100
 knit straight and then repeat for seven 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.850
 times a thrown and 2 meshes together with 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.009
 straight so let's do our cast 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:11.259
 this is once and after we do 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:11.259
 see the two shirts together 234 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:21.690
 5 6 and 7 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:24.140
 we work 8 straight stitch and start a 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.940
 do what is the mirrored part 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.319
 here we will do what the pass passes 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.800
 straight thrown 12 my pass passes 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.840
 straight with the thrown this we repeat it 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.650
 seven times as we did with le 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.110
 two jerseys together with straight and thrown 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.170
 and then we'll have two straight jerseys there 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.760
 create our border when we return 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.069
 back we work all our own 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.049
 knit to straight creating what is a 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.989
 garment movement 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:03:00.780
 and we repeat this as you can see 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:04.319
 here for one the first iron 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.060
 therefore times are our 14 irons of the 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.860
 openwork motif 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.650
 remember to always do the last two 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.930
 knit straight and when you come back work 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.940
 always straight so let's continue 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.769
 let's go on make our thrown 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.320
 the pass goes straight and we create that 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.120
 that our pierced motif 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.190
 mirrored that once we go to 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.140
 blocking our work will allow us 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.410
 to create those very beautiful tips 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.060
 decorative and if we do it red for 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.940
 Christmas with a beautiful Christmas star 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.769
 on the center table is beautiful 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.829
 when we get to the bottom we work 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.670
 the last links to straight and we turn the 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.959
 our work 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.639
 and remember to work them in garter st 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.709
 work this these two irons for 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:52.230
 seven times in all and we are ready then 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:56.630
 for what is the central phase of the 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.630
 Our placemat good job
