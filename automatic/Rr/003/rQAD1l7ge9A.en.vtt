anywhere<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.690> so<00:02:33.690> here<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.770> figure<00:02:35.209> one

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
anywhere and so here is the figure one

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.570 
anywhere and so here is the figure one
thing<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.630> note<00:02:36.780> about<00:02:36.990> this<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.709> that<00:02:37.800> it's

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
thing to note about this is that it's

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.490 
thing to note about this is that it's
really<00:02:38.849> difficult<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.569> balance<00:02:39.990> it<00:02:40.200> without

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
really difficult to balance it without

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.300 
really difficult to balance it without
the<00:02:41.069> stage<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:42.300> once<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:43.020> tip<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:43.500> one<00:02:43.710> over

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
the stage so once you tip this one over

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.990 
the stage so once you tip this one over
or<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:45.240> just<00:02:45.870> falls<00:02:46.110> down<00:02:46.230> and

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
or it just falls down and

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.780 
or it just falls down and
back<00:02:47.210> so<00:02:47.630> some<00:02:48.290> of<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.590> possibilities<00:02:49.400> for

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
back so some of the possibilities for

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.150 
back so some of the possibilities for
this<00:02:49.910> figure<00:02:50.090> or<00:02:50.360> joints<00:02:51.020> you<00:02:51.590> have<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.920> nice

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
this figure or joints you have a nice

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.580 
this figure or joints you have a nice
ball<00:02:52.490> jointed<00:02:52.910> head<00:02:53.180> it<00:02:53.750> is<00:02:53.810> connected<00:02:54.440> just

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
ball jointed head it is connected just

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.160 
ball jointed head it is connected just
like<00:02:54.710> a<00:02:54.830> Revoltech<00:02:55.520> joint<00:02:55.820> but<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.810> doesn't

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
like a Revoltech joint but it doesn't

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.040 
like a Revoltech joint but it doesn't
click<00:02:57.380> so<00:02:57.800> that's<00:02:58.520> less<00:02:58.940> affordable<00:02:59.210> tech<00:02:59.750> and

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
click so that's less affordable tech and

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.390 
click so that's less affordable tech and
then<00:03:00.740> we<00:03:00.980> have<00:03:01.220> swiveling<00:03:02.090> arms<00:03:02.600> and<00:03:02.960> a<00:03:03.500> upper

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
then we have swiveling arms and a upper

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.199 
then we have swiveling arms and a upper
bicep<00:03:05.240> cut<00:03:05.630> here<00:03:05.900> and<00:03:06.080> then<00:03:06.800> we<00:03:07.310> have<00:03:07.550> a<00:03:07.820> single

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
bicep cut here and then we have a single

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.640 
bicep cut here and then we have a single
joint<00:03:08.690> on<00:03:08.990> the<00:03:09.320> elbows<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:10.040> then<00:03:11.080> it<00:03:12.080> easily

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
joint on the elbows and then it easily

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.340 
joint on the elbows and then it easily
comes<00:03:13.010> off<00:03:13.220> so<00:03:13.850> no<00:03:14.150> need<00:03:14.330> to<00:03:14.390> worry<00:03:14.810> about<00:03:14.930> that

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
comes off so no need to worry about that

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.490 
comes off so no need to worry about that
you<00:03:15.620> can<00:03:15.830> always<00:03:16.100> plug<00:03:16.610> it<00:03:16.880> back<00:03:17.090> on<00:03:17.990> its<00:03:18.290> arm

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
you can always plug it back on its arm

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.810 
you can always plug it back on its arm
and<00:03:18.740> then<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:20.120> hand<00:03:20.540> also<00:03:20.810> moves<00:03:21.340> right<00:03:22.340> here

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
and then the hand also moves right here

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.300 
and then the hand also moves right here
but<00:03:23.660> somewhat<00:03:24.050> hindered<00:03:24.320> because<00:03:24.800> of<00:03:25.070> the

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
but somewhat hindered because of the

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.510 
but somewhat hindered because of the
webslinger<00:03:26.180> accent<00:03:26.840> here<00:03:27.080> on<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.860> near<00:03:28.280> the

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
webslinger accent here on the near the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.949 
webslinger accent here on the near the
wrist<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:29.000> then<00:03:29.600> we<00:03:29.930> have<00:03:30.080> a<00:03:30.110> upper<00:03:30.770> torso

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
wrist and then we have a upper torso

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.340 
wrist and then we have a upper torso
joint<00:03:32.959> and<00:03:33.140> also<00:03:34.010> waist<00:03:34.520> joint<00:03:34.970> to<00:03:35.350> kinda

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
joint and also waist joint to kinda

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.479 
joint and also waist joint to kinda
hindered<00:03:36.709> because<00:03:36.860> of<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.790> this<00:03:38.980> area<00:03:39.980> here

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
hindered because of the this area here

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.830 
hindered because of the this area here
on<00:03:40.670> hips<00:03:41.270> and<00:03:41.600> then<00:03:42.560> we<00:03:42.980> have<00:03:43.459> a<00:03:43.940> single<00:03:44.420> joint

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
on hips and then we have a single joint

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.690 
on hips and then we have a single joint
on<00:03:45.050> the<00:03:45.709> knee<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:46.630> then<00:03:47.630> we<00:03:48.560> have<00:03:48.739> some<00:03:49.100> pivot

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
on the knee and then we have some pivot

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.740 
on the knee and then we have some pivot
points<00:03:50.030> also<00:03:50.209> on<00:03:50.600> the<00:03:50.720> hips<00:03:50.900> so<00:03:51.860> that's<00:03:52.130> nice

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
points also on the hips so that's nice

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.150 
points also on the hips so that's nice
another<00:03:53.750> thing<00:03:54.019> to<00:03:54.200> know<00:03:54.320> about<00:03:54.350> this<00:03:54.860> figure

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
another thing to know about this figure

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.250 
another thing to know about this figure
is<00:03:55.280> that<00:03:55.310> it's<00:03:56.030> kind<00:03:56.209> of<00:03:56.269> irritating<00:03:56.570> to<00:03:56.989> work

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
is that it's kind of irritating to work

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.039 
is that it's kind of irritating to work
around<00:03:57.650> it<00:03:57.830> because<00:03:58.250> most<00:03:59.150> of<00:03:59.360> the<00:03:59.570> joints

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
around it because most of the joints

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.620 
around it because most of the joints
here<00:04:00.350> can<00:04:00.650> be<00:04:00.830> taken<00:04:01.280> off<00:04:01.430> like<00:04:02.150> for<00:04:02.299> example

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
here can be taken off like for example

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.729 
here can be taken off like for example
the<00:04:02.690> head<00:04:02.870> it<00:04:03.650> just<00:04:03.970> plugs<00:04:04.970> out<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:05.540> then<00:04:06.260> some

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
the head it just plugs out and then some

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.460 
the head it just plugs out and then some
of<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:07.010> joints<00:04:07.730> here<00:04:07.820> like<00:04:08.480> I<00:04:08.690> showed<00:04:09.290> you

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
of the joints here like I showed you

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.310 
of the joints here like I showed you
earlier<00:04:09.500> like<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.489> hands<00:04:10.880> can<00:04:11.600> be<00:04:11.780> taken<00:04:12.200> off

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
earlier like the hands can be taken off

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.759 
earlier like the hands can be taken off
easily<00:04:13.190> and<00:04:13.549> then<00:04:14.030> especially<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:15.110> foot<00:04:15.350> the

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
easily and then especially the foot the

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.789 
easily and then especially the foot the
foot<00:04:15.950> is<00:04:16.280> just<00:04:16.549> like<00:04:16.729> yeah<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:17.870> it<00:04:18.410> falls<00:04:18.650> down

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
foot is just like yeah and it falls down

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.000 
foot is just like yeah and it falls down
if<00:04:19.310> you're<00:04:19.640> not<00:04:19.669> careful<00:04:20.060> with<00:04:20.419> it<00:04:20.570> so<00:04:21.500> it

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
if you're not careful with it so it

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.480 
if you're not careful with it so it
really<00:04:22.550> helps<00:04:22.940> that<00:04:23.540> you<00:04:23.750> have<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:23.930> stage<00:04:24.490> that

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
really helps that you have a stage that

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.180 
really helps that you have a stage that
nandroid<00:04:26.000> or<00:04:26.450> good<00:04:26.840> smile<00:04:27.080> company<00:04:27.320> did

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
nandroid or good smile company did

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.610 
nandroid or good smile company did
include<00:04:28.640> some<00:04:29.030> stages<00:04:29.479> the<00:04:30.080> only<00:04:30.380> thing<00:04:30.560> I

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
include some stages the only thing I

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.409 
include some stages the only thing I
didn't<00:04:30.950> mention<00:04:30.979> about<00:04:31.460> state<00:04:31.729> about<00:04:32.240> this

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
didn't mention about state about this

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.800 
didn't mention about state about this
stage<00:04:32.690> is<00:04:32.990> this<00:04:33.380> one<00:04:33.620> so<00:04:34.340> we<00:04:34.520> have<00:04:34.669> a<00:04:34.880> nice<00:04:35.390> flat

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
stage is this one so we have a nice flat

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.080 
stage is this one so we have a nice flat
and<00:04:36.050> one<00:04:36.260> in<00:04:36.950> a<00:04:37.550> clear

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
and one in a clear

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.630 
and one in a clear
Stage<00:04:38.540> two<00:04:38.570> and<00:04:39.080> then<00:04:39.740> you<00:04:39.979> can<00:04:40.160> use<00:04:40.460> the

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
Stage two and then you can use the

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.350 
Stage two and then you can use the
suction<00:04:41.030> cup<00:04:41.240> here<00:04:41.720> then<00:04:42.410> just<00:04:43.180> push<00:04:44.180> it<00:04:44.330> down

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
suction cup here then just push it down

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.050 
suction cup here then just push it down
and<00:04:44.890> then<00:04:45.890> you<00:04:46.130> can<00:04:46.310> play<00:04:46.970> with<00:04:47.860> study<00:04:49.060> with

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
and then you can play with study with

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.110 
and then you can play with study with
this<00:04:50.390> one<00:04:50.630> if<00:04:51.020> you're<00:04:51.320> not<00:04:51.350> keen<00:04:51.919> in<00:04:52.190> using<00:04:52.850> on

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
this one if you're not keen in using on

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.490 
this one if you're not keen in using on
the<00:04:54.110> other<00:04:55.039> stage<00:04:55.610> with<00:04:56.210> hat<00:04:56.510> which<00:04:56.990> has<00:04:57.260> the

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
the other stage with hat which has the

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.429 
the other stage with hat which has the
cityscape<00:04:58.180> thing<00:04:59.180> going<00:04:59.479> on<00:04:59.630> but

00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:00.439 
cityscape thing going on but

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:03.279 
cityscape thing going on but
overall<00:05:00.830> I<00:05:00.860> do<00:05:01.099> like<00:05:01.519> the<00:05:01.789> sculpt<00:05:02.089> on<00:05:02.300> it<00:05:02.599> the

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
overall I do like the sculpt on it the

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.889 
overall I do like the sculpt on it the
features<00:05:03.649> it's<00:05:04.429> just<00:05:04.610> that<00:05:04.789> the<00:05:05.119> joints<00:05:05.689> and

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:05.899 
features it's just that the joints and

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:09.850 
features it's just that the joints and
some<00:05:06.800> of<00:05:06.919> the<00:05:07.009> parts<00:05:07.399> easily<00:05:08.289> plug<00:05:09.289> off<00:05:09.499> and

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
some of the parts easily plug off and

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.609 
some of the parts easily plug off and
it's<00:05:10.699> hard<00:05:10.909> to<00:05:11.119> keep<00:05:11.330> on<00:05:11.539> balance<00:05:11.989> without<00:05:12.349> it

00:05:12.609 --> 00:05:12.619 
it's hard to keep on balance without it

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:15.459 
it's hard to keep on balance without it
without<00:05:13.099> the<00:05:13.429> stage<00:05:13.669> so<00:05:14.659> that's<00:05:14.959> all

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:15.469 
without the stage so that's all

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:18.219 
without the stage so that's all
overall<00:05:16.399> call<00:05:16.699> me<00:05:16.909> shallow<00:05:17.209> but<00:05:17.569> I<00:05:17.749> really<00:05:18.050> do

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
overall call me shallow but I really do

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.709 
overall call me shallow but I really do
like<00:05:18.469> the<00:05:18.739> addition<00:05:18.769> of<00:05:19.309> the<00:05:19.369> suction<00:05:19.669> cup<00:05:20.059> for

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:20.719 
like the addition of the suction cup for

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:22.479
