00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.800
 besides the surroundings of architectural photography but similar on 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:06.810
 some points to landscape photography 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.660
 however there are some peculiarities and tips you need to consider 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.980
 the highest construction more perform in different types of 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.179
 plans as the overall plan 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.209
 the closeup in its entirety where will be detailed 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.439
 you will have the choice between keeping the building in its environment 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.919
 on the contrary, subtract it to highlight 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.920
 a part that seem important to me 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.969
 in the first quarter you have to pay attention to the disruptive elements 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.150
 such as works 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.350
 a little misplaced for too bright lighting 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.770
 all of which may be detrimental to the intent of the observer 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.900
 proposition and the key factor of an architecture fault you will have to go 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.120
 beyond the simple proposition 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.540
 adding a bit of mystery with the choice of weather climate 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.410
 aesthetic 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.500
 a building reflects a style messi a historical period 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.950
 do not hesitate to go around the building before photographing it by 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.810
 following you will have the choice to take the building in English that 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.220
 reflects the most you have felt but simply to 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.410
 the interpretation you want to pass you will have to take a first 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.500
 time look at what are the guidelines of a building so that 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.080
 your photo so standards and lines and the character of the building 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.410
 is also recommended to bring a human presence it's a little 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.710
 inform the observer about the scale but sometimes make the game more alive 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.140
 through his functional aspect of the ancients however he says do not need 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.380
 to transform a photo of archived dior in portrait in its environment it is necessary 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.010
 so keep a balance between the building that must be preponderant 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.050
 elected to red the characters who drink contextualize the places if 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.570
 your goal is to make unpublished shots I recommend 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.580
 to play on the contrast 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.110
 color saturation besides a tutorial is provided for this purpose 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.200
 we always recommend touching a face under photoshop yet reason the 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.979
 focal length 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:15.039
 but also to use polarizing filters that can prove very 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:18.349
 useful if you photograph a building 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.529
 fully glazed and you want to comment on the raids as 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.670
 in the weather landscape the moment chosen in 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:27.580
 the day 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.540
 I am thinking in particular of simulations of buildings during the night these last 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.629
 are very important 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.770
 you need to keystone photo be happy with these elements so 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.280
 to highlight the volumes until March 27 the colors are 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.179
 workers the design is signed afterwards 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:46.989
 likewise 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.200
 it is best to inquire upstream about the building q you have 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.730
 photographed in order to bring a cultural dimension the morning most 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.340
 big challenge consists of photos and perspective indeed the constructions 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.019
 high problem 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.049
 because most of the time the crisis of eavesdropping carried out all 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.370
 this balance against the dive and the convergence of the high lines and the 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.049
 Outlook flaws are strongly accentuated 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.579
 here is a photograph of the montparnasse tower in paris confronted with 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.379
 this problematic to correct this problem there are three solutions 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.739
 either you invest in a goal to shift anti-minarets control 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.959
 of parallelism 12 vertical or horizontal lines the courtyard of this 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.010
 kind of style goal is very expensive or you're moving away echoes 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.809
 a maximum of your subject 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:37.089
 using as large a focal length as possible 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.029
 either you opt for a correction of the distortions of the problems of 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:44.479
 prospects in post spread as we can see it currently 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:49.049
 especially with the engine perspective team on fire things though this 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.839
 would be a loss of definition 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:54.229
 because it will surely be necessary to look at the picture later as 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:55.469
 French Cleric 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:59.589
 to be as creative as possible, do not hesitate to use the surfaces 

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:04.449
 reflective in addition to any other material that creates an image 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.870
 all at once for night shots 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.210
 it is necessary to have a secondhand to avoid the crowds that I write 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.520
 because the pause time may be longer then for the day this 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.600
 decision must be so perfectly mastered so avoid men coming 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.900
 wide space 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.960
 especially on wolseley the top 500 appliances you can turn on the 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.850
 function of his arms that just allows to see what are the 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.300
 works for indoor photos shooting all adhered more 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.080
 complicated because of light sources and a temperature of 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.379
 different colors 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:43.020
 do not forget to make a white balance emmanuel to section a 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.389
 preprogrammed mode adequate to work essentially between poses 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.960
 long views on tripods of course and preferably importance finally 

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:56.029
 the careful study of the environment of the subject is the choice of the best 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:00.059
 living conditions are the prerequisite for the achievement of a 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.959
 site photo a building
