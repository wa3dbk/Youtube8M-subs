changed the types of secreted molecules
they<00:03:05.850> produced<00:03:06.709> so<00:03:07.709> this<00:03:07.860> was<00:03:08.010> exciting<00:03:08.310> and

they produced so this was exciting and

scientists found that a factor that

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.499 
scientists found that a factor that

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
promotes the growth of blood vessels is

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:01.850 
promotes the growth of blood vessels is
responsible<00:04:58.470> for<00:04:58.650> this<00:05:00.470> this<00:05:01.470> is<00:05:01.650> very

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
responsible for this this is very

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.370 
responsible for this this is very
exciting<00:05:02.340> because<00:05:02.430> it<00:05:02.699> suggests<00:05:02.940> that<00:05:03.569> NPCs

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
exciting because it suggests that NPCs

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.740 
exciting because it suggests that NPCs
are<00:05:04.409> controlling<00:05:05.159> microglia<00:05:05.699> that<00:05:06.330> in<00:05:06.479> turn

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
are controlling microglia that in turn

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.339 
are controlling microglia that in turn
control<00:05:07.380> NPC<00:05:07.830> function<00:05:08.539> this<00:05:09.539> type<00:05:09.750> of<00:05:09.780> cycle

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
control NPC function this type of cycle

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:12.439 
control NPC function this type of cycle
is<00:05:10.470> found<00:05:10.710> in<00:05:10.949> many<00:05:11.159> systems<00:05:11.460> in<00:05:11.849> nature<00:05:12.180> and

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
is found in many systems in nature and

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.210 
is found in many systems in nature and
it's<00:05:12.990> very<00:05:13.199> interesting<00:05:13.770> to<00:05:13.889> think<00:05:13.919> about

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
it's very interesting to think about

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.159 
it's very interesting to think about
some<00:05:14.550> possible<00:05:14.880> reasons<00:05:14.940> life<00:05:15.870> would<00:05:16.080> have

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
some possible reasons life would have

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.379 
some possible reasons life would have
evolved<00:05:16.710> such<00:05:16.889> complex<00:05:17.400> modes<00:05:17.639> of<00:05:17.759> regulation

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.730 

so<00:05:21.389> what<00:05:21.509> can<00:05:21.630> we<00:05:21.750> take<00:05:21.870> away<00:05:22.050> from<00:05:22.139> this<00:05:22.469> study

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
so what can we take away from this study

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.790 
so what can we take away from this study
when<00:05:23.069> it<00:05:23.190> comes<00:05:23.370> to<00:05:23.520> therapy<00:05:23.699> of<00:05:24.229> course<00:05:25.229> like

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
when it comes to therapy of course like

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.260 
when it comes to therapy of course like
every<00:05:26.099> other<00:05:26.219> study<00:05:26.580> there<00:05:26.819> are<00:05:26.969> a<00:05:27.000> lot<00:05:27.240> of

every other study there are a lot of

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.680 
every other study there are a lot of
