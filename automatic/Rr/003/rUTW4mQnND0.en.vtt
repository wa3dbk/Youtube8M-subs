00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.010

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.910
 very simple way that it becomes well

 so I hope you like this 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.510
 video there we will go to the cut myself 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.729
 I'll try to explain the type on the line. 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.930
 basically speaking without too much 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.340
 many longs 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.630
 I hope I can get the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.630
 message for you guys 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.140
 good the great amenity with abs is that 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.600
 You really feel the car in your hand. 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.460
 however if you are a challenging and 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.979
 this becomes a little easier 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.030
 for you there in the passages that I gave 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.289
 captured 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.119
 You can see that people 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:39.280
 can lock the trigger until the last 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.159
 point it will not lose traction and 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.110
 will not lose the line he's good 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.180
 this will make it easier to 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.280
 that the car is for you. 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.550
 beginner this really is easier 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.100
 right there on the bottom right 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.330
 you can see the brake rod 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.119
 it means that it is 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.009
 tightening everything and with that you have to 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.380
 possibility of stopping everything and still 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.750
 turn the steering wheel and steering wheel lock not only 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.970
 a positive point of the adece 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.470
 however as I said you are someone who 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.940
 likes challenges 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.150
 You'll definitely learn to play. 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.620
 no abs in this video so this here was 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.620
 the game with abs nÃ© 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.840
 on the sensitivity of the trigger where 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.330
 again showed this to you straight 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.739
 between the trigger the control is the point 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.510
 maximum you can get with 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.510
 trigger per car do not brake the wheels 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.989
 the trick of how I learned to play without 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.879
 abs was this 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.310
 I took a piece of electrical tape 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:50.620
 black small piece on which I fit 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.700
 behind the trigger and this causes 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.950
 block the total sinking of the 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.470
 trigger this helps a lot for who is 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.030
 starting and has heavy hand is a tip 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.349
 It's cool, I recommend it. 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.349
 I quite learned to play yes 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.120
 at the beginning and you can check the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.829
 the car's reaction when you press the 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.659
 trigger without abs you do not 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.769
 can handle the steering wheel 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.299
 gets stuck 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.769
 You can tell that he holds 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.049
 quite the car 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.629
 this makes you lose a lot of grip 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.780
 same vehicle making your 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:30.510
 but also when you 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.969
 use the right abs showing those 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.969
 techniques that I showed in video one 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:38.939
 a little while ago showing how it is done 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:40.829
 When you put negative only then it is 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:43.799
 only you go using it using that 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.450
 trick is easy to play in china and it is 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.739
 this is the behavior of the car 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.760
 using without abs + training straight 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.269
 for you to see that there is a difference 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.269
 great 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:59.189
 so that's it folks the video will arrive 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.290
 In the end I hope you have 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.450
 liked this tip I have helped to 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.629
 vast majority who were doubtful that 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.909
 had difficulty and this method that 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.129
 floor of the xbox the year can be adapted in 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.959
 other islands normally you go 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.819
 make your adaptations I did as 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.669
 example the xbox live console that I 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.169
 I have a racing game but then it's 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.180
 This without further ado I hope that 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.409
 Everyone liked this video if you
