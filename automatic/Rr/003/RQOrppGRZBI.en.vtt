pre<00:01:47.610> referee<00:01:47.909> grid<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:49.259> advantages<00:01:49.740> of

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
pre referee grid and the advantages of

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.469 
pre referee grid and the advantages of
the<00:01:50.040> system<00:01:50.070> are<00:01:50.579> kind<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.090> limited<00:01:51.390> because

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the system are kind of limited because

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.789 
the system are kind of limited because

in there you know you press it you do
that<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.490> have<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.909> know<00:01:57.000> go<00:01:57.210> in

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
that on this you have to you know go in

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.609 
that on this you have to you know go in

if you want make leggings you have to go

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.440 
if you want make leggings you have to go
like<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.700> take<00:01:59.880> longer<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.360> be

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
like this and it can take longer to be

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.090 
like this and it can take longer to be
honest<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:01.020> system<00:02:01.320> especially<00:02:01.979> if

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
honest to do this system especially if

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.440 
honest to do this system especially if
you're<00:02:02.219> gonna<00:02:02.280> be<00:02:02.399> using<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.640> thumb<00:02:02.820> stick<00:02:03.090> but

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
you're gonna be using a thumb stick but

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.300 
you're gonna be using a thumb stick but
that's<00:02:03.869> again<00:02:04.259> it's<00:02:04.439> not<00:02:04.590> fair<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.890> say<00:02:05.040> that

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
that's again it's not fair to say that

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.889 
that's again it's not fair to say that
the<00:02:05.460> Peter<00:02:05.670> Mac<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.270> classic<00:02:06.600> crafting

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
the Peter Mac that the classic crafting

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.449 
the Peter Mac that the classic crafting
system<00:02:07.020> doesn't<00:02:07.439> have<00:02:07.590> its<00:02:07.829> advantages<00:02:07.950> and

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
system doesn't have its advantages and

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.770 
system doesn't have its advantages and
let's<00:02:08.849> try<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.119> fight<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.330> other<00:02:09.479> side<00:02:09.629> now

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
let's try and fight the other side now

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.660 
let's try and fight the other side now
so<00:02:09.989> basically<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:11.069> one<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.520> big

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
so basically the one of the big

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.400 
so basically the one of the big
advantages<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:12.360> my<00:02:12.390> opinion<00:02:12.870> is

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
advantages in my opinion is

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.140 
advantages in my opinion is
because<00:02:13.860> classic<00:02:14.340> crafting<00:02:14.670> if<00:02:14.820> it<00:02:14.970> comes

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
because classic crafting if it comes

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.910 
because classic crafting if it comes
properly<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.660> console<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.170> has<00:02:16.440> all<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.740> PC

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
properly to console and has all the PC

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.410 
properly to console and has all the PC
functionality<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.700> means<00:02:18.030> there<00:02:18.180> will<00:02:18.270> be<00:02:18.330> a

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
functionality it means there will be a

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.150 
functionality it means there will be a
few<00:02:18.570> advantages<00:02:18.840> first<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.410> all<00:02:19.530> if<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.980> know

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
few advantages first of all if you know

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.290 
few advantages first of all if you know

the recipes but don't know their
locations<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:22.050> means<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.320> can<00:02:22.440> switch<00:02:22.620> from

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
the PC to the console easier if you

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.550 
the PC to the console easier if you
mostly<00:02:24.390> pay<00:02:24.570> PC<00:02:24.930> but<00:02:25.080> play<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.230> little<00:02:25.380> bit

that's done second of all there are some

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.680 
that's done second of all there are some
recipes<00:02:41.130> which<00:02:41.460> will<00:02:41.760> be<00:02:41.940> faster<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:42.570> the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
recipes which will be faster on the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.050 
recipes which will be faster on the
console<00:02:43.050> than<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.620> possible<00:02:44.130> on<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.460> PC<00:02:44.880> so

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
console than is possible on the PC so

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.460 
console than is possible on the PC so
for<00:02:45.180> instance<00:02:45.450> if<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.900> want<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.110> make<00:02:46.200> sticks

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
for instance if you want to make sticks

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.470 
for instance if you want to make sticks
it's<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.860> fast<00:02:47.070> that<00:02:47.280> that's<00:02:47.760> simple<00:02:48.090> if<00:02:48.240> you

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
it's that fast that that's simple if you

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.730 
it's that fast that that's simple if you
want<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.690> make<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.810> sword<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.260> just<00:02:49.470> saw<00:02:49.590> me

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
want to make a sword you just saw me

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.650 
want to make a sword you just saw me
it's<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:50.940> simple<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.270> go<00:02:51.360> from<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:51.600> to

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
it's this simple you go from that to

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.970 
it's this simple you go from that to
that<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.110> if<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.380> wanna<00:02:52.500> make<00:02:52.620> multiple

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
that and if you wanna make multiple

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.500 
that and if you wanna make multiple
items<00:02:53.280> in<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.430> row<00:02:53.580> you<00:02:53.760> can<00:02:53.940> leave<00:02:54.120> some<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.450> the

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
items in a row you can leave some of the

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.970 
items in a row you can leave some of the
items<00:02:54.810> in<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:54.990> crafting<00:02:55.320> grid<00:02:55.350> in<00:02:55.620> fact<00:02:55.830> I

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
items in the crafting grid in fact I

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.530 
items in the crafting grid in fact I
think<00:02:56.130> one<00:02:56.490> of<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.610> most<00:02:56.730> popular<00:02:57.270> ones<00:02:57.420> is

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
think one of the most popular ones is

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.060 
think one of the most popular ones is
like<00:02:57.720> if<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:57.930> go<00:02:58.380> like<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.560> wait<00:02:58.740> let<00:02:58.860> me<00:02:58.920> let<00:02:59.040> me

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
like if you go like a wait let me let me

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.530 
like if you go like a wait let me let me
do<00:02:59.160> this<00:02:59.250> so<00:02:59.430> if<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.820> go<00:02:59.970> like<00:03:00.120> this<00:03:00.180> for

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
do this so if you go like this for

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.990 
do this so if you go like this for
instance<00:03:01.100> this<00:03:02.100> is<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.550> know<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:02.790> might

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
instance this is you know and this might

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.580 
instance this is you know and this might
be<00:03:03.030> slightly<00:03:03.330> faster<00:03:03.390> than<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.500> know

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
be slightly faster than the you know

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.930 
be slightly faster than the you know
console<00:03:04.920> version<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:05.400> can<00:03:05.490> just<00:03:05.610> be<00:03:05.670> like<00:03:05.820> a

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
console version you can just be like a

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.190 
console version you can just be like a
legging<00:03:06.240> sine<00:03:06.420> hammock<00:03:06.690> done<00:03:06.870> or<00:03:07.020> you<00:03:07.080> take

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
legging sine hammock done or you take

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.420 
legging sine hammock done or you take
both<00:03:07.410> at<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.650> same<00:03:07.830> time<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.220> you've<00:03:08.310> got

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
both at the same time and you've got

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.310 
both at the same time and you've got
both<00:03:08.610> pairs<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:08.970> things<00:03:09.150> second<00:03:09.870> of<00:03:09.960> all<00:03:10.110> there

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
both pairs of things second of all there

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.510 
both pairs of things second of all there
is<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.440> nother<00:03:10.710> big<00:03:10.920> advantage<00:03:11.340> in<00:03:11.490> that

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
is a nother big advantage in that

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.550 
is a nother big advantage in that
shift-clicking<00:03:12.240> which<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.930> PC<00:03:13.350> feature

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
shift-clicking which is a PC feature

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.720 
shift-clicking which is a PC feature
that<00:03:13.830> you<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:14.130> do<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.370> console<00:03:14.670> by

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
that you can do on the console by

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.160 
that you can do on the console by
pressing<00:03:14.760> Y<00:03:15.210> so<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:15.510> can<00:03:15.630> move<00:03:15.720> items<00:03:16.020> like

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
pressing Y so you can move items like

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.110 
pressing Y so you can move items like
that<00:03:16.380> this<00:03:16.740> means<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.100> can<00:03:17.250> craft<00:03:17.490> stuff<00:03:17.760> much

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
that this means you can craft stuff much

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.730 
that this means you can craft stuff much
faster<00:03:18.540> like<00:03:18.690> right<00:03:18.900> now<00:03:19.050> if<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.530> want<00:03:19.680> to

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
faster like right now if you want to

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.590 
faster like right now if you want to
make<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:20.010> thousand<00:03:20.790> sticks<00:03:21.060> or<00:03:21.210> you<00:03:21.300> know<00:03:21.390> some

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
make a thousand sticks or you know some

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.030 
make a thousand sticks or you know some
ridiculous<00:03:21.990> number<00:03:22.050> of<00:03:22.260> sticks<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.740> put<00:03:22.950> the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
ridiculous number of sticks you put the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.740 
ridiculous number of sticks you put the
items<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.460> then<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.730> manually<00:03:24.090> have<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.540> press

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
items in then you manually have to press

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.780 
items in then you manually have to press
a<00:03:24.900> AAA<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.950> each<00:03:26.040> time<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.280> do<00:03:26.460> it<00:03:26.490> you<00:03:26.640> get

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
a AAA and each time you do it you get

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.610 
a AAA and each time you do it you get
this<00:03:26.940> sort<00:03:27.150> thing<00:03:27.300> going<00:03:27.480> on<00:03:27.570> on<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:28.110> PC<00:03:28.470> if

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
this sort thing going on on the PC if

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.230 
this sort thing going on on the PC if
you<00:03:28.800> shift<00:03:29.040> lick<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.310> stack<00:03:29.520> you<00:03:29.550> get<00:03:29.820> as<00:03:29.940> many

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
you shift lick the stack you get as many

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.970 
you shift lick the stack you get as many
as<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.630> can<00:03:30.780> possibly<00:03:30.810> craft<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:31.800> means

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
as it can possibly craft and this means

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.800 
as it can possibly craft and this means
you<00:03:32.070> can<00:03:32.250> get<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.460> bunch<00:03:32.970> of<00:03:33.210> stuff<00:03:33.360> made<00:03:33.690> at

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
you can get a bunch of stuff made at

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.510 
you can get a bunch of stuff made at
once<00:03:34.020> and<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.350> means<00:03:34.530> yeah<00:03:34.860> if<00:03:35.040> you're<00:03:35.340> making

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
once and it means yeah if you're making

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.160 
once and it means yeah if you're making
all<00:03:35.910> these<00:03:36.150> sticks<00:03:36.420> for<00:03:36.540> instance<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.990> make

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
all these sticks for instance to make

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.660 
all these sticks for instance to make
all<00:03:37.350> these<00:03:37.440> ladders<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:37.890> can<00:03:38.100> do<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:38.520> much

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
all these ladders you can do it so much

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.220 
all these ladders you can do it so much
faster<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.360> know<00:03:39.570> again<00:03:39.750> with<00:03:39.900> Lac<00:03:40.020> like

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
faster and you know again with Lac like

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.410 
faster and you know again with Lac like
I'll<00:03:40.380> show<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.530> again<00:03:40.740> later<00:03:40.920> so<00:03:41.220> if<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.270> just

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
I'll show you again later so if you just

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.970 
I'll show you again later so if you just
take<00:03:42.570> this<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:42.900> then<00:03:43.230> you<00:03:43.290> split<00:03:43.560> into<00:03:43.680> half

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
take this and then you split into half

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.680 
take this and then you split into half
and<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:44.280> do<00:03:44.400> this<00:03:44.490> over<00:03:44.670> again<00:03:44.910> you<00:03:45.330> can<00:03:45.510> make

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
and you do this over again you can make

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.480 
and you do this over again you can make
so<00:03:46.050> many<00:03:46.110> ladders<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:46.830> much<00:03:46.980> faster<00:03:47.220> than<00:03:47.400> you

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
so many ladders so much faster than you

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.710 
so many ladders so much faster than you
possibly<00:03:47.820> can<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.120> constant<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:48.510> it's<00:03:48.630> one

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
possibly can the constant and it's one

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.760 
possibly can the constant and it's one
of<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.870> big<00:03:48.990> advantages<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:49.530> now<00:03:49.620> I've<00:03:49.740> just

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
of the big advantages so now I've just

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.590 
of the big advantages so now I've just
made<00:03:50.010> myself<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:50.730> know<00:03:50.820> that<00:03:50.970> many<00:03:51.270> ladders

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
made myself you know that many ladders

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.420 
made myself you know that many ladders
in<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:51.900> fast<00:03:52.200> as<00:03:52.380> approach<00:03:52.590> being<00:03:52.800> like<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:53.100> a

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
in that fast as approach being like a a

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.490 
in that fast as approach being like a a
a<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:54.750> that's<00:03:54.930> one<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.260> biggest

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
a so that's one of the biggest

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.530 
a so that's one of the biggest
advantages<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.490> know<00:03:56.610> some<00:03:57.000> items<00:03:57.300> being

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
advantages you know some items being

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.320 
advantages you know some items being
faster<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.550> you<00:03:59.550> know<00:03:59.640> that<00:03:59.820> bit<00:04:00.000> of<00:04:00.090> thing

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
faster and you know that bit of thing

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.730 
faster and you know that bit of thing
are<00:04:00.480> big<00:04:00.630> advantages<00:04:01.020> the<00:04:01.320> big<00:04:01.470> disadvantage

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
are big advantages the big disadvantage

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.590 
are big advantages the big disadvantage
is<00:04:02.190> having<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.520> know<00:04:02.670> every<00:04:02.910> craft<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.240> recipe<00:04:03.510> I

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
is having to know every craft a recipe I

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.780 
is having to know every craft a recipe I
doubt<00:04:03.900> most<00:04:04.170> you<00:04:04.470> know<00:04:04.590> I<00:04:04.830> personally<00:04:05.580> can't

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
doubt most you know I personally can't

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.070 
doubt most you know I personally can't
say<00:04:05.910> I<00:04:05.970> know<00:04:06.030> every<00:04:06.360> crafting<00:04:06.690> recipe<00:04:06.930> but

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
say I know every crafting recipe but

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.270 
say I know every crafting recipe but
there<00:04:07.170> are<00:04:07.260> some<00:04:07.410> really<00:04:07.650> tricky<00:04:07.860> ones<00:04:08.130> like<00:04:08.250> a

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
there are some really tricky ones like a

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.520 
there are some really tricky ones like a
piston<00:04:08.730> for<00:04:09.270> instance<00:04:09.570> it's<00:04:09.750> like<00:04:09.990> free<00:04:10.320> bits

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
piston for instance it's like free bits

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.710 
piston for instance it's like free bits
of<00:04:10.650> wood<00:04:10.740> at<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:10.890> top<00:04:11.100> there's<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.700> redstone<00:04:12.480> in

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
of wood at the top there's a redstone in

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.360 
of wood at the top there's a redstone in
the<00:04:12.810> middle<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.290> then<00:04:13.410> an<00:04:13.530> iron<00:04:13.830> vetno<00:04:14.190> it's

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
the middle and then an iron vetno it's

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.980 
the middle and then an iron vetno it's
probably<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.820> way<00:04:14.940> around<00:04:15.150> maybe<00:04:15.270> there<00:04:15.930> you

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
probably the way around maybe there you

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.660 
probably the way around maybe there you
go<00:04:16.080> so<00:04:16.260> a<00:04:16.410> piston<00:04:16.859> recipe<00:04:17.130> like<00:04:17.250> you<00:04:17.370> look<00:04:17.520> at

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
go so a piston recipe like you look at

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.550 
go so a piston recipe like you look at
this<00:04:17.790> this<00:04:17.940> is<00:04:18.000> so<00:04:18.150> complex<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:18.900> strange<00:04:19.200> like

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
this this is so complex and strange like

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.440 
this this is so complex and strange like
trying<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.220> know<00:04:20.340> all<00:04:20.459> these<00:04:20.549> recipes<00:04:20.790> can<00:04:21.299> be

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
trying to know all these recipes can be

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.210 
trying to know all these recipes can be
difficult<00:04:21.840> to<00:04:21.930> remember<00:04:22.080> so<00:04:22.590> I<00:04:22.620> think<00:04:22.710> there

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
difficult to remember so I think there

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.290 
difficult to remember so I think there
is<00:04:23.250> gonna<00:04:23.430> be<00:04:23.520> a<00:04:23.610> place<00:04:23.790> for<00:04:23.970> both<00:04:24.120> these

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
is gonna be a place for both these

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.120 
is gonna be a place for both these
things<00:04:24.570> I<00:04:24.660> think<00:04:24.780> if<00:04:25.080> you're<00:04:25.229> pvping<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:25.979> you

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
things I think if you're pvping and you

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.629 
things I think if you're pvping and you
need

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
need

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.520 
need
that<00:04:26.939> quick<00:04:27.180> response<00:04:27.569> time<00:04:27.749> I<00:04:27.930> think<00:04:28.349> there's

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
that quick response time I think there's

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.409 
that quick response time I think there's
gonna<00:04:28.650> be<00:04:28.710> some<00:04:28.860> advantage<00:04:29.610> to<00:04:29.639> using<00:04:29.999> classic

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
gonna be some advantage to using classic

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:31.820 
gonna be some advantage to using classic
crafting<00:04:30.749> I<00:04:30.810> think<00:04:31.050> you<00:04:31.319> know<00:04:31.409> it<00:04:31.560> might<00:04:31.710> be

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
crafting I think you know it might be

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.110 
crafting I think you know it might be
fun<00:04:32.009> to<00:04:32.039> like<00:04:32.249> set<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.639> rule<00:04:32.789> for<00:04:32.939> the<00:04:32.999> whole

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
fun to like set the rule for the whole

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.459 
fun to like set the rule for the whole
world<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.389> have<00:04:33.509> to<00:04:33.599> use<00:04:33.749> it<00:04:33.780> so<00:04:33.960> it<00:04:34.259> you<00:04:34.349> know

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:34.469 
world to have to use it so it you know

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:36.230 
world to have to use it so it you know
answer<00:04:34.800> that<00:04:34.919> new<00:04:35.039> level<00:04:35.279> skill<00:04:35.460> I<00:04:35.610> think<00:04:35.759> for

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
answer that new level skill I think for

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.149 
answer that new level skill I think for
very<00:04:36.270> specific<00:04:36.749> events<00:04:37.259> classic<00:04:37.680> crafting<00:04:38.039> is

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:38.159 
very specific events classic crafting is

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.100 
very specific events classic crafting is
deafening<00:04:38.580> in<00:04:38.610> a<00:04:38.699> place<00:04:38.879> place<00:04:39.150> but<00:04:39.629> if<00:04:39.870> you

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
deafening in a place place but if you

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.390 
deafening in a place place but if you
don't<00:04:40.379> want<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:40.620> use<00:04:40.740> it<00:04:40.770> if<00:04:41.009> you<00:04:41.219> want<00:04:41.370> to

don't want to use it if you want to

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.399 
don't want to use it if you want to
stick<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.669> concert<00:04:41.939> you<00:04:42.389> know<00:04:42.509> the<00:04:42.689> sort<00:04:43.379> of

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.100 
the automatic cropping the console
crafting<00:04:44.969> I<00:04:45.120> don't<00:04:45.479> think<00:04:45.599> there's<00:04:45.749> gonna<00:04:45.990> be

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
crafting I don't think there's gonna be

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.450 
crafting I don't think there's gonna be
too<00:04:46.409> much<00:04:46.529> for<00:04:46.680> downside<00:04:47.069> I<00:04:47.159> think<00:04:47.340> it's

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
too much for downside I think it's

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.670 
too much for downside I think it's
mainly<00:04:47.729> just<00:04:48.180> if<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:49.020> want<00:04:49.229> to<00:04:49.319> have<00:04:49.469> this

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
mainly just if you want to have this

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.679 
mainly just if you want to have this
nice<00:04:49.949> PC<00:04:50.279> feature<00:04:50.520> you<00:04:50.789> can<00:04:50.969> have<00:04:51.120> it<00:04:51.240> if<00:04:51.360> you

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:51.689 
nice PC feature you can have it if you

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:53.450 
nice PC feature you can have it if you
don't<00:04:51.719> have<00:04:52.169> it<00:04:52.289> that's<00:04:52.529> entirely<00:04:52.949> fine<00:04:53.310> but

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
don't have it that's entirely fine but

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.040 
don't have it that's entirely fine but
everyone<00:04:53.699> else<00:04:53.849> too<00:04:54.029> so<00:04:54.270> yeah<00:04:54.659> it's<00:04:54.810> just<00:04:54.960> one

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
everyone else too so yeah it's just one

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.420 
everyone else too so yeah it's just one
of<00:04:55.080> those<00:04:55.259> pictures<00:04:55.469> that<00:04:55.620> I<00:04:55.770> think<00:04:56.129> is<00:04:56.219> cool

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
of those pictures that I think is cool

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.860 
of those pictures that I think is cool
because<00:04:56.669> you<00:04:56.969> know<00:04:57.029> they're<00:04:57.300> dedicated<00:04:57.779> that

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
because you know they're dedicated that

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.360 
because you know they're dedicated that
trying<00:04:58.169> to<00:04:58.199> at<00:04:58.289> you<00:04:58.409> know<00:04:58.499> let<00:04:58.740> PC<00:04:59.129> players

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
trying to at you know let PC players

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.980 
trying to at you know let PC players
convert<00:04:59.759> easier<00:05:00.029> and<00:05:00.300> that's<00:05:00.509> always<00:05:00.719> a<00:05:00.840> good

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
convert easier and that's always a good

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.330 
convert easier and that's always a good
thing<00:05:01.199> I<00:05:01.289> think<00:05:01.529> having<00:05:01.740> everyone<00:05:02.039> be<00:05:02.159> oh<00:05:02.250> to

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
thing I think having everyone be oh to

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.860 
thing I think having everyone be oh to
play<00:05:02.460> everyone<00:05:02.759> else's<00:05:03.029> platform<00:05:03.449> it's<00:05:03.719> just

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
play everyone else's platform it's just

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.360 
play everyone else's platform it's just
kind<00:05:04.050> of<00:05:04.080> a<00:05:04.169> general<00:05:04.349> all-around<00:05:04.710> good<00:05:05.129> thing

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
kind of a general all-around good thing

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.800 
kind of a general all-around good thing
and<00:05:05.550> maybe<00:05:05.759> that<00:05:05.969> means<00:05:06.120> that<00:05:06.360> automatic

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
and maybe that means that automatic

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.119 
and maybe that means that automatic
crackling<00:05:07.169> you<00:05:07.259> know<00:05:07.289> console<00:05:07.680> cropping<00:05:08.009> will

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:08.129 
crackling you know console cropping will

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
about PC crafting classic cropping it's

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.089 
about PC crafting classic cropping it's
a<00:05:15.419> really<00:05:15.779> cool<00:05:15.960> system<00:05:16.259> that<00:05:16.650> I'm<00:05:16.740> gonna<00:05:16.860> use

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
a really cool system that I'm gonna use

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:18.740 
a really cool system that I'm gonna use
just<00:05:17.370> for<00:05:17.490> fun<00:05:17.669> but<00:05:18.120> you<00:05:18.210> don't<00:05:18.449> have<00:05:18.569> any

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
just for fun but you don't have any

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.450 
just for fun but you don't have any
obligation<00:05:18.870> to<00:05:19.259> use<00:05:19.469> it<00:05:19.620> and<00:05:19.770> if<00:05:19.979> you<00:05:20.099> do<00:05:20.310> use

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
obligation to use it and if you do use

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.339 
obligation to use it and if you do use
it<00:05:20.490> you<00:05:20.699> get<00:05:20.879> a<00:05:20.909> tiny<00:05:21.330> advantage<00:05:21.839> in<00:05:22.020> some

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
it you get a tiny advantage in some

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.619 
it you get a tiny advantage in some
specific<00:05:22.650> situations<00:05:23.430> and<00:05:23.550> I<00:05:24.120> think<00:05:24.210> that's

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:24.629 
specific situations and I think that's

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:25.879 
specific situations and I think that's
what<00:05:24.749> you<00:05:24.810> need<00:05:24.960> from<00:05:25.050> a<00:05:25.139> thing<00:05:25.349> to<00:05:25.499> make<00:05:25.650> it<00:05:25.800> a

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
what you need from a thing to make it a
