00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.389
 hello girls here is a new video like vi 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.360
 I said in the previous video used 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.100
 waste extractor to create 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.020
 Popsicles are very special 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.789
 moreover for this period they are 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.679
 really fit and right to make you 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.840
 see that anyway the waste though 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.460
 so many can be used 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.009
 however also for desserts as well as 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.960
 be thrown away but at least we don't throw away 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.210
 via nothing doing this recipe 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.800
 now I'll show you in detail how 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.240
 make it the recipe of course 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.390
 Popsicles can be reproduced by 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.690
 all tastes and sauces all shapes 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.039
 possible imaginary that you want 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.230
 now let's take our bowl with 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.730
 waste so as not to dirty other things 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.649
 we use what you have to do 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.859
 you must still take half a lemon 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.690
 or lemon of your choice to express 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.300
 obviously be careful not to squeeze 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.949
 also the seeds because it is still then 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.840
 we are going to eat it anyway 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.730
 like ice lollies, not even for example 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.150
 one thing that the gap has not so much 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:10.280
 taste than when you wanted to eat 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.259
 the fact itself therefore unfortunately we must 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.330
 however add some sugars to you 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.310
 you know that I don't love sugars so much 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.290
 but we still need to add them now 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.030
 not a glass of water or doses 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.759
 they are more or less the second eye 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.009
 beginning scrap however it also mixes a 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.380
 po and I use cane sugar 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.710
 integral as a sweetener use 2 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.509
 teaspoons you can use any 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.829
 sweetener that you like to keep 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.530
 present this thing unfortunately 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.210
 since the waste does not have much taste 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.920
 you have to put these two 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.200
 spoons of sugar 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.090
 obviously I tend in the recipes a 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.560
 part of those of the classic desserts though ad 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.780
 example of it as you have seen also for the 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.820
 smoothie do not use sugar in 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.430
 this case is necessary now we take 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.070
 a blender and begin to blend the 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.689
 all very personally because it will be 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.369
 nice also good to the taste of 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.790
 icicles will also feel like gods 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.920
 pieces of fruit in itself so we do 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.869
 this also to us once 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.420
 we are in our containers 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.009
 I took it for a while it fails that it has here but it goes 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.590
 well any container you have 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.650
 as you can see it is not liquid, however, I respect 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.300
 as like as a product that came out 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.510
 because I wasn't there on my own 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.400
 blend it in the lug 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.250
 and obviously we begin to fill all the 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.930
 ours our icicles until no 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.879
 then my steep we put them all in 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.950
 freezer keep in mind to at least keep them 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.510
 a 3 hours before you can eat 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.579
 I did it the day before and the 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.069
 day later anyway or let's say 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.629
 recorded the initial intro because it is the 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.030
 taste at that time was beautiful beautiful 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.280
 hard and as I said you will be able to reproduce 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.840
 this recipe with all the ways of 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.879
 this imaginable land possible 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.250
 in fact want to print or others on 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.049
 Popsicles to have other tests done 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.819
 a bit strange, I have 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.069
 really much liked compared to 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.930
 classic standards this result 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.430
 final of my likes so much I hope that 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.540
 you like this video let me know 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.180
 what do you think 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.519
 and if you reproduce the recipes then paid 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.519
 of social a big boulder all hello
