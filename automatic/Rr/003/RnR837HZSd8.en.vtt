so<00:01:56.920> I'm<00:01:57.010> just<00:01:57.160> looking<00:01:57.520> at<00:01:57.760> I<00:01:58.120> think<00:01:58.450> it<00:01:58.630> is<00:01:58.660> a

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
so I'm just looking at I think it is a

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.360 
so I'm just looking at I think it is a
Marcelo<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.510> psv<00:02:01.510> a<00:02:02.020> brazilian<00:02:02.950> center<00:02:03.220> back

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
Marcelo the psv a brazilian center back

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.720 
Marcelo the psv a brazilian center back
and<00:02:03.990> add<00:02:04.990> a<00:02:05.080> Jerome<00:02:05.740> o<00:02:05.830> to<00:02:05.890> my<00:02:06.130> watch<00:02:06.340> list<00:02:06.370> I

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
and add a Jerome o to my watch list I

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.790 
and add a Jerome o to my watch list I
don't<00:02:06.880> think<00:02:07.030> again<00:02:07.330> but<00:02:07.720> that's<00:02:08.590> another

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
don't think again but that's another

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.679 
don't think again but that's another
good<00:02:09.039> thing<00:02:09.069> to<00:02:09.280> look<00:02:09.879> at<00:02:10.060> current<00:02:10.479> team<00:02:10.599> of

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:10.689 
good thing to look at current team of

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.509 
good thing to look at current team of
the<00:02:10.749> week<00:02:10.840> discs<00:02:11.170> are<00:02:11.290> players<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:12.280> can<00:02:12.310> get<00:02:12.489> a

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
the week discs are players you can get a

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.250 
the week discs are players you can get a
lot<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.730> luck<00:02:12.969> getting<00:02:13.359> them<00:02:13.450> under<00:02:13.810> discard

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
lot of luck getting them under discard

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.770 
lot of luck getting them under discard
you<00:02:14.590> know<00:02:14.709> even<00:02:14.920> if<00:02:15.099> you<00:02:15.219> discard

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
you know even if you discard

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.030 
you know even if you discard
most<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.900> times<00:02:17.080> you're<00:02:17.200> making<00:02:17.440> like<00:02:17.530> six<00:02:17.890> to

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
most of times you're making like six to

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.680 
most of times you're making like six to
eight<00:02:18.099> hundred<00:02:18.129> coins<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:19.060> mean<00:02:19.330> if<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.540> can

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
eight hundred coins I mean if you can

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.350 
eight hundred coins I mean if you can
keep<00:02:19.840> doing<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.200> with<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.440> good<00:02:21.010> coin<00:02:21.220> total<00:02:22.150> I

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
keep doing that with a good coin total I

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.020 
keep doing that with a good coin total I
mean<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.629> could<00:02:22.750> be<00:02:22.900> something<00:02:23.680> that's<00:02:24.550> not

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
mean it could be something that's not

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.140 
mean it could be something that's not
that<00:02:25.150> much<00:02:25.209> risk<00:02:26.170> in<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.910> can<00:02:28.030> get

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
that much risk in it and you can get

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.229 
that much risk in it and you can get
decent<00:02:28.390> rewards<00:02:28.959> from<00:02:29.319> doing<00:02:29.739> that<00:02:30.239> just

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
decent rewards from doing that just

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.000 
decent rewards from doing that just
checking<00:02:31.510> his<00:02:31.629> price<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.080> goes<00:02:32.739> for<00:02:32.769> around

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
checking his price and goes for around

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.220 
checking his price and goes for around
850<00:02:33.790> I<00:02:33.940> think<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.239> was<00:02:34.360> up<00:02:34.510> for<00:02:34.660> like<00:02:34.690> 12<00:02:35.110> hours

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
850 I think it was up for like 12 hours

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.350 
850 I think it was up for like 12 hours
so<00:02:35.590> i<00:02:35.800> think<00:02:36.430> i'm<00:02:36.670> going<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.819> put<00:02:36.970> mine<00:02:37.150> out

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
so i think i'm going to put mine out

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.509 
so i think i'm going to put mine out
around<00:02:37.630> eight<00:02:37.930> hundred<00:02:38.410> coins<00:02:38.590> in<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:38.980> 442

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
around eight hundred coins in a 442

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.449 
around eight hundred coins in a 442
formation<00:02:40.150> so<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:41.110> know<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.260> point<00:02:41.440> from<00:02:41.620> 607

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
formation so you know I point from 607

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.250 
formation so you know I point from 607
for<00:02:42.580> 800<00:02:43.060> even<00:02:43.299> after<00:02:43.510> tax<00:02:43.690> I'm<00:02:43.810> making<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:44.140> bit

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
for 800 even after tax I'm making a bit

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.140 
for 800 even after tax I'm making a bit
of<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.440> profit<00:02:44.860> but<00:02:44.890> at<00:02:45.400> this<00:02:45.610> stage<00:02:45.670> it's

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
of a profit but at this stage it's

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.210 
of a profit but at this stage it's
nothing<00:02:46.450> special<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:47.049> want<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.620> little<00:02:47.920> bit<00:02:48.010> more

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
nothing special I want a little bit more

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.030 
nothing special I want a little bit more
than<00:02:48.430> I'm<00:02:48.549> getting<00:02:48.760> so<00:02:49.209> as<00:02:50.110> I<00:02:50.230> said<00:02:50.290> earlier<00:02:50.769> I

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
than I'm getting so as I said earlier I

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.770 
than I'm getting so as I said earlier I
think<00:02:51.099> it's<00:02:51.340> better<00:02:51.489> to<00:02:51.730> focus<00:02:51.970> on<00:02:52.420> an<00:02:52.569> area

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
think it's better to focus on an area

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.440 
think it's better to focus on an area
next<00:02:53.680> day<00:02:53.890> you<00:02:53.950> can<00:02:54.280> see<00:02:54.430> 18<00:02:54.819> things<00:02:55.060> have<00:02:55.209> sold

basically<00:03:41.620> your<00:03:41.859> starter<00:03:42.250> pack<00:03:42.489> I<00:03:42.880> think<00:03:43.420> that

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
basically your starter pack I think that

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.240 
basically your starter pack I think that
by<00:03:43.630> now<00:03:43.780> them<00:03:43.989> really<00:03:44.290> didn't<00:03:44.560> sell<00:03:44.769> so<00:03:45.220> I

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
by now them really didn't sell so I

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.590 
by now them really didn't sell so I
think<00:03:45.340> I'm<00:03:45.549> going<00:03:45.700> to<00:03:45.760> probably<00:03:45.940> discard<00:03:46.450> them

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
think I'm going to probably discard them

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.870 
think I'm going to probably discard them
or<00:03:46.780> sell<00:03:47.560> them<00:03:47.590> a<00:03:47.769> little<00:03:47.920> bit<00:03:48.100> cheaper<00:03:48.489> and

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
or sell them a little bit cheaper and

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.729 
or sell them a little bit cheaper and
it's<00:03:49.359> just<00:03:49.540> weird<00:03:49.840> like<00:03:49.959> a<00:03:50.109> player<00:03:50.410> like<00:03:50.470> that

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
it's just weird like a player like that

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.050 
it's just weird like a player like that
I<00:03:50.769> thought<00:03:51.069> would<00:03:51.280> be<00:03:51.340> worth<00:03:51.639> a<00:03:51.790> little<00:03:51.970> bit

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.580 
I thought would be worth a little bit
money<00:03:52.329> especially<00:03:52.510> now<00:03:52.840> a<00:03:52.870> shiny<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.440> he's

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.979 
money especially now a shiny and he's

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
literally worth nafal it's the areas you

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.589 
literally worth nafal it's the areas you
can<00:03:56.230> make<00:03:56.470> in<00:03:56.739> a<00:03:57.400> trade<00:03:57.850> so<00:03:58.180> I'm<00:03:58.269> going<00:03:58.480> to<00:03:58.540> just

from this play another one we picked up
I<00:04:46.389> think<00:04:46.569> that's<00:04:46.689> 850<00:04:47.589> coins<00:04:47.889> in<00:04:48.519> a<00:04:48.819> pore

00:04:48.989 --> 00:04:48.999 
I think that's 850 coins in a pore

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:51.209 
I think that's 850 coins in a pore
formation<00:04:49.149> but<00:04:49.659> still<00:04:49.959> I<00:04:50.139> mean<00:04:50.589> they<00:04:50.739> usually

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:51.219 
formation but still I mean they usually

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:54.629 
formation but still I mean they usually
sell<00:04:51.489> most<00:04:51.699> of<00:04:51.759> the<00:04:51.849> day<00:04:51.969> under<00:04:52.529> 1.6<00:04:53.529> 1.7<00:04:53.919> 1.8

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
sell most of the day under 1.6 1.7 1.8

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.419
