cut off their sight of you and they
won't<00:01:34.700> be<00:01:34.850> able<00:01:34.970> to<00:01:35.149> lock<00:01:35.330> on<00:01:35.619> this<00:01:36.619> tactic<00:01:37.130> is

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
won't be able to lock on this tactic is

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.889 
won't be able to lock on this tactic is
very<00:01:37.460> useful<00:01:37.880> against<00:01:38.090> helicopters<00:01:38.750> and

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
very useful against helicopters and

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.889 
very useful against helicopters and
ground<00:01:39.530> support<00:01:39.740> if<00:01:40.310> an<00:01:41.030> enemy<00:01:41.180> jet<00:01:41.539> is<00:01:41.660> trying

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
ground support if an enemy jet is trying

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.480 
ground support if an enemy jet is trying
to<00:01:41.990> lock<00:01:42.140> on<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:42.560> with<00:01:42.770> Heatseekers<00:01:43.310> your

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
to lock on to you with Heatseekers your

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.200 
to lock on to you with Heatseekers your
best<00:01:43.729> option<00:01:44.149> is<00:01:44.330> to<00:01:44.360> go<00:01:44.600> into<00:01:44.750> a<00:01:44.869> tight<00:01:45.170> turn

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
best option is to go into a tight turn

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.370 
best option is to go into a tight turn
alright<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:47.450> let's<00:01:47.600> say<00:01:47.750> you<00:01:47.780> can't<00:01:48.140> get<00:01:48.289> out

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
alright so let's say you can't get out

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.050 
alright so let's say you can't get out
of<00:01:48.500> sight<00:01:48.680> and<00:01:48.860> you<00:01:48.950> have<00:01:49.130> an<00:01:49.220> enemy<00:01:49.430> rocket

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
of sight and you have an enemy rocket

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.540 
of sight and you have an enemy rocket
headed<00:01:50.360> your<00:01:50.479> way<00:01:50.539> what<00:01:51.110> should<00:01:51.320> you<00:01:51.440> do<00:01:51.590> well

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
headed your way what should you do well

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.670 
headed your way what should you do well
I<00:01:52.580> found<00:01:52.910> if<00:01:53.180> you<00:01:53.300> bank<00:01:53.630> hard<00:01:53.930> left<00:01:54.320> or<00:01:54.500> right

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
I found if you bank hard left or right

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.830 
I found if you bank hard left or right
the<00:01:54.860> rocket<00:01:55.039> won't<00:01:55.490> be<00:01:55.700> able<00:01:55.850> to<00:01:56.030> file<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.570> fly

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
the rocket won't be able to file and fly

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.710 
the rocket won't be able to file and fly
right<00:01:56.869> past<00:01:57.320> you<00:01:57.970> this<00:01:58.970> maneuver<00:01:59.479> will<00:01:59.600> be

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
right past you this maneuver will be

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.270 
right past you this maneuver will be
kind<00:01:59.930> of<00:01:59.990> tricky<00:02:00.170> since<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:00.710> have<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:01.009> time<00:02:01.250> it

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
kind of tricky since you have to time it

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.910 
kind of tricky since you have to time it
right<00:02:01.429> if<00:02:01.880> you<00:02:02.390> bank<00:02:02.599> too<00:02:02.840> soon<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.500> rocket

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
right if you bank too soon the rocket

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.529 
right if you bank too soon the rocket
won't<00:02:04.160> need<00:02:04.429> to<00:02:04.580> turn<00:02:04.759> and<00:02:04.970> hit<00:02:05.090> you<00:02:05.240> straight

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
won't need to turn and hit you straight

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.020 
won't need to turn and hit you straight
on<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:05.929> if<00:02:06.349> you<00:02:06.470> bank<00:02:06.679> too<00:02:06.920> late<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.580> rocket

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
on and if you bank too late the rocket

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.089 
on and if you bank too late the rocket
will<00:02:08.179> still<00:02:08.390> hit<00:02:08.569> you<00:02:08.780> so<00:02:09.770> with<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:09.979> little

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
will still hit you so with a little

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.860 
will still hit you so with a little
practice<00:02:10.520> you<00:02:10.910> should<00:02:10.940> be<00:02:11.270> able<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:11.660> avoid

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
practice you should be able to avoid

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.990 
practice you should be able to avoid
most<00:02:12.140> Rockets<00:02:12.650> as<00:02:12.830> soon<00:02:13.430> as<00:02:13.550> you<00:02:13.670> hear<00:02:13.819> the
