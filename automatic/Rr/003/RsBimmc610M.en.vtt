most anything you can click on first
we'll<00:00:22.170> start<00:00:22.410> with<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.769> copy<00:00:23.099> and<00:00:23.429> paste

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
we'll start with the copy and paste

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.359 
we'll start with the copy and paste
keyboard<00:00:24.510> commands<00:00:24.869> now<00:00:25.380> first<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.890> all<00:00:25.949> let's

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
keyboard commands now first of all let's

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.910 
keyboard commands now first of all let's
locate<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:27.090> keys<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:28.199> your<00:00:28.349> keyboard<00:00:28.529> on

the far lower left you're going to want

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.720 
the far lower left you're going to want
to<00:00:30.779> locate<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.320> command<00:00:31.679> key<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.460> you're

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
to locate the command key and you're

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.580 
to locate the command key and you're
going<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.910> use<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.330> combination<00:00:33.990> with<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
going to use it in combination with the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.270 
going to use it in combination with the
C<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.220> the<00:00:35.670> V<00:00:35.940> key<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.810> command<00:00:37.290> C<00:00:37.680> that

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
C and the V key so command C that

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.550 
C and the V key so command C that
keyboard<00:00:38.490> combination<00:00:39.210> does<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> copy<00:00:40.050> command

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
keyboard combination does a copy command

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.490 
keyboard combination does a copy command
and<00:00:40.740> command<00:00:41.370> V<00:00:41.520> does<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.060> paste<00:00:42.420> command<00:00:42.900> and

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
and command V does a paste command and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.440 
and command V does a paste command and
let's<00:00:43.710> see<00:00:43.860> how<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.310> looks<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:45.060> action

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
let's see how this looks like in action

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.090 
let's see how this looks like in action
so<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.960> first<00:00:46.170> scenario<00:00:46.440> we're<00:00:46.770> gonna<00:00:46.860> look

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
so the first scenario we're gonna look

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.820 
so the first scenario we're gonna look
at<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.490> how<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.760> copy<00:00:48.150> text<00:00:48.720> so<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.470> text

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
at is how to copy text so I have a text

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.650 
at is how to copy text so I have a text
file<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.220> on<00:00:50.370> my<00:00:50.490> desktop<00:00:50.910> I'm<00:00:51.420> going<00:00:51.570> to

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
file here on my desktop I'm going to

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.810 
file here on my desktop I'm going to
open<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.020> up<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.380> I've<00:00:53.070> got<00:00:53.100> some<00:00:53.430> sample<00:00:53.790> text

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
open it up and I've got some sample text

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.090 
open it up and I've got some sample text
in<00:00:54.210> here<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.570> maybe<00:00:55.080> I<00:00:55.200> want<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.560> copy<00:00:55.770> this

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.700 
be in the same file or a separate file
another<00:01:29.729> scenario<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.359> can<00:01:30.509> look<00:01:30.689> at<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.049> to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
another scenario we can look at is to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.090 
another scenario we can look at is to
copy<00:01:32.009> text<00:01:32.490> from<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:33.119> website<00:01:33.560> into<00:01:34.560> maybe<00:01:35.009> a

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
let's take a look and pull up Safari and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.739 
let's take a look and pull up Safari and
we'll<00:01:40.170> pull<00:01:40.439> up<00:01:40.469> a<00:01:41.149> website<00:01:42.149> that's<00:01:42.329> got<00:01:42.539> some
