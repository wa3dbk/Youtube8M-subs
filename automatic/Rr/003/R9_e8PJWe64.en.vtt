00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 a wonderful morning and good morning 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.960
 welcome you love youtuber yes it 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.450
 Let's go and what is going on today? 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.030
 show you today the nuke dimap the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.040
 atom bomb as you want it in call of 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.109
 Duty big yes that's actually true 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.199
 you see how it plays here on the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.119
 card strikes and it is somehow 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.289
 possible this nuke this ear like it 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.210
 always wanted to have under certain 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.340
 circumstances to get call of duty 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.750
 Ghost and that is the first circumstance 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.269
 is for example only on certain 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.560
 cards in this case strikes and what 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.059
 had to make her this is first time 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.980
 following you can you your colleagues 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.899
 sees the blue suitcase and what makes 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.239
 Here you get the blue suitcase 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.980
 right now in the blue suitcase is now 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.420
 a certain order you have to do 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.610
 In my case, they reach you 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.110
 finish with her second the weapon like that 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.789
 My colleague is guaranteed to be guaranteed 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.440
 zack zack slipped away again and you 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.910
 have the supplies as they are under right in 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.340
 The corner looks so if you stock this 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.410
 you will see them around the statue 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.090
 So somewhere around the city in the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.550
 near the statue like that and now 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.309
 happened to her waiting sakes that 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.350
 structure and there comes the packet too 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.339
 already flown parcel is down and 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.630
 what is inside 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.400
 the krm atomic nuclear strike we have 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.549
 Do you want to see the ad below 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.280
 flashes the atomic bomb is detonated around the 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.560
 opponent is ready to be analyzed 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.880
 that's what you look like and you see shot here 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.340
 everything goes to waste 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.680
 all enemies are dead only you survived 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.080
 yes the blow I'll say that 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.850
 atomic strike and sees the map is 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.310
 no longer recognizing the whole 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.229
 map is in ruins 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.420
 the card is up in this case too 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.500
 a level she is really absolute 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.960
 no longer recognizing what 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.270
 Funny is the whole building supporting one 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.320
 only the flames while standing quite clear what 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.869
 no little fun 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.970
 You see a completely new quark map 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.680
 I have almost and yes pretty much 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.509
 pretty horny of these clothes underneath 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.579
 certain circumstances I just got it 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.710
 told to tell me why always have 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.850
 I want to know how it works and yes 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.780
 It was now on this first 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.909
 map 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.590
 we come to the second card on the 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.049
 second card works that one 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.190
 a little different, it's not an atomic one 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.709
 nuclear strike but there it is more so yes 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.630
 a small satellite crash I say 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.160
 Here's how it goes on the map 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.560
 sincerely sorry, it is here 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.920
 no atomic atomic strike no newcomer 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.940
 still pretty cool what I think I am 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.550
 said it is only under certain 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.230
 circumstances on certain cards in 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.300
 you already have this case strike 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.750
 The atomic bomb seen really cool 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.390
 made 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.250
 Jesus was not a nuclear bomb but a monster 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.320
 satellite crash asked by 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.880
 satellite crash what you will see 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.370
 to grab the suitcase again 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.110
 a graduation from behind so my colleague 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.170
 is already faster this time because times 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.390
 just here in the paper with nice 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.100
 the rule does not matter 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.140
 In any case, you must now 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.060
 stockpile here around the totem 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.940
 Not memorized in the dead in the Rhine 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.330
 which the supplies should be around 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.010
 how the supplies then land 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.690
 Shit is her stocks fall 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.769
 Saxony is still in death and it is 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.810
 actually do not care 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.549
 you have the satellite crash like that 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.070
 that's probably what you're asking 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.079
 I'm sorry, I hope it's something 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.420
 the satellite is so worth protecting 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.829
 is now nothing pressed 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.209
 I've already happened 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.950
 asked what's going on, if still 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.600
 nothing happens, however, friends 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.280
 however, look at you right away 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.079
 that's the thing I'm exactly right now 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.430
 happens you ask yourself and run 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.440
 now so much about it 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.670
 Also , what's happening is what I see 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.310
 pretty cool if you find happiness have 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.600
 was standing there maybe get 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.489
 opponent maybe the one or 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.420
 other opponents where you then smell the 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.060
 nice here 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.060
 here look at the total destruction 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.680
 where the satellite is hit if 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.870
 the opponents of the long run because they just 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.709
 have this question or something else can 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.380
 you maybe one or the other 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.750
 Get caught with it and very, very 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.209
 So I hope you liked it yes 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.010
 I hope you sorry the video comments 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.160
 is and so much fun pure skin and up 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.160
 to the next
