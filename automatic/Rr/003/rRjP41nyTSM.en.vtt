to<00:00:06.010> a<00:00:06.400> good<00:00:06.609> year<00:00:06.850> having<00:00:07.210> fun<00:00:07.420> riding<00:00:07.630> my<00:00:07.810> bike

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.050 
to a good year having fun riding my bike

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.020 
to a good year having fun riding my bike
and<00:00:08.230> I<00:00:08.320> ended<00:00:08.950> up<00:00:09.070> doing<00:00:09.130> real<00:00:09.490> good<00:00:09.519> this<00:00:09.790> year
