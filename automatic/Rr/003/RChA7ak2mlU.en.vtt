it's a Z 750s this is I only made this
bike<00:00:11.820> for<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.059> couple<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.450> years<00:00:12.679> really<00:00:13.679> great

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
bike for a couple of years really great

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.799 
bike for a couple of years really great
bikes<00:00:14.160> an<00:00:14.400> inline<00:00:14.820> four-cylinder<00:00:15.120> motor

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
bikes an inline four-cylinder motor

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.130 
bikes an inline four-cylinder motor
fuel-injected<00:00:16.970> nice<00:00:17.970> power<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.690> motor<00:00:18.960> in

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
fuel-injected nice power the motor in

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.230 
fuel-injected nice power the motor in
this<00:00:19.289> bike<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.859> essentially<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.789> same<00:00:20.970> motor

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
this bike is essentially the same motor

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.230 
this bike is essentially the same motor
it<00:00:21.390> was<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> z1000<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.039> era<00:00:23.340> but<00:00:24.000> a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
it was in the z1000 of this era but a

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.390 
it was in the z1000 of this era but a
smaller<00:00:24.570> displacement<00:00:24.930> 750<00:00:25.920> instead<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.340> a

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
smaller displacement 750 instead of a

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.330 
smaller displacement 750 instead of a
1000<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.840> just<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.140> really<00:00:28.439> great<00:00:28.619> bike<00:00:28.949> very

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
1000 so just a really great bike very

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.269 
1000 so just a really great bike very
smooth<00:00:29.760> some<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> early<00:00:31.019> z7s<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.949> like<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
smooth some of the early z7s is like the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.209 
smooth some of the early z7s is like the
2000<00:00:32.790> ones<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.360> twos<00:00:33.630> i<00:00:33.899> think<00:00:34.170> we're<00:00:35.100> an

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
2000 ones and twos i think we're an

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.979 
2000 ones and twos i think we're an
air-cooled<00:00:35.700> motor<00:00:36.090> this<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.570> different

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
air-cooled motor this is a different

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.020 
air-cooled motor this is a different
motor<00:00:37.190> this<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.370> liquid<00:00:38.760> cooled

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
motor this is liquid cooled

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.819 
motor this is liquid cooled
fuel-injected

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
fuel-injected

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.580 
fuel-injected
much<00:00:41.340> more<00:00:41.550> modern<00:00:42.030> motor<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:43.140> bikes<00:00:43.410> in

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
much more modern motor this bikes in

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.680 
much more modern motor this bikes in
really<00:00:43.829> nice<00:00:44.010> shape<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.460> has<00:00:44.520> about<00:00:44.730> 22,000

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
really nice shape it has about 22,000

miles<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.320> believe<00:00:46.410> we'll<00:00:46.860> look<00:00:46.950> at<00:00:47.100> that

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
miles on it I believe we'll look at that

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.490 
miles on it I believe we'll look at that
no<00:00:47.579> 16,000<00:00:48.480> miles<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.809> believe<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:49.230> we'll<00:00:49.350> look
