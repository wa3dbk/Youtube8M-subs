00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
stem and it was extremely painful we

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.350 
stem and it was extremely painful we
finally<00:00:36.310> figured<00:00:36.520> out<00:00:36.700> a<00:00:36.760> way<00:00:36.940> to<00:00:37.000> get<00:00:37.239> it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360

together<00:00:37.660> but<00:00:37.989> it<00:00:38.260> was<00:00:38.500> not<00:00:38.739> easy<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:43.510> tried<00:00:43.780> to

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
together but it was not easy we tried to

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.920 
together but it was not easy we tried to
figure<00:00:44.230> out<00:00:44.320> a<00:00:44.410> way<00:00:44.470> to<00:00:44.559> put<00:00:44.830> the<00:00:45.059> stern<00:00:46.059> on<00:00:46.300> but

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.760 
figure out a way to put the stern on but
it<00:00:47.080> wasn't<00:00:47.440> working<00:00:47.620> well<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:50.440> we<00:00:50.590> took<00:00:50.710> a

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
it wasn't working well so we took a

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:58.490 
it wasn't working well so we took a
little<00:00:50.920> break<00:00:51.070> and<00:00:52.650> came<00:00:53.650> back<00:00:53.890> to<00:00:54.100> it<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
little break and came back to it and

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.530 
little break and came back to it and
just<00:00:59.500> went<00:00:59.680> for<00:00:59.829> it<00:01:00.040> and<00:01:00.220> I<00:01:00.940> ended<00:01:01.210> up<00:01:01.300> looking

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
just went for it and I ended up looking

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.450 
just went for it and I ended up looking
pretty<00:01:01.720> good<00:01:04.470> cow<00:01:05.470> came<00:01:05.770> up<00:01:05.890> with<00:01:06.009> the<00:01:06.070> idea<00:01:06.369> of

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
pretty good cow came up with the idea of

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.889 
pretty good cow came up with the idea of
putting<00:01:06.700> some<00:01:06.910> of<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.090> bulkheads<00:01:07.600> in<00:01:07.750> there

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
putting some of the bulkheads in there

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:09.570 
putting some of the bulkheads in there
to<00:01:08.020> kind<00:01:08.140> of<00:01:08.229> hold<00:01:08.410> it<00:01:08.530> apart<00:01:08.830> and<00:01:09.130> it<00:01:09.280> really

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
to kind of hold it apart and it really

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:19.620 
to kind of hold it apart and it really
helped<00:01:09.910> a<00:01:09.970> lot<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:18.520> measured<00:01:18.880> out<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.210> three

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
helped a lot we measured out the three

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.109 
helped a lot we measured out the three
four<00:01:20.110> bulkheads<00:01:20.649> and<00:01:20.860> put<00:01:21.280> those<00:01:21.430> in<00:01:21.670> and<00:01:22.000> it

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
four bulkheads and put those in and it

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.580 
four bulkheads and put those in and it
really<00:01:22.240> started<00:01:22.690> shaping<00:01:23.050> up<00:01:23.170> real<00:01:23.680> nicely<00:01:25.590> we

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
really started shaping up real nicely we

00:01:26.590 --> 00:02:04.660 
really started shaping up real nicely we
ran<00:01:27.430> out<00:01:27.610> of<00:01:27.700> copper<00:01:28.090> ties<00:01:29.130> about<00:01:30.130> this<00:01:30.399> point

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.959 

no<00:02:06.490> ordered<00:02:07.490> pizza<00:02:07.909> and<00:02:07.940> head<00:02:08.660> there
