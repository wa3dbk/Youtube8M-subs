00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello as youtube a review of samsung 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.309
 6 58 30 years and short violence when 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.320
 closed the procedure applications 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.639
 it's very simple basically with this 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.099
 we achieve is that the telephone work 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.690
 little bit faster because if we have 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.640
 many applications working in the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.990
 background that are consuming process 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.580
 they are building memory and they make 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.200
 telecom our slowest 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.000
 the procedure is very simple but 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.840
 he invited them again to subscribe to me 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.580
 channel if they have not done it here police and 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.559
 are watching the following video that 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.180
 I will teach you how to force application is 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.460
 one thing develops applications and others 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.690
 force closure as there are applications 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.850
 that has been one closes with this 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.090
 procedure that they will do with some 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.680
 active processes and that's why we have to make an effort 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.440
 social the procedure is very simple 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.870
 let's give a saying and button the center 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.400
 here we can see the applications that 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.110
 we have recently used and that 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.199
 they are consuming resources and are 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.659
 activated for example let's keep in mind 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.309
 those who are here quickly and to 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.070
 close the two machines we give 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.970
 they want task manager 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.980
 immediately here we can see the 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.810
 applications that are active tells me 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.880
 that I have three active applications that 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.190
 they are consuming ram and they are 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.110
 consuming soon cpu in this case this 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.060
 is consuming ram and so I want 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.220
 stop it just by clicking on the 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.680
 I want to have a job and click in order 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.420
 and that way I close it what is not 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.869
 activating more if you wanted to make them behind 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.420
 very finite in that way is already closed 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.800
 these applications we are going to return 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.580
 let's click again here in the 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.590
 and they see starting center again for 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.630
 the task manager of the 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.250
 active applications if left 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.860
 definitely eliminate them completely 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.350
 it can also be ram type and I give 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.119
 delete memory and that way it tells me 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.160
 here will be eight applications that 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.040
 they're working in the background and that 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.320
 way since I already have more slowly in 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.090
 I have a little bit that can run a 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.979
 a little bit faster in the case that there is not 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.920
 help to open a heavier application 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.420
 for example a game or something like that in your 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.979
 method for this video thank you very much for 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.110
 watch the video if they are pending 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.330
 next video in which they come 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.060
 how to force the applications to close 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.680
 of applications so force 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.300
 there are some that let us be very 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.459
 easily so play hard 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.459
 close thank you very much for the video
