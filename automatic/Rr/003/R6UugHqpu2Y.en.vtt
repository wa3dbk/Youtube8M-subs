over<00:06:06.240> below<00:06:06.780> this<00:06:06.960> temperature<00:06:07.170> was

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
over below this temperature was

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.850 
over below this temperature was
collected<00:06:08.280> in<00:06:08.400> the<00:06:08.490> beaker<00:06:08.640> and<00:06:08.850> discarded

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
collected in the beaker and discarded

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.110 
collected in the beaker and discarded
there<00:06:10.860> might<00:06:11.100> be<00:06:11.130> a<00:06:11.310> little<00:06:11.730> bit<00:06:11.850> of<00:06:11.940> water

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
there might be a little bit of water

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.140 
there might be a little bit of water
that<00:06:12.300> comes<00:06:12.690> over<00:06:13.080> with<00:06:13.350> the<00:06:13.470> product<00:06:13.890> if<00:06:14.150> you

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
that comes over with the product if you

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.700 
that comes over with the product if you
are<00:06:15.180> worried<00:06:15.690> about<00:06:15.720> any<00:06:16.080> water<00:06:16.410> in<00:06:16.620> your

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
are worried about any water in your

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.530 
are worried about any water in your
product<00:06:17.130> you<00:06:17.280> should<00:06:17.310> dry<00:06:17.730> it<00:06:17.790> before<00:06:18.030> the

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
product you should dry it before the

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.880 
product you should dry it before the
distillation<00:06:18.960> with<00:06:19.350> something<00:06:19.710> like

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
distillation with something like

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.300 
distillation with something like
magnesium<00:06:20.490> sulfate<00:06:21.680> final<00:06:22.680> product<00:06:23.040> was<00:06:23.160> then

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
magnesium sulfate final product was then

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.160 
magnesium sulfate final product was then
poured<00:06:23.580> from<00:06:23.790> the<00:06:23.940> collecting<00:06:24.300> flask<00:06:24.570> into<00:06:25.140> a

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.170 
poured from the collecting flask into a

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.650 
poured from the collecting flask into a
DRAM<00:06:25.500> vial<00:06:25.940> the<00:06:26.940> final<00:06:27.270> product<00:06:27.540> is<00:06:27.630> very

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 
DRAM vial the final product is very

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.530 
DRAM vial the final product is very
strong<00:06:28.170> candy<00:06:28.620> banana<00:06:28.950> odor<00:06:29.250> but<00:06:29.880> remember<00:06:30.330> it

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
strong candy banana odor but remember it

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.730 
strong candy banana odor but remember it
was<00:06:30.660> made<00:06:30.810> in<00:06:30.900> the<00:06:30.990> lab<00:06:31.170> so<00:06:31.500> you<00:06:31.530> should

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
was made in the lab so you should

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.770 
was made in the lab so you should
definitely<00:06:32.250> not<00:06:32.430> eat<00:06:32.670> it<00:06:32.820> or<00:06:32.970> even<00:06:33.330> try<00:06:33.600> it

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
definitely not eat it or even try it

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.680 
definitely not eat it or even try it
I<00:06:33.930> also<00:06:34.920> took<00:06:35.070> an<00:06:35.280> h<00:06:35.430> NMR<00:06:35.850> which<00:06:36.150> was<00:06:36.330> actually

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
I also took an h NMR which was actually

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.840 
I also took an h NMR which was actually
quite<00:06:36.930> clean<00:06:37.320> and<00:06:37.560> I<00:06:37.770> labeled<00:06:38.100> each<00:06:38.310> peak<00:06:38.640> with

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:38.850 
quite clean and I labeled each peak with

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:48.040 
quite clean and I labeled each peak with
the<00:06:38.940> corresponding<00:06:39.720> hydrogen

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.110
