my<00:00:46.050> start<00:00:46.469> making<00:00:46.710> my<00:00:46.890> cursors<00:00:47.309> as<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.520> can

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
my start making my cursors as you can

my start making my cursors as you can
see<00:00:47.820> there's<00:00:48.809> one<00:00:48.960> strategy<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.379> beats<00:00:49.649> this

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
see there's one strategy that beats this

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.090 
see there's one strategy that beats this
which<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.430> timing<00:00:50.730> boys<00:00:51.000> from<00:00:51.270> Tran<00:00:51.570> and

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
which is timing boys from Tran and

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.130 
which is timing boys from Tran and
because<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:53.370> no<00:00:53.520> sellouts<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.870> I

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
because you have no sellouts but if I I

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.779 
because you have no sellouts but if I I
usually<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:55.800> i'm<00:00:55.920> doing<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.190> strategy<00:00:56.579> and

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
usually if i'm doing the strategy and

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.540 
usually if i'm doing the strategy and
their<00:00:57.480> timing<00:00:57.750> pushing<00:00:58.020> me<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.320> just<00:00:58.620> retreat

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
their timing pushing me I just retreat

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
and that usually works but sometimes I

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.390

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
more but I replace like two gateways

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.859 
more but I replace like two gateways
replaced<00:01:32.280> by<00:01:32.490> my<00:01:32.640> Stargate<00:01:33.060> because<00:01:33.509> that

gets<00:02:03.440> boring<00:02:03.800> after<00:02:03.890> a<00:02:04.160> while<00:02:05.890> I'm<00:02:06.890> going<00:02:07.160> to

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
gets boring after a while I'm going to

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.160 
gets boring after a while I'm going to
us<00:02:07.430> they're<00:02:07.700> technically<00:02:08.420> as<00:02:08.510> I<00:02:08.540> stared<00:02:08.900> so<00:02:09.080> if

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
us they're technically as I stared so if

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.780 
us they're technically as I stared so if
I<00:02:09.260> should<00:02:09.470> get<00:02:09.530> my<00:02:09.590> fourth<00:02:10.010> and<00:02:10.310> hopefully
