 district of the pallars sobirÃ  in the Pyrenees 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.510

 bravas most emblematic Europe a 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.339
 unique natural environment a stable flow 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.049
 to navigate throughout the year and a 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.149
 travel with different stretches of 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.300
 difficulty are the elements that 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.370
 they make so special 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.200
 the rafting came to the nola pallaresa 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:19.660
 in 1986 that is 28 years ago to what 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.730
 throughout this period this river has had 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.650
 an indispensable protagonist who has 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.560
 done enjoy this activity with 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.410
 safety and a lot of humor the water guide 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.570
 bravas today in evasion we show you the 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.780
 two generations that have lived and are 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.330
 still living the world of rafting I love you 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.870
 since the year 89 going down the river in a 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.810
 experience of about 25 years or so 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.510
 and I started I started here and here and I continued 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.210
 in the year I think it was 98 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.450
 I had about 4000 passes now we are 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.600
 in 2014, then calculation of 12 thousand 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.780
 13 thousand descents comes out an average more 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.440
 or less about 400 500 downloads per 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.440
 season 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.780
 I am born here in the area of 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.849
 Pyrenees in the same south and I carry all my 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.760
 life doing this basically from the 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.980
 Four years and I took 10 years of this monitor 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.099
 It's my tenth season and with many 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.080
 wanting to do 10 more is a is a 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.090
 hard work that requires a state 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.489
 good physical people have a concept 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.890
 that doing this job you put on 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.390
 way I always say the opposite 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.050
 you have to be in shape to be able to 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.700
 do this work the beginnings were 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.510
 pretty good but at the same time quite 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.660
 euros since there was no previous experience 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.610
 of the river the sport was imported by 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.650
 French people formerly 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.209
 He practiced this sport out for 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.640
 passion to sport for passion to the in the 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.610
 zone the old glories have a value 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.680
 added that it was doing a sport that 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.690
 nobody could explain the new 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.549
 generations we have the experience of 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.110
 we old people have books we have 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.150
 explanations we have videos 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.519
 formerly the first person who came down 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.970
 by this river he bought a boat in france 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.460
 and he threw himself into the adventure with the step of 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.460
 over the years we have been acquiring 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.830
 technique we have changed criteria with 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.320
 other guides things that at the beginning 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.540
 I spent the things you had to 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.540
 discover practically ortiz himself 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.730
 some fine boats of the people came down 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.370
 here with marine flowers first stone and 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.959
 they sank and they had to adapt 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.010
 the material to the activity they wanted 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:53.500
 do now the materials are much more 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.230
 rigid much lighter much more 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.239
 easy to carry because of the 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.580
 experiences of the people who carry more 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.769
 of 20 years doing rafting we can 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.019
 draw some conclusions to be able 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.060
 streamline and make more secure and more 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.510
 fun what is the activity of the 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.510
 rafting 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.760
 currently the new generation of 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.800
 sportsmen like it a lot 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.480
 specialize in a sport and with the 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.520
 ease that we have of displacements 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.930
 after doing season here they have 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.410
 much ease to go to work in 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.410
 other areas 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.520
 apart from being our profession it is 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.360
 our hobby and that perhaps is the most 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.529
 difficult to combine this sport 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.829
 as work 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:40.459
 I hope to reach 70 years continuing 

00:04:36.829 --> 00:04:44.980
 practicing kayak the rating that removes me 

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:46.840
 Tired a little more but the kayak 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.199
 I hope to get to 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.830
 at 70 years old by continuing to practice this 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:55.610
 sport that both 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.610
 I filled
