and<00:00:01.410> goes<00:00:01.589> native<00:00:01.920> potato<00:00:02.399> and<00:00:03.319> basically

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
and goes native potato and basically

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:05.809 
and goes native potato and basically
I've<00:00:04.500> just<00:00:04.680> been<00:00:04.859> experimenting<00:00:05.790> with

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
I've just been experimenting with

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.330 
I've just been experimenting with
Minecraft<00:00:08.540> looking<00:00:09.540> around<00:00:09.719> with<00:00:10.050> files<00:00:10.889> and

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
Minecraft looking around with files and

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.200 
Minecraft looking around with files and
textures<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:11.969> stuff<00:00:12.179> just<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:13.080> kind<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.530> see

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.210 
textures and stuff just to kind of see

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.930 
textures and stuff just to kind of see
what<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.330> would<00:00:15.389> be<00:00:15.450> like<00:00:15.570> if<00:00:16.139> deserts<00:00:16.770> had

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
what it would be like if deserts had

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.279 
what it would be like if deserts had
sandstorms<00:00:17.940> because<00:00:18.210> that's<00:00:18.930> one<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.230> the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
sandstorms because that's one of the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.630 
sandstorms because that's one of the
things<00:00:19.320> about<00:00:19.500> Minecraft<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.220> really

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
things about Minecraft that really

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.300 
things about Minecraft that really
annoys<00:00:20.910> me<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.720> um<00:00:21.930> yeah<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.769> have<00:00:23.010> rain

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
annoys me is that um yeah you have rain

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.820 
annoys me is that um yeah you have rain
and<00:00:23.550> snow<00:00:23.880> but<00:00:23.910> if<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.320> happens<00:00:25.619> while

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
and snow but if that happens while

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.220 
and snow but if that happens while
you're<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.220> desert<00:00:26.400> or<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.849> get<00:00:26.970> is

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
you're in the desert or you get is

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.689 
you're in the desert or you get is
suddenly<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.439> sky<00:00:28.710> turns<00:00:29.010> black<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.429> you

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
suddenly the sky turns black and you

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.670 
suddenly the sky turns black and you
can't<00:00:29.910> see<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.210> Sun<00:00:30.510> it's<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.109> weird<00:00:31.730> so

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
can't see the Sun it's just weird so

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.010 
can't see the Sun it's just weird so
yeah<00:00:34.680> they<00:00:34.860> need<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.309> put<00:00:35.550> sand<00:00:35.910> storms<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
yeah they need to put sand storms in the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.619 
yeah they need to put sand storms in the
vanilla<00:00:37.410> but<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.489> was<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.180> playing<00:00:39.510> around

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
vanilla but I was just playing around

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.130 
vanilla but I was just playing around
trying<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.079> see<00:00:40.320> what<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.649> would<00:00:40.739> look<00:00:40.920> like

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
trying to see what it would look like

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.930 
trying to see what it would look like
basically<00:00:43.140> I've<00:00:43.260> retextured<00:00:43.920> snow<00:00:44.250> too<00:00:44.610> hugs

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
basically I've retextured snow too hugs

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.330 
basically I've retextured snow too hugs
and<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:46.110> these<00:00:46.379> are<00:00:46.500> actually<00:00:46.710> snow<00:00:47.039> balls

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
and and these are actually snow balls

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.150 
and and these are actually snow balls
which<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:48.110> made<00:00:49.110> look<00:00:49.289> like<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> little<00:00:49.829> pile<00:00:50.129> of

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
which I made look like a little pile of

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.479 
which I made look like a little pile of
sand<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.629> handful<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.050> sand<00:00:52.489> well

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
sand so it's just a handful of sand well

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.709 
sand so it's just a handful of sand well
it's<00:00:53.670> actually<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:54.030> snowball<00:00:56.270> the<00:00:57.270> basically

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
it's actually a snowball the basically

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.049 
it's actually a snowball the basically
San<00:00:58.079> should<00:00:58.289> just<00:00:58.590> act<00:00:58.800> exactly<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.609> snow

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
San should just act exactly like snow

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.219 
San should just act exactly like snow
you<00:01:00.390> know<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:00.719> blowing<00:01:01.289> around<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> air

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
you know it's blowing around in the air

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.410 
you know it's blowing around in the air
you<00:01:04.229> can<00:01:04.379> dig<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.070> pick<00:01:05.309> up<00:01:05.489> little

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
you can dig it up and pick up little

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:14.410 
you can dig it up and pick up little
handfuls<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.470> sand<00:01:10.670> do<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.820> wave<00:01:12.030> crippled

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
handfuls of sand do this wave crippled

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.490 
handfuls of sand do this wave crippled
so<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.689> should<00:01:15.869> sort<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.650> collect<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:18.500> solid

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
so it should sort of collect on solid

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.080 
so it should sort of collect on solid
blocks<00:01:19.830> if<00:01:20.100> there's<00:01:20.280> nothing<00:01:20.549> above<00:01:20.790> them

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
blocks if there's nothing above them

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.420 
blocks if there's nothing above them
just<00:01:21.509> there's<00:01:22.020> all<00:01:22.229> thin<00:01:22.619> layers<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.159> sand

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
just there's all thin layers of sand

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.170 
just there's all thin layers of sand
which<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.720> dig<00:01:24.900> up<00:01:25.020> give<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.500> little

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
which if you dig up give you little

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.480 
which if you dig up give you little
endless<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.659> achieve<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:28.200> craft<00:01:29.100> into<00:01:29.340> a

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
endless and to achieve in craft into a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.140 
endless and to achieve in craft into a
block<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.240> sand<00:01:33.259> so<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.290> should<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:35.700> like

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
block of sand so it should be just like

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.819 
block of sand so it should be just like
that<00:01:36.470> this<00:01:37.470> text<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.100> dumb<00:01:39.140> from<00:01:40.140> it's

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
that this text is just dumb from it's

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.350 
that this text is just dumb from it's
like<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> snow<00:01:41.310> texture<00:01:41.759> when<00:01:41.850> snow<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.180> going

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
like the snow texture when snow is going

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.510 
like the snow texture when snow is going
over<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.720> side<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.140> block<00:01:43.409> because<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
over the side of a block because the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.340 
over the side of a block because the
snows<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.299> top<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.720> bear<00:01:45.930> said<00:01:46.200> it's

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
snows on top of a bear said it's

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.460 
snows on top of a bear said it's
actually<00:01:46.770> sand<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.549> live<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.540> desert<00:01:48.840> it'll

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
actually sand I live in a desert it'll

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.039 
actually sand I live in a desert it'll
be<00:01:49.890> sand<00:01:50.310> not<00:01:50.610> dirt<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.329> won't<00:01:51.570> get<00:01:51.840> this

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
be sand not dirt so you won't get this

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.350 
be sand not dirt so you won't get this
so<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.530> won't<00:01:52.710> really<00:01:52.890> matter<00:01:53.189> it'll<00:01:54.090> just

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
so that won't really matter it'll just

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.560 
so that won't really matter it'll just
be<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.590> this<00:01:55.610> in<00:01:56.610> here<00:01:56.969> there<00:01:57.210> won't<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.450> any

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
be like this in here there won't be any

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.090 
be like this in here there won't be any
brown<00:01:58.259> shine<00:01:58.740> they've<00:01:59.549> dirt<00:01:59.850> or<00:02:00.180> anything<00:02:01.100> not

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
brown shine they've dirt or anything not

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.800 
brown shine they've dirt or anything not
sure<00:02:02.219> why<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.399> retextured<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.540> to

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
sure why I retextured that but just to

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.770 
sure why I retextured that but just to
sort<00:02:03.960> of

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
sort of

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.160 
sort of
so<00:02:05.680> it<00:02:05.740> looks<00:02:05.799> better<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:07.450> was<00:02:07.600> annoying<00:02:07.840> doing

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
so it looks better it was annoying doing

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.680 
so it looks better it was annoying doing
it<00:02:08.259> before<00:02:08.350> with<00:02:08.740> um<00:02:08.979> like<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:10.090> dirt<00:02:10.270> starting

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
it before with um like the dirt starting

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.360 
it before with um like the dirt starting
on<00:02:10.810> PA<00:02:11.050> because<00:02:11.650> i<00:02:11.709> mock<00:02:11.860> up<00:02:12.010> there<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:12.280> it

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
on PA because i mock up there and it

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.580 
on PA because i mock up there and it
just<00:02:12.520> seemed<00:02:12.700> brown<00:02:12.970> everyone<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:14.350> didn't

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
basically retextured rain to look like

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.360 
basically retextured rain to look like
sand<00:02:23.770> blowing<00:02:24.280> sort<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.290> i<00:02:26.290> basically<00:02:27.250> just

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
sand blowing sort of i basically just

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.130 
sand blowing sort of i basically just
got<00:02:27.580> snow<00:02:27.910> texture<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.510> made<00:02:28.630> its<00:02:28.810> and

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
got snow texture and made its and

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.040 
got snow texture and made its and
collagen<00:02:29.709> made<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.340> little<00:02:30.489> denser<00:02:31.000> like<00:02:31.510> copy

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
collagen made a little denser like copy

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.140 
collagen made a little denser like copy
and<00:02:32.260> pasted<00:02:32.560> it<00:02:32.650> over<00:02:32.950> itself<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.730> place<00:02:36.940> the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
and pasted it over itself and place the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.000 
and pasted it over itself and place the
rain<00:02:37.420> sound<00:02:37.930> with<00:02:38.170> sound<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.709> wind<00:02:39.220> blowing

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
rain sound with sound of wind blowing

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.350 
rain sound with sound of wind blowing
some<00:02:42.750> yeah<00:02:43.750> said<00:02:44.050> it's<00:02:44.430> sinful<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.700> 20<00:02:46.150> it

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
some yeah said it's sinful to 20 it

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.699 
some yeah said it's sinful to 20 it
should<00:02:46.570> be<00:02:46.720> sure<00:02:48.600> in<00:02:49.600> an<00:02:49.750> actual<00:02:50.019> San<00:02:50.350> song

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
should be sure in an actual San song

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.610 
should be sure in an actual San song
like<00:02:51.220> if<00:02:51.940> they<00:02:52.600> did<00:02:52.750> actually<00:02:52.930> do<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.440> it

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
like if they did actually do it it

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.500 
like if they did actually do it it
should<00:02:53.800> be<00:02:53.830> really<00:02:54.280> really<00:02:54.400> short<00:02:54.819> sort<00:02:55.420> of

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
should be really really short sort of

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.979 
should be really really short sort of
you<00:02:56.350> know<00:02:56.459> make<00:02:57.459> it<00:02:57.610> hard<00:02:57.819> to<00:02:57.940> see<00:02:58.239> very<00:02:58.720> far

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
you know make it hard to see very far

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.920 
you know make it hard to see very far
should<00:02:59.830> be<00:02:59.890> like<00:03:00.040> half<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.580> tiny<00:03:00.819> distance<00:03:01.150> no

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
should be like half the tiny distance no

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.660 
should be like half the tiny distance no
matter<00:03:02.140> what<00:03:02.410> setting<00:03:02.860> you've<00:03:03.130> actually<00:03:03.310> got

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
matter what setting you've actually got

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.009 
matter what setting you've actually got
your<00:03:03.819> fog<00:03:04.090> on<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:06.400> also<00:03:06.610> i<00:03:06.760> got<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.150> fog<00:03:07.600> color

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
your fog on and also i got the fog color

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.220 
your fog on and also i got the fog color
changer<00:03:08.620> mod<00:03:09.360> so<00:03:10.360> i<00:03:10.420> tried<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.660> make<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.900> fog

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
changer mod so i tried to make a fog

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.030 
changer mod so i tried to make a fog
sort<00:03:11.920> of<00:03:11.980> scene<00:03:12.220> in<00:03:12.459> color<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:16.739> maybe<00:03:17.739> just

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
sort of scene in color so maybe just

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.750 
sort of scene in color so maybe just
brunt<00:03:18.519> of<00:03:18.730> it<00:03:19.110> that's<00:03:20.110> a<00:03:20.230> bit<00:03:20.380> too<00:03:20.410> much<00:03:23.760> just

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
brunt of it that's a bit too much just

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.069 
brunt of it that's a bit too much just
something<00:03:25.030> up<00:03:26.549> so<00:03:27.549> yeah<00:03:27.730> that's<00:03:27.910> almost<00:03:28.720> too

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
something up so yeah that's almost too

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:42.980 
something up so yeah that's almost too
close<00:03:29.500> actually

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.170 

Taylor<00:03:43.990> I<00:03:44.460> don't<00:03:45.460> know<00:03:45.520> something<00:03:45.880> on<00:03:46.000> this

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
you get the idea I actually looks a bit

00:03:49.300 --> 00:04:05.760 
you get the idea I actually looks a bit
yellow<00:04:01.740> yeah<00:04:02.740> you<00:04:03.490> get<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.850> idea<00:04:04.770> basically

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
yellow yeah you get the idea basically

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.830 
yellow yeah you get the idea basically

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
colored folk not as the edge of the

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.060 
colored folk not as the edge of the

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.410 

oh<00:04:51.110> it's<00:04:52.110> because<00:04:52.260> it's<00:04:52.440> sitting<00:04:53.340> on<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:54.180> Sun

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
setting and I'm its kind of getting the

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.580 
setting and I'm its kind of getting the
blue<00:04:59.250> moon<00:04:59.550> light<00:04:59.850> on<00:05:00.030> it<00:05:03.200> so<00:05:04.200> if<00:05:04.320> you<00:05:04.380> change

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590

way today how are you there we go so

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.000 
way today how are you there we go so
that's<00:05:08.430> kind<00:05:08.640> of<00:05:08.670> annoying<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.210> fog<00:05:09.570> doesn't

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
that's kind of annoying the fog doesn't

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.050 
that's kind of annoying the fog doesn't
because<00:05:11.010> the<00:05:11.160> fault<00:05:11.340> doesn't<00:05:11.610> change<00:05:11.760> color

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
because the fault doesn't change color

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.310 
because the fault doesn't change color
with<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.330> time<00:05:12.960> of<00:05:13.110> day<00:05:13.290> so<00:05:14.280> it's<00:05:15.320> not

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
with the time of day so it's not

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.360 
with the time of day so it's not
matching<00:05:16.770> this<00:05:16.950> sand<00:05:18.440> which<00:05:19.440> was<00:05:19.650> getting

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
matching this sand which was getting

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:38.270 
matching this sand which was getting
annoying<00:05:34.250> but<00:05:35.250> yeah<00:05:35.430> you<00:05:35.490> get<00:05:35.730> the<00:05:35.820> idea<00:05:37.280> just

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
annoying but yeah you get the idea just

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.760 
annoying but yeah you get the idea just
sand<00:05:38.880> should<00:05:39.210> be<00:05:39.300> blowing<00:05:39.600> around<00:05:39.900> collecting

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
sand should be blowing around collecting

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.050 
sand should be blowing around collecting
on<00:05:40.980> the<00:05:41.070> ground<00:05:42.050> making<00:05:43.520> sound<00:05:44.520> of<00:05:44.700> wind

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
on the ground making sound of wind

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.320 
on the ground making sound of wind
should<00:05:45.780> be<00:05:46.010> sand<00:05:47.010> colored<00:05:47.310> fog<00:05:47.730> just<00:05:48.180> like<00:05:48.300> a

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
should be sand colored fog just like a

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.990 
should be sand colored fog just like a
really<00:05:48.600> really<00:05:48.810> short<00:05:49.170> distance<00:05:49.880> makes<00:05:50.880> it

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
really really short distance makes it

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.750 
really really short distance makes it
hard<00:05:51.150> to<00:05:51.240> see<00:05:53.600> yes<00:05:54.600> what<00:05:54.960> I<00:05:55.050> think<00:05:55.760> sandston
