00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.740 
idea but I don't recommend that just
simply<00:06:18.830> because<00:06:19.129> the<00:06:20.060> amount<00:06:20.270> of<00:06:20.330> maintenance

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
simply because the amount of maintenance

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.499 
simply because the amount of maintenance
you've<00:06:21.139> gotta<00:06:21.319> doing<00:06:22.000> hole<00:06:23.000> in<00:06:23.180> the<00:06:23.240> top<00:06:23.419> of

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:23.509 
you've gotta doing hole in the top of

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:27.610 
you've gotta doing hole in the top of
the<00:06:23.569> tank<00:06:23.780> isn't<00:06:24.020> the<00:06:24.229> biggest<00:06:24.590> but<00:06:26.409> fair<00:06:27.409> play

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
the tank isn't the biggest but fair play

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.899 
the tank isn't the biggest but fair play
to<00:06:27.680> the<00:06:27.860> ones<00:06:28.039> that<00:06:28.159> have<00:06:28.250> tried<00:06:28.639> and

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:28.909 
to the ones that have tried and

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:31.600 
to the ones that have tried and
succeeded<00:06:29.120> with<00:06:29.659> that<00:06:29.810> I<00:06:30.039> originally<00:06:31.039> did<00:06:31.520> it

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
succeeded with that I originally did it

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.899 
succeeded with that I originally did it
with<00:06:31.729> the<00:06:31.849> flooville<00:06:32.509> edge<00:06:33.340> 23<00:06:34.340> litre<00:06:34.580> which

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:34.909 
with the flooville edge 23 litre which

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:41.399 
with the flooville edge 23 litre which
was<00:06:35.120> an<00:06:35.210> absolute<00:06:36.610> hell<00:06:37.610> on<00:06:37.759> earth<00:06:37.789> basically

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:41.409 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:43.330 

as<00:06:42.409> you<00:06:42.560> can<00:06:42.620> see<00:06:42.800> it's<00:06:42.949> a<00:06:42.979> nice<00:06:43.129> little

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
as you can see it's a nice little

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.909 
as you can see it's a nice little
freshwater<00:06:43.639> tank

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 
freshwater tank

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.159 
freshwater tank
ideal<00:06:45.919> for<00:06:45.979> small<00:06:46.430> fish<00:06:46.699> shrimps<00:06:47.659> everything

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:48.169 
ideal for small fish shrimps everything

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:55.840 
ideal for small fish shrimps everything
