players who are into modal playing when
I<00:01:00.300> understand<00:01:00.719> modes<00:01:00.960> maybe<00:01:01.260> for<00:01:01.800> us<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.039> her

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
I understand modes maybe for us to her

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
to start from the very foundations and

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.200 
to start from the very foundations and
we're<00:01:13.799> going<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:13.979> build<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.369> step<00:01:14.759> by<00:01:14.790> step

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
we're going to build it up step by step

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.570 
we're going to build it up step by step
now<00:01:15.869> encourage<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.439> not<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.710> skip<00:01:17.220> through

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
now encourage you not to skip through

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.999 
now encourage you not to skip through
the<00:01:18.150> different<00:01:18.540> parts<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.350> series<00:01:19.619> if

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the different parts on this series if

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.770 
the different parts on this series if
you<00:01:20.070> if<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.610> covered<00:01:21.000> one<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.240> these<00:01:21.360> parts

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
you if you covered one of these parts

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.090 
you if you covered one of these parts
and<00:01:21.900> that's<00:01:22.079> fine<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.470> move<00:01:22.680> on<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.040> next

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
and that's fine just move on to the next

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.460 
and that's fine just move on to the next
one<00:01:23.310> that's<00:01:23.579> very<00:01:23.850> important<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.229> get<00:01:25.409> a

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
one that's very important that we get a

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.640 
one that's very important that we get a
solid<00:01:25.770> foundation

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
solid foundation

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.430 
solid foundation
work<00:01:26.920> on<00:01:27.220> and<00:01:27.760> then<00:01:28.060> build<00:01:28.780> it<00:01:28.900> on<00:01:28.990> from<00:01:29.260> there

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
work on and then build it on from there

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.370 
work on and then build it on from there
because<00:01:29.650> if<00:01:29.770> you<00:01:29.860> skip<00:01:30.130> over<00:01:30.310> it<00:01:31.200> it's<00:01:32.200> not

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
because if you skip over it it's not

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.350 
because if you skip over it it's not
going<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:32.620> make<00:01:32.740> much<00:01:32.800> sense<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:33.640> you<00:01:34.090> need<00:01:34.270> to

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
going to make much sense and you need to

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.640 
going to make much sense and you need to
make<00:01:34.510> sure<00:01:34.540> that<00:01:34.870> you<00:01:34.960> follow<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.410> program

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
make sure that you follow the program

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.640 
make sure that you follow the program
from<00:01:36.040> start<00:01:36.670> to<00:01:36.910> finish<00:01:37.270> and<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:38.290> idea<00:01:38.620> is

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
from start to finish and the idea is

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.220 
from start to finish and the idea is
you'll<00:01:38.980> be<00:01:39.100> able<00:01:39.190> to<00:01:39.370> improvise<00:01:40.230> create

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
you'll be able to improvise create

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.070 
you'll be able to improvise create
melodies<00:01:41.710> or<00:01:42.010> compose<00:01:42.420> over<00:01:43.420> any<00:01:43.660> chord

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
melodies or compose over any chord

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.670 
melodies or compose over any chord
progression<00:01:44.620> in<00:01:44.800> any<00:01:45.370> key<00:01:46.350> completely<00:01:47.350> freely

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
progression in any key completely freely

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.070 
progression in any key completely freely
that's<00:01:47.980> the<00:01:48.100> goal<00:01:48.310> and<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:49.630> I<00:01:49.660> hope<00:01:49.930> you
