00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
actually revealing it for the first time

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.840 
actually revealing it for the first time
and<00:01:13.049> then<00:01:13.170> we<00:01:13.229> get<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.549> obviously<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> biggest

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
and then we get it obviously the biggest

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.520 
and then we get it obviously the biggest
difference<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> white<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.200> black

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
difference to the white is the black

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.590 
difference to the white is the black
screen<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> front<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.580> opposed<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
screen on the front as opposed to the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600 
screen on the front as opposed to the
white<00:01:18.900> bezels<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.830> obviously<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.189> just<00:01:20.490> thought

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
white bezels so obviously I just thought

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.940 
white bezels so obviously I just thought
I'd<00:01:20.790> give<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:21.000> quick<00:01:21.479> color<00:01:22.049> comparison<00:01:22.680> here

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
I'd give a quick color comparison here

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.280 
I'd give a quick color comparison here
we<00:01:23.490> I've<00:01:23.670> also<00:01:23.850> thrown<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.570> older

in<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.590> little<00:01:40.950> while<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:41.970> find<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
in a little while I just find that the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.760 
in a little while I just find that the
blacks<00:01:42.750> are<00:01:42.869> always<00:01:43.110> tend<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.470> be<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> little

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
blacks are always tend to be a little

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.550 
blacks are always tend to be a little
bit<00:01:44.220> sleeker<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:45.000> little<00:01:45.570> bit<00:01:45.659> more<00:01:45.780> classy<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
bit sleeker a little bit more classy and

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.230 
bit sleeker a little bit more classy and
that<00:01:46.710> original<00:01:47.100> black<00:01:47.250> color<00:01:47.490> was<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.820> far

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
that original black color was just far

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.210 
that original black color was just far
far<00:01:48.750> too<00:01:48.780> black<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.710> here's<00:01:49.860> probably<00:01:50.159> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
far too black so here's probably a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.770 
far too black so here's probably a
better<00:01:50.369> look<00:01:50.549> at<00:01:50.700> both<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.270> ipad<00:01:51.630> mini

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
better look at both of the ipad mini

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.749 
better look at both of the ipad mini
with<00:01:51.930> retina<00:01:51.990> display<00:01:52.409> colors<00:01:53.040> here<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.640> can

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
with retina display colors here you can

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:54.560 
with retina display colors here you can
see<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.030> there<00:01:54.119> definitely<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.540> a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
see that there definitely is a

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.230 
see that there definitely is a
difference<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.320> backs<00:01:55.770> but<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.790> front

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
difference but the backs but the front

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.969 
difference but the backs but the front
is<00:01:57.509> really<00:01:57.930> where<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.259> kind<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.530> difference

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
is really where the kind of difference

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.950 
is really where the kind of difference
comes<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.579> and<00:02:00.270> i'm<00:02:00.360> actually<00:02:00.450> going<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.780> talk

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.740 
comes in and i'm actually going to talk
about<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.439> in<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.740> second<00:02:02.310> about<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.329> bezels

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
about just in a second about the bezels

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.380 
about just in a second about the bezels
and<00:02:03.869> kind<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.110> why<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.380> prefer<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.310> black<00:02:05.939> over

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
and kind of why I prefer the black over

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.059 
and kind of why I prefer the black over
the<00:02:06.420> white<00:02:06.840> does<00:02:07.409> first<00:02:07.619> something<00:02:07.920> quite

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
the white does first something quite

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.550 
the white does first something quite

then the kind of all-inclusive screen
around<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.610> apple<00:02:21.760> logo<00:02:21.940> will<00:02:22.420> be<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.810> same

the display you actually kind of get a
little<00:02:34.180> gap<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:35.019> black<00:02:35.739> gap<00:02:36.160> between<00:02:36.640> the

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
whole lot more than it does on the black

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
black due to the fact that it just looks

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.449 
black due to the fact that it just looks
