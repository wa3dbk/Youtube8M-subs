00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.259
 You Kon'nichiwa 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.740
 Influence 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.860
 Then 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:16.450
 Released on September 8 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:25.000
 I would like to introduce the produced eyeliner 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:26.200
 I was allowed to produce 2 colors of 2 Tsuguraun and Black, but it is really old days 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.309
 I-line 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:36.280
 I have a particular interest in Japan, so this time I stuffed everything that I was stuck with 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.440
 Now over that love 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:44.110
 so 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:49.780
 It's waterproof and it's hard to fall off and it's easy to dry out when you 're writing it 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:54.790
 It has become two colors of Blan and black of firm dry and tight adhesion 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:59.440
 It might be the design of the package of this 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:01.990
 I tried to design such a noticeable color that looks good 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.530
 Not even in such a feeling 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:11.610
 Do you think 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:13.570
 Also introduction of Toka little point at the time of the eye line but today that his 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.960
 We want to Restoration 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:22.130
 Not a meet I'd come pretty even Toka comments first say that difficult to write Eyeliner 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:28.180
 So slow 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.180
 It's the point to write and it's a big deficit 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.320
 Stuffy in the Meiji Ri road 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.690
 Going to heat 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:42.200
 After 10, it is cotton mucous membrane in this of eyes 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:46.369
 If I'll fill in A well 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:52.969
 I'd be feeling that patch when you open pretty eyes 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:57.860
 As I pulled the skin narrowly rather than pulling the eyeliner too thick, and because the width of several cars is rising 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:02:02.310
 I think it looks big because the range of entering is wide 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:06.159
 When I want to make it look like this I 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.659
 I have got some high lines 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.659
 I 'm positive with my eyes open 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:24.210
 This is when you want to show off 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:29.880
 If I write only the upper part of the eyes a little thicker 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:34.170
 I think I 'm finished with a womanish that is thick but 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:39.330
 Ainano's too bad for me 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.940
 If both of them are close to nine, they will fall apart on both the left and right side. 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:47.880
 I was not good at it 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:51.080
 Do not he be everyone going to become a darling to true in order to immediately practice bought a make 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:55.920
 Practice track record's But 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:03:00.590
 Please try to light up also thank you Ma 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.590
 Pie pan was cracked when Mizuki tee in 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:09.150
