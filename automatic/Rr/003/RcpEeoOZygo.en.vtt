it has more species of fish than all of
North<00:00:40.960> America<00:00:41.110> for<00:00:41.800> example<00:00:42.420> more<00:00:43.420> than<00:00:43.510> a

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
North America for example more than a

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.260 
North America for example more than a
thousand<00:00:44.550> there<00:00:45.550> are<00:00:45.640> also<00:00:45.760> only<00:00:46.000> five

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
thousand there are also only five

species of fish in the lake that are

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.120 
species of fish in the lake that are
found<00:00:49.270> everywhere<00:00:49.570> else<00:00:50.050> so<00:00:50.170> I<00:00:50.290> like<00:00:50.830> to<00:00:50.980> say

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
found everywhere else so I like to say

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.670 
found everywhere else so I like to say
it's<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.460> nearest<00:00:51.610> thing<00:00:51.880> we<00:00:52.000> have<00:00:52.180> to<00:00:52.420> an

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
it's the nearest thing we have to an

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.770 
it's the nearest thing we have to an
extra<00:00:53.680> terrestrial<00:00:54.370> ecosystem<00:00:55.060> where<00:00:55.600> all

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
extra terrestrial ecosystem where all

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.360 
extra terrestrial ecosystem where all
the<00:00:55.900> species<00:00:56.140> are<00:00:56.440> related<00:00:56.860> to<00:00:56.890> each<00:00:57.040> other

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
the species are related to each other

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.810 
the species are related to each other
and<00:00:57.580> not<00:00:57.700> much<00:00:57.970> to<00:00:58.240> do<00:00:58.630> anything<00:00:59.110> else<00:00:59.610> and<00:01:00.610> it

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
and not much to do anything else and it

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.009 
and not much to do anything else and it
is<00:01:00.970> really<00:01:01.870> an<00:01:02.079> achievement<00:01:02.500> to<00:01:03.299> after<00:01:04.299> 60

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
is really an achievement to after 60

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.440 
is really an achievement to after 60
years<00:01:05.170> of<00:01:05.500> work<00:01:05.770> to<00:01:05.950> finally<00:01:06.280> have<00:01:06.460> protection

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
years of work to finally have protection

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:15.330 
years of work to finally have protection

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.230 

of<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:16.119> protection<00:01:16.570> of<00:01:17.009> Lake<00:01:18.009> niassa<00:01:18.909> is<00:01:19.210> a

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
of the protection of Lake niassa is a

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.870 
of the protection of Lake niassa is a
bit<00:01:19.509> of<00:01:19.630> a<00:01:19.689> balancing<00:01:19.899> act<00:01:20.380> because<00:01:20.829> it<00:01:21.700> is

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
bit of a balancing act because it is

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.429 
bit of a balancing act because it is
occurring<00:01:22.359> in<00:01:22.509> one<00:01:22.810> of<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:23.170> poorest

fish<00:01:28.990> for<00:01:29.259> their<00:01:29.409> sustenance<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.939> we<00:01:31.569> have<00:01:31.780> to

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
fish for their sustenance so we have to

focus on protection of species at

a closer relation before the reserve the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.059 
a closer relation before the reserve the
practice<00:02:28.389> was<00:02:28.600> to<00:02:28.840> put<00:02:29.139> nets<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:29.590> Weir's<00:02:29.799> and

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
practice was to put nets and Weir's and

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.309 
practice was to put nets and Weir's and
catch<00:02:30.730> these<00:02:31.060> fish<00:02:31.329> during<00:02:31.630> their<00:02:31.959> spawning
