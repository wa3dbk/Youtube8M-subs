00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:04.170 

why<00:00:02.649> would<00:00:02.860> we<00:00:02.980> want<00:00:03.220> to<00:00:03.310> use<00:00:03.580> structure

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:04.180 
why would we want to use structure

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.040 
why would we want to use structure
mapping<00:00:04.660> with<00:00:05.200> other<00:00:05.499> Rantz<00:00:05.799> units<00:00:06.720> well<00:00:07.720> for

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.050 
mapping with other Rantz units well for

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.919 
mapping with other Rantz units well for
one<00:00:08.230> the<00:00:09.129> last<00:00:09.339> 10<00:00:09.670> or<00:00:09.700> 15<00:00:09.910> years<00:00:10.360> my<00:00:10.540> fish<00:00:10.809> with

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:10.929 
one the last 10 or 15 years my fish with

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:13.980 
one the last 10 or 15 years my fish with
my<00:00:11.110> regular<00:00:11.290> waypoints<00:00:12.040> in<00:00:12.129> GPS<00:00:12.809> I'd<00:00:13.809> have<00:00:13.959> a

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
my regular waypoints in GPS I'd have a

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.930 
my regular waypoints in GPS I'd have a
couple<00:00:14.320> spots<00:00:14.559> marked<00:00:15.070> and<00:00:15.249> you<00:00:15.549> could<00:00:15.669> pull

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
couple spots marked and you could pull

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.650 
couple spots marked and you could pull
up<00:00:16.120> here<00:00:16.420> and<00:00:17.400> when<00:00:18.400> you<00:00:18.490> got<00:00:18.670> to<00:00:18.880> them<00:00:19.030> sure

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
up here and when you got to them sure

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.690 
up here and when you got to them sure
you<00:00:19.810> could<00:00:19.960> fire<00:00:20.320> cast<00:00:20.800> right<00:00:21.190> at<00:00:21.370> them<00:00:21.670> and

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
you could fire cast right at them and

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.880 
you could fire cast right at them and
and<00:00:22.150> hope<00:00:22.720> your<00:00:22.990> GPS<00:00:23.560> was<00:00:23.770> on<00:00:24.360> accurate<00:00:25.770> if<00:00:26.770> you

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
and hope your GPS was on accurate if you

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.890 
and hope your GPS was on accurate if you
had<00:00:27.040> marks<00:00:27.370> their<00:00:27.610> nose<00:00:27.850> rocks<00:00:28.120> and<00:00:28.390> weeds<00:00:28.570> or

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
had marks their nose rocks and weeds or

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.750 
had marks their nose rocks and weeds or
something<00:00:29.350> you<00:00:30.100> still<00:00:30.340> don't<00:00:30.520> know<00:00:30.550> if<00:00:30.670> you

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
something you still don't know if you

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.260 
something you still don't know if you
were<00:00:30.850> exactly<00:00:31.270> hitting<00:00:31.540> the<00:00:31.780> key<00:00:31.990> spot<00:00:32.439> there

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
were exactly hitting the key spot there

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.300 
were exactly hitting the key spot there
after<00:00:34.270> making<00:00:34.480> my<00:00:34.720> first<00:00:35.050> structure<00:00:35.590> map<00:00:35.830> it

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
after making my first structure map it

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.880 
after making my first structure map it
was<00:00:36.460> pretty<00:00:36.730> easy<00:00:36.970> to<00:00:37.150> see<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:38.380> I<00:00:38.410> wanted<00:00:38.800> to

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
was pretty easy to see that I wanted to

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.190 
was pretty easy to see that I wanted to
do<00:00:39.040> this<00:00:39.190> to<00:00:39.250> all<00:00:39.550> my<00:00:39.940> key<00:00:40.240> spots<00:00:40.690> on<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:40.990> lake

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
do this to all my key spots on the lake

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.040 
do this to all my key spots on the lake
that<00:00:41.380> I'm<00:00:41.470> going<00:00:41.710> to<00:00:41.740> fish<00:00:42.630> it's<00:00:43.630> not<00:00:43.810> going<00:00:43.990> to

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
that I'm going to fish it's not going to

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.020 
that I'm going to fish it's not going to
pay<00:00:44.260> off<00:00:44.440> every<00:00:44.829> spot<00:00:45.160> that<00:00:45.430> the<00:00:45.579> fish<00:00:45.790> aren't

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
pay off every spot that the fish aren't

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.970 
pay off every spot that the fish aren't
out<00:00:46.150> there<00:00:46.420> but<00:00:46.690> once<00:00:47.290> you<00:00:47.440> have<00:00:47.560> these<00:00:47.710> in<00:00:47.890> the

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
out there but once you have these in the

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.940 
out there but once you have these in the
memory<00:00:48.310> on<00:00:48.550> your<00:00:49.390> SD<00:00:49.540> cards<00:00:50.200> every<00:00:50.680> time<00:00:50.860> you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
memory on your SD cards every time you

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.710 
memory on your SD cards every time you
go<00:00:51.070> to<00:00:51.130> that<00:00:51.220> lake<00:00:51.460> you<00:00:52.030> have<00:00:52.180> a<00:00:52.210> history<00:00:52.510> of

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
go to that lake you have a history of

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.260 
go to that lake you have a history of
the<00:00:52.840> lake<00:00:53.310> sure<00:00:54.310> the<00:00:54.550> weeds<00:00:54.760> could<00:00:55.030> change

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
the lake sure the weeds could change

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.729 
the lake sure the weeds could change
from<00:00:55.420> year<00:00:55.630> to<00:00:55.780> year<00:00:55.810> but<00:00:56.020> what<00:00:56.350> I'm<00:00:56.410> looking

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
from year to year but what I'm looking

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.490 
from year to year but what I'm looking
for<00:00:56.950> on<00:00:57.040> our<00:00:57.130> lakes<00:00:57.399> up<00:00:57.640> here<00:00:57.940> is<00:00:58.410> basically<00:00:59.410> a

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
for on our lakes up here is basically a

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.860 
for on our lakes up here is basically a
hard<00:00:59.710> bottom<00:00:59.950> and<00:01:00.489> in<00:01:00.640> areas<00:01:01.149> that<00:01:01.180> have<00:01:01.450> rocks

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
hard bottom and in areas that have rocks

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.109 
hard bottom and in areas that have rocks
and<00:01:02.800> different<00:01:03.160> things<00:01:03.399> that<00:01:03.520> are<00:01:03.579> not<00:01:03.820> going

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
and different things that are not going

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.209 
and different things that are not going
to<00:01:04.210> change<00:01:04.420> from<00:01:04.659> year<00:01:04.899> to<00:01:05.019> year<00:01:05.049> the<00:01:05.950> first

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:06.219 
to change from year to year the first

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:07.620 
to change from year to year the first
thing<00:01:06.369> we'll<00:01:06.520> see<00:01:06.549> here<00:01:07.030> when<00:01:07.179> you<00:01:07.270> make<00:01:07.299> this

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
thing we'll see here when you make this

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.840 
thing we'll see here when you make this
map<00:01:08.020> is<00:01:08.229> I<00:01:08.319> made<00:01:08.469> a<00:01:08.530> couple<00:01:08.740> of<00:01:08.829> passes<00:01:09.490> back

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
map is I made a couple of passes back

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.279 
map is I made a couple of passes back
and<00:01:10.090> forth<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.590> I<00:01:11.679> saw<00:01:11.979> this<00:01:12.189> long<00:01:13.289> finger

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
and forth and I saw this long finger

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.819 
and forth and I saw this long finger
coming<00:01:15.130> out<00:01:15.280> from<00:01:15.429> shore<00:01:15.789> in<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:17.409> a<00:01:17.499> quick

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
coming out from shore in just a quick

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.989 
coming out from shore in just a quick
glance<00:01:18.249> you<00:01:18.609> can<00:01:18.759> see<00:01:19.179> the<00:01:20.139> edge<00:01:20.319> of<00:01:20.590> it<00:01:20.999> and

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:21.999 
glance you can see the edge of it and

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:24.569 
glance you can see the edge of it and
when<00:01:22.420> you<00:01:22.479> look<00:01:22.659> around<00:01:23.219> you<00:01:24.219> know<00:01:24.310> you<00:01:24.399> got

when you look around you know you got

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.289 
when you look around you know you got
your<00:01:24.670> tip<00:01:24.969> here<00:01:25.709> well<00:01:26.709> this<00:01:26.950> here<00:01:27.490> is<00:01:28.060> one<00:01:28.270> of

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
the key spots on it a lot of times I run

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:32.969 
the key spots on it a lot of times I run
these<00:01:31.689> spots<00:01:31.990> you<00:01:32.139> know<00:01:32.229> you'd<00:01:32.350> go<00:01:32.529> to<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:32.709> tip

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
these spots you know you'd go to the tip

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.760 
these spots you know you'd go to the tip
market<00:01:33.639> fish<00:01:33.999> it<00:01:34.209> but<00:01:35.109> a<00:01:35.139> lot<00:01:35.350> of<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.560> rocks

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
market fish it but a lot of the rocks

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.120 
market fish it but a lot of the rocks
and<00:01:36.130> different<00:01:36.429> clumps<00:01:36.819> are<00:01:36.939> right<00:01:37.149> here<00:01:37.600> and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
and different clumps are right here and

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.419 
and different clumps are right here and
then<00:01:39.130> again<00:01:39.279> right<00:01:39.789> up<00:01:39.969> in<00:01:40.119> here<00:01:40.509> and<00:01:41.429> then

then again right up in here and then

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.190 
then again right up in here and then
here<00:01:43.029> is<00:01:43.209> where<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.779> Coon<00:01:44.049> tail<00:01:44.380> edge<00:01:44.649> is<00:01:46.200> now

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
here is where the Coon tail edge is now

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.440 
here is where the Coon tail edge is now
I<00:01:47.619> might<00:01:48.039> blow<00:01:48.249> up<00:01:48.310> this<00:01:48.459> spot<00:01:48.729> to<00:01:48.939> fish<00:01:49.209> it

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
I might blow up this spot to fish it

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.839 
I might blow up this spot to fish it
especially<00:01:49.899> in<00:01:50.109> a<00:01:50.170> tournament<00:01:50.499> if<00:01:51.340> I<00:01:51.579> pull<00:01:51.819> up

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:51.849 
especially in a tournament if I pull up

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:56.789 
especially in a tournament if I pull up
here<00:01:52.359> I<00:01:52.770> start<00:01:53.770> casting<00:01:54.099> I<00:01:55.049> know<00:01:56.049> exactly

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
here I start casting I know exactly

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.349 
here I start casting I know exactly
where<00:01:57.639> my<00:01:57.849> casts<00:01:58.149> are<00:01:58.450> going<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.909> can<00:02:01.060> hit<00:02:01.179> the

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.890 
either picks create structure map when
complete<00:04:02.580> and<00:04:02.910> as<00:04:03.480> soon<00:04:03.720> as<00:04:03.780> you're<00:04:03.870> done

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
complete and as soon as you're done

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.960 
complete and as soon as you're done
recording<00:04:04.200> your<00:04:04.620> file<00:04:05.100> it'll<00:04:05.670> make<00:04:05.940> a

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
recording your file it'll make a

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.990 
recording your file it'll make a
structure<00:04:06.360> map<00:04:06.690> or<00:04:07.350> you<00:04:07.769> can<00:04:07.920> just<00:04:08.070> record<00:04:08.610> and

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
structure map or you can just record and

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.440 
structure map or you can just record and
then<00:04:09.239> do<00:04:09.420> this<00:04:09.570> step<00:04:09.959> later<00:04:10.290> too<00:04:11.330> once<00:04:12.330> you

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
then do this step later too once you

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.810 
then do this step later too once you
have<00:04:12.630> these<00:04:12.810> set<00:04:13.140> just<00:04:13.830> click<00:04:14.040> on<00:04:14.190> record

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
have these set just click on record

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.180 
have these set just click on record
once<00:04:15.630> it<00:04:15.780> starts<00:04:16.049> recording<00:04:16.200> you'll<00:04:16.769> see<00:04:16.979> some

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
once it starts recording you'll see some

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.490 
once it starts recording you'll see some
red<00:04:17.400> dots<00:04:17.669> flashing<00:04:18.510> on<00:04:18.600> top<00:04:18.840> of<00:04:18.989> your<00:04:19.080> screen

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
red dots flashing on top of your screen

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.050 
red dots flashing on top of your screen
so<00:04:19.770> you<00:04:20.280> know<00:04:20.459> that<00:04:20.609> it's<00:04:20.760> recording

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
so you know that it's recording

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.720 
so you know that it's recording
once<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:24.240> save<00:04:24.600> your<00:04:24.930> structure<00:04:25.470> map<00:04:25.730> you'll

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
once you save your structure map you'll

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.580 
once you save your structure map you'll
need<00:04:26.940> to<00:04:27.060> change<00:04:27.480> a<00:04:27.660> couple<00:04:27.810> settings<00:04:28.290> so<00:04:28.500> it

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
need to change a couple settings so it

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
need to change a couple settings so it
actually<00:04:28.740> shows<00:04:28.950> up<00:04:29.400> on<00:04:29.580> your<00:04:29.730> charting<00:04:30.270> map

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
actually shows up on your charting map

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.310 
actually shows up on your charting map
so<00:04:32.610> what<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.060> do<00:04:33.180> is<00:04:33.510> just<00:04:33.540> go<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:33.930> your<00:04:34.140> main

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
so what I do is just go to your main

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.860 
so what I do is just go to your main
chart<00:04:34.710> page<00:04:35.070> and<00:04:35.460> if<00:04:35.880> you<00:04:36.060> go<00:04:36.270> down<00:04:36.510> towards

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
chart page and if you go down towards

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.110 
chart page and if you go down towards
the<00:04:36.960> bottom<00:04:37.580> you<00:04:38.580> have<00:04:38.610> one<00:04:38.820> that<00:04:38.940> says

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
the bottom you have one that says

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.140 
the bottom you have one that says
overlay<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:40.080> you<00:04:40.830> want<00:04:41.070> to<00:04:41.220> check<00:04:41.640> this<00:04:41.940> and

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
overlay and you want to check this and

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.650 
overlay and you want to check this and
make<00:04:42.180> sure<00:04:42.390> it<00:04:42.510> says<00:04:42.690> structure<00:04:43.380> and<00:04:44.510> then<00:04:45.510> if

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
make sure it says structure and then if

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.590 
make sure it says structure and then if
you<00:04:45.780> go<00:04:45.960> down<00:04:46.230> below<00:04:47.130> this<00:04:47.670> one<00:04:47.970> a<00:04:48.000> little<00:04:48.270> ways

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
you go down below this one a little ways

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.590 
you go down below this one a little ways
below<00:04:49.440> this<00:04:49.680> overlay<00:04:50.160> structure<00:04:50.880> option

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
below this overlay structure option

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.690 
below this overlay structure option
there's<00:04:52.200> one<00:04:52.530> where<00:04:52.680> you<00:04:52.800> can<00:04:52.980> either<00:04:53.070> go<00:04:53.340> live

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
there's one where you can either go live

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.490 
there's one where you can either go live
view<00:04:54.240> or<00:04:54.450> saved<00:04:56.240> so<00:04:57.240> if<00:04:57.360> you<00:04:57.480> want<00:04:57.720> to<00:04:57.810> use<00:04:58.110> the

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
view or saved so if you want to use the

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.860 
view or saved so if you want to use the
file<00:04:58.770> that<00:04:58.980> you<00:04:59.130> just<00:04:59.340> created<00:04:59.850> you'll<00:05:00.630> want

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
file that you just created you'll want

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.340 
file that you just created you'll want
to<00:05:00.960> pick<00:05:01.320> the<00:05:01.530> saved<00:05:01.890> option<00:05:03.200> under<00:05:04.200> your

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
to pick the saved option under your

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.780 
to pick the saved option under your
structure<00:05:04.800> map<00:05:05.010> settings<00:05:05.520> you<00:05:05.580> have<00:05:05.640> a<00:05:05.760> few

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
structure map settings you have a few

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.940 
structure map settings you have a few
more<00:05:06.090> options<00:05:06.390> you<00:05:06.780> can<00:05:06.930> play<00:05:07.230> with<00:05:07.500> one<00:05:07.830> is

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
more options you can play with one is

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.840 
more options you can play with one is
your<00:05:08.070> transparency<00:05:08.910> and<00:05:09.750> that'll<00:05:10.470> be<00:05:10.850> how

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
your transparency and that'll be how

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.450 
your transparency and that'll be how
much<00:05:12.690> of<00:05:12.990> your<00:05:13.260> contour<00:05:13.860> map<00:05:14.130> will<00:05:14.430> show

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
much of your contour map will show

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.170 
much of your contour map will show
through<00:05:15.180> your<00:05:15.750> structure<00:05:16.350> map<00:05:16.560> I<00:05:16.970> set<00:05:17.970> mine

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
through your structure map I set mine

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.910 
through your structure map I set mine
down<00:05:18.360> to<00:05:18.600> minimum<00:05:18.990> most<00:05:19.200> of<00:05:19.350> the<00:05:19.410> time<00:05:19.620> so<00:05:19.890> I

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
down to minimum most of the time so I

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.090 
down to minimum most of the time so I
see<00:05:20.280> the<00:05:20.520> pier<00:05:20.970> structure<00:05:21.600> map<00:05:21.810> I<00:05:21.960> created<00:05:22.470> I'm

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
see the pier structure map I created I'm

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.310 
see the pier structure map I created I'm
not<00:05:23.460> too<00:05:23.640> concerned<00:05:23.850> about<00:05:24.120> my<00:05:24.450> contour<00:05:25.050> lines

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
not too concerned about my contour lines

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.010 
not too concerned about my contour lines
I<00:05:25.770> want<00:05:25.920> to<00:05:26.070> see<00:05:26.310> the<00:05:27.120> rocks<00:05:27.420> and<00:05:27.720> different

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
also choose from live data so as you're

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.040 
also choose from live data so as you're
driving<00:06:08.610> on<00:06:08.850> the<00:06:08.910> lake<00:06:09.180> it's<00:06:09.480> filling<00:06:09.870> up<00:06:10.020> your

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
driving on the lake it's filling up your

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.430 
driving on the lake it's filling up your
map<00:06:10.820> this<00:06:11.820> is<00:06:12.060> what<00:06:12.240> your<00:06:12.420> screen<00:06:12.720> should<00:06:13.200> look

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
map this is what your screen should look

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.920 
map this is what your screen should look
like<00:06:13.470> then<00:06:14.010> once<00:06:14.550> you<00:06:14.730> have<00:06:14.910> your<00:06:15.030> overlay<00:06:15.540> set

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
like then once you have your overlay set

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.590 
like then once you have your overlay set
to<00:06:16.080> structure<00:06:16.760> and<00:06:17.760> you're<00:06:17.970> actually<00:06:18.360> over<00:06:18.540> an

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
to structure and you're actually over an

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.630 
to structure and you're actually over an
area<00:06:18.990> where<00:06:19.230> you<00:06:19.380> would<00:06:19.470> scanned<00:06:20.040> and<00:06:20.280> saved

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
area where you would scanned and saved

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.660 
area where you would scanned and saved
it<00:06:20.970> and<00:06:21.290> converted<00:06:22.290> it<00:06:22.410> to<00:06:22.440> a<00:06:22.620> structure<00:06:23.190> map

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:25.670 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.310 

what<00:06:26.670> you<00:06:26.820> see<00:06:27.150> here<00:06:27.540> is<00:06:27.660> where<00:06:27.810> I<00:06:27.870> made<00:06:28.050> a<00:06:28.080> few

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
what you see here is where I made a few

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.980 
what you see here is where I made a few
different<00:06:28.590> passes<00:06:29.250> and<00:06:29.550> you<00:06:30.300> can<00:06:30.480> still<00:06:30.720> see

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
different passes and you can still see

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.290 
different passes and you can still see
the<00:06:31.170> stuff<00:06:31.410> that<00:06:31.560> you<00:06:31.650> scanned<00:06:32.220> but<00:06:33.150> what<00:06:33.270> I

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
the stuff that you scanned but what I

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.460 
the stuff that you scanned but what I
like<00:06:33.510> to<00:06:33.690> do<00:06:33.870> is<00:06:34.230> if<00:06:34.470> it's<00:06:34.620> an<00:06:34.740> area<00:06:34.950> that's

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
like to do is if it's an area that's

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.410 
like to do is if it's an area that's
really<00:06:35.680> good<00:06:35.920> and<00:06:36.280> there's<00:06:36.700> a<00:06:36.760> lot<00:06:36.940> of<00:06:36.970> cover<00:06:37.300> I

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:37.420 
really good and there's a lot of cover I

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.650 
really good and there's a lot of cover I
want<00:06:37.630> a<00:06:37.690> clear<00:06:37.990> picture<00:06:38.200> I<00:06:38.680> would<00:06:39.400> actually

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
want a clear picture I would actually

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.830 
want a clear picture I would actually
just<00:06:40.660> delete<00:06:41.260> these<00:06:41.470> files<00:06:42.300> come<00:06:43.300> back<00:06:43.480> across

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
just delete these files come back across

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.710 
just delete these files come back across
there<00:06:44.380> and<00:06:44.650> make<00:06:44.800> one<00:06:45.100> nice<00:06:45.400> clean<00:06:45.880> pass<00:06:46.270> over

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
there and make one nice clean pass over

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.070 
there and make one nice clean pass over
the<00:06:46.840> key<00:06:47.080> spots<00:06:47.500> and<00:06:47.940> then<00:06:48.940> make<00:06:49.090> that<00:06:49.360> my

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
the key spots and then make that my

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.050 
the key spots and then make that my
structure<00:06:50.440> map<00:06:50.800> so<00:06:51.640> you<00:06:51.730> don't<00:06:51.850> have<00:06:51.940> these

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
structure map so you don't have these

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.300 
structure map so you don't have these
different<00:06:52.480> darkness<00:06:52.750> cutting<00:06:53.560> across<00:06:53.830> here

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310 
different darkness cutting across here

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.970 
different darkness cutting across here
and<00:06:54.340> different<00:06:54.790> shades<00:06:55.210> and<00:06:55.540> all<00:06:55.660> that<00:06:55.950> it's<00:06:56.950> a

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:56.980 
and different shades and all that it's a

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.590 
and different shades and all that it's a
lot<00:06:57.130> easier<00:06:57.370> to<00:06:57.490> see<00:06:57.790> exactly<00:06:58.270> what<00:06:58.360> you<00:06:58.450> want

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:58.600 
lot easier to see exactly what you want

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.470 
lot easier to see exactly what you want
to<00:06:58.690> fish<00:06:59.400> hopefully<00:07:00.400> this<00:07:00.820> video<00:07:01.120> shows<00:07:01.450> you

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:01.480 
to fish hopefully this video shows you

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.390 
to fish hopefully this video shows you
how<00:07:01.630> easy<00:07:01.900> it<00:07:02.140> is<00:07:02.200> to<00:07:02.470> you<00:07:02.560> a<00:07:02.590> structure<00:07:03.010> map

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 
how easy it is to you a structure map

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.910 
how easy it is to you a structure map
and<00:07:03.940> what<00:07:04.450> kind<00:07:04.660> of<00:07:04.720> advantages<00:07:05.380> you<00:07:05.500> can<00:07:05.710> gain

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:05.920 
and what kind of advantages you can gain

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.000 
and what kind of advantages you can gain
by<00:07:06.100> using<00:07:06.340> it<00:07:06.870> one<00:07:07.870> other<00:07:08.080> thing<00:07:08.530> for<00:07:08.560> people

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.010 
by using it one other thing for people

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.770 
by using it one other thing for people
that<00:07:09.220> live<00:07:09.370> up<00:07:09.490> north<00:07:09.670> where<00:07:10.030> you<00:07:10.150> have<00:07:10.240> ice<00:07:10.450> on

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.610 
these if you go to ice fishing you

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.010 
these if you go to ice fishing you
should<00:07:18.730> be<00:07:18.790> able<00:07:18.850> to<00:07:18.940> drive<00:07:19.150> right<00:07:19.480> up<00:07:19.540> to<00:07:19.720> the
