is good and sort of what I expected but

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.550 
is good and sort of what I expected but

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
which I didn't know was possible towards

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.880

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
the beginning of the series I knew it

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.410 
the beginning of the series I knew it
would<00:00:20.039> take<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.189> long<00:00:20.609> time<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:21.060> find<00:00:21.210> some

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
would take a long time to find some

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.210 
would take a long time to find some
bases<00:00:21.810> especially<00:00:21.960> certain<00:00:22.650> episodes<00:00:22.740> where

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
bases especially certain episodes where

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.099 
bases especially certain episodes where
I<00:00:23.250> only<00:00:23.400> got<00:00:23.609> like<00:00:23.789> 50<00:00:24.119> or<00:00:24.210> 60<00:00:24.539> trophies<00:00:24.930> but

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109

seeing as we got 150 trophies in the
last<00:00:27.750> episode<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.230> definitely<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:28.800> some<00:00:28.980> hope

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160

to<00:00:29.580> hit<00:00:29.699> Titan<00:00:30.119> 2<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.480> let's<00:00:30.630> go<00:00:30.750> ahead<00:00:30.810> and

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
out this first base here looks like the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
didn't find a base for a while and

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.420

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
into the center of the base I just need

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.270 
into the center of the base I just need
to<00:01:06.960> try<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.170> destroy<00:01:07.500> as<00:01:07.650> many<00:01:07.830> buildings<00:01:08.040> as

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
possible and that's why I spread out my

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.870 
possible and that's why I spread out my
troops<00:01:10.350> pretty<00:01:10.530> far<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.460> didn't<00:01:11.700> really

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
troops pretty far and I didn't really

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.760 
troops pretty far and I didn't really
focus<00:01:12.030> too<00:01:12.360> much<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.750> center<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.590> we're<00:01:13.710> at

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
focus too much on the center so we're at

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.590 
focus too much on the center so we're at
45<00:01:14.010> percent<00:01:14.310> right<00:01:14.790> now<00:01:14.820> gonna<00:01:15.270> go<00:01:15.390> ahead<00:01:15.450> and

in just a second we should be able to

get to 50% and add the battle right away
so<00:01:25.080> Queen's<00:01:25.830> gonna<00:01:26.040> shoot<00:01:26.280> down<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.460> Expo<00:01:27.000> in

so Queen's gonna shoot down that Expo in

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.179 
so Queen's gonna shoot down that Expo in
just<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.630> second<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.229> as<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.350> fast<00:01:28.650> forward<00:01:29.070> I

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
just a second and as I fast forward I

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.620 
just a second and as I fast forward I
gave<00:01:29.369> myself<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.759> little<00:01:29.880> bit<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.150> time<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.509> see

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
gave myself a little bit of time to see

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
gave myself a little bit of time to see
if<00:01:30.689> my<00:01:30.750> troops<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.259> make<00:01:31.409> their<00:01:31.560> way<00:01:31.619> through

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
if my troops can make their way through

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.289 
if my troops can make their way through
and<00:01:32.130> try<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.310> get<00:01:32.460> three<00:01:32.640> stars<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.119> base

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
and try to get three stars on the base

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.300 
and try to get three stars on the base
but<00:01:33.960> unfortunately<00:01:34.560> all<00:01:34.710> my<00:01:34.740> troops<00:01:35.100> went

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
but unfortunately all my troops went

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.649 
but unfortunately all my troops went
down<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.610> just<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.880> second<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.299> left<00:01:36.570> hand

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
down in just a second on that left hand

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.940 
down in just a second on that left hand
side<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.229> went<00:01:37.409> ahead<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.680> ended<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
side so I went ahead and ended the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.710 
side so I went ahead and ended the
battle<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.700> ended<00:01:38.909> up<00:01:39.000> stealing<00:01:39.270> seven

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
battle and I ended up stealing seven

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.870 
battle and I ended up stealing seven
trophies<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.380> raid<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.950> not<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> ton<00:01:41.850> of

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
trophies for this raid so not a ton of

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.520 
trophies for this raid so not a ton of
trophies<00:01:42.329> but<00:01:42.509> seeing<00:01:42.780> if<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.990> Town<00:01:43.140> Hall<00:01:43.350> was

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
trophies but seeing if the Town Hall was

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.490 
trophies but seeing if the Town Hall was
on<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> outside<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.460> knew<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.060> had<00:01:45.540> zero<00:01:45.720> risk<00:01:46.229> to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
on the outside I knew I had zero risk to

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.810 
on the outside I knew I had zero risk to
try<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> get<00:01:46.860> two<00:01:47.009> stars<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.430> base<00:01:47.579> so

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
try to get two stars in the base so

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.310 
try to get two stars in the base so
that's<00:01:48.000> what<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.149> decided<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> attack<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.079> one

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
that's what I decided to attack this one

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.060 
that's what I decided to attack this one
or<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.680> one

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
or that one

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.429 
or that one
and<00:01:50.340> speaking<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.939> zero<00:01:51.210> risk<00:01:51.540> finding<00:01:52.200> this

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
and speaking of zero risk finding this

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.740 
and speaking of zero risk finding this
base<00:01:52.649> right<00:01:52.770> here<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.360> definitely<00:01:54.360> pretty

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
base right here is definitely pretty

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.170 
base right here is definitely pretty
easy<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.649> let's<00:01:56.040> take<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.520> guy<00:01:56.759> out<00:01:56.969> real

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
easy so let's take this guy out real

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.580 
easy so let's take this guy out real
quick<00:01:57.420> I'm<00:01:57.570> just<00:01:57.630> gonna<00:01:57.810> drop<00:01:58.049> all<00:01:58.229> my<00:01:58.350> troops

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
quick I'm just gonna drop all my troops

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.109

on the bottom a couple of witches or

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.910 
on the bottom a couple of witches or
wizards<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.659> top<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.170> I've<00:02:01.710> actually

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
wizards on the top and I've actually

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.679 
wizards on the top and I've actually
been<00:02:02.189> finding<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.610> couple<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.030> bases<00:02:03.360> like<00:02:03.509> this

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
been finding a couple of bases like this

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.899 
been finding a couple of bases like this
I<00:02:03.899> found<00:02:04.170> maybe<00:02:04.649> two<00:02:04.979> or<00:02:05.130> three<00:02:05.159> town<00:02:05.579> lines

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
I found maybe two or three town lines

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.639 
I found maybe two or three town lines
with<00:02:06.210> older<00:02:06.479> their<00:02:06.810> defenses<00:02:07.229> spread<00:02:07.469> out

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
with older their defenses spread out

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.440 
with older their defenses spread out
ready<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.489> get<00:02:08.640> three<00:02:08.849> started<00:02:09.209> because<00:02:09.390> I

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
ready to get three started because I

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.850 
ready to get three started because I
think<00:02:09.509> people<00:02:09.929> who<00:02:10.080> were<00:02:10.200> pushing<00:02:10.530> up<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.679> town

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
think people who were pushing up a town

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.800 
think people who were pushing up a town
online<00:02:11.160> they<00:02:11.340> realize<00:02:11.700> they're<00:02:11.940> sort<00:02:12.180> of

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
online they realize they're sort of

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.059 
online they realize they're sort of
not<00:02:12.900> gonna<00:02:13.020> be<00:02:13.110> able<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.380> defend<00:02:13.680> against<00:02:13.920> the

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
not gonna be able to defend against the

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.680 
not gonna be able to defend against the
three<00:02:14.250> star<00:02:14.459> up<00:02:14.580> here<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:14.940> they<00:02:15.090> might<00:02:15.540> as<00:02:15.660> well

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
three star up here so they might as well

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.180 
three star up here so they might as well
just<00:02:15.840> troll<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.410> put<00:02:16.620> some<00:02:16.770> message<00:02:17.069> or

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
just troll and put some message or

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.920 
just troll and put some message or
whatever<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.670> chop<00:02:18.150> all<00:02:18.300> their<00:02:18.420> defenses<00:02:18.810> on

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
whatever and chop all their defenses on

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.300 
whatever and chop all their defenses on
the<00:02:19.020> bottom<00:02:19.319> so<00:02:19.440> that's<00:02:19.560> what<00:02:19.739> this<00:02:19.890> guy<00:02:20.040> did

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
the bottom so that's what this guy did

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.040 
the bottom so that's what this guy did
and<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:20.970> ended<00:02:21.209> up<00:02:21.330> just<00:02:21.390> storming<00:02:21.840> my<00:02:21.930> way

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
and I ended up just storming my way

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.660 
and I ended up just storming my way
through<00:02:22.200> his<00:02:22.349> base<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.770> getting<00:02:22.950> myself<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.640> a

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
through his base and getting myself to a

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.729 
through his base and getting myself to a
pretty<00:02:23.910> simple<00:02:24.300> three-star<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.020> good<00:02:25.530> stuff

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
pretty simple three-star so good stuff

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.830 
pretty simple three-star so good stuff
there<00:02:26.010> but<00:02:26.220> honestly<00:02:26.610> today<00:02:27.060> was<00:02:27.569> sort<00:02:27.750> of

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
there but honestly today was sort of

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.270 
there but honestly today was sort of
back<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.230> grind<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.709> was<00:02:28.800> really<00:02:29.010> hard

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
back to the grind and it was really hard

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.699 
back to the grind and it was really hard
to<00:02:29.370> find<00:02:29.580> any<00:02:29.790> good<00:02:30.000> bases<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:31.620> these

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
to find any good bases and of these

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.350 
to find any good bases and of these
first<00:02:31.920> two<00:02:32.130> bases<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.519> think<00:02:32.760> took<00:02:32.940> maybe<00:02:33.180> like

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
first two bases I think took maybe like

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.150 
first two bases I think took maybe like
three<00:02:33.630> hours<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.989> find<00:02:34.140> except<00:02:34.590> for<00:02:34.739> Snipes

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
three hours to find except for Snipes

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.400 
three hours to find except for Snipes
because<00:02:35.580> I'm<00:02:35.910> finding<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.569> ton<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:36.900> Town<00:02:37.230> Hall

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410

I have attacked this base a couple times
before<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:19.470> one<00:03:19.680> is<00:03:19.709> a<00:03:19.829> little<00:03:20.010> bit

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
before this one is a little bit

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.620 
before this one is a little bit
different<00:03:20.519> of<00:03:20.549> a<00:03:20.640> variation<00:03:21.209> but<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.450> still

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
different of a variation but I still

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.259 
different of a variation but I still
know<00:03:21.780> how<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:21.930> attack<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:22.650> my<00:03:23.430> tip<00:03:24.060> when<00:03:24.239> I

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
know how to attack it and my tip when I

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.569 
know how to attack it and my tip when I
attack<00:03:24.630> this<00:03:24.810> base<00:03:24.989> using<00:03:25.350> going<00:03:25.650> is<00:03:25.799> I<00:03:26.250> try

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
attack this base using going is I try

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.809 
attack this base using going is I try
not<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:27.000> worry<00:03:27.209> too<00:03:27.299> much<00:03:27.420> about<00:03:27.600> making<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.819> I

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
not to worry too much about making it I

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.699 
not to worry too much about making it I
guess<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.569> get<00:03:30.720> breakthrough<00:03:31.200> point<00:03:31.350> in<00:03:31.590> the

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
guess I get breakthrough point in the

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:32.930 
guess I get breakthrough point in the
center<00:03:31.920> compartment<00:03:32.430> with<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.579> Town<00:03:32.760> Hall

center compartment with the Town Hall

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.580 
center compartment with the Town Hall
because<00:03:33.239> my<00:03:33.390> Queen<00:03:33.690> should<00:03:33.989> be<00:03:34.109> able<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.350> shoot

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
because my Queen should be able to shoot

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.500 
because my Queen should be able to shoot
over<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.950> top<00:03:34.980> as<00:03:35.400> long<00:03:35.910> as<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.150> rest<00:03:36.299> of<00:03:36.450> my

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
over the top as long as the rest of my

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.759 
over the top as long as the rest of my
troops<00:03:36.780> can<00:03:36.959> make<00:03:37.109> their<00:03:37.260> way<00:03:37.350> throughout<00:03:37.620> the

troops can make their way throughout the

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.410 
troops can make their way throughout the
base<00:03:37.920> so<00:03:38.220> I'm<00:03:38.400> just<00:03:38.640> trying<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:38.880> clear<00:03:39.120> out<00:03:39.180> all

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
have enough range to shoot over those

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.449 
have enough range to shoot over those

shooting the Town Hall even though the

shooting the Town Hall even though the
Queen's<00:04:09.480> AI<00:04:09.690> is<00:04:09.870> pretty<00:04:10.319> crazy<00:04:10.500> now<00:04:10.739> it<00:04:10.859> is<00:04:10.980> I

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
Queen's AI is pretty crazy now it is I

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.949 
Queen's AI is pretty crazy now it is I
find<00:04:11.459> that<00:04:11.609> from<00:04:11.970> this<00:04:12.090> base<00:04:12.269> design<00:04:12.630> she

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
find that from this base design she

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.500 
find that from this base design she
almost<00:04:13.260> always<00:04:13.650> will<00:04:14.100> gravitate<00:04:14.850> towards<00:04:15.359> the

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
almost always will gravitate towards the

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.909 
almost always will gravitate towards the
Town<00:04:15.690> Hall<00:04:15.840> towards<00:04:16.229> the<00:04:16.350> end<00:04:16.500> of<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.739> raid<00:04:16.889> so

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
Town Hall towards the end of the raid so

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.340 
Town Hall towards the end of the raid so
forty-nine<00:04:17.669> percent<00:04:17.910> one<00:04:18.720> more<00:04:18.900> building<00:04:19.109> for

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
forty-nine percent one more building for

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.050 
forty-nine percent one more building for
50%<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.280> means<00:04:20.459> we're<00:04:20.639> getting<00:04:20.700> two

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
50% and that means we're getting two

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.719 
50% and that means we're getting two
stars<00:04:21.299> against<00:04:21.930> this<00:04:22.019> 51<00:04:22.560> trophy<00:04:23.159> offer<00:04:23.370> and

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
stars against this 51 trophy offer and

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.430 
stars against this 51 trophy offer and
that<00:04:24.240> we<00:04:24.330> definitely<00:04:24.510> took<00:04:24.810> advantage<00:04:24.870> of

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
that we definitely took advantage of

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.510 
that we definitely took advantage of
probably<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.130> only

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520
