00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
and that's how you make one now you can

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.830 
and that's how you make one now you can
write<00:03:30.360> anything<00:03:30.810> on<00:03:31.200> here<00:03:31.439> you<00:03:31.620> can<00:03:31.680> use<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.010> pin

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
write anything on here you can use a pin

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.080 
write anything on here you can use a pin
and<00:03:33.840> that's<00:03:34.170> how<00:03:34.349> it<00:03:34.409> goes<00:03:34.769> if<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.730> want<00:03:35.760> it

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
and that's how it goes if you want it

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.679 
and that's how it goes if you want it
smaller<00:03:36.569> just<00:03:37.760> take<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:39.379> snip<00:03:40.379> and<00:03:41.239> do<00:03:42.239> that<00:03:42.450> I

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:42.689 
smaller just take a snip and do that I

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.050 
smaller just take a snip and do that I
like<00:03:43.079> taking<00:03:43.379> Smith's<00:03:43.950> before<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:44.489> do<00:03:44.640> it

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
like taking Smith's before I do it

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.649 
like taking Smith's before I do it
because<00:03:45.239> it<00:03:45.720> makes<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.079> more<00:03:46.319> smaller<00:03:47.659> okay

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
because it makes it more smaller okay

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.339 
because it makes it more smaller okay
and<00:03:49.560> then<00:03:50.459> look<00:03:50.730> at<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.390> just<00:03:51.420> compare<00:03:52.290> it

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
and then look at it and just compare it

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.179 
and then look at it and just compare it
see<00:03:53.180> if<00:03:54.180> this<00:03:54.540> is<00:03:54.780> a<00:03:54.810> little<00:03:55.530> bigger<00:03:55.799> than<00:03:55.890> that

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:56.189 
see if this is a little bigger than that

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:01.790
