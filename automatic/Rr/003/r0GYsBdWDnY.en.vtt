00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.849
 Hi, I received a request to show 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.970
 how do I make whipped cream was the carlos 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:13.210
 eduardo or stele is very easy 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.860
 So I decided to show you and now 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.710
 I'll tell you what the 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.350
 ingredients that I will use 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.440
 ingredients are a box of this 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.880
 hence of sour cream and two spoons 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.529
 of sugar soup 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.870
 if you want more you can put a 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.700
 A little more to leave behind, just look at this 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.920
 show how you can put 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.660
 down in the basin with ice water that I go 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.200
 To be honest with you, I've never done this. 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:46.280
 way and still works 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.250
 So now I'm going to hit people and read later. 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.260
 When I save the chili I go 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.070
 put in that bag of confectioners that the 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.360
 bought in a wedge in 12 units 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.320
 I'll put it here because I think it stays 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.120
 easier then it's time to use it here 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.250
 I put the cream and the two 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.229
 spoons of sugar and now it's just 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.770
 hit, I say how long I hit 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.770
 Chantilly 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.490
 Look, I guess for five minutes. 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.070
 this whipped cream I started at speed 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.560
 more feeble for not much spread 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.060
 cream and then I put it on the 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.250
 Maximum speed 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.560
 if you want a little more consistent 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.700
 Just hit some more I like this one. 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.620
 consistency 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.520
 Then I'll put it inside the bag. 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.520
 confectioner now 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.450
 I just put every instant law inside the 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.180
 bag of confectionery the one with 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.260
 capacity for 600 ml gives right looks 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.420
 there only used the way you 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.120
 I hope you have 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.120
 liked until the next video kiss bye
