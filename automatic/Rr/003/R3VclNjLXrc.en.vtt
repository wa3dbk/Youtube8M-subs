00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
that so it's basically a diagonal fold

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.920 
that so it's basically a diagonal fold
so<00:02:34.230> just<00:02:34.500> do<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.519> same<00:02:35.730> thing<00:02:36.000> with<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.750> other

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
so just do the same thing with the other

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:44.920 
so just do the same thing with the other
side<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:41.310> take<00:02:41.549> it<00:02:41.579> and<00:02:41.940> fold<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:43.019> just<00:02:43.410> like<00:02:43.590> so

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
side so take it and fold it just like so

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.490 
side so take it and fold it just like so
and<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.410> should<00:02:47.000> have<00:02:48.000> something<00:02:48.299> that<00:02:48.720> looks

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
and you should have something that looks

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:58.220 
and you should have something that looks
like<00:02:49.739> this<00:02:51.709> so<00:02:52.709> just<00:02:53.489> crease<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:58.170> you

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
like this so just crease it and so you

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.300 
like this so just crease it and so you
should<00:02:58.319> have<00:02:58.440> something<00:02:58.829> that<00:02:58.950> looks<00:02:59.099> like

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
should have something that looks like

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.539 
should have something that looks like
this<00:02:59.810> two<00:03:00.810> flaps<00:03:01.470> at<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.799> bottom<00:03:02.129> with<00:03:02.519> a

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
this two flaps at the bottom with a

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.479 
this two flaps at the bottom with a
little<00:03:02.910> triangle<00:03:03.450> thing<00:03:03.629> at<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.900> top<00:03:04.489> all

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
little triangle thing at the top all

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.250 
little triangle thing at the top all
right<00:03:05.730> so<00:03:05.880> you'll<00:03:06.060> take<00:03:06.299> your<00:03:06.750> model<00:03:07.109> and

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
right so you'll take your model and

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.620 
right so you'll take your model and
you'll<00:03:07.349> flip<00:03:07.560> it<00:03:07.709> over<00:03:07.859> and<00:03:08.359> the<00:03:09.359> little

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
you'll flip it over and the little

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.879 
you'll flip it over and the little
triangle<00:03:09.810> thing<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.349> was<00:03:10.470> at<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.709> top

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
triangle thing that was at the top

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.160 
triangle thing that was at the top
should<00:03:11.340> now<00:03:11.489> be<00:03:11.549> at<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.910> bottom<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:12.359> you'll

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
should now be at the bottom and you'll

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.589 
should now be at the bottom and you'll
take<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.769> you'll<00:03:14.010> take<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.430> from<00:03:14.819> the

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
take it and you'll take it from the

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.059 
take it and you'll take it from the
opposite<00:03:16.019> side<00:03:17.959> so<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.019> took<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.470> triangle

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
opposite side so you took the triangle

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.339 
opposite side so you took the triangle
it<00:03:20.220> was<00:03:20.400> facing<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.239> other<00:03:21.329> way<00:03:21.480> you'll<00:03:22.049> fold

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
it was facing the other way you'll fold

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.309 
it was facing the other way you'll fold
it<00:03:22.530> back<00:03:23.280> on<00:03:23.639> itself<00:03:23.940> basically<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.780> it

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
it back on itself basically and it

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.520 
it back on itself basically and it
should<00:03:25.500> now<00:03:25.650> be<00:03:25.709> visible<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.959> line<00:03:28.169> of<00:03:28.380> the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
should now be visible the line of the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.039 
should now be visible the line of the
triangle<00:03:29.340> should<00:03:29.579> be<00:03:29.700> visible<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.269> you<00:03:30.900> just

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
triangle should be visible and you just

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.339 
triangle should be visible and you just
want<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.319> make<00:03:31.410> sure<00:03:31.470> that<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:33.239> top<00:03:34.079> of<00:03:34.260> the

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
want to make sure that the top of the

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.289 
want to make sure that the top of the
triangle<00:03:34.590> is<00:03:34.950> lined<00:03:35.220> up<00:03:35.340> with<00:03:35.579> the<00:03:35.609> half<00:03:36.000> of

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
triangle is lined up with the half of

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.680 
triangle is lined up with the half of
the<00:03:37.109> paper<00:03:37.639> so<00:03:38.639> that<00:03:38.669> line<00:03:39.209> that's<00:03:39.450> in<00:03:39.599> the

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
the paper so that line that's in the

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.180 
the paper so that line that's in the
center<00:03:39.959> of<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.169> paper<00:03:40.319> just<00:03:40.500> make<00:03:40.859> sure<00:03:41.040> it's

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
center of the paper just make sure it's

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.270 
center of the paper just make sure it's
lined<00:03:41.340> up<00:03:41.579> with<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.530> should<00:03:43.530> have

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
lined up with that and should have

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.039 
lined up with that and should have
something<00:03:44.549> that<00:03:44.669> looks<00:03:44.819> like<00:03:44.970> this<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.900> you

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
something that looks like this and you

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.009 
something that looks like this and you
will<00:03:46.169> fold<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.620> in<00:03:46.769> half<00:03:47.209> along<00:03:48.209> that<00:03:48.480> line<00:03:49.609> and

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
will fold it in half along that line and

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.860 
will fold it in half along that line and
it<00:03:52.019> should<00:03:52.260> look<00:03:52.410> like<00:03:52.470> this<00:03:52.769> so<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:54.720> have

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
it should look like this so you have

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.190 
it should look like this so you have
your<00:03:54.900> first<00:03:55.459> point<00:03:56.459> of<00:03:56.760> your<00:03:57.660> star<00:03:59.480> so<00:04:00.480> you

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
your first point of your star so you

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.909 
your first point of your star so you
just<00:04:01.319> need<00:04:01.700> 15<00:04:02.700> more<00:04:02.849> or<00:04:03.840> more<00:04:04.169> all<00:04:04.590> right<00:04:04.769> so

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
just need 15 more or more all right so

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.650 
just need 15 more or more all right so
you<00:04:05.010> should<00:04:05.040> have<00:04:05.609> something<00:04:05.879> that<00:04:06.239> looks

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
you should have something that looks

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.430 
you should have something that looks
like<00:04:06.989> this<00:04:07.160> when<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.310> are<00:04:08.579> done<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:09.289> it<00:04:10.289> is<00:04:10.410> a

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
like this when you are done and it is a

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.430 
like this when you are done and it is a
lot<00:04:10.680> of<00:04:10.799> work<00:04:10.979> it<00:04:11.459> gets<00:04:11.669> tedious<00:04:11.970> but<00:04:12.870> it's

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
lot of work it gets tedious but it's

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.580 
lot of work it gets tedious but it's
worth<00:04:13.709> it<00:04:13.919> because

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
worth it because

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.569 
worth it because
this<00:04:14.950> part<00:04:15.250> is<00:04:15.430> a<00:04:16.030> lot<00:04:16.389> easier<00:04:17.070> so<00:04:18.070> once<00:04:18.430> you

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
this part is a lot easier so once you

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.659 
this part is a lot easier so once you
have<00:04:18.609> this<00:04:18.940> you<00:04:19.269> will<00:04:19.389> take<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:20.829> back<00:04:21.340> as<00:04:21.609> you

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
have this you will take the back as you

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.080 
have this you will take the back as you
can<00:04:22.389> see<00:04:22.510> it<00:04:22.600> has<00:04:22.690> two<00:04:23.050> pockets<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:24.760> front

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
can see it has two pockets and the front

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.680 
can see it has two pockets and the front
has<00:04:25.540> two<00:04:26.460> points<00:04:27.460> so<00:04:28.060> you'll<00:04:28.180> put<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.479> two

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
has two points so you'll put the two

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.320 
has two points so you'll put the two
points<00:04:28.900> into<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.440> two<00:04:29.860> pockets<00:04:30.370> and<00:04:30.580> there's

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
points into the two pockets and there's

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.000 
points into the two pockets and there's
a<00:04:31.389> divider<00:04:31.840> in<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.139> middle<00:04:32.380> so<00:04:32.560> you<00:04:32.590> put<00:04:32.800> one

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
a divider in the middle so you put one

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.219 
a divider in the middle so you put one
point<00:04:33.280> on<00:04:33.430> one<00:04:33.580> side<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:34.060> other<00:04:34.330> point<00:04:34.780> on<00:04:34.930> the

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
point on one side the other point on the

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.200 
point on one side the other point on the
other<00:04:35.320> side<00:04:35.590> so<00:04:36.370> it<00:04:36.639> should<00:04:36.970> look<00:04:37.150> something

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
other side so it should look something

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.879 
other side so it should look something
like<00:04:37.690> this<00:04:38.400> so<00:04:39.400> you<00:04:39.490> put<00:04:39.699> one<00:04:40.360> point<00:04:40.720> on<00:04:41.139> one

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
like this so you put one point on one

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.740 
like this so you put one point on one
side<00:04:42.130> one<00:04:42.580> point<00:04:42.820> on<00:04:42.910> the<00:04:43.030> other<00:04:43.150> and<00:04:43.419> they're

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
side one point on the other and they're

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.490 
side one point on the other and they're
both<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:44.590> divider<00:04:44.949> is<00:04:45.190> in<00:04:45.370> between<00:04:45.460> them<00:04:45.880> both

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
both the divider is in between them both

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.850 
both the divider is in between them both
and<00:04:47.520> you'll<00:04:48.520> keep<00:04:48.790> doing<00:04:49.630> that<00:04:49.840> until<00:04:50.850> you

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:37.069 
you get to this last point you will take

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:40.680 
you get to this last point you will take
it<00:05:37.280> and<00:05:37.430> you'll<00:05:37.879> put<00:05:38.060> the<00:05:38.240> first<00:05:38.599> two<00:05:39.500> points

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
it and you'll put the first two points

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.860 
it and you'll put the first two points
into<00:05:41.690> the<00:05:42.050> last<00:05:42.800> two<00:05:43.099> pockets<00:05:43.610> so<00:05:44.599> it<00:05:44.690> should

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
into the last two pockets so it should

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.709 
into the last two pockets so it should
be<00:05:44.900> something<00:05:45.259> like<00:05:45.469> this<00:05:45.770> and<00:05:46.270> your<00:05:47.270> second

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:47.719 
be something like this and your second

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:51.399 
be something like this and your second
point<00:05:47.960> like<00:05:48.379> the<00:05:49.039> second<00:05:49.719> point<00:05:50.719> of<00:05:50.990> your<00:05:51.139> star

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:51.409 
point like the second point of your star

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:53.140 
point like the second point of your star
that<00:05:51.620> you<00:05:51.650> insert<00:05:52.069> it<00:05:52.159> it<00:05:52.460> should<00:05:52.669> become

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
that you insert it it should become

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.740 
that you insert it it should become
disconnected<00:05:53.659> from<00:05:54.020> the<00:05:54.139> first<00:05:54.379> one<00:05:54.560> because

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
disconnected from the first one because

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.320 
disconnected from the first one because
they're<00:05:56.750> loosely<00:05:57.280> into<00:05:58.280> each<00:05:58.370> other<00:05:58.550> but<00:05:58.759> when

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
they're loosely into each other but when

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.450 
they're loosely into each other but when
you<00:05:59.419> put<00:05:59.449> the<00:05:59.690> second<00:06:00.080> one<00:06:00.229> inside<00:06:01.069> back

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
you put the second one inside back

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.640 
you put the second one inside back
inside<00:06:01.490> of<00:06:01.969> the<00:06:02.029> first<00:06:02.240> one<00:06:02.479> it<00:06:03.379> might<00:06:03.529> be<00:06:03.620> a

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
inside of the first one it might be a

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.820 
inside of the first one it might be a
little<00:06:03.830> bit<00:06:04.039> difficult<00:06:04.219> at<00:06:04.669> first<00:06:04.930> but<00:06:05.930> when

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
little bit difficult at first but when

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.300 
little bit difficult at first but when
you<00:06:06.949> put<00:06:06.979> it<00:06:07.189> back<00:06:07.370> inside<00:06:07.550> you<00:06:08.360> then<00:06:08.629> just

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
you put it back inside you then just

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.029 
you put it back inside you then just
make<00:06:10.310> the<00:06:10.550> circle<00:06:10.969> smaller<00:06:11.509> and<00:06:11.840> more<00:06:12.710> stable

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 
make the circle smaller and more stable

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.430 
make the circle smaller and more stable
so<00:06:13.400> you<00:06:13.490> just<00:06:13.669> squeeze<00:06:14.029> it<00:06:14.060> while<00:06:15.020> it's<00:06:15.199> flat

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
so you just squeeze it while it's flat

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.619 
so you just squeeze it while it's flat
and<00:06:15.620> don't<00:06:16.219> do<00:06:16.400> what<00:06:17.060> I'm<00:06:17.180> doing<00:06:17.210> right<00:06:17.539> here

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:17.629 
and don't do what I'm doing right here

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:20.499 
and don't do what I'm doing right here
because<00:06:18.440> it<00:06:18.740> doesn't<00:06:19.009> work<00:06:19.129> you'll<00:06:19.909> just<00:06:20.150> make

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:20.509 
because it doesn't work you'll just make

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.619 
because it doesn't work you'll just make
it<00:06:20.569> fall<00:06:20.870> apart<00:06:21.219> but<00:06:22.219> so<00:06:22.610> the<00:06:22.909> best<00:06:23.240> way<00:06:23.449> is<00:06:23.509> to

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:23.629 
it fall apart but so the best way is to

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:25.950 
it fall apart but so the best way is to
lay<00:06:23.839> it<00:06:23.930> down<00:06:24.050> flat<00:06:24.319> and<00:06:24.589> to<00:06:24.830> squat<00:06:25.159> squash<00:06:25.699> it

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
lay it down flat and to squat squash it

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.469 
lay it down flat and to squat squash it
until<00:06:26.960> it<00:06:27.259> the<00:06:28.039> center<00:06:28.430> looks<00:06:28.879> like<00:06:29.029> a<00:06:29.060> circle

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 
until it the center looks like a circle

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:31.990 
until it the center looks like a circle
so<00:06:30.409> if<00:06:30.529> you<00:06:30.620> want<00:06:30.770> to<00:06:30.830> make<00:06:30.949> it<00:06:31.099> sturdy<00:06:31.819> enough

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
so if you want to make it sturdy enough

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.689 
so if you want to make it sturdy enough
to<00:06:32.960> like<00:06:33.379> throw<00:06:33.740> up<00:06:33.770> people<00:06:34.129> or<00:06:34.550> whatever

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:34.699 
to like throw up people or whatever

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:36.100 
to like throw up people or whatever

00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:40.279 
know but you just tape the inside just

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:42.129
