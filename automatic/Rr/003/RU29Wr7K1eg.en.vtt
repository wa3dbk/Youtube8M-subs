00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
opposed to like the three or four that I

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.240 
opposed to like the three or four that I
would<00:03:11.900> have<00:03:12.019> an<00:03:12.109> adult<00:03:12.349> because<00:03:12.889> of<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.069> fact

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
would have an adult because of the fact

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.890 
would have an adult because of the fact
that<00:03:13.310> I<00:03:13.430> used<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.670> have<00:03:13.849> to<00:03:14.000> mix<00:03:14.299> these<00:03:14.510> with<00:03:14.870> a

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
that I used to have to mix these with a

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.360 
that I used to have to mix these with a
carrier<00:03:15.319> oil<00:03:15.349> I<00:03:15.709> didn't<00:03:15.920> want<00:03:16.040> it<00:03:16.069> to<00:03:16.130> be<00:03:16.250> as

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
carrier oil I didn't want it to be as

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.020 
carrier oil I didn't want it to be as
potent<00:03:16.910> so<00:03:17.660> I<00:03:17.930> definitely<00:03:18.859> recommend<00:03:19.489> the

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030
