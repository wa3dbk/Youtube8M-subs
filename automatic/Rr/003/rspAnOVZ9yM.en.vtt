00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:14.169
 this lack of rain and this high temperature 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.430
 whose values ​​are more than 10 degrees above normal 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.039
 for this type k of the year 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.230
 begins a period of drought in a large part of the Argentine territory and very 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.920
 little bit there with relatively unity 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.890
 see what happened this week 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.520
 in the south of brazil it practically did not rain around 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.740
 10 millimeters nothing more between five and ten in general the same in the south of 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.830
 paraguay and the same the place is very hypocritical rains virtually nothing 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.790
 only on the river uruguay 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.910
 they fell 16 millimeters and in the north in the center of formosa 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.740
 therese millimeters this the mound 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.990
 in inns only 4 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.220
 between 1 biniez we could say in the north of the littoral 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.020
 i roughly about a millimeter in the northern provinces 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.040
 practically bag and has not rained anything picket 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.399
 between zero and one millimeter 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.970
 or practically some drizzle were 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.880
 and sheep intermittent not even be true 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.860
 percent the one for two or three days 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.320
 as it usually is at this time of year 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.180
 and we were saying last time that there is only one anticyclone 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.159
 blockade in the south 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.490
 we are going to have enough to produce good rains throughout 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.470
 the central zone in patagonia 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.630
 Of course this happens when falling in the mountains 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.270
 between 70 and 90 millimeters and I tell you that there is in Chile 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.980
 between 100 and 150 millimeters 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.080
 I was in Bariloche and the Andes 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.130
 meanwhile in the north of patagonia there were 20 millimeters of rain 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.220
 a rain 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.510
 that the people press 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.750
 previously I can say more or less normal for this time 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.410
 I said at the beginning that it's just a blocking bronze situation 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.699
 can save us from this drought 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.679
 she starts already started 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.029
 to insinuate itself in a large part of the Argentine territory 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:15.100
 and what it puts us 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.479
 quite 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:18.440
 is doubtful with respect to 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.440
 the sowing of wheat because everything is over is happening the time 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.509
 and the sowing time is ending, that is to say that fidel soon practically 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.599
 the wheat of the next season 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.689
 it's going to decrease a lot more 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.309
 of what is 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:37.699
 considering the people who analyze 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:38.799
 that topic 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.799
 and I had been saying it from the beginning since a long time ago 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.849
 that this was going to happen that you will have less rain than normal 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.139
