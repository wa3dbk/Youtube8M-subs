for<00:00:31.550> this<00:00:31.699> video<00:00:31.939> by<00:00:32.390> not<00:00:32.570> using<00:00:32.840> bomb<00:00:33.350> towers

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
for this video by not using bomb towers

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.640 
for this video by not using bomb towers
at<00:00:34.160> all<00:00:34.310> because<00:00:34.910> as<00:00:35.300> we<00:00:35.480> all<00:00:35.510> know<00:00:35.660> bombs<00:00:36.080> ROP

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
at all because as we all know bombs ROP

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.280 
at all because as we all know bombs ROP
in<00:00:36.800> this<00:00:37.010> mission<00:00:37.250> if<00:00:37.580> you<00:00:38.300> simply<00:00:38.720> get<00:00:38.900> seven

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
in this mission if you simply get seven

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.440 
in this mission if you simply get seven
mothers<00:00:39.710> or<00:00:39.920> so<00:00:40.160> and<00:00:40.370> a<00:00:40.460> good<00:00:40.640> bloom<00:00:40.880> defense

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
mothers or so and a good bloom defense

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.810 
mothers or so and a good bloom defense
you<00:00:41.780> can<00:00:41.960> win<00:00:42.200> this<00:00:42.380> pretty<00:00:42.770> handily<00:00:43.130> so<00:00:43.790> I

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
you can win this pretty handily so I

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.880 
you can win this pretty handily so I
decided<00:00:44.420> to<00:00:44.570> stray<00:00:44.930> away<00:00:44.960> from<00:00:45.290> that<00:00:45.650> because

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
decided to stray away from that because

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.640 
decided to stray away from that because
doing<00:00:46.400> the<00:00:46.700> same<00:00:47.000> strategy<00:00:47.690> that<00:00:47.720> 100<00:00:48.470> people

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
doing the same strategy that 100 people

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.790 
doing the same strategy that 100 people
already<00:00:49.100> uploaded<00:00:49.460> is<00:00:49.880> kind<00:00:50.180> of<00:00:50.330> bland<00:00:50.800> so

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
already uploaded is kind of bland so

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.920 
already uploaded is kind of bland so
yeah<00:00:52.100> basically<00:00:52.700> all<00:00:53.210> I<00:00:53.240> need<00:00:53.630> for<00:00:53.840> the

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
yeah basically all I need for the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.080 
yeah basically all I need for the
balloon<00:00:54.200> popping<00:00:54.680> power<00:00:55.130> is<00:00:55.400> an<00:00:55.550> Arctic<00:00:55.940> when

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
balloon popping power is an Arctic when

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.480 
balloon popping power is an Arctic when
paired<00:00:56.480> with<00:00:56.600> a<00:00:56.780> 2/3<00:00:57.290> village<00:00:57.680> and<00:00:57.950> that<00:00:58.280> will

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
paired with a 2/3 village and that will

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.880 
paired with a 2/3 village and that will
take<00:00:58.700> of<00:00:58.880> everything<00:00:59.110> for<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.170> Moab<00:01:00.440> and

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
take of everything for the Moab and

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.160 
take of everything for the Moab and
popping<00:01:01.340> power<00:01:01.640> though<00:01:01.940> I'm<00:01:02.240> going<00:01:02.840> to<00:01:02.990> need

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
popping power though I'm going to need

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.290 
popping power though I'm going to need
to<00:01:03.380> whole<00:01:03.560> lot<00:01:03.890> more<00:01:04.129> towers<00:01:04.640> in<00:01:04.850> order<00:01:05.150> to

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
to whole lot more towers in order to

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.290 
to whole lot more towers in order to
deal<00:01:05.540> with<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:06.020> Z<00:01:06.310> oMG<00:01:07.310> since<00:01:07.700> I<00:01:07.880> don't<00:01:07.940> have

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
deal with the Z oMG since I don't have

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.950 
deal with the Z oMG since I don't have
any<00:01:08.570> Moab<00:01:09.080> mothers<00:01:09.760> so<00:01:10.760> as<00:01:10.940> you<00:01:11.090> can<00:01:11.270> see<00:01:11.510> I<00:01:11.540> use

any Moab mothers so as you can see I use

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.610 
any Moab mothers so as you can see I use
spike<00:01:12.350> factories<00:01:13.240> engineers<00:01:14.320> darling<00:01:15.320> guns

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
spike factories engineers darling guns

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.250 
spike factories engineers darling guns
and<00:01:15.980> my<00:01:16.490> other<00:01:16.670> spare<00:01:17.180> towers<00:01:17.750> which

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
and my other spare towers which

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.650 
and my other spare towers which
hopefully<00:01:18.590> should<00:01:18.980> be<00:01:19.340> enough<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:20.450> it

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
hopefully should be enough and it

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.750 
hopefully should be enough and it
probably<00:01:21.200> should<00:01:21.470> be<00:01:21.500> because<00:01:22.250> who<00:01:22.460> in<00:01:22.610> the

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
probably should be because who in the
