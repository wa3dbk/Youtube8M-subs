00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
thick heavy shaving cream now what we're

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.440 
thick heavy shaving cream now what we're
gonna<00:02:21.810> do<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.770> pour<00:02:23.160> our<00:02:23.400> dry<00:02:23.640> ingredients<00:02:23.670> all

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
gonna do is pour our dry ingredients all

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.870 
gonna do is pour our dry ingredients all
at<00:02:24.690> once<00:02:24.900> into<00:02:25.230> our<00:02:25.709> meringue<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.310> begin

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
at once into our meringue and begin

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.250 
at once into our meringue and begin
folding<00:02:28.400> since<00:02:29.400> folding<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.209> batter<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.750> one

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
folding since folding the batter is one

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.960 
folding since folding the batter is one
of<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.440> key<00:02:31.650> components<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:32.489> making

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
of the key components of making

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.120 
of the key components of making
macaroons<00:02:33.410> there<00:02:34.410> are<00:02:34.530> two<00:02:34.680> things<00:02:34.830> that<00:02:34.950> you

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
macaroons there are two things that you

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.880 
macaroons there are two things that you
want<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.370> look<00:02:35.459> out<00:02:35.640> for<00:02:35.880> one<00:02:36.750> if<00:02:36.989> your<00:02:37.590> batter

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
want to look out for one if your batter

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.430 
want to look out for one if your batter
has<00:02:38.280> reached<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.910> consistency<00:02:39.120> similar<00:02:40.050> to

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
has reached the consistency similar to

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.920 
has reached the consistency similar to
that<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:41.010> pancake<00:02:41.400> batter<00:02:41.580> then<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.780> can

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
that of a pancake batter then you can

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.290 
that of a pancake batter then you can
stop<00:02:43.170> at<00:02:43.320> that<00:02:43.410> point<00:02:43.680> another<00:02:44.580> thing<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.150> can

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
stop at that point another thing you can

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.510 
stop at that point another thing you can
do<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.720> test<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.739> draw<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:46.950> line<00:02:47.220> with<00:02:47.489> your

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
do to test is to draw a line with your

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.430 
do to test is to draw a line with your
spatula<00:02:47.880> along<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.570> bottom<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:49.110> your<00:02:49.230> batter

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
spatula along the bottom of your batter

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.979 
spatula along the bottom of your batter
and<00:02:49.800> if<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.340> comes<00:02:50.430> together<00:02:50.700> in<00:02:51.390> about<00:02:51.600> five

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
and if it comes together in about five

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.560 
and if it comes together in about five
seconds<00:02:52.560> then<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.580> know<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.820> should<00:02:53.940> stop<00:02:54.330> at

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
seconds then you know you should stop at

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:01.699 
seconds then you know you should stop at
that<00:02:54.720> point<00:02:59.570> now<00:03:00.570> what<00:03:00.780> we're<00:03:00.930> gonna<00:03:01.019> do<00:03:01.320> is

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
that point now what we're gonna do is

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:10.300 
that point now what we're gonna do is
fill<00:03:02.040> up<00:03:02.310> our<00:03:02.519> piping<00:03:02.910> bag<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.360> begin<00:03:03.930> piping

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.130 

once<00:03:11.310> we've<00:03:11.489> primed<00:03:11.790> our<00:03:11.940> macaroons<00:03:12.450> we're

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
once we've primed our macaroons we're

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.660 
once we've primed our macaroons we're
gonna<00:03:13.230> let<00:03:13.470> them<00:03:13.620> sit<00:03:13.799> out<00:03:13.860> for<00:03:14.190> about<00:03:14.280> thirty

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
gonna let them sit out for about thirty

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.390 
gonna let them sit out for about thirty
minutes<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:15.299> let<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:16.019> tops<00:03:16.350> of<00:03:16.560> them<00:03:16.739> harden<00:03:17.310> a

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
minutes to let the tops of them harden a

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.370 
minutes to let the tops of them harden a
bit<00:03:17.580> in<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.330> meantime<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.870> want<00:03:19.049> to<00:03:19.140> pre-heat

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
bit in the meantime you want to pre-heat

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
chilled enough I whipped it up with a

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.180 
chilled enough I whipped it up with a
whisk<00:04:26.150> really<00:04:26.690> quick<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:27.170> put<00:04:27.890> it<00:04:27.980> in<00:04:28.100> a

whisk really quick and put it in a

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.840 
whisk really quick and put it in a
piping<00:04:28.370> bag<00:04:28.700> and<00:04:29.260> started<00:04:30.260> piping<00:04:30.440> away<00:04:30.850> now

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
piping bag and started piping away now

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.940

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
all that's left to do is finish up these

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.020
