team by using this guy an AI injector
which<00:01:43.740> just<00:01:43.979> has<00:01:44.130> no<00:01:44.340> recipe<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:44.970> that's<00:01:45.479> kind

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
which just has no recipe so that's kind

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.730 
which just has no recipe so that's kind
of<00:01:45.720> something<00:01:45.899> going<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.320> spawn<00:01:46.560> in

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
of something going to have to spawn in

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.249 
of something going to have to spawn in
there<00:01:47.119> but<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.450> actually<00:01:48.600> move<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.930> pieces

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
there but to actually move the pieces

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.679 
there but to actually move the pieces
you're<00:01:49.560> going<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.890> need<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.280> black<00:01:50.790> piece<00:01:51.479> which

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
you're going to need a black piece which

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.090 
you're going to need a black piece which
is<00:01:51.720> made<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.290> with<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.530> stick<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.890> for

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
is made like this with a stick and for

is made like this with a stick and for
black<00:01:53.490> hole<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.000> then<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.149> white<00:01:55.219> moving<00:01:56.219> piece

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
black hole and then a white moving piece

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.249 
black hole and then a white moving piece
which<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.759> made<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.180> same<00:01:57.390> way<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:58.170> with

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
which is made the same way just with

this guy here and I could make the white

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.650 
this guy here and I could make the white
pieces<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.150> computer<00:02:21.599> so<00:02:23.239> as<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.420> can<00:02:24.540> see

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
pieces the computer so as you can see

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.229 
pieces the computer so as you can see
Jess<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.050> am<00:02:25.200> let's<00:02:25.920> see<00:02:26.190> it's<00:02:26.370> kind<00:02:26.849> of<00:02:26.940> talking

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
Jess I am let's see it's kind of talking

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.150 
Jess I am let's see it's kind of talking
or<00:02:27.480> thinking<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:28.020> think<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.590> might<00:02:28.680> be<00:02:28.739> his<00:02:29.010> turn

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
or thinking I think it might be his turn

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.890 
or thinking I think it might be his turn
first<00:02:29.459> but<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.269> way<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.420> would<00:02:30.569> move<00:02:30.720> your

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
first but the way you would move your

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.210 
first but the way you would move your
pieces<00:02:31.110> you'd<00:02:31.470> right<00:02:31.650> click<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.040> then

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
pieces you'd right click it and then

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.009 
pieces you'd right click it and then
it'll<00:02:32.819> be<00:02:32.849> green<00:02:33.180> whatever<00:02:33.480> you're<00:02:33.810> actually

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
it'll be green whatever you're actually

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.080 
it'll be green whatever you're actually
allowed<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.530> move<00:02:35.099> it<00:02:35.280> but<00:02:35.879> it's<00:02:36.000> actually

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
allowed to move it but it's actually

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.940 
allowed to move it but it's actually
whites<00:02:36.480> turn<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:36.989> need<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.260> hurry<00:02:37.410> up<00:02:37.620> so

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
whites turn so I need to hurry up so

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.559 
whites turn so I need to hurry up so
yeah<00:02:38.099> as<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:38.730> guys<00:02:38.849> saw<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.030> that's<00:02:39.390> the

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
yeah as you guys saw that that's the

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.259 
yeah as you guys saw that that's the
horse<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.050> we're<00:02:40.290> like<00:02:40.440> night<00:02:40.709> rather<00:02:40.890> and

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
horse and we're like night rather and

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.430 
horse and we're like night rather and
it's<00:02:42.269> like<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.720> piece<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:42.959> looks<00:02:43.230> like<00:02:43.410> a

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
it's like the piece that looks like a

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.720 
it's like the piece that looks like a
horse<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:43.980> feels<00:02:44.129> like<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.280> really<00:02:44.550> cool

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
horse and it feels like a really cool

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.820 
horse and it feels like a really cool
animation<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.420> kind<00:02:45.599> of<00:02:45.629> just<00:02:45.780> jumps<00:02:46.319> up<00:02:46.530> I

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
animation it kind of just jumps up I

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.380 
animation it kind of just jumps up I
think<00:02:47.160> it's<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.340> only<00:02:47.730> chess<00:02:47.940> piece<00:02:48.120> sounds

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
think it's the only chess piece sounds

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.449 
think it's the only chess piece sounds
like<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.569> cool<00:02:48.720> animation<00:02:49.230> but<00:02:49.860> let's<00:02:50.250> play<00:02:50.430> a

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
like a cool animation but let's play a

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.690 
like a cool animation but let's play a
quick<00:02:50.670> game<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.970> chess<00:02:51.150> here<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:52.400> we'll<00:02:53.400> see

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
but I mean it's a computer i'm pretty

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.220 
but I mean it's a computer i'm pretty
sure<00:03:06.540> there's<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.780> way<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.900> could<00:03:07.050> probably

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
sure there's a way you could probably

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.199 
sure there's a way you could probably
change<00:03:07.409> the<00:03:07.590> difficulty<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.190> this<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.640> once

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
change the difficulty of this and once

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.720 
change the difficulty of this and once
you<00:03:09.300> actually<00:03:09.450> take<00:03:09.810> down<00:03:10.050> somebody's<00:03:10.680> a

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
you actually take down somebody's a

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:18.589 
you actually take down somebody's a
piece<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.970> get<00:03:12.120> experience<00:03:12.569> from<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.840> so<00:03:17.599> as

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
piece you get experience from it so as
