00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.159 
comes up very high so this is still
pretty<00:04:46.070> somber<00:04:46.699> but<00:04:47.030> if<00:04:47.180> I<00:04:47.330> were<00:04:47.510> to<00:04:47.690> close<00:04:47.900> it

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
pretty somber but if I were to close it

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.640 
pretty somber but if I were to close it
up<00:04:48.289> like<00:04:49.130> this<00:04:49.430> I<00:04:49.760> think<00:04:50.270> you'll<00:04:50.599> agree<00:04:50.870> it's

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
up like this I think you'll agree it's

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.370 
up like this I think you'll agree it's
extremely<00:04:52.400> somber<00:04:52.880> so<00:04:53.300> whenever<00:04:53.690> a<00:04:53.930> layer<00:04:54.260> of

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
extremely somber so whenever a layer of

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.820 
extremely somber so whenever a layer of
black<00:04:54.500> jacket<00:04:55.220> I<00:04:55.690> always<00:04:56.690> wear<00:04:56.990> a<00:04:57.020> brooch<00:04:57.440> and

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
black jacket I always wear a brooch and

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.159 
black jacket I always wear a brooch and
I<00:04:57.949> wear<00:04:58.190> one<00:04:58.430> it's<00:04:58.669> in<00:04:59.289> bold<00:05:00.460> bold<00:05:01.960> silver<00:05:02.960> or

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
I wear one it's in bold bold silver or

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.560 
I wear one it's in bold bold silver or
something<00:05:03.740> close<00:05:03.949> to<00:05:04.010> that<00:05:04.220> let's<00:05:05.150> just<00:05:05.360> put

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
something close to that let's just put

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.620 
something close to that let's just put
this<00:05:05.720> on<00:05:05.990> quickly<00:05:08.710> so<00:05:09.710> you<00:05:09.770> can<00:05:10.039> get<00:05:10.190> an<00:05:10.310> idea

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
this on quickly so you can get an idea

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.500 
this on quickly so you can get an idea
that<00:05:11.630> this<00:05:11.810> indeed<00:05:12.199> does<00:05:12.940> defeat<00:05:13.940> the<00:05:14.270> black

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
that this indeed does defeat the black

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.930 
that this indeed does defeat the black
and<00:05:14.810> it<00:05:14.900> keeps<00:05:15.110> it<00:05:15.320> from<00:05:15.590> looking<00:05:15.800> too<00:05:16.310> serious

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
and it keeps it from looking too serious

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.920 
and it keeps it from looking too serious
so<00:05:17.570> I've<00:05:17.960> got<00:05:18.199> lots<00:05:18.590> of<00:05:18.889> brooches<00:05:19.610> that<00:05:19.930> are

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
so I've got lots of brooches that are

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.500 
so I've got lots of brooches that are
actually<00:05:21.410> made<00:05:21.919> of<00:05:22.070> leather<00:05:22.340> and<00:05:22.639> fabric<00:05:23.060> this

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
actually made of leather and fabric this

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.439 
actually made of leather and fabric this
one<00:05:23.750> is<00:05:23.900> leather<00:05:24.139> and<00:05:24.849> this<00:05:25.849> defeats<00:05:26.300> the

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
one is leather and this defeats the

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.270 
one is leather and this defeats the
black<00:05:26.630> also<00:05:27.080> and<00:05:27.229> keeps<00:05:27.500> it<00:05:27.650> from<00:05:27.680> being<00:05:28.010> so

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
black also and keeps it from being so

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.120 
black also and keeps it from being so
somber<00:05:28.820> and<00:05:29.180> so<00:05:29.419> severe<00:05:29.960> so<00:05:30.590> if<00:05:30.919> you're

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
somber and so severe so if you're

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.189 
somber and so severe so if you're
looking<00:05:31.430> for<00:05:32.680> ideas<00:05:33.820> to<00:05:34.820> change<00:05:35.479> the<00:05:35.780> way<00:05:35.900> your

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:36.199

looking for ideas to change the way your
black<00:05:36.500> suit<00:05:36.800> looks<00:05:37.430> from<00:05:37.729> one<00:05:37.909> day<00:05:38.120> to<00:05:38.150> the

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
black suit looks from one day to the

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.600 
black suit looks from one day to the
