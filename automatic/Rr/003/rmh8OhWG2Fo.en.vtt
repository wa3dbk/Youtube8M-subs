00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:13.580
I wander through this undawning night on an endless journey

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:23.250
by a road that reaches far into the distant sky.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:37.040
The moon again tonight shines its light upon the world.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:46.870
O how I cannot escape this dreamlike tale!

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.490
“This red thread…

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:01.840
Where does it lead? What is it pointing to?”

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.800
Without a sound,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:16.270
I swallow these meaningless questions.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:29.240
Under the drifting clouds, even though the ages may fade

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:42.320
with this unchanging life, I can keep shining for you…

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:06.180
Moistening the earth, your tears

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:15.630
sank into my heart and for an instant, reflected it…

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.010
I’m overflowing with emotions,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:30.670
more than I can convey in words.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:45.440
From now on, let’s face the coming morning together.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:58.180
Overcoming even time and space, may my gaze, though fraught with sin

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:10.780
lead you on to happiness…

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:54.430
Under the drifting clouds, even though the ages may fade

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:06.350
with this unchanging life, I can keep shining for you…

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:18.210
Overcoming even time and space, may my gaze, though fraught with sin

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:33.560
lead you on to happiness…
