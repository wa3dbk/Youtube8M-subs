00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.110
 Hello everyone, today I am going to teach you 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.820
 set up a command 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:12.190
 of xbox good a command of xbox not 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.760
 configure any command so that 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.190
 emulate one of xbox and thus be able to play 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.490
 gta 4 with a command or control as 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.119
 want to call 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.380
 without it having to be the xbox 360 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.330
 then the first thing we need is 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.640
 a command or control like what it is to call 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.000
 I call him command you that we need a 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.580
 I send 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.950
 I'm using one of play 2 that I've 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.989
 connected by an adapter to 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.140
 computer you can use one of computers 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.710
 and one of play 3 if you can get it 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.510
 connect to the computer is easy me to what 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.260
 better someday I make a video of how it 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.750
 make 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.110
 If you do not look for it there, I 'm sure 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.790
 you will find 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.260
 You can also connect a Wii Remote 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.450
 but I do not recommend it because I do not know 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.870
 how will they lower it gta 4 I have tried it not 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.399
 no no 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.989
 but I'm going to do it with the 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.390
 you can also do it with a 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.360
 computer is not that you buy the 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.920
 Chinese well that's the first thing and what 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.840
 second that we are is to download a 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.320
 file but here a moment that I just 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.200
 to make the video is good 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.490
 I've done before this one since how 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.460
 put one on 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.500
 in gta 4 to 100% looking if you want 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.390
 I leave the link the description too 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.649
 but we have to go to this link that 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.710
 is in the description that is for 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.790
 download the file 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.790
 I had open 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.210
 and we keep it, I'm going to 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.830
 save desktop for example 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.830
 bad we can close the browser 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.930
 and tickets also to you not 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.750
 you will have and we will extract with the wing 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.360
 weird with something similar and we're going to open 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.170
 the folder we take we copy all 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.980
 our archives with the right to copy 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.530
 we are going to team 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.640
 the local disk good the route we will go 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.380
 route to 7-4 were recorded 7 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.180
 to 4 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.180
 right here we are going to hit it 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.379
 I already have it 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.519
 I'm going to put it copy is move 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.890
 you will leave us because you do not 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.750
 you will have 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.180
 this would be better if you do not go out you can 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.630
 continue if you do not leave if not nothing and we 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.600
 let's go to the file 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.570
 and this 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.630
 which is called input test and here we will see 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.750
 what comes out 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.860
 we get a command from the xbox here what 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.370
 first thing we have to do is put 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.709
 controller one 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.989
 if you want they can put more controls more 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.330
 of one since you put here 1 2 3 but for 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.040
 put the first one by tunis 1 and here 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.500
 check that the buttons this good 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.390
 I send here some numbers because 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.920
 is a little more expensive and abortions in 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.090
 0 if no principle will come about 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.800
 numbers do not worry about walking 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.020
 perfectly even if it is waterfall 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.569
 good you try buttons to see what you 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.819
 work 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.010
 and they will get that coming out for example if 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.800
 you are pressing the back as they enter you 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.440
 here some numbers 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.020
 it may be that they have invested that 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.340
 you are pressing the front and you 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.350
 come out those from behind that is what I 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.910
 happens to me happens with some controls not you 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.860
 you worry only when you play 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.530
 they would have the controls turned upside down instead 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.080
 to use this one again instead of 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.270
 to use this we will use this and even what 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.760
 same day and we check that all the 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.380
 buttons work correctly 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.230
 in principle, the service will work 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.580
 crosspiece the two joysticks is 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.010
 It is recommended that you have joysticks in 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.200
 controls 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.360
 that goes a lot better here you can 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.340
 test if your control has the motor 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.519
 of vibration you can try the works 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.560
 and well with this we can close this 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:48.450
 and for the next step it would be in gta 4 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.000
 we see you there, well, here you can see 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.890
 that the side works perfectly you see 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.970
 Well, now you will see it is that 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.590
 I'm talking over the video 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.770
 because he has a problem with the plate he 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.840
 he put it back to him that I recorded the micro 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.530
 and now in the next video of 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.270
 solve myself if I do another now not 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.910
 to another 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.710
 and good when you use the mouse and the 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.570
 keyboard already puts you the commands that 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.660
 you have a contract on the keyboard and if 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.190
 you want to use the command, then you play a 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.850
 button and that's it, all the 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.200
 control commands 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.660
 you can use moving with the command and 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.070
 pointing with the mouse if you want that yes 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.620
 with the command to tip automatically I 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.840
 I say that that helps multiplayer a lot 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.820
 it depends that nothing to the server some what 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.490
 allow others is not a thing that you have 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.690
 that allowed you to create yours server 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.040
 and they put what they can 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.460
 I do not know how you want it is good now 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.980
 I will leave with what remains of video is mode 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.530
 gameplay 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.480
 simple shows that I teach you that everything 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.730
 it works properly and all that and 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.590
 Well I hope you liked it 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.840
 I have also served 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.220
 like if they worked for you if you did not 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.630
 we have worked putting it in the 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.190
 comments why it happens to you and I 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.510
 I will try to find a solution 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.510
 I will answer as soon as possible 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.140
 And until next time
