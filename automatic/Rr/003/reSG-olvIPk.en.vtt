all right of your blue and kind of hit
the<00:00:48.640> side<00:00:49.060> so<00:00:49.420> they're<00:00:49.570> not<00:00:49.750> mixing<00:00:50.050> just<00:00:50.950> put

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
the side so they're not mixing just put

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.460 
the side so they're not mixing just put
a<00:00:51.220> little<00:00:51.400> bit<00:00:51.670> in<00:00:51.880> there<00:00:52.270> it's<00:00:52.840> kind<00:00:53.050> of<00:00:53.110> hard

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
a little bit in there it's kind of hard

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.650 
a little bit in there it's kind of hard
because<00:00:54.130> we<00:00:54.489> know<00:00:54.700> that<00:00:54.730> we're<00:00:55.180> talking<00:00:55.570> about

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
because we know that we're talking about

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.139 
because we know that we're talking about
the<00:00:55.810> primary<00:00:56.290> colors<00:00:56.800> blue<00:00:56.829> yellow<00:00:57.700> and<00:00:57.880> red

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
the primary colors blue yellow and red

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.200 
the primary colors blue yellow and red
so<00:00:59.079> we<00:00:59.110> don't<00:00:59.320> put<00:00:59.950> a<00:00:59.980> little<00:01:00.430> try<00:01:00.670> not<00:01:00.940> for

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
so we don't put a little try not for

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.569 
so we don't put a little try not for
them<00:01:01.329> to<00:01:01.480> mix<00:01:01.690> event<00:01:02.290> because<00:01:03.100> that's<00:01:03.280> kind<00:01:03.520> of

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
them to mix event because that's kind of

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.210 
them to mix event because that's kind of
the<00:01:03.700> fun<00:01:03.910> part<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:05.199> then<00:01:05.409> put<00:01:05.620> a<00:01:05.650> little<00:01:05.740> it

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
the fun part and then put a little it

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.710 
the fun part and then put a little it
doesn't<00:01:06.550> you<00:01:06.700> don't<00:01:06.820> have<00:01:07.000> to<00:01:07.120> be<00:01:07.240> exact

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
doesn't you don't have to be exact

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.200 
doesn't you don't have to be exact
because<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.620> formulas<00:01:09.370> going<00:01:09.610> to<00:01:09.700> change<00:01:09.940> the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
because the formulas going to change the

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.560 
because the formulas going to change the
end<00:01:10.420> result<00:01:10.840> anyway<00:01:11.170> so<00:01:12.040> put<00:01:12.250> a<00:01:12.280> little<00:01:12.570> red

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
mixing these now we're going to assume

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.630 
mixing these now we're going to assume
that<00:01:24.460> children<00:01:25.420> would<00:01:25.600> be<00:01:25.810> very<00:01:26.740> careful<00:01:27.520> and

green in there but what's really fun
about<00:01:53.590> this<00:01:54.130> as<00:01:54.460> you<00:01:54.610> continue<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:56.229> mix<00:01:57.159> and

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
about this as you continue to mix and

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.359 
about this as you continue to mix and
squash<00:01:57.939> and<00:01:58.210> see<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.509> different<00:01:58.900> colors

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
squash and see the different colors

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.350 
squash and see the different colors
eventually<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:00.549> I've<00:02:00.670> made<00:02:00.880> up<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.180> back

eventually and I've made up the back

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.149 
eventually and I've made up the back
it's<00:02:01.570> going<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:01.900> turn<00:02:02.110> all<00:02:02.290> one<00:02:02.500> color<00:02:02.799> okay

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
it's going to turn all one color okay

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.649 
it's going to turn all one color okay
now<00:02:03.580> so<00:02:03.790> pretty<00:02:04.060> anymore

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
now so pretty anymore

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.960 
now so pretty anymore
right<00:02:05.020> it's<00:02:05.290> not<00:02:05.380> as<00:02:05.740> pretty<00:02:06.100> anymore<00:02:06.610> but

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
right it's not as pretty anymore but

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.479 
right it's not as pretty anymore but
that<00:02:07.689> is<00:02:08.019> another<00:02:08.439> that's<00:02:08.919> the<00:02:09.129> way<00:02:09.249> you<00:02:09.310> can

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
that is another that's the way you can

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.729 
that is another that's the way you can
take<00:02:09.669> it<00:02:09.789> to<00:02:09.909> a<00:02:09.939> different<00:02:10.359> level<00:02:10.509> is<00:02:11.049> by<00:02:11.680> the

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
take it to a different level is by the

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:12.870 
take it to a different level is by the
different<00:02:12.340> amount

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
different amount

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.670 
different amount
of<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.150> color<00:02:13.360> you're<00:02:13.660> going<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.870> get<00:02:14.110> all<00:02:14.410> one

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
of the color you're going to get all one

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.560 
of the color you're going to get all one
color<00:02:14.980> so<00:02:15.130> more<00:02:15.610> red<00:02:15.910> is<00:02:16.060> going<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.240> create<00:02:16.450> a

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
color so more red is going to create a

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.350 
color so more red is going to create a
brown<00:02:16.960> tone<00:02:17.380> more<00:02:18.070> Blues<00:02:18.400> going<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.730> create<00:02:19.030> a

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
brown tone more Blues going to create a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.630 
brown tone more Blues going to create a
black<00:02:19.660> tone<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:20.650> kids<00:02:20.920> can<00:02:21.100> experiment<00:02:21.460> with

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
black tone so kids can experiment with
