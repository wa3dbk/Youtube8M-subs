way<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.470> do<00:02:23.739> it<00:02:23.920> if<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.580> go<00:02:24.760> away<00:02:24.880> from<00:02:25.239> the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
way to do it if you go away from the

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.570 
way to do it if you go away from the
face<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.110> do<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.380> same<00:02:26.410> thing<00:02:26.890> clown<00:02:27.220> and

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
face and you do the same thing clown and

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:37.320 
face and you do the same thing clown and
then<00:02:28.209> pull<00:02:28.480> away<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:31.620> slowly<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:36.330> that's

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
then pull away and slowly and that's

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
then pull away and slowly and that's
going<00:02:37.600> away<00:02:37.750> from<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.110> face<00:02:41.640> love<00:02:42.640> them

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.730 

and<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:49.070> good<00:02:49.190> thing<00:02:49.250> about<00:02:49.460> a<00:02:49.900> flatiron<00:02:50.900> curl

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
and the good thing about a flatiron curl

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.860 
and the good thing about a flatiron curl
is<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.340> actually<00:02:55.580> get<00:02:56.120> heat<00:02:56.420> from<00:02:56.660> both

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
is that you actually get heat from both

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.170 
is that you actually get heat from both
sides<00:02:57.200> of<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.500> plate<00:02:57.800> so<00:02:58.550> it's<00:02:58.760> going<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.030> keep

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
sides of the plate so it's going to keep

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.560 
sides of the plate so it's going to keep
that<00:02:59.360> curl<00:03:00.130> longer<00:03:01.130> smoother<00:03:01.970> it's<00:03:02.270> going<00:03:02.480> to

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
that curl longer smoother it's going to

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.390 
that curl longer smoother it's going to
add<00:03:02.690> shine<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.530> because<00:03:03.890> what<00:03:04.040> happens

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
add shine to it because what happens

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.340 
add shine to it because what happens
when<00:03:04.610> you<00:03:04.730> straight<00:03:05.090> out<00:03:05.240> of<00:03:05.390> here<00:03:05.570> with<00:03:06.320> a

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
when you straight out of here with a

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.190 
when you straight out of here with a
flag<00:03:06.950> it<00:03:07.400> makes<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.880> nice<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.270> soft<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:09.020> looks

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
flag it makes a nice and soft that looks

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.410 
flag it makes a nice and soft that looks
shiny<00:03:09.560> what<00:03:10.280> you're<00:03:10.430> getting<00:03:10.820> that<00:03:10.970> but<00:03:11.270> while

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
shiny what you're getting that but while

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.060 
shiny what you're getting that but while
gaining<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.930> curl<00:03:12.500> too<00:03:14.560> because<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.650> curling

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
gaining the curl too because the curling

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.450 
gaining the curl too because the curling
iron<00:03:16.220> is<00:03:16.840> actually<00:03:17.840> just<00:03:18.650> going<00:03:18.830> to<00:03:18.920> have<00:03:19.190> he

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
iron is actually just going to have he

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.160 
iron is actually just going to have he
in<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.730> middle<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.270> around<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:20.840> it's<00:03:20.990> not

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
in the middle and around it it's not

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.690 
in the middle and around it it's not
really<00:03:21.380> going<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.620> have<00:03:21.800> that<00:03:22.040> so<00:03:22.430> we're

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
really going to have that so we're

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.420 
really going to have that so we're
smoothing<00:03:23.210> the<00:03:23.480> hair<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:24.070> curling<00:03:25.070> at<00:03:25.310> the

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
smoothing the hair and curling at the

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.920 
smoothing the hair and curling at the
same<00:03:25.640> time<00:03:25.850> to<00:03:26.510> make<00:03:26.690> sense

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.060 

investment<00:03:32.930> though<00:03:35.440> my<00:03:36.440> hair<00:03:36.620> is<00:03:36.710> the<00:03:36.890> one

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
investment though my hair is the one

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.680 
investment though my hair is the one
thing<00:03:37.280> on<00:03:37.610> myself<00:03:38.030> did<00:03:38.450> I<00:03:38.830> spend<00:03:39.830> my<00:03:39.950> money<00:03:40.100> on

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
thing on myself did I spend my money on

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.440 
thing on myself did I spend my money on
my<00:03:41.690> nails<00:03:41.900> always<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.440> horrible<00:03:43.060> my<00:03:44.060> makeups

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
my nails always the horrible my makeups

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.850 
my nails always the horrible my makeups
not<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.750> greatest<00:03:44.990> but<00:03:46.240> my<00:03:47.240> hair<00:03:47.600> gets<00:03:48.590> the

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
not the greatest but my hair gets the

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:57.610 
not the greatest but my hair gets the
attention<00:03:55.690> all<00:03:56.690> right<00:03:56.870> so<00:03:57.140> I'm<00:03:57.170> just<00:03:57.470> eating

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
attention all right so I'm just eating

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.950 
attention all right so I'm just eating
sections<00:03:58.310> I'm<00:03:58.670> not<00:03:58.820> really<00:03:59.000> being<00:03:59.330> me<00:03:59.570> about

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
sections I'm not really being me about

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.510 
sections I'm not really being me about
it<00:04:00.200> because<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:02.770> don't<00:04:03.770> want<00:04:03.980> to<00:04:04.070> make<00:04:04.190> it<00:04:04.340> nice

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
it because I don't want to make it nice

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.940 
it because I don't want to make it nice
and<00:04:04.550> messy<00:04:05.300> but<00:04:06.230> not<00:04:06.350> too<00:04:06.620> messy<00:04:07.040> so<00:04:08.710> and<00:04:09.710> in

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
and messy but not too messy so and in

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.040 
and messy but not too messy so and in
the<00:04:10.040> bag<00:04:10.220> i<00:04:10.400> always<00:04:10.820> like<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.210> take<00:04:11.450> a<00:04:11.630> huge

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
the bag i always like to take a huge

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.320 
the bag i always like to take a huge
huge<00:04:12.470> section<00:04:13.250> because<00:04:13.460> she<00:04:13.730> should<00:04:14.240> have

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
huge section because she should have

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.020 
huge section because she should have
longer<00:04:14.690> hair<00:04:14.720> so<00:04:15.650> we<00:04:15.830> want<00:04:16.010> to<00:04:16.070> keep<00:04:16.220> that<00:04:16.489> one

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
longer hair so we want to keep that one

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.240 
longer hair so we want to keep that one
that<00:04:17.450> length<00:04:17.720> there<00:04:18.049> so<00:04:18.560> if<00:04:18.739> we<00:04:18.770> would<00:04:19.070> take

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
that length there so if we would take

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.979 
that length there so if we would take
smaller<00:04:19.580> sections<00:04:19.910> it<00:04:20.450> would<00:04:20.600> make<00:04:20.780> little

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
smaller sections it would make little

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.040 
smaller sections it would make little
ringlets<00:04:21.880> so<00:04:22.880> by<00:04:23.060> doing<00:04:23.120> that<00:04:23.480> is<00:04:23.660> just<00:04:23.840> giving

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
ringlets so by doing that is just giving

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.990 
ringlets so by doing that is just giving
you<00:04:24.200> that<00:04:24.380> nice<00:04:24.590> wave<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:27.550> it's<00:04:28.550> not<00:04:28.700> taking

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
you that nice wave and it's not taking

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.740 
you that nice wave and it's not taking
any<00:04:29.210> of<00:04:29.420> that<00:04:29.570> length<00:04:29.810> away<00:04:31.150> for<00:04:32.150> those<00:04:32.360> with

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
any of that length away for those with

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.900 
any of that length away for those with
shorter<00:04:33.290> hair<00:04:33.320> should<00:04:34.190> they<00:04:34.340> do<00:04:34.400> smaller

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
shorter hair should they do smaller

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.730 
shorter hair should they do smaller
sections<00:04:35.540> or<00:04:35.750> should<00:04:35.930> they<00:04:36.080> continue<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:36.620> do

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
sections or should they continue to do

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.430 
sections or should they continue to do
bigger<00:04:37.010> sections<00:04:37.610> with<00:04:38.300> shorter<00:04:38.960> hair<00:04:38.990> yeah

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
bigger sections with shorter hair yeah

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.840 
bigger sections with shorter hair yeah
they<00:04:39.890> should<00:04:40.190> do<00:04:40.360> intersection<00:04:41.360> okay<00:04:42.700> so<00:04:43.700> no

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
they should do intersection okay so no

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.160 
they should do intersection okay so no
matter<00:04:43.970> your<00:04:44.240> hair<00:04:44.390> thanks<00:04:44.600> do<00:04:44.840> you<00:04:44.870> think

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
matter your hair thanks do you think

00:04:45.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
matter your hair thanks do you think
yeah

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.850 

then<00:05:02.880> I'm<00:05:02.970> fully<00:05:03.210> curl<00:05:03.570> and<00:05:03.900> then<00:05:04.410> you<00:05:04.530> can<00:05:04.710> do

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
then I'm fully curl and then you can do

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.680 
then I'm fully curl and then you can do
it<00:05:05.010> towards<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:05.610> plate<00:05:05.850> the<00:05:06.210> opposite

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
it towards the plate the opposite

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.540 
it towards the plate the opposite
direction<00:05:06.810> just<00:05:07.410> have<00:05:07.590> some<00:05:07.980> nice<00:05:08.220> movement

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
direction just have some nice movement

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.870 
direction just have some nice movement
to<00:05:08.910> it<00:05:12.290> so<00:05:13.290> as<00:05:13.380> you<00:05:13.500> can<00:05:13.680> see<00:05:13.890> this<00:05:14.070> is<00:05:14.280> this<00:05:14.700> is

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
to it so as you can see this is this is

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.450 
to it so as you can see this is this is
almost<00:05:15.270> like<00:05:15.390> a<00:05:15.630> really<00:05:16.080> really<00:05:16.440> relaxed<00:05:17.160> curl

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
almost like a really really relaxed curl
