have<00:05:53.790> these<00:05:53.940> coalition's

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.020 

I<00:06:00.200> have<00:06:00.770> this<00:06:00.890> general<00:06:01.310> theory<00:06:01.670> and<00:06:01.760> I<00:06:01.790> wonder

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
I have this general theory and I wonder

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.640 
I have this general theory and I wonder
what<00:06:02.180> you<00:06:02.420> know<00:06:02.540> what<00:06:03.140> other<00:06:03.230> people<00:06:03.560> think

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
what you know what other people think

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.160 
what you know what other people think
about<00:06:03.800> it<00:06:04.070> that's<00:06:04.760> like<00:06:04.970> on<00:06:05.690> a<00:06:05.750> very<00:06:06.020> basic

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.170 
about it that's like on a very basic

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.260 
about it that's like on a very basic
level<00:06:06.440> when<00:06:07.040> you<00:06:07.220> approach<00:06:07.550> say<00:06:07.910> the<00:06:08.090> child

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
level when you approach say the child

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.340 
level when you approach say the child
when<00:06:08.570> you<00:06:08.660> approach<00:06:08.870> the<00:06:09.020> idea<00:06:09.350> of<00:06:09.530> writing

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
when you approach the idea of writing

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.040 
when you approach the idea of writing
some<00:06:12.350> people

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
some people

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.920 
some people
yeah<00:06:14.620> okay<00:06:15.069> well<00:06:15.310> I'm<00:06:15.580> a<00:06:15.639> small<00:06:16.210> business<00:06:16.539> and

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
always be voted the concepts of voting

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.969 
always be voted the concepts of voting
is<00:06:25.449> like<00:06:25.629> I'm<00:06:25.900> making<00:06:26.289> a<00:06:26.319> decision<00:06:26.590> what<00:06:26.949> I

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
is like I'm making a decision what I

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:29.129 
is like I'm making a decision what I
think<00:06:27.190> is<00:06:27.280> best<00:06:27.460> for<00:06:27.610> everyone<00:06:27.940> and<00:06:28.270> so<00:06:29.020> I'm

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:29.139 
think is best for everyone and so I'm

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:30.540 
think is best for everyone and so I'm
convinced<00:06:29.560> the<00:06:29.620> people<00:06:29.740> that<00:06:30.039> wrote<00:06:30.220> left

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
convinced the people that wrote left

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.980 
convinced the people that wrote left
with<00:06:31.050> well<00:06:32.050> there<00:06:32.830> may<00:06:32.949> be<00:06:32.979> a<00:06:33.129> very<00:06:33.340> small

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
with well there may be a very small

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.570 
with well there may be a very small
section<00:06:34.990> of<00:06:35.050> the<00:06:35.199> conservative<00:06:35.770> voters<00:06:35.979> but

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
section of the conservative voters but

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.629 
section of the conservative voters but
that<00:06:37.539> do<00:06:37.750> genuinely<00:06:38.259> feel<00:06:38.949> that<00:06:39.280> what<00:06:39.520> they

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 
that do genuinely feel that what they

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.909 
that do genuinely feel that what they
vote<00:06:39.849> is<00:06:40.030> best<00:06:40.240> for<00:06:40.389> everyone<00:06:40.629> I<00:06:40.960> think<00:06:41.830> there

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 
vote is best for everyone I think there

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:43.290 
vote is best for everyone I think there
must<00:06:42.009> be<00:06:42.190> a<00:06:42.220> lot<00:06:42.400> of<00:06:42.430> conscious<00:06:42.879> waiting

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
must be a lot of conscious waiting

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.809 
must be a lot of conscious waiting
conservative<00:06:43.930> rating<00:06:44.110> that<00:06:45.009> that<00:06:47.819> that

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:48.819 
conservative rating that that that

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:50.159 
conservative rating that that that
you're<00:06:49.000> really<00:06:49.120> really<00:06:49.330> voting<00:06:49.539> for<00:06:49.840> yourself

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.169 
you're really really voting for yourself

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:52.140 
you're really really voting for yourself
because<00:06:51.009> the<00:06:51.190> Conservatives<00:06:51.699> going<00:06:51.909> to<00:06:51.969> drop

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
because the Conservatives going to drop

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.439 
because the Conservatives going to drop
taxes

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:54.449 
taxes

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:56.510 
taxes
you<00:06:54.960> know<00:06:55.050> drop<00:06:55.409> business<00:06:55.830> taxes<00:06:56.219> and<00:06:56.370> pub

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
you know drop business taxes and pub

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.459 
you know drop business taxes and pub
taxes<00:06:57.419> on<00:06:57.539> poor<00:06:57.779> people<00:06:58.110> or<00:06:58.199> whatever<00:06:58.319> that

taxes on poor people or whatever that

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:01.969 
taxes on poor people or whatever that
suits<00:06:58.800> you<00:06:58.949> quite<00:06:59.219> well<00:06:59.279> and<00:07:00.590> then<00:07:01.590> I<00:07:01.620> think

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:01.979 
suits you quite well and then I think

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:03.499 
suits you quite well and then I think
that<00:07:02.159> you<00:07:02.430> know<00:07:02.550> the<00:07:02.639> vast<00:07:02.819> majority<00:07:02.909> of<00:07:03.360> the

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:03.509 
that you know the vast majority of the

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:05.329 
that you know the vast majority of the
left<00:07:03.689> wing<00:07:03.900> probably<00:07:04.289> do<00:07:04.469> so<00:07:04.710> wrote<00:07:05.039> so

00:07:05.329 --> 00:07:05.339 
left wing probably do so wrote so

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:06.950 
left wing probably do so wrote so
because<00:07:05.699> they<00:07:05.819> feel<00:07:06.240> that<00:07:06.449> it's<00:07:06.599> best<00:07:06.779> for

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
because they feel that it's best for

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.179 
because they feel that it's best for
everyone<00:07:06.990> and<00:07:07.409> not<00:07:07.529> because<00:07:07.800> they're<00:07:07.919> rating

00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:08.189 
everyone and not because they're rating

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:09.589 
everyone and not because they're rating
thoughts<00:07:08.460> best<00:07:08.729> for<00:07:08.879> themselves<00:07:08.999> like<00:07:09.479> I

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 
thoughts best for themselves like I

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:10.760 
thoughts best for themselves like I
don't<00:07:09.659> think<00:07:09.930> the<00:07:10.020> vast<00:07:10.199> majority<00:07:10.319> of

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770 
don't think the vast majority of

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.369 
don't think the vast majority of
left-wing<00:07:11.069> voters<00:07:11.580> are<00:07:11.759> like<00:07:11.909> are<00:07:12.779> the

00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:13.379 
left-wing voters are like are the

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:14.959 
left-wing voters are like are the
working<00:07:13.589> class<00:07:13.979> voting<00:07:14.400> because<00:07:14.550> they<00:07:14.759> want

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:14.969 
working class voting because they want

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:16.279 
working class voting because they want
like<00:07:15.120> because<00:07:15.479> they<00:07:15.539> don't<00:07:15.749> have<00:07:15.779> to<00:07:15.960> work<00:07:16.110> so

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:16.289 
like because they don't have to work so

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:18.279 
like because they don't have to work so
they<00:07:16.379> can<00:07:16.499> be<00:07:16.589> benefit<00:07:17.009> scroungers<00:07:17.189> and<00:07:17.759> like

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:18.289 
they can be benefit scroungers and like

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:20.989 
they can be benefit scroungers and like
you<00:07:19.289> know<00:07:19.319> living<00:07:19.800> council<00:07:20.279> houses<00:07:20.639> and<00:07:20.789> stuff

00:07:20.989 --> 00:07:20.999 
you know living council houses and stuff

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:23.450 
you know living council houses and stuff
I<00:07:21.349> really<00:07:22.349> don't<00:07:22.499> think<00:07:22.529> people<00:07:22.830> that<00:07:23.279> very

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:23.460 
I really don't think people that very

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.769 
I really don't think people that very
left-wing<00:07:23.699> do<00:07:23.969> it<00:07:24.059> for<00:07:24.240> themselves<00:07:24.360> they

00:07:24.769 --> 00:07:24.779 
left-wing do it for themselves they

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:27.019 
left-wing do it for themselves they
think<00:07:24.990> that<00:07:25.169> the<00:07:25.349> vast<00:07:25.529> vast<00:07:26.279> majority<00:07:26.400> of<00:07:26.849> the

00:07:27.019 --> 00:07:27.029 
think that the vast vast majority of the

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:29.899 
think that the vast vast majority of the
left<00:07:27.180> wing<00:07:27.330> probably<00:07:27.689> vote<00:07:27.870> left<00:07:28.909> left

00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:29.909 
left wing probably vote left left

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:36.060 
left wing probably vote left left
because<00:07:31.279> they<00:07:32.279> care<00:07:32.520> about<00:07:32.789> other<00:07:33.029> people

I'm going to say it's quite circling to

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.540 
I'm going to say it's quite circling to
