00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.089
 yes 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.679
 as you see 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.640
 the positive evolution was very 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.550
 very noticeable change for more than change 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.070
 right he also had enough 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.560
 such a change happened from being a boxer 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.450
 of first and second plastics and 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.770
 third march forward make a 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.130
 wrestler who handle spaces to 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.130
 ring 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:01:01.390
 says the development beyond 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:03.650
 what you think it's going to be but I do believe 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.540
 to have a lot of work more than anything 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.740
 because of its official size for its 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.740
 strength in addition to the fact 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.729
 Amen 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.840
 inclusion of camps without zoubek te 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.140
 worries how big maybe more than 20 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.649
 books like 180 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.920
 will have to move 180 days during 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.950
 many years and that will give you a lot 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.950
 work 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.220
 in the last fight he could not do that 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.960
 something is going to be different for you and that 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.910
 you will be able to take mentally if I will have to 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.040
 move me marking you I'll have to move 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.780
 because nothing moved dili little or nothing 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:02:00.680
 Well, that's the price that there is 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:03.370
 pay if I move I will receive 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.910
 besides moving to a good strategy 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.910
 handled with a good 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.030
 the last three or four opponents that 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.560
 it's something new that will continue to be new 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.020
 fights will always jump in managed 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.590
 we have always placed above all 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.769
 the things I want I want to show 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.340
 I go out to look for the fight to look for the 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:43.129
 triumph by knockout or not to knock out in a 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.260
 round but if it worked it would work 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.510
 build a knockout is what I try 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.890
 doing 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.890
 grana serious country 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.519
 he says something that you do not run what 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.720
 you felt when he accused you of being a runner 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.890
 is trying to convince himself that he can 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.100
 fight with me that they may have 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.040
 with you 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.230
 but he knows he can not and 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.459
 is about the issue of drugs that 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.629
 will be in this contract there is something about 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.629
 that's going to be normal for the 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.629
 tradition 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:37.120
 and that the commission does a job 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.070
 this is so work all march on 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:54.750
 wheels 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:54.750
 one of my parents by my side was in if 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.170
 you still distrust the commission this 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.310
 year we saw many boxers that when 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.260
 They used other methods of drug testing 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.640
 they left that many of them 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.920
 socializing something in the commission and 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.660
 traditionally you do not grab that because 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.930
 the evidence that people use is more 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.050
 sophisticated exams as is your 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.050
 opinion 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.010
 well I worry about the health of 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.600
 athlete nothing more and why 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.750
 why 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.650
 if we find out many hours commit 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.830
 this type of crime is a crime 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.690
 the option loses credibility 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.010
 if he loses credibility we lose all 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.620
 the fighters what we do not do anything 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.800
 we end up losing in these well 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.800
 pay 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:05:01.760
 and problematic here is today the 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.130
 youtube parents when they fight each 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.870
 movie in that is that it's Irish and 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.250
 had a large contingent that came to 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.410
 see him now you're going to fight in las vegas 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.760
 where there are going to be many Mexicans like 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.760
 being Argentine American 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.870
 I've been fighting for 10 years 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.870
 visitor 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:26.189
 I really like that kind of challenges 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.439
 I enjoy a lot of command there are very many 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:30.439
 collaborate against sporting 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.650
 it is no longer my personality at the time of 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.650
 fight 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.110
 in the house of proponents I am much more 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:44.680
 big much stronger much more clever 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.680
 and much more 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.479
 yes
