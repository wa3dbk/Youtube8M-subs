 the armchair to the vertical position 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.090
 make sure that your dining table is 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.340
 and respect for the life of a non- smoker 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.429
 we inform you that the colleges concerned 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.570
 with smoke detectors is not allowed 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.980
 the use of electronic equipment 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.930
 portable 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.720
 the sound wireless transmission technology 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.400
 with remote control and did not discuss 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.529
 during the take-off procedure 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.860
 then all the electronic equipment 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.840
 which lasted scarce two connected to the use 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.610
 the cell is allowed only for 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.300
 leonardo is on ground with doors 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.130
 open 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.680
 I intend to conclude that it is switched off during 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.180
 the flight does not obstruct the emergency exit 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.980
 with luggage in case of depressurising 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.760
 Oxygen masks fell 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.130
 automatically in front of you 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.280
 the last of the masks to release the 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.500
 Oxygen puts is on the nose and mouth 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.410
 adjust the elastic around the head and 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.540
 breathe normally I'm a child to 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.960
 its side puts the mask first in 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.740
 you after the child in case of landing 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.440
 in the water 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.320
 we remember that your seat is floating 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.930
 I hope this has lights indicative of 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.860
 long rejection 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.860
 next to the emergency exit 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.210
 and that the closest exit to its collection 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.110
 additional shares are due to the debts of 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.660
 located potions cards 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.500

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.249
