00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.139 
don't know if this is correct or not
it's<00:01:55.140> probably<00:01:55.409> stupid<00:01:55.680> because<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.939> water

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
it's probably stupid because the water

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.940 
it's probably stupid because the water
gets<00:01:57.360> filtered<00:01:57.600> out<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:57.990> stuff<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:58.649> come<00:01:58.829> on

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950

think about it what if someone peas in

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.010 
think about it what if someone peas in
it<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.530> not<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> person<00:02:02.310> I'm<00:02:02.430> talking<00:02:02.549> dogs<00:02:03.020> or
