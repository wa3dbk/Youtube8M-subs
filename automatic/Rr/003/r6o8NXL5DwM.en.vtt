art<00:00:31.320> style<00:00:31.640> there's<00:00:32.640> something<00:00:32.940> so

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
art style there's something so

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.150 
art style there's something so
simplistic<00:00:33.719> yet<00:00:34.110> exaggerated<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:34.980> works

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
simplistic yet exaggerated that works

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.729 
simplistic yet exaggerated that works
well<00:00:35.430> for<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.700> series<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.440> especially<00:00:37.440> like

the design of the three bears each

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.790 
the design of the three bears each
design<00:00:40.440> matches<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.890> character<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.430> them<00:00:42.800> the

let's<00:00:50.760> talk<00:00:50.850> about<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.090> show<00:00:51.270> itself

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
let's talk about the show itself

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.340 
let's talk about the show itself
although<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:53.010> enjoyed<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.640> overall<00:00:53.809> it<00:00:54.809> didn't

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
although I enjoyed it overall it didn't

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.010 
although I enjoyed it overall it didn't
offer<00:00:55.500> much<00:00:55.739> new<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.250> table<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.870> no

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
offer much new to the table it is in no

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.500 
offer much new to the table it is in no
way<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.289> generic<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:58.800> Teen<00:00:59.070> Titans<00:00:59.399> go<00:00:59.460> but<00:01:00.359> it

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
way as generic as Teen Titans go but it

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.569 
way as generic as Teen Titans go but it
seems<00:01:00.989> very<00:01:01.320> similar<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.129> other<00:01:02.280> recent

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
seems very similar to other recent

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.359 
seems very similar to other recent
cartoons<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.559> guess<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.710> main<00:01:04.830> aspect<00:01:05.280> that

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
cartoons I guess the main aspect that

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.859 
cartoons I guess the main aspect that
sets<00:01:05.580> them<00:01:05.670> apart<00:01:05.820> from<00:01:06.090> other<00:01:06.330> animated

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
sets them apart from other animated

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.840 
sets them apart from other animated
shows<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.409> how<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.680> Bears<00:01:08.070> are<00:01:08.340> treated<00:01:08.760> by

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
shows is how the Bears are treated by

do have actions that cause ones to do
that<00:01:27.390> there's<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.080> little<00:01:28.409> bit<00:01:28.530> too<00:01:28.770> harsh<00:01:29.780> this

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
that there's a little bit too harsh this

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.330 
that there's a little bit too harsh this
is<00:01:30.930> what<00:01:31.079> makes<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.350> show<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> bit<00:01:32.159> awkward

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
is what makes this show a bit awkward

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.149 
is what makes this show a bit awkward
for<00:01:32.700> me<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.270> don't<00:01:34.200> know<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.439> motives<00:01:34.799> for<00:01:34.860> each

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
for me I don't know the motives for each

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.890 
for me I don't know the motives for each
human<00:01:35.640> character<00:01:36.060> acting<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> way<00:01:36.659> they<00:01:36.840> do

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
human character acting the way they do

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.350 
human character acting the way they do
to<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.560> Bears<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.790> same<00:01:39.000> breath<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
to the Bears but in the same breath the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.440 
to the Bears but in the same breath the
Bears<00:01:39.570> don't<00:01:39.840> seem<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.320> realize<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:41.040> is

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
Bears don't seem to realize this is

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.700 
Bears don't seem to realize this is
because<00:01:42.450> they're<00:01:42.689> ignorant<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.290> how<00:01:43.380> human

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
because they're ignorant to how human

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.310 
because they're ignorant to how human
society<00:01:44.159> works<00:01:44.570> or<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.079> because

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
society works or is it just because

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.800 
society works or is it just because

into society has a lot of possibilities
and<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.800> hope<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.099> they<00:02:41.220> try<00:02:41.459> new<00:02:41.640> things<00:02:42.260> the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
and I hope that they try new things the

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.780 
and I hope that they try new things the
one<00:02:43.440> factor<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.069> show<00:02:44.250> needs<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.640> work

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
one factor that the show needs to work

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.820 
one factor that the show needs to work
on<00:02:44.970> his<00:02:45.180> uniqueness

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
on his uniqueness
