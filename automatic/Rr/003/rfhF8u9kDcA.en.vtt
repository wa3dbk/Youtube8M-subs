00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.599 
we're these were quite easy assemble one
of<00:04:06.510> them<00:04:06.630> on<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:07.019> bus<00:04:07.320> it's<00:04:07.799> fine<00:04:08.900> out<00:04:10.609> because

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
of them on the bus it's fine out because

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.270 
of them on the bus it's fine out because
up<00:04:11.850> being<00:04:12.299> d<00:04:12.600> qu<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:13.680> might<00:04:13.890> want<00:04:14.070> to<00:04:14.130> get<00:04:14.250> a

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
up being d qu you might want to get a

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.159 
up being d qu you might want to get a
little<00:04:14.519> file<00:04:14.760> and<00:04:15.150> just<00:04:15.180> sand<00:04:15.690> down<00:04:15.900> some<00:04:16.140> of

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
little file and just sand down some of

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.440 
little file and just sand down some of
the<00:04:16.350> sharp<00:04:16.890> corners<00:04:17.280> because<00:04:17.609> it's<00:04:17.910> salty

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
the sharp corners because it's salty

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.800 
the sharp corners because it's salty
cool<00:04:18.859> Rose<00:04:19.859> so<00:04:20.760> I<00:04:20.789> put<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.060> shop<00:04:21.269> is<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.599> shop

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
cool Rose so I put a shop is the shop

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.110 
cool Rose so I put a shop is the shop
it's<00:04:22.019> here<00:04:22.380> and<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.099> feet<00:04:23.310> it's<00:04:23.580> just<00:04:23.820> you

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
it's here and the feet it's just you

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.200 
it's here and the feet it's just you
really<00:04:24.630> wanna<00:04:24.750> send<00:04:24.960> them<00:04:25.110> now<00:04:25.400> now

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
really wanna send them now now

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.820 
really wanna send them now now
this<00:04:27.509> looks<00:04:27.840> like<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:28.169> has<00:04:28.259> more<00:04:28.290> technician

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
this looks like it has more technician

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.590 
this looks like it has more technician
but<00:04:28.949> doesn't<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.759> tall<00:04:29.970> so<00:04:30.090> does<00:04:30.270> not<00:04:30.419> rotate

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
but doesn't the tall so does not rotate

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.540 
but doesn't the tall so does not rotate
the<00:04:30.930> head<00:04:31.080> does<00:04:31.259> not<00:04:31.440> rotate<00:04:31.650> I<00:04:32.160> mean<00:04:32.490> this

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
the head does not rotate I mean this

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.550 
the head does not rotate I mean this
totally<00:04:33.060> looks<00:04:33.090> like<00:04:33.360> it<00:04:33.570> can<00:04:33.750> but<00:04:33.990> no<00:04:34.169> it<00:04:34.410> on

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
totally looks like it can but no it on

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.590 
totally looks like it can but no it on
the<00:04:34.650> correct<00:04:35.130> angle<00:04:35.220> it<00:04:35.490> doesn't<00:04:35.669> move<00:04:36.030> can't

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
the correct angle it doesn't move can't

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.810 
the correct angle it doesn't move can't
move<00:04:36.660> it<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:37.320> this<00:04:37.830> alone<00:04:38.039> looks<00:04:38.310> like<00:04:38.460> that

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
move it and this alone looks like that

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.939 
move it and this alone looks like that
the<00:04:38.910> original<00:04:39.389> like<00:04:40.229> this<00:04:40.380> is<00:04:40.500> copy<00:04:40.710> from

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
the original like this is copy from

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:42.170 
the original like this is copy from
someone's<00:04:41.220> custom<00:04:41.580> job<00:04:41.759> looks<00:04:41.970> like<00:04:42.090> the

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
someone's custom job looks like the

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.550 
someone's custom job looks like the
original<00:04:42.509> what<00:04:42.600> this<00:04:42.690> was<00:04:42.840> a<00:04:42.870> ball<00:04:43.169> joint<00:04:43.470> but

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
original what this was a ball joint but

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.090 
original what this was a ball joint but
again<00:04:44.520> it<00:04:44.699> can't<00:04:44.910> move<00:04:45.090> so<00:04:45.949> the<00:04:46.949> only

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
again it can't move so the only

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.480 
again it can't move so the only
articulation<00:04:47.639> in<00:04:47.729> the<00:04:47.820> arms<00:04:48.240> and<00:04:48.600> I<00:04:49.490> guess

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
articulation in the arms and I guess

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.040 
articulation in the arms and I guess
someone<00:04:50.820> who<00:04:50.940> really<00:04:51.240> want<00:04:51.419> to<00:04:51.479> spend<00:04:51.630> time<00:04:51.750> on

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
someone who really want to spend time on

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.020 
someone who really want to spend time on
this<00:04:52.169> could<00:04:52.530> cut<00:04:52.830> this<00:04:53.100> like<00:04:53.370> you<00:04:53.490> just<00:04:53.639> open

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
this could cut this like you just open

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.670 
this could cut this like you just open
it<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.330> cut<00:04:54.600> both<00:04:54.810> sides<00:04:54.840> and<00:04:55.320> make<00:04:55.440> it<00:04:55.560> rotate

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
it and cut both sides and make it rotate

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.750 
it and cut both sides and make it rotate
rotate<00:04:56.639> it<00:04:56.970> also<00:04:57.180> but<00:04:57.449> no<00:04:58.070> it<00:04:59.070> does<00:04:59.280> have<00:04:59.460> a<00:04:59.520> bit

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
rotate it also but no it does have a bit

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.370 
rotate it also but no it does have a bit
more<00:04:59.789> articulation<00:05:00.510> like<00:05:01.199> one<00:05:02.479> two<00:05:03.479> extra

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
more articulation like one two extra

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.930 
more articulation like one two extra
articulation<00:05:04.560> than<00:05:04.979> normal<00:05:05.310> hope<00:05:05.490> figures

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
articulation than normal hope figures

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.700 
articulation than normal hope figures
from<00:05:06.120> like<00:05:06.360> official<00:05:06.750> leg<00:05:06.870> and<00:05:07.020> stuff<00:05:07.199> but

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
from like official leg and stuff but

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.590 
from like official leg and stuff but
it's<00:05:07.860> still<00:05:08.010> fairly<00:05:08.190> limited<00:05:08.340> so<00:05:08.820> here's

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
it's still fairly limited so here's

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.080 
it's still fairly limited so here's
hoping<00:05:09.750> that<00:05:09.900> chignon<00:05:10.320> will<00:05:10.560> do<00:05:10.680> this<00:05:10.889> and<00:05:11.190> add

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
hoping that chignon will do this and add

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.420 
hoping that chignon will do this and add
torso<00:05:12.780> articulation<00:05:13.380> head<00:05:13.620> articulation<00:05:14.190> and

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
torso articulation head articulation and

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.250 
torso articulation head articulation and
perhaps<00:05:14.970> feet<00:05:15.360> articulation<00:05:15.930> because<00:05:16.110> it's

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
perhaps feet articulation because it's

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.900 
perhaps feet articulation because it's
definitely<00:05:16.680> doable<00:05:17.070> to<00:05:17.400> just<00:05:17.580> haven't

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
definitely doable to just haven't

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.060 
definitely doable to just haven't
bothered<00:05:18.090> and<00:05:18.449> then<00:05:19.320> ask<00:05:19.500> that's<00:05:19.770> because

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
bothered and then ask that's because

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.900 
bothered and then ask that's because
quite<00:05:20.280> for<00:05:20.490> me<00:05:21.289> really<00:05:22.289> is<00:05:22.590> that<00:05:23.220> they<00:05:23.460> didn't

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
quite for me really is that they didn't

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.650 
quite for me really is that they didn't
bother<00:05:25.250> but<00:05:26.250> hey<00:05:26.430> s<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:26.759> Hulkbuster<00:05:27.360> people

gonna buy it anyway to bus some hope I
guess<00:05:32.460> don't<00:05:32.610> need<00:05:32.760> last<00:05:33.270> thing<00:05:33.479> to<00:05:33.570> do<00:05:33.780> is

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
guess don't need last thing to do is

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.140 
guess don't need last thing to do is
that<00:05:34.560> if<00:05:34.770> you<00:05:34.949> use<00:05:35.190> two<00:05:35.400> big<00:05:35.610> figures<00:05:35.970> with<00:05:36.120> a

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
that if you use two big figures with a

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.150 
that if you use two big figures with a
limited<00:05:36.479> articulation<00:05:36.570> to<00:05:37.080> be<00:05:37.169> fine<00:05:37.440> but<00:05:37.919> you

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
limited articulation to be fine but you
