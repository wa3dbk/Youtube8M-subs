00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.100
 FIFA referee Michael Kempter leads the field for the two teams 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.099
 After all, this is about the rise in the highest win Baden league 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.650
 the teams from Schiltach and the less open the relegation round and it is 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.350
 clearly 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.300
 only the winner of today's game may be in game number two the FC 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.470
 Radolfzell justified hopes to make the climb 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.800
 the first stele for seeking her salvation theme was also on the offensive 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.069
 not played for two minutes yet 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:27.630
 and how it is estimated that keeper Christian Fromm 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.630
 demanded for the first time 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.010
 and also the next action is especially pleased with the topic of Iran Angelo 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.490
 Saggiomo Schlenzer runs very close to the gate but is always worth seeing 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.390
 Coach Claus Kraskovic rushed to be satisfied with the status of his guys here 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.890
 he still plays that balanced but Schiltach certainly with possibilities 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.049
 to the early leadership 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:57.770
 very thick air in the penalty area of ​​the guests 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.230
 Nino does not mean to get away from 16 yards to the shot 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.110
 Take a deep breath and be part of the Rallye Ernst and his team 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.899
 Prejudices are three live bands flatten the game then, however 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.979
 it is getting hot it is a lot at stake accordingly 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.120
 Both teams work cautiously on a solo by Florian Kraft Müller 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.140
 because the exception 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.620
 but it is not really dangerous and he is now looking for a zero number 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.620
 in the break 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.940
 The coaches are likely to have it again, we have only the winner 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.500
 makes a big step towards the Association League Kitas Mathias 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.600
 Trautwein opens passage two with a class shot 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.600
 Rheinschiene from the two rescued on the line 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.890
 It is now the best phase of the host after the master SC 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.580
 Hofstetten as a second team from the child then wants to come back high 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.330
 some best man for a shot 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.450
 but not so Kowalzig's intention to score the goal, though 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.800
 clearly recognizable 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.200
 what you do not necessarily claim on the other side of as a television world 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.050
 can 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.439
 and nevertheless 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.439
 is in his case 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.590
 50 minutes played the guests from Teningen lead with 1 0 thanks partly completely 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.780
 her f even if i stick to this ball was not planned that way 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.740
 surprised everyone 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.740
 especially to visit Kristian 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:28.309
 the guests now with a decent dose of self-confidence before all 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:30.090
 Scorers want to know now 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.810
 it can be her ride is safe because this time also goalless 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.299
 the Schiltacher has to do something now we have room for yb-counter 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.340
 It's really hard for Kraus and Pascal Stadelmann 70 minutes 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:47.730
 the 2 0 for the FC Teningen 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.350
 and that's funny 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.980
 in 32 Kieninger championship games 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.740
 when not a single bogey decided on it 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.150
 Hopp or Topp is the motto of this game is again top 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:09.379
 for the guests lie down with the scorer Pascal Stadelmann takes 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.459
 which is placed in the penalty area by keeper Christian Sohn in last place 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.799
 that's why there's not only penalty but also big and because 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.409
 Schiltach must not change any more must with David Schmieder a fielder ins 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.409
 gate 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.689
 because the blacksmith against you is the duel and the winner 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:30.849
 is called Daniel Schmider 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.969
 well-preserved books the story 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:35.399
 unfortunately nothing with a happy ending 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:38.889
 because the next action shows that Schmieder then better in the field 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.699
 cleared Petri is clear finally shot attempt goes completely wrong 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:44.719
 Defense of Daniel Schmider but also 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.169
 all just minute 87 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.309
 13 clock that it is the final score for the FC Teningen 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:52.010
 a victory for order goes 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.010
 but it was too high 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.839
 I buy it relatively thin that is known 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:03.589
 all players who play we can play through the game through Beck started too 

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:06.919
 worry that Merck won 5 percent, they decide to take care of it 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.919
 High field and in force 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.759
 rather, that is what can be done now 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.799
 i do the job so i think thats just because 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.379
 We recommend the product RTL Shop 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:20.379
 replace is 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:24.279
 submitted ten meters and so it comes Wednesday in a week with big 

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:27.180
 Probability for showdown against Radolfzell 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.490
 FCT sees itself prepared for today's performance 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.909
 With the beginning of the second half a day later, the flight is on 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.759
 Minute good play facility 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.469
 you have clearly more overview of all tasks 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:45.810
 important 1 0 Norbert Pohlmann sound picture was but the 2 2 at the 4 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:46.760
 Yes and then 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.210
 but also two goals to the power of the temperature was the same 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.569
 really hard then posed 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:52.419
 for this and rap 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:53.400
 Opponent yes 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.059
 Start to measure yes but clearly win away 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:59.519
 if I put forward play and the small hill not all the more beautiful 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:04.979
 The FC Teningen may therefore more than from the return to the league 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.949
 only dream of the Schiltacher test against dreamed out nevertheless that is 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.929
 Achieving Relegation says the greatest success in the 84-year-old 

00:05:12.929 --> 00:05:14.329
 club history
