050<00:00:17.510> one<00:00:18.510> piece<00:00:18.750> Tyrion<00:00:19.439> this<00:00:19.710> belt<00:00:20.520> drive<00:00:20.850> I

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
050 one piece Tyrion this belt drive I

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.210 
050 one piece Tyrion this belt drive I
do<00:00:21.900> also<00:00:22.199> have<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.470> chain<00:00:22.680> drive<00:00:22.830> one<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.100> these

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
do also have a chain drive one of these

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.550 
do also have a chain drive one of these
but<00:00:23.400> like<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.609> said<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.880> board<00:00:24.090> was<00:00:24.240> bad<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.720> so

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
but like I said the board was bad on so

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.310 
but like I said the board was bad on so
I'm<00:00:25.680> thinking<00:00:26.070> after<00:00:26.580> maybe<00:00:27.150> I'll<00:00:27.779> switch<00:00:28.140> out

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
I'm thinking after maybe I'll switch out

I'm thinking after maybe I'll switch out
the<00:00:28.470> board's<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:28.890> week<00:00:28.949> throw<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:29.939> chain

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
the board's this week throw that chain

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.040 
the board's this week throw that chain
drive<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.630> here<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> video<00:00:31.250> but<00:00:32.250> maybe<00:00:32.579> not

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
drive in here for a video but maybe not

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.190

we're<00:00:48.270> running<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> reshoot<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
we're running this is a reshoot on the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.340 
we're running this is a reshoot on the
real<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.219> teh<00:00:50.539> the<00:00:51.539> last<00:00:51.719> time<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:51.989> guys<00:00:52.079> saw

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
real on teh the last time you guys saw

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.350 
real on teh the last time you guys saw
this<00:00:52.500> was<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.860> build<00:00:53.160> mark<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:54.000> reason<00:00:54.270> we

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
this was on the build mark the reason we

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.910 
this was on the build mark the reason we
pulled<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.750> unit<00:00:55.079> was<00:00:55.260> because<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.739> belt

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
pulled this unit was because the belt

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.639 
pulled this unit was because the belt
broke<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.699> like<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.600> said<00:00:57.660> before<00:00:58.199> when

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
broke on it and like I said before when

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.229 
broke on it and like I said before when
it<00:00:58.680> was<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> build<00:00:59.219> mark<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.670> put<00:01:00.210> a

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
it was on the build mark I put a

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.349 
it was on the build mark I put a
Chamberland<00:01:00.840> end<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.230> there<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.329> got<00:01:03.329> it

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
Chamberland end on it there and got it

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.990 
Chamberland end on it there and got it
back<00:01:03.480> up<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.960> running<00:01:04.580> running<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.790> today

by the way as you guys do remember does
work<00:01:55.310> with<00:01:55.549> Chamberlain<00:01:55.939> sensors<00:01:56.950> these<00:01:57.950> are

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
work with Chamberlain sensors these are

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.590 
work with Chamberlain sensors these are
not<00:01:58.250> linear<00:01:58.610> sensors<00:01:58.820> these<00:01:59.210> are<00:01:59.390> the

sensors<00:02:01.850> that<00:02:02.030> I<00:02:02.090> normally<00:02:02.210> have<00:02:02.690> Mallard<00:02:03.110> in

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
sensors that I normally have Mallard in

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.320 
sensors that I normally have Mallard in
here<00:02:03.439> as<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:04.280> can<00:02:04.310> see<00:02:04.430> they<00:02:04.700> are<00:02:04.729> lit<00:02:05.000> up<00:02:05.149> and

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
here as you can see they are lit up and

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.440 
here as you can see they are lit up and
they<00:02:05.780> do<00:02:05.840> respond<00:02:06.590> they<00:02:07.460> are<00:02:07.700> actually

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
they do respond they are actually

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.630 
they do respond they are actually
working<00:02:09.259> on<00:02:09.470> sensors<00:02:10.069> it's<00:02:10.250> go<00:02:10.399> ahead<00:02:10.550> and

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
working on sensors it's go ahead and

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.309 
working on sensors it's go ahead and
open<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:11.060> door<00:02:11.260> just<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.380> little<00:02:12.620> bit<00:02:13.000> stop<00:02:14.000> it

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
open the door just a little bit stop it

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.670 
open the door just a little bit stop it
run<00:02:15.319> it<00:02:15.440> back<00:02:15.470> down<00:02:15.970> break<00:02:16.970> your<00:02:17.120> bean<00:02:17.680> there's

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
run it back down break your bean there's

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.910 
kinda a wiring glitch it takes a minute
for<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.290> sense<00:02:21.560> of<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.769> reset<00:02:22.130> itself<00:02:23.920> and

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
for the sense of the reset itself and

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.570 
for the sense of the reset itself and
then<00:02:25.130> lights<00:02:25.580> on<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:27.200> can<00:02:27.350> see<00:02:27.650> no<00:02:28.340> moving

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
then lights on it you can see no moving

then lights on it you can see no moving
on<00:02:28.760> usually<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.480> blink<00:02:29.780> huh<00:02:29.930> these<00:02:30.500> sensors<00:02:30.950> are

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
on usually a blink huh these sensors are

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.600 
on usually a blink huh these sensors are
a<00:02:31.100> little<00:02:31.250> weird<00:02:31.489> but<00:02:31.700> they<00:02:31.850> do<00:02:31.910> work<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:33.610> there

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
a little weird but they do work so there

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.660 
a little weird but they do work so there
