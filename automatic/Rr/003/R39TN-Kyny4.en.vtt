00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.440
 what is the first thing we appreciate in a 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.219
 videogame the intro of the good game 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.960
 after that the graphics good good 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.580
 After that, that's the first thing 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.580
 we watch in a video game 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.599
 good inheritance I shit go to the point 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.040
 one ignore that intro good everyone 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.680
 have you ever wondered what would be 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.750
 of a game without music that would be that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.300
 epic scene without a soundtrack that the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.780
 accompany that would be that ending without a 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.580
 song that fit perfectly no 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.730
 well it does not matter I made a video of 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.010
 all the music in a video game 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.590
 I think it's vital for the game 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.019
 It is considered the best of a good 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.030
 game will always be clear gameplay 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.489
 it is but there are several factors that make 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.380
 of a good game one of them is the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.020
 soundtrack that accompanies the game 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.299
 many may say that it is nonsense 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.940
 that a game is enjoyed equal or more without 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.729
 music that obstructs in quotation marks but 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.549
 I say do not imagine the final battle 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.920
 from one of your favorite games I'll put a 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.460
 example the final battle of super mario 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.409
 64 we are all 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.270
 the way to the end with a music 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.549
 that fits very well with the occasion 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.159
 suddenly we got to where he was and 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.020
 it stops the music the battle is no longer what 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.119
 same because music makes the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.100
 player sits inside the game and 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.740
 follow with detail luxury the scene that 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.380
 is living another example is the battle 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.960
 final gear metal solid 4 of today's 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.300
 snake against liquid ocelot is one of the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.040
 more epic scenes that I saw and the music did not 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.470
 does more than give the master touch to 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.600
 this one I think you could not enjoy 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.060
 likewise if there was not a melody 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.130
 highlighting although some games have 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.130
 scenes that can be excluded from this 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.619
 list but they are very moderate 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.170
 so I ask you do you think that's the way 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.900
 a game you could enjoy equal 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.540
 way with music or without music I leave it to you 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.940
 At your discretion also the melody varies 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.310
 depending on the time of the game 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.310
 example you can not do that obviously 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.530
 he is not in a group 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.840
 which one 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.660
 hahahaha I think you understand me now 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.660
 compare the above with this 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.070
 completely different now it 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.620
 they will ask what is better without music or 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.200
 music that does not fit well because I think 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.420
 my opinion is that I prefer that the scene 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.260
 do not have music to have music but 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.840
 that does not fit because good music is 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.240
 an important factor in a game without 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.430
 this factor the game would lower its quality 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.550
 and it would not be the same but it would not be 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.590
 I would simply score this on 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.320
 change if we put a melody that does not 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.990
 lace like the previous example the game 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.300
 would have the music factor but if not 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.030
 goes well with the game the music now yes 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.700
 I would be clogging and being able to shit 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.720
 I prefer that something has nothing 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.240
 have high but bad 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.040
 I do not know what you think but all 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.960
 opinion is valid and I invite you to 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.930
 Share it in the comments area 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.350
 very well now let's move to the effects of 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.350
 sounds 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.150
 the sound effects exist from 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.549
 before music in videogames 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.799
 since before the games video games 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.079
 they had a moderate library of 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.290
 sound effects and sometimes small 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.700
 melodies when losing or when entering the game 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.669
 imagine a game without sound effects 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:33.250
 that only has background music and 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.250
 nothing more for example mortal kombat 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.279
 I think it feels empty because it does not 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:45.729
 there are sounds that complement the 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:48.199
 movements and actions of the characters 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.909
 obviously both music and these 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.339
 effects can be activated or deactivated 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:54.710
 in the options of almost all games 

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:59.409
 but I'm talking in a general way 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.409
 now let's see with sound effects 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.740
 better truth 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:13.020
 now we know how a game looks 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:15.120
 sound that accompanies you to a game without 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.940
 sound is the same as a guitar without 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.640
 good cords not so like that but I do not know 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.740
 occurred an ingenious comparison if 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.110
 we play something and we take away the sound 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.750
 for various issues such as what is 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.700
 night or your head hurts and so on 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.890
 obviously we 're going to enjoy the 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.330
 game but I think not in the same way 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.270
 of what we would do with the volume 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.070
 put putting a separate point fits 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.660
 highlight that music is one of the 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.970
 factors that are used more to 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.040
 argue that a video game is art and 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.680
 one of the most irrefutable tests for 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.540
 affirm this for which I believe that it is 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.550
 just as important as many others 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.140
 aspects of a game and it's something that makes 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.140
 draw attention to people without 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.180
 knowledge in this good up to here 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.280
 came the video reiterated that this is a 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.010
 personal opinion and that does not mean 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.260
 everyone thinks like me if you have 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.870
 liked please like it and subscribe 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.690
 if you would like to see more videos like these 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:13.220
 nothing good to say we are in the 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.220
 next video greetings
