probably did it for maybe 15 matches
with<00:07:23.349> a<00:07:23.379> group<00:07:23.650> because<00:07:24.370> I<00:07:24.400> didn't<00:07:24.789> know<00:07:24.849> what

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:24.969 
with a group because I didn't know what

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.020 
time but I just I grew out of that I

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.390 
time but I just I grew out of that I
would<00:07:29.379> definitely<00:07:29.589> not<00:07:29.889> put<00:07:30.099> it<00:07:30.189> up<00:07:30.279> on

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 
would definitely not put it up on

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.249 
would definitely not put it up on
YouTube<00:07:30.430> and<00:07:31.000> say<00:07:31.120> how<00:07:31.270> such<00:07:31.689> a<00:07:31.719> beast<00:07:32.020> like
