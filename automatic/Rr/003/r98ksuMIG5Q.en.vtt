00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.090 

it's<00:00:31.720> a<00:00:31.750> beautiful

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.650 

the<00:00:35.640> idea<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.350> BMW<00:00:37.350> zagato<00:00:37.530> coupe

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
the idea of the BMW zagato coupe

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.380 
the idea of the BMW zagato coupe
actually<00:00:39.660> came<00:00:40.309> like<00:00:41.309> many<00:00:41.550> things<00:00:41.820> more<00:00:42.180> out

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
actually came like many things more out

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.920 
actually came like many things more out
of<00:00:43.309> two<00:00:44.309> people<00:00:44.699> meeting<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.750> certain

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
of two people meeting in a certain

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.139 
of two people meeting in a certain
setting<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:47.190> was<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> couple<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.850> years<00:00:47.909> ago

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
setting and it was a couple of years ago

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.079 
setting and it was a couple of years ago
I<00:00:48.269> think<00:00:48.629> Andrea<00:00:49.109> zagato<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.070> Adrian<00:00:50.519> at<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
I think Andrea zagato and Adrian at a

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.770 
I think Andrea zagato and Adrian at a
talk<00:00:51.530> about<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.769> possible<00:00:53.159> project<00:00:53.940> what<00:00:54.449> could

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
talk about a possible project what could

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.910 
talk about a possible project what could
be<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.289> coupe<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.610> with<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> lot<00:00:57.180> more<00:00:57.920> exclusive

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
be a coupe but with a lot more exclusive

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.460 
be a coupe but with a lot more exclusive
or<00:01:00.049> exotic<00:01:01.049> feel<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.829> something<00:01:02.430> very<00:01:03.470> very

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
or exotic feel to it something very very

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.130 
or exotic feel to it something very very
unique<00:01:05.190> very<00:01:05.220> rare<00:01:05.789> and<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.509> think<00:01:06.750> zagato

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
unique very rare and I think zagato

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.630

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
pure emotion exotic feeling and you can
still<00:03:17.880> recognize<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.900> car<00:03:19.140> is<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.260> BMW<00:03:19.980> I

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.000 

think<00:03:24.630> that's<00:03:24.810> kind<00:03:25.019> of<00:03:25.080> a<00:03:25.170> nice<00:03:25.380> thing<00:03:25.410> I

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
think that's kind of a nice thing I

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.699 
think that's kind of a nice thing I
don't<00:03:26.700> think<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:26.970> can<00:03:27.090> say<00:03:27.269> front<00:03:28.110> is<00:03:28.380> this

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
don't think you can say front is this

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.699 
don't think you can say front is this
and<00:03:29.010> rear<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.670> it's<00:03:29.970> not<00:03:30.060> like<00:03:30.360> that

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
and rear is that it's not like that

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.870 
and rear is that it's not like that
obviously<00:03:31.709> I'm<00:03:31.799> not<00:03:31.830> objective<00:03:32.459> but<00:03:32.610> I<00:03:32.640> think

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
obviously I'm not objective but I think

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.309 
obviously I'm not objective but I think
that's<00:03:33.060> why<00:03:33.209> it's<00:03:33.330> so<00:03:33.390> successful<00:03:33.660> because<00:03:34.080> it

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
that's why it's so successful because it

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.839 
that's why it's so successful because it
really<00:03:34.620> is<00:03:34.860> like<00:03:35.130> it<00:03:36.080> symbiosis<00:03:37.080> of<00:03:37.349> both<00:03:40.849> the

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
really is like it symbiosis of both the

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.720 
really is like it symbiosis of both the
kidney<00:03:42.299> is<00:03:42.660> one<00:03:43.470> of<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.709> part<00:03:43.950> that<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.190> like<00:03:44.489> as

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
kidney is one of the part that I like as

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.590 
kidney is one of the part that I like as
it<00:03:45.510> is<00:03:45.810> an<00:03:45.959> icon<00:03:46.560> because<00:03:46.859> it's<00:03:47.160> very

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
it is an icon because it's very

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.710 
it is an icon because it's very
recognizable<00:03:48.600> because<00:03:48.840> nowadays<00:03:49.350> most<00:03:50.070> cars

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
molded this vision together and then you

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.320 
molded this vision together and then you
know<00:06:46.040> with<00:06:46.220> every<00:06:46.430> times<00:06:46.700> we<00:06:46.850> weren't<00:06:47.180> really
