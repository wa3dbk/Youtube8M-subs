00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.210
 to the beginning of May a very simple attempt now with the patch performance too 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.480
 bring a helicopter was now actually right around the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.570
 High-axle spin in the torque balancing prammer instead he flies 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.570
 completely without control even quite stable 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.369
 at Expand against, the pirouette begins immediately 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.369
 as you may expect 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.270
 Next attempt to leave the stick again in peace but come on 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.270
 Torque balance into the pedal 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.950
 the helicopter breaks out quickly 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.950
 and it will crash soon 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.520
 it Norman right hovers 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.590
 As in reality, we have to balance with the Stick Nano Ralf position 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.500
 and even without wind influence constantly to correct all controls 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.780
 Robert's image of the helicopter is always a bit up in the air and needs to 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.620
 Balancing the tail rotor shines to be held in lighter wings bearings 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.800
 the left skid is also the first one to relaunch 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.750
 Percent compares later flew at BfS 2004 Prohn the take off 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.890
 m seems somewhat robotic and unnatural per hub Schober responds 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:29.560
 only on significant tax relief Pratt otherwise 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:41.079
 but completely calm and stable in the air Prof when landing are the 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.669
 Differences clearly 

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:47.739
 private on joints in the grass is the floor effect but not an optical one 

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:49.510
 shown the flight is landed 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:56.350
 knows the FTSE MIB Prof who will succeed in turn possible movements 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.740
 It is easy to place the helicopter just above the target 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.360
 Landing approach is experts 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.810
 we constantly have to correct the attitude every change made to one 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.340
 Control as feedback to the other controls 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:22.109
 Not only does it look realistic, it almost feels like picking on it 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.379
 a real helicopter on only the pop-up feel lacks of course 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.859
 Jack effect significantly noticeable transition buoyancy and also its 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.189
 Loss when landing 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:42.529
 Realistic Aero Dynamic Behavior Common to Reality 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:46.290
 Speed â€‹â€‹suspension over the comparison of cockpit contours with the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.989
 Horizont as the icing on the cake is called that dominates experts and thus has in 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.299
 Our comparison for Schmidt Robert is clearly ahead 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:02.759
 no fun 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:06.179
 This is
