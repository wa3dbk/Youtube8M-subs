00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
and the only issue of I I had in regards

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.320 
and the only issue of I I had in regards
to<00:01:12.720> installation<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.740> had<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.670> course<00:01:14.850> do

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
to installation is I had to of course do

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.270 
to installation is I had to of course do
a<00:01:15.360> full<00:01:16.250> why<00:01:17.250> partition<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.150> full<00:01:19.080> white<00:01:19.920> cash

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
a full why partition and full white cash

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.240 
a full why partition and full white cash
after<00:01:20.729> i<00:01:21.450> installed<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.170> despite<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.100> fact

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
after i installed it despite the fact

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.359 
after i installed it despite the fact
that<00:01:23.369> i<00:01:23.580> chose<00:01:23.880> full<00:01:24.240> wipe<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:25.320> i<00:01:25.830> guess<00:01:26.159> that's

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
that i chose full wipe so i guess that's

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.710 
that i chose full wipe so i guess that's
probably<00:01:26.610> one<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.119> issues<00:01:27.240> when<00:01:27.600> you're

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
probably one of the issues when you're

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.450 
probably one of the issues when you're
coming<00:01:28.020> from<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.229> different<00:01:28.259> firmware<00:01:29.040> or<00:01:29.189> room

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
was saying there I find that I have a

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.899 
was saying there I find that I have a
better<00:01:48.090> signal<00:01:48.509> with<00:01:49.470> my<00:01:49.740> Omega<00:01:50.399> Rho<00:01:50.670> i

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
better signal with my Omega Rho i

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.870 
better signal with my Omega Rho i
believe<00:01:51.840> it's<00:01:52.320> using<00:01:53.130> let's<00:01:53.610> see<00:01:53.759> which

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
believe it's using let's see which

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.289 
believe it's using let's see which
kernel<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.630> currently<00:01:54.990> using<00:01:56.090> yeah<00:01:57.090> it's

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
kernel is currently using yeah it's

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.300 
kernel is currently using yeah it's
still<00:01:57.570> use<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.079> believe<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:59.159> is

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
still use I believe this is this is

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.690 
still use I believe this is this is
still<00:01:59.640> the<00:02:00.170> official<00:02:01.170> samsung<00:02:01.469> Colonel<00:02:02.280> but<00:02:02.490> I

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
still the official samsung Colonel but I

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.330 
still the official samsung Colonel but I
think<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.149> be<00:02:03.270> getting<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.630> better<00:02:04.340> signal

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
think to be getting a better signal

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.110 
think to be getting a better signal
mobile<00:02:06.180> signal<00:02:06.590> here<00:02:08.300> so<00:02:09.300> apart<00:02:09.780> from<00:02:09.899> that

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
mobile signal here so apart from that

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.940 
mobile signal here so apart from that
the<00:02:11.480> good<00:02:11.750> thing<00:02:11.780> about<00:02:12.049> is<00:02:12.379> the<00:02:12.590> signal
