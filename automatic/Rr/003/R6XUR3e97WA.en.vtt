00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
struggling with making this video just

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.920 
struggling with making this video just
because<00:00:16.440> it's<00:00:17.130> really<00:00:17.490> hard<00:00:17.730> for<00:00:17.789> me<00:00:17.970> to

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
because it's really hard for me to

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.859 
because it's really hard for me to
discern<00:00:19.760> what<00:00:20.760> you're<00:00:21.119> doing<00:00:21.630> if<00:00:21.840> you're
