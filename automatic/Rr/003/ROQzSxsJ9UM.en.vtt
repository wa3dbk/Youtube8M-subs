going to thence all the way around so
the<00:00:53.219> fence<00:00:53.489> will<00:00:53.760> come<00:00:54.000> off<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.480> these<00:00:54.629> two

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the fence will come off of these two

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.729 
the fence will come off of these two
structures<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.949> wrap<00:00:56.430> around<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.420> entire

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
rectangle of this space now let's focus

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.660 
rectangle of this space now let's focus
on<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.050> buildings<00:01:01.440> for<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.890> minute<00:01:02.219> when

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
on the buildings for just a minute when

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.429 
on the buildings for just a minute when
we<00:01:02.789> cleared<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.300> area<00:01:03.719> we<00:01:03.870> made<00:01:04.110> sure<00:01:04.140> that

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
we cleared this area we made sure that

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.980 
we cleared this area we made sure that
any<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> pine<00:01:05.549> trees<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.299> were<00:01:06.689> large

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
any of the pine trees that were large

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.320 
any of the pine trees that were large
enough<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.350> be<00:01:07.680> taken<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> sawmill<00:01:08.850> we

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
enough to be taken to the sawmill we

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.390 
enough to be taken to the sawmill we
safe<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.840> that's<00:01:09.960> exactly<00:01:10.439> what<00:01:10.619> we<00:01:10.740> did<00:01:10.950> so

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
safe and that's exactly what we did so

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.850 
safe and that's exactly what we did so
we're<00:01:11.610> recycling<00:01:12.479> those<00:01:12.659> trees<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:13.619> got<00:01:13.770> it

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
we're recycling those trees we got it

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.499 
we're recycling those trees we got it
back<00:01:14.010> from<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> sawmill<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.119> that's<00:01:15.299> what

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
back from the sawmill and that's what

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.840 
back from the sawmill and that's what
we're<00:01:15.689> using<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.200> part<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:17.189> these<00:01:17.310> buildings

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
we're using in part for these buildings

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.359 
we're using in part for these buildings
some<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.810> Cypress<00:01:19.159> locally<00:01:20.159> harvested

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
some of it is Cypress locally harvested

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.940 
some of it is Cypress locally harvested
and<00:01:21.000> used<00:01:21.060> here<00:01:21.930> now<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.290> windows<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.770> are

and used here now the windows that are

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.429 
and used here now the windows that are
going<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.520> these<00:01:23.939> buildings<00:01:24.479> are<00:01:24.630> salvaged

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
going in these buildings are salvaged

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.740 
going in these buildings are salvaged
from<00:01:25.860> houses<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.640> been<00:01:26.670> pulled<00:01:27.150> out<00:01:27.390> so

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
from houses that have been pulled out so

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.899 
from houses that have been pulled out so
I'm<00:01:27.840> very<00:01:28.080> excited<00:01:28.259> about<00:01:28.770> reusing<00:01:29.520> and

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
I'm very excited about reusing and

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.480 
I'm very excited about reusing and
recycling<00:01:30.320> right<00:01:31.320> here<00:01:31.650> now<00:01:31.950> take<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.159> look<00:01:32.340> at

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
recycling right here now take a look at

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.390 
recycling right here now take a look at
the<00:01:32.670> pathway<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:33.869> I've<00:01:34.350> mentioned<00:01:34.560> pathways

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the pathway as I've mentioned pathways

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.969 
the pathway as I've mentioned pathways
are<00:01:35.579> very<00:01:35.909> important<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:37.320> consider<00:01:37.710> them

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
are very important and I consider them

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.310 
are very important and I consider them
part<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.520> structure<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.180> garden<00:01:39.600> here

because<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.680> vegetable<00:01:44.070> garden<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.759> need

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
because in a vegetable garden you need

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.420 
because in a vegetable garden you need
excellent<00:01:45.479> drainage<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.110> down<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.740> center<00:01:47.250> of

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
excellent drainage so down the center of

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.139 
excellent drainage so down the center of
this<00:01:47.850> garden<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.960> put<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.909> filter<00:01:50.909> fabric

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
this garden we put in a filter fabric
