two<00:00:04.710> water<00:00:04.980> marble<00:00:05.339> designs<00:00:05.730> this<00:00:06.690> first

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
two water marble designs this first

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.410 
two water marble designs this first
design<00:00:07.529> uses<00:00:07.980> three<00:00:08.280> polishes<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:08.880> they<00:00:09.300> are

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
design uses three polishes and they are

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.350 
design uses three polishes and they are
all<00:00:09.599> from<00:00:09.809> OPI<00:00:10.230> I<00:00:10.610> normally<00:00:11.610> don't<00:00:11.820> use<00:00:11.910> any

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
all from OPI I normally don't use any

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.930 
all from OPI I normally don't use any
OPI<00:00:12.780> nail<00:00:13.049> polishes<00:00:13.620> because<00:00:13.920> because<00:00:14.309> it's<00:00:14.639> a

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
OPI nail polishes because because it's a

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.930 
OPI nail polishes because because it's a
little<00:00:15.210> bit<00:00:15.480> more<00:00:16.320> on<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.890> expensive<00:00:17.160> side

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
little bit more on the expensive side

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.500 
little bit more on the expensive side
and<00:00:18.890> for<00:00:19.890> water<00:00:20.189> marble<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.670> do<00:00:20.910> have<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.300> use

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
and for water marble you do have to use

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.470 
and for water marble you do have to use
more<00:00:22.260> drops<00:00:22.560> than<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.630> normal<00:00:24.630> manicure<00:00:25.230> but

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
more drops than a normal manicure but

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.910 
more drops than a normal manicure but
OPI<00:00:27.480> actually<00:00:27.960> works<00:00:28.170> really<00:00:28.380> well<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
OPI actually works really well in the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:38.310 
OPI actually works really well in the
water

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.020 

now<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.380> bullseye<00:00:39.920> is<00:00:40.100> done<00:00:40.370> I'm<00:00:40.580> going<00:00:40.820> to<00:00:40.880> go

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
now the bullseye is done I'm going to go

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.690 
now the bullseye is done I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:41.150> and<00:00:41.480> draw<00:00:41.600> my<00:00:41.630> design<00:00:42.190> I'm<00:00:43.190> not<00:00:43.460> going

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
ahead and draw my design I'm not going

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.210 
ahead and draw my design I'm not going
to<00:00:43.760> go<00:00:44.030> ahead<00:00:44.300> and<00:00:44.540> go<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:44.720> the<00:00:45.230> outermost<00:00:45.770> ring

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
to go ahead and go to the outermost ring

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.150 
to go ahead and go to the outermost ring
because<00:00:46.700> the<00:00:47.420> polish<00:00:47.870> is<00:00:48.080> already<00:00:48.500> dry<00:00:48.800> over

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
because the polish is already dry over

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.840 
because the polish is already dry over
there<00:00:49.600> so<00:00:50.600> I'm<00:00:50.720> just<00:00:50.750> going<00:00:51.170> to<00:00:51.370> do<00:00:52.370> few

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
there so I'm just going to do few

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.170 
there so I'm just going to do few
strokes

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.050 

and<00:00:58.110> now<00:00:58.950> I'm<00:00:59.070> going<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.310> do<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> same<00:00:59.760> thing

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
and now I'm going to do the same thing

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.679 
and now I'm going to do the same thing
but<00:01:00.360> from<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.170> other<00:01:01.380> direction

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.169 

now<00:01:07.289> the<00:01:07.350> design<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.219> done<00:01:08.249> I'm<00:01:08.819> going<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.119> go

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179 
now the design is done I'm going to go

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:11.899 
now the design is done I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.780> take<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.170> fake<00:01:10.439> nail<00:01:10.679> and<00:01:10.950> dip<00:01:11.670> in

from Ulta so these ones I actually
picked<00:01:54.509> up<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.810> cell<00:01:55.140> door<00:01:55.170> five<00:01:55.800> for<00:01:56.070> five

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
picked up on cell door five for five

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.460 
picked up on cell door five for five
dollars<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.910> they<00:01:57.509> work<00:01:57.690> really<00:01:58.020> well<00:01:58.170> in

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
dollars and they work really well in

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.560 
dollars and they work really well in
order<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:59.190> let's<00:01:59.220> get<00:01:59.790> started<00:02:00.270> with<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
order so let's get started with the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:23.900 
order so let's get started with the
bull's<00:02:00.780> eye

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.920

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.780 

that's<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.110> bullseye<00:02:29.530> I'm<00:02:30.190> going<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.549> go<00:02:30.730> to

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
that's the bullseye I'm going to go to

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.230 
that's the bullseye I'm going to go to
the<00:02:31.090> top<00:02:31.629> and<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.379> bottom

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.370 

and<00:02:36.330> I'm<00:02:37.230> going<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.590> drag<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.460> one<00:02:38.700> more<00:02:38.880> time

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
and I'm going to drag it one more time

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:47.690 
and I'm going to drag it one more time
from<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.440> center<00:02:45.890> I'm<00:02:46.890> going<00:02:47.070> to<00:02:47.220> do<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.460> same

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
from the center I'm going to do the same

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.149 
from the center I'm going to do the same
on<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.060> bottom

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.440

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
now I'm going to quickly go from sides

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.780 
now I'm going to quickly go from sides
to<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.599> from<00:03:01.379> the<00:03:01.530> middle<00:03:01.799> to<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.010> side<00:03:02.370> I'm

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
to the from the middle to the side I'm

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.259 
to the from the middle to the side I'm
going<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:03.629> try<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:03.959> do<00:03:04.170> this<00:03:04.370> as<00:03:05.370> fast<00:03:05.730> as<00:03:05.969> I<00:03:06.180> can

design looks like on the nail so I'm

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.729 
design looks like on the nail so I'm
going<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:53.730> go<00:03:53.970> at<00:03:54.239> an<00:03:54.390> angle<00:03:54.420> so<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.200> not<00:03:55.709> only

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
going to go at an angle so I not only

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.970 
going to go at an angle so I not only
take<00:03:56.310> up<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.930> center<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.260> design<00:03:58.650> but<00:03:58.950> I

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
take up the center of the design but I

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:09.770 
take up the center of the design but I
pick<00:03:59.310> up<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.610> size<00:03:59.879> as<00:04:00.180> well

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.370 

and<00:04:11.370> here<00:04:12.370> is<00:04:12.580> the<00:04:12.940> design<00:04:13.330> on<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.900> nail<00:04:14.110> I

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
and here is the design on the nail I

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.130 
and here is the design on the nail I
think<00:04:14.800> this<00:04:14.950> is<00:04:15.130> really<00:04:15.370> cool<00:04:15.760> it<00:04:16.600> almost<00:04:16.870> has

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
think this is really cool it almost has

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.470 
think this is really cool it almost has
a<00:04:17.170> geometric<00:04:17.590> kind<00:04:18.459> of<00:04:18.609> shape<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.299> it

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
a geometric kind of shape to it

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.750 
a geometric kind of shape to it
