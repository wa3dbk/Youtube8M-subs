to use and they get a nicer you get a
nicer<00:02:13.390> finish<00:02:13.420> with<00:02:13.870> them<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:15.280> is<00:02:15.660> 120<00:02:16.660> grit

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400

that's<00:02:18.400> usually<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.940> good<00:02:19.240> place<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.540> start<00:02:20.040> you

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
that's usually a good place to start you

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.370 
that's usually a good place to start you
can<00:02:21.220> experiment<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.390> try<00:02:22.630> what<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.200> like

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
can experiment and try what you like

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.010 
can experiment and try what you like
best<00:02:23.680> but<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:24.820> would<00:02:25.240> suggest<00:02:25.420> starting<00:02:25.960> with

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
best but I would suggest starting with

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.760 
best but I would suggest starting with
120<00:02:26.740> grit<00:02:26.770> and<00:02:27.220> then<00:02:28.200> keep<00:02:29.200> in<00:02:29.350> mind<00:02:29.560> though

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
120 grit and then keep in mind though

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.370 
120 grit and then keep in mind though
that<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:30.730> lower<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.330> number<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.720> course<00:02:32.200> of

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
that the lower the number the course of

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.380 
that the lower the number the course of
the<00:02:32.500> grit<00:02:32.710> so<00:02:33.040> for<00:02:33.340> example<00:02:33.790> 80<00:02:34.090> grit

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
the grit so for example 80 grit

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.260 
the grit so for example 80 grit

let's start with this little green table

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.870 
let's start with this little green table
it<00:05:01.800> has<00:05:02.250> a<00:05:02.580> previously<00:05:03.530> painted<00:05:04.530> surface<00:05:05.310> and

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
it has a previously painted surface and

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.879 
it has a previously painted surface and
even<00:05:06.120> though<00:05:06.270> I<00:05:06.570> don't<00:05:06.900> think<00:05:07.080> it's<00:05:07.590> an

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
even though I don't think it's an

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.159 
even though I don't think it's an

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
have been an oil-based paint the paint

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.270 
have been an oil-based paint the paint
wouldn't<00:05:35.729> have<00:05:36.000> come<00:05:36.240> off<00:05:36.800> so<00:05:37.800> what<00:05:38.130> I<00:05:38.159> did

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
yesterday was I painted this little test

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.480 
yesterday was I painted this little test
here<00:05:42.010> to<00:05:42.670> see<00:05:42.910> how<00:05:43.150> well<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.510> paint<00:05:43.750> adheres

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490
