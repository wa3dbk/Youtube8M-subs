00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.500 
if I can get her out of there maybe with
a<00:02:39.660> little<00:02:39.990> extra<00:02:40.290> oomph<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:41.270> little<00:02:42.270> extra

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
a little extra oomph a little extra

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.350 
a little extra oomph a little extra
tension<00:02:42.900> on<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.200> front<00:02:43.860> end<00:02:44.010> it'll<00:02:44.360> pull

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
tension on the front end it'll pull

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.140 
tension on the front end it'll pull
itself<00:02:45.660> up<00:02:45.810> out<00:02:45.990> of<00:02:46.140> there<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.290> little<00:02:46.530> easier

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
itself up out of there a little easier

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:56.900 
itself up out of there a little easier
worth<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.300> shot<00:02:50.300> okay<00:02:51.300> that's<00:02:51.810> another<00:02:52.200> fail<00:02:55.910> so

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
worth a shot okay that's another fail so

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.420 
worth a shot okay that's another fail so
when<00:02:57.360> all<00:02:57.510> else<00:02:57.690> fails<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.440> start<00:02:59.070> linking

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
when all else fails you start linking

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.090 
when all else fails you start linking
stuff<00:02:59.730> together<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.590> see<00:03:01.590> if<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.770> can<00:03:01.920> make

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
stuff together and see if you can make

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.460 
stuff together and see if you can make
it<00:03:02.250> work<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.640> way

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
it work that way

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.060 
it work that way

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
to it that air that by itself weighs

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.469 
to it that air that by itself weighs
almost<00:04:41.110> 7,000<00:04:41.949> pounds<00:04:42.340> I<00:04:42.520> don't<00:04:42.910> know<00:04:43.000> how<00:04:43.240> but

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
almost 7,000 pounds I don't know how but

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.870 
almost 7,000 pounds I don't know how but
it<00:04:43.539> does<00:04:43.949> and<00:04:46.680> just<00:04:47.680> not<00:04:47.860> enough<00:04:48.160> you<00:04:48.699> can't

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
it does and just not enough you can't

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.390 
it does and just not enough you can't
get<00:04:49.000> enough<00:04:49.180> grip<00:04:49.449> or<00:04:49.630> whatever<00:04:50.250> without<00:04:51.250> it

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
get enough grip or whatever without it

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.589 
get enough grip or whatever without it
trying<00:04:51.639> to<00:04:51.759> slide<00:04:52.030> to<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.800> to<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:53.919> left<00:04:54.190> and

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
trying to slide to the to the left and

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:58.350 
trying to slide to the to the left and
run<00:04:55.599> into<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:55.840> porch<00:04:56.169> so<00:04:57.060> we'll<00:04:58.060> have<00:04:58.180> to

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
run into the porch so we'll have to

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.820 
run into the porch so we'll have to
figure<00:04:58.630> something<00:04:59.020> else<00:04:59.199> out<00:04:59.560> nothing<00:05:00.490> else

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
figure something else out nothing else

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.710 
figure something else out nothing else
probably<00:05:02.830> come<00:05:03.070> out<00:05:03.220> here<00:05:03.960> and<00:05:06.330> fire<00:05:07.330> up<00:05:07.570> all

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
probably come out here and fire up all

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:16.159 
probably come out here and fire up all
red<00:05:08.050> since<00:05:08.530> it's<00:05:08.710> a<00:05:08.880> dual<00:05:09.880> rear<00:05:10.150> end<00:05:10.419> on<00:05:10.630> it<00:05:11.970> and

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.450
