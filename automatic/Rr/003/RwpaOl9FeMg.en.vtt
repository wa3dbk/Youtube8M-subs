the<00:00:02.639> Atkins<00:00:03.060> diet<00:00:03.179> trains<00:00:04.049> your<00:00:04.380> body<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.980> burn

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
the Atkins diet trains your body to burn

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.150 
the Atkins diet trains your body to burn
its<00:00:05.609> own<00:00:05.850> fat<00:00:06.569> as<00:00:06.899> your<00:00:07.259> primary<00:00:07.680> energy

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
its own fat as your primary energy

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.749 
its own fat as your primary energy
source<00:00:09.500> enabling<00:00:10.500> you<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.679> lose<00:00:11.190> weight<00:00:11.460> and

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
source enabling you to lose weight and

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.299 
source enabling you to lose weight and
then<00:00:11.940> maintain<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.690> weight<00:00:12.840> loss<00:00:13.099> your<00:00:14.099> body

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
then maintain that weight loss your body

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.580 
then maintain that weight loss your body
handles<00:00:14.910> carbohydrates<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.870> fats<00:00:16.139> very

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
handles carbohydrates and fats very

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.400 
handles carbohydrates and fats very
differently<00:00:17.070> when<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.029> use<00:00:18.449> carbohydrates

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
differently when you use carbohydrates

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.460 
differently when you use carbohydrates
as<00:00:19.560> your<00:00:19.710> primary<00:00:19.949> fuel<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.930> consume

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
as your primary fuel and you consume

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.290 
as your primary fuel and you consume
more<00:00:22.740> carbs<00:00:23.310> than<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.609> body<00:00:23.789> needs<00:00:24.090> for

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
more carbs than the body needs for

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.439 
more carbs than the body needs for
energy<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:25.470> can<00:00:25.650> encourage<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.730> storage<00:00:27.240> of

your stored fat for energy you'll lose

but<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.079> will<00:00:58.230> always<00:00:58.739> burn<00:00:59.070> carbs<00:00:59.699> first

but it will always burn carbs first

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.959 
but it will always burn carbs first
that's<00:01:01.770> not<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.100> carbs<00:01:02.609> are<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> better

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
that's not because carbs are a better

that's not because carbs are a better
fuel<00:01:03.300> source<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:04.830> easier

fuel source it's just that it's easier
for<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.610> body<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.090> use<00:01:06.240> carbs<00:01:06.659> for<00:01:06.810> energy

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
for your body to use carbs for energy

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.710 
for your body to use carbs for energy
because<00:01:07.619> they<00:01:07.650> break<00:01:08.130> down<00:01:08.430> into<00:01:08.760> glucose<00:01:09.479> or
