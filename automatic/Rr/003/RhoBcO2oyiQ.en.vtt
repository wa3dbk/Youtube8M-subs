 study then sorry that's why I'm going to 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.410
 see if you create a server to play 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.960
 with a friend and upload videos or if not 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.439
 they entered would serve served if to play 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.809
 and record it and to record but then 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.739
 in the description I will give you the link 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.809
 of download then let's download 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:43.649
 this little tummies there like that there's 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.480
 install it we sold it here because here 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.480
 says it will be the last install it 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.480
 ready let's go the blog launcher 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.750
 let's now like the diversity here 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.540
 top block launcher options 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.989
 and we came here we will be 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.160
 add-ons and how can you see 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.540
 automatically if not put here the 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.950
 take intense 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.950
 then I will 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.330
 then as you can see here I have the m 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.820
 and here things come out and one thing that 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.979
 has liked to make nitens take you have like 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.650
 the computer more or less who by 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.770
 example I want to do what was 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.650
 then I say here it just tells you how 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.840
 it is done 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.910
 For example, leaving a bed 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.910
 obviously making a bed is easy 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.700
 to do as for example that to 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.850
 do this then tell how it is done 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.340
 So here it tells us how the 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.800
 things because not so much here tells us 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.740
 how to do then for example as 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.470
 how are things going to look like then 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.020
 Well I hope I hope you liked the 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.310
 idea is like sharing your clients and what 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.310
 thank and good
