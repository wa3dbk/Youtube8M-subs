00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.710
 i 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:25.890
 fragile like a kite on the roofs of 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.890
 ravines 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:35.230
 played the night child with his little hands 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:40.070
 purple 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:42.170
 with the rag ball 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.570
 I have also seen the person with the 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:50.550
 what I was talking about, they're going to do that 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:54.750
 It has been a study session 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.000
 several of us played soccer baby 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.680
 and we had 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.409
 a team where víctor participated 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.859
 participated 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.319
 july wars with my brother william without 

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:13.150
 all of us who are at that moment the 

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:15.520
 group had 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.470
 much interest in the future always 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.070
 then always before people something that happens 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.340
 championships 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:28.570
 there were some who were supporters of the 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.620
 or another was before the color but we have 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.550
 had always 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.640
 a lot of interest in football 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.870
 and there came a time when the magazine 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.270
 rhythm 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.360
 organized a championship in order to 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.470
 promote national artists who 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.229
 it consisted of the artists forming 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.710
 teams and that are presented to these 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.710
 championships 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:04.610
 he was not a great player we were not very 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.610
 good but but the victory was 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:13.260
 He did what he could but he did not cooperate 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.960
 let's say the game but it's very nice that 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.040
 that 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:23.640
 the fact that not everything is pure 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.630
 stress because that makes there's always 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.530
 an uncertainty and a quota that puts 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.620
 chance or what it means to be the moment when 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.740
 the players are asking until one 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.000
 graphic of a bee can be 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:46.200
 determinants of for me and it's like a 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.150
 synthesis of the life of these two teams 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:54.390
 that face that they look for let's say 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:59.420
 consolidate his triumph but that also 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:02.340
 are delivered to this game of chance of 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.030
 destination 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.030
 here 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.150
 we left like two weeks before 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.140
 of the military coup 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.500
 we are at a press conference 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.810
 journalist and great journalists running 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.150
 announcing that there is the military coup 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.550
 we did not understand anything in his 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.010
 moment one or two days later we 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:30.030
 we find out we are also in a 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.950
 theater waiting to go out and sing when 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:37.100
 Suddenly terrible news arrives 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.160
 frightful from 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.390
 he does had killed víctor 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.090
 we could not believe that I could 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:51.460
 occur a thing like that was a blow 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.460
 terrible in the head and in the heart 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.370
 like what was the awakening to what 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:04:00.329
 it was truly happening in 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:04.110
 chile there we realized that it was a 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:07.079
 horror that was a monstrous thing and of 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:10.069
 what we were going to take a long time in 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.069
 undo
