playing a first-person shooter and

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.690 
playing a first-person shooter and
anyway<00:03:26.580> Mike<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:26.970> Laura<00:03:27.120> are<00:03:27.390> still<00:03:28.050> reading

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
anyway Mike and Laura are still reading

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.010 
anyway Mike and Laura are still reading
still<00:03:29.700> brushing<00:03:30.060> up<00:03:30.180> on<00:03:30.270> their<00:03:30.330> skill<00:03:30.660> points

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
still brushing up on their skill points

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.960 
still brushing up on their skill points
it's<00:03:31.920> going<00:03:32.100> to<00:03:32.130> take<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.340> while<00:03:32.550> especially

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
it's going to take a while especially

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.470 
it's going to take a while especially
because<00:03:33.630> they<00:03:33.960> are<00:03:34.140> so<00:03:35.070> far<00:03:35.460> up<00:03:35.490> on<00:03:36.210> those

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
because they are so far up on those

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.080 
because they are so far up on those
points<00:03:36.960> I<00:03:37.190> think<00:03:38.190> Mike<00:03:38.400> will<00:03:38.550> probably<00:03:38.880> get<00:03:38.940> it

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
points I think Mike will probably get it

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
points I think Mike will probably get it
before<00:03:39.180> Laura<00:03:39.570> she<00:03:39.930> has<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.460> longer<00:03:41.460> way<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.790> go

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.170
