the market for if you're buying this OEM

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.670 
the market for if you're buying this OEM
be<00:00:52.700> sure<00:00:52.880> that<00:00:53.090> you<00:00:53.180> get<00:00:53.330> a<00:00:53.530> really<00:00:54.530> good

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
be sure that you get a really good

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.290 
be sure that you get a really good
heater<00:00:54.950> cooler<00:00:55.430> because<00:00:55.640> it<00:00:55.760> will<00:00:55.940> get<00:00:56.120> quite

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
heater cooler because it will get quite

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.620 
heater cooler because it will get quite
hot<00:00:56.860> also<00:00:57.860> and<00:00:58.220> they<00:00:58.310> are<00:00:58.490> still<00:00:58.700> using<00:00:58.730> 45

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
hot also and they are still using 45

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.990 
hot also and they are still using 45
nanometer<00:01:00.200> technology<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:00.950> this<00:01:01.130> chip<00:01:01.550> is<00:01:01.760> no

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
nanometer technology and this chip is no

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.090 
nanometer technology and this chip is no
different<00:01:02.420> it<00:01:02.540> still<00:01:02.630> uses<00:01:02.960> 45<00:01:03.560> nanometer

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
different it still uses 45 nanometer

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.370 
different it still uses 45 nanometer
technology<00:01:04.360> Intel<00:01:05.360> obviously<00:01:05.869> now<00:01:06.140> have

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
technology Intel obviously now have

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.920 
technology Intel obviously now have
moved<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.860> 32<00:01:07.610> nanometer<00:01:08.060> technology<00:01:08.299> and

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
moved to 32 nanometer technology and

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.960 
moved to 32 nanometer technology and
hopefully<00:01:09.229> that's<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:09.680> move<00:01:09.860> that<00:01:09.890> AMD<00:01:10.640> can

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
hopefully that's the move that AMD can

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.660 
hopefully that's the move that AMD can
move<00:01:11.150> to<00:01:11.360> in<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:12.020> very<00:01:12.290> near<00:01:12.500> future<00:01:12.530> it<00:01:13.430> has<00:01:13.609> a

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
move to in the very near future it has a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.639 
move to in the very near future it has a
total<00:01:14.090> with<00:01:14.179> 2<00:01:14.359> megabytes<00:01:14.810> of<00:01:14.869> l2<00:01:14.960> cache<00:01:15.200> but

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
total with 2 megabytes of l2 cache but

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.289 
total with 2 megabytes of l2 cache but
is<00:01:15.740> missing<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.189> l3<00:01:16.490> cache<00:01:16.729> that<00:01:17.179> the

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
is missing the l3 cache that the

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.359 
is missing the l3 cache that the

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
chip but that still doesn't stop us from

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
having a little fun and games of it and

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.050 
having a little fun and games of it and
overclocking<00:01:26.869> this<00:01:27.289> particular<00:01:27.679> chip<00:01:28.130> every

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
overclocking this particular chip every

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.209 
overclocking this particular chip every
processor<00:01:29.689> review<00:01:30.109> that<00:01:30.229> I<00:01:30.289> do<00:01:30.350> I<00:01:30.679> do<00:01:30.740> feel

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
processor review that I do I do feel

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:32.800 
processor review that I do I do feel
that<00:01:31.249> I<00:01:31.490> am<00:01:31.549> becoming<00:01:32.030> quite<00:01:32.479> repetitive

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
that I am becoming quite repetitive

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.050 
that I am becoming quite repetitive
because<00:01:33.649> I<00:01:33.890> talk<00:01:34.100> about<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:34.429> design<00:01:34.789> and

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
because I talk about the design and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.749 
because I talk about the design and
styling<00:01:35.359> of<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.749> chip<00:01:35.990> frankly<00:01:36.679> it's<00:01:37.130> purely

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
styling of the chip frankly it's purely

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.660 
styling of the chip frankly it's purely
to<00:01:37.999> just<00:01:38.210> sort<00:01:38.389> of<00:01:38.420> say<00:01:38.719> that<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:40.009> chip<00:01:40.249> hasn't

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
to just sort of say that the chip hasn't

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.739 
to just sort of say that the chip hasn't
changed<00:01:41.060> over<00:01:41.179> time

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
changed over time

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:43.660 
changed over time
this<00:01:42.020> chip<00:01:42.319> still<00:01:42.649> looks<00:01:42.829> like<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.189> older

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
this chip still looks like the older

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.309 
this chip still looks like the older
chips<00:01:44.210> have<00:01:44.359> been<00:01:44.389> used<00:01:44.630> in<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.840> Athlon<00:01:45.049> 64

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
chips have been used in the Athlon 64

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:48.039 
chips have been used in the Athlon 64
days<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.249> only<00:01:46.399> chips<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:46.850> look<00:01:47.749> slightly

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
days the only chips that look slightly

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.599 
days the only chips that look slightly
different<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.560> this<00:01:48.649> where<00:01:48.889> the<00:01:48.979> old<00:01:49.189> Athlon

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:49.609 
different to this where the old Athlon

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.639 
different to this where the old Athlon
XP<00:01:49.880> is<00:01:50.060> because<00:01:50.389> they<00:01:50.509> didn't<00:01:50.749> have<00:01:50.869> this<00:01:50.990> IHS

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
XP is because they didn't have this IHS

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.529 
XP is because they didn't have this IHS
shim<00:01:52.189> on<00:01:52.310> top<00:01:52.549> it<00:01:52.670> was<00:01:52.759> just<00:01:52.969> the<00:01:53.090> bare<00:01:53.270> call

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
shim on top it was just the bare call

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.319 
shim on top it was just the bare call
but<00:01:54.079> since<00:01:54.409> the<00:01:54.530> Athlon<00:01:54.740> 64<00:01:54.979> days<00:01:55.579> this<00:01:55.969> has

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
but since the Athlon 64 days this has

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.379 
but since the Athlon 64 days this has
been<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:57.409> overall<00:01:57.799> style<00:01:58.069> the<00:01:58.459> same<00:01:58.670> size<00:01:58.999> the

00:01:59.379 --> 00:01:59.389 
been the overall style the same size the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:01.989 
been the overall style the same size the
same<00:01:59.420> design<00:01:59.959> and<00:02:00.259> so<00:02:00.469> forth<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:01.639> is<00:02:01.700> quite

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:01.999 
same design and so forth it is quite

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:03.940 
same design and so forth it is quite
nice<00:02:02.119> so<00:02:02.179> I<00:02:02.600> will<00:02:03.020> admit<00:02:03.259> I<00:02:03.289> do<00:02:03.409> like<00:02:03.619> having

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
nice so I will admit I do like having

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.559 
nice so I will admit I do like having

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
the heat shield on top because it does

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.929 
the heat shield on top because it does

the speed of the chip the model number
the<00:02:31.100> voltage<00:02:31.520> TDP<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:33.230> forth<00:02:33.730> taking<00:02:34.730> a

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
the voltage TDP and so forth taking a

the voltage TDP and so forth taking a
look<00:02:34.880> at<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.060> underside<00:02:35.330> of<00:02:35.540> chip<00:02:35.930> once<00:02:36.260> again

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
look at the underside of chip once again

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.410 
look at the underside of chip once again
no<00:02:36.830> different<00:02:37.250> these<00:02:37.370> chips<00:02:37.670> really<00:02:38.120> haven't

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
no different these chips really haven't

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.880 
no different these chips really haven't
changed<00:02:38.450> if<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.020> look<00:02:39.170> at<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.350> Intel<00:02:39.650> chips

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
changed if you look at the Intel chips

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.080 
changed if you look at the Intel chips
they're<00:02:40.130> slightly<00:02:40.370> different<00:02:40.790> with<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:40.940> i7

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
they're slightly different with the i7

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.900 
they're slightly different with the i7
and<00:02:41.690> so<00:02:42.200> on<00:02:42.380> because<00:02:42.740> they<00:02:43.250> haven't<00:02:43.550> got<00:02:43.670> pins

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
and so on because they haven't got pins

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.310 
and so on because they haven't got pins
on<00:02:44.090> them<00:02:44.210> as<00:02:44.330> such<00:02:44.510> they've<00:02:44.720> got<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:44.990> actual

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
on them as such they've got the actual

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.930 
on them as such they've got the actual
holes<00:02:45.770> in<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.100> motherboards<00:02:46.520> got<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.730> pins

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
holes in the motherboards got the pins

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.820 
holes in the motherboards got the pins
and<00:02:47.180> they<00:02:47.420> are<00:02:47.600> still<00:02:47.840> sticking<00:02:48.110> with<00:02:48.260> this

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
and they are still sticking with this

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.580 
and they are still sticking with this
overall<00:02:49.220> design<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:50.420> is<00:02:50.570> a<00:02:50.810> socket<00:02:51.140> am3

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
overall design it is a socket am3

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.830 
overall design it is a socket am3
processor<00:02:52.070> obviously<00:02:52.880> will<00:02:53.060> work<00:02:53.210> with<00:02:53.390> a<00:02:53.570> m2

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
processor obviously will work with a m2

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.470 
processor obviously will work with a m2
plus<00:02:54.050> as<00:02:54.320> well<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.920> socket<00:02:55.310> am3<00:02:55.910> is<00:02:56.120> actually

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
plus as well the socket am3 is actually

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.300 
plus as well the socket am3 is actually
nine<00:02:56.810> hundred<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.260> forty-one<00:02:57.620> pins<00:02:58.040> on<00:02:58.220> the

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
nine hundred and forty-one pins on the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.650 
nine hundred and forty-one pins on the

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
motherboard about the chips themselves

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.060 
motherboard about the chips themselves
you've<00:03:00.110> nine<00:03:00.290> hundred<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.680> thirty<00:03:00.800> eight

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
you've nine hundred and thirty eight

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.340 
you've nine hundred and thirty eight
pins<00:03:01.430> this<00:03:01.880> is<00:03:02.030> because<00:03:02.330> of<00:03:02.420> AMD's<00:03:02.810> transition

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
pins this is because of AMD's transition

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.760 
pins this is because of AMD's transition
period<00:03:03.650> between<00:03:03.770> a<00:03:04.190> m2<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.090> am3<00:03:06.080> so<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.650> this

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
period between a m2 and am3 so that this

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.590 
period between a m2 and am3 so that this
chip<00:03:07.220> can<00:03:07.400> actually<00:03:07.670> be<00:03:07.730> used<00:03:07.940> in<00:03:08.090> an<00:03:08.210> a.m.<00:03:08.450> 2

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
chip can actually be used in an a.m. 2

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.190 
chip can actually be used in an a.m. 2
plus<00:03:08.870> board<00:03:09.140> as<00:03:09.290> well<00:03:09.830> as<00:03:09.890> an<00:03:10.190> a.m.<00:03:10.670> 3<00:03:11.300> board<00:03:11.900> as

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
plus board as well as an a.m. 3 board as

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.600 
plus board as well as an a.m. 3 board as
well<00:03:12.410> so<00:03:12.770> it's<00:03:12.890> quite<00:03:13.010> nice<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.370> way<00:03:13.460> that

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
well so it's quite nice the way that

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.040 
well so it's quite nice the way that
they've<00:03:13.700> done<00:03:13.880> that<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.300> you<00:03:14.540> don't<00:03:14.750> have<00:03:14.870> to

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
they've done that and you don't have to

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.270 
they've done that and you don't have to
sort<00:03:15.260> of<00:03:15.290> fork<00:03:15.530> out<00:03:15.710> for<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:15.920> whole<00:03:16.100> new

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
sort of fork out for a whole new

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.640 
sort of fork out for a whole new
motherboard<00:03:16.760> just<00:03:17.720> like<00:03:17.870> you<00:03:17.990> have<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.350> with

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
motherboard just like you have to with

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.830 
motherboard just like you have to with
the<00:03:18.860> Intel<00:03:19.250> hence<00:03:19.700> why<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:20.150> am<00:03:20.420> they're<00:03:20.600> always

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
the Intel hence why I am they're always

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.690 
the Intel hence why I am they're always
slightly<00:03:21.230> cheaper<00:03:21.590> when<00:03:22.280> it<00:03:22.400> comes<00:03:22.580> to

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
slightly cheaper when it comes to

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.100 
slightly cheaper when it comes to
motherboards<00:03:23.270> processors<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.050> memory

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
motherboards processors and memory

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.200 
motherboards processors and memory

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
because they've just tried to think

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.820 
because they've just tried to think
about<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:26.720> customer<00:03:27.140> that<00:03:27.410> a<00:03:27.470> little<00:03:27.740> bit

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
about the customer that a little bit

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.880 
about the customer that a little bit
more<00:03:28.010> in<00:03:28.250> comparison<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:29.000> Intel<00:03:29.660> and<00:03:30.050> also<00:03:30.770> in

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
more in comparison to Intel and also in

review<00:03:33.740> I<00:03:33.890> do<00:03:34.040> I<00:03:34.070> like<00:03:34.280> to<00:03:34.459> sort<00:03:34.910> of<00:03:34.940> say<00:03:35.090> a

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
review I do I like to sort of say a

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.040 
review I do I like to sort of say a
little<00:03:35.390> bit<00:03:35.480> something<00:03:35.690> about<00:03:35.840> the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
little bit something about the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.630 
little bit something about the
comparison<00:03:36.680> of<00:03:36.800> the<00:03:36.860> chip<00:03:37.070> so<00:03:37.220> it<00:03:37.310> gives<00:03:37.490> you<00:03:37.580> a

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
comparison of the chip so it gives you a

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.090 
comparison of the chip so it gives you a
better<00:03:38.300> idea<00:03:38.510> on<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:39.410> you<00:03:39.590> know<00:03:39.680> if<00:03:39.920> you're

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
better idea on so you know if you're

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.590 
better idea on so you know if you're
paying<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.430> right<00:03:40.580> price<00:03:40.880> for<00:03:40.910> a<00:03:41.090> process<00:03:41.330> of

paying the right price for a process of
all<00:03:41.720> systems<00:03:42.110> right<00:03:42.320> for<00:03:42.470> you<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:42.860> so<00:03:43.160> on<00:03:43.310> with

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
all systems right for you and so on with

all systems right for you and so on with
this<00:03:43.910> it<00:03:44.120> is<00:03:44.240> an<00:03:44.390> AMD<00:03:44.630> processor<00:03:44.780> it's

quad-core and it runs at 2.9 gives if

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.320 
quad-core and it runs at 2.9 gives if
you<00:03:48.290> want<00:03:48.470> a<00:03:48.560> similarly<00:03:49.100> priced<00:03:49.459> Intel<00:03:50.090> chip

than<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.419> AMD<00:04:29.840> chip<00:04:30.080> but<00:04:30.320> when<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:30.830> look<00:04:30.979> at

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
than the AMD chip but when you look at

than the AMD chip but when you look at
it<00:04:31.190> on<00:04:31.280> paper<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:32.120> amount<00:04:32.330> of<00:04:32.450> cores<00:04:32.690> and<00:04:32.960> the

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 
Sandra and Everest obviously you can go

Sandra and Everest obviously you can go
out<00:06:01.130> there<00:06:01.370> and<00:06:01.580> you<00:06:01.670> could<00:06:01.880> buy<00:06:02.060> a<00:06:02.300> phenom<00:06:02.810> 2<00:06:03.080> X

3<00:06:04.340> for<00:06:04.850> around<00:06:05.570> the<00:06:05.690> same<00:06:05.900> sort<00:06:06.140> of<00:06:06.200> money<00:06:06.470> but

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
3 for around the same sort of money but

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.610 
3 for around the same sort of money but
the<00:06:07.550> problem<00:06:07.940> with<00:06:08.090> that<00:06:08.120> is<00:06:08.570> obviously<00:06:09.500> you

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
the problem with that is obviously you

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.680 
the problem with that is obviously you
will<00:06:09.770> get<00:06:09.980> the<00:06:10.310> l3<00:06:10.820> cache<00:06:11.030> which<00:06:11.270> is<00:06:11.420> always<00:06:11.570> a

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
will get the l3 cache which is always a

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.510 
will get the l3 cache which is always a
benefit<00:06:12.110> but<00:06:12.680> the<00:06:12.890> reason<00:06:13.190> you'd<00:06:13.340> probably

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
benefit but the reason you'd probably

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.280 
benefit but the reason you'd probably
buy<00:06:13.760> something<00:06:14.090> like<00:06:14.180> an<00:06:14.300> X<00:06:14.420> phrase<00:06:14.660> in<00:06:14.960> the

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
buy something like an X phrase in the

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.840 
buy something like an X phrase in the
hope<00:06:15.470> that<00:06:15.500> you'd<00:06:15.800> be<00:06:15.920> able<00:06:16.040> to<00:06:16.160> unlock<00:06:16.610> the

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
hope that you'd be able to unlock the

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.390 
hope that you'd be able to unlock the
full<00:06:17.060> core<00:06:17.450> if<00:06:18.080> you're<00:06:18.590> not<00:06:18.800> an<00:06:18.890> enthusiast

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
full core if you're not an enthusiast

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.890 
full core if you're not an enthusiast
and<00:06:19.670> you're<00:06:19.790> not<00:06:19.910> someone<00:06:20.180> who<00:06:20.270> knows<00:06:20.660> how<00:06:20.840> to

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
and you're not someone who knows how to

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.330 
and you're not someone who knows how to
do<00:06:21.110> something<00:06:21.410> like<00:06:21.650> that<00:06:21.710> then<00:06:22.190> you<00:06:22.310> are

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
do something like that then you are

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.980 
do something like that then you are
going<00:06:22.610> to<00:06:22.670> be<00:06:22.760> better<00:06:22.970> off<00:06:23.240> getting<00:06:23.600> something

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
going to be better off getting something

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.810 
going to be better off getting something
like<00:06:24.200> this<00:06:24.350> because<00:06:24.710> it<00:06:24.830> works<00:06:24.980> straight<00:06:25.640> out

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
like this because it works straight out

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.720 
like this because it works straight out
the<00:06:25.910> box<00:06:26.060> quad-core<00:06:26.930> decent<00:06:27.620> speed<00:06:27.890> and<00:06:28.130> it<00:06:28.550> is

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:28.730 
the box quad-core decent speed and it is

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.150 
the box quad-core decent speed and it is
quite<00:06:29.240> good<00:06:29.270> value<00:06:29.690> for<00:06:29.720> money<00:06:29.900> as<00:06:30.200> well<00:06:30.410> due

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 
quite good value for money as well due

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.920 
quite good value for money as well due
to<00:06:31.190> that<00:06:31.430> I'm<00:06:31.610> going<00:06:31.820> to<00:06:31.850> give<00:06:32.000> it<00:06:32.120> 4<00:06:32.540> out<00:06:32.570> of<00:06:32.750> 5

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:32.930 
to that I'm going to give it 4 out of 5

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:41.250 
to that I'm going to give it 4 out of 5
