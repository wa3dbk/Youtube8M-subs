me about it it has nothing to do with
YouTube<00:00:30.989> which<00:00:31.860> I<00:00:31.980> thought<00:00:32.130> was<00:00:32.250> kind<00:00:32.489> of

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
YouTube which I thought was kind of

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.200 
YouTube which I thought was kind of
surprising<00:00:33.800> but<00:00:34.800> everybody<00:00:35.550> I've<00:00:35.730> tried<00:00:36.059> it

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
surprising but everybody I've tried it

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.790 
surprising but everybody I've tried it
out<00:00:36.360> with<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.750> far<00:00:36.930> there's<00:00:37.260> only<00:00:37.320> one<00:00:37.590> person

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
out with so far there's only one person

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.580 
out with so far there's only one person
that's<00:00:38.010> had<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:39.149> let's<00:00:39.510> go<00:00:39.630> ahead<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.930> show

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
that's had it so let's go ahead and show

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.130 
that's had it so let's go ahead and show
you<00:00:40.649> guys<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.250> app<00:00:41.430> here<00:00:41.750> again<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:42.930> called

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140

which<00:02:31.460> I<00:02:31.550> think<00:02:31.790> makes<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.300> lot<00:02:32.450> easier<00:02:32.870> to

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
which I think makes it a lot easier to

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.430 
which I think makes it a lot easier to
move<00:02:33.140> all<00:02:33.320> of<00:02:33.500> them<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:34.120> if<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.270> notice<00:02:35.630> well

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
move all of them and if you notice well

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.230 
move all of them and if you notice well

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.750 
I I really think this thing is cool for
free<00:05:47.450> you<00:05:48.200> know<00:05:48.320> even<00:05:48.680> though<00:05:48.890> it's<00:05:49.310> it<00:05:49.610> might

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
free you know even though it's it might

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.610 
free you know even though it's it might
take<00:05:50.000> a<00:05:50.030> little<00:05:50.180> longer<00:05:50.510> you<00:05:50.960> know<00:05:51.110> like<00:05:51.590> a

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
take a little longer you know like a

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.620 
take a little longer you know like a
next<00:05:52.010> hour<00:05:52.160> or<00:05:52.280> whatever<00:05:52.400> but<00:05:52.820> I<00:05:53.030> think<00:05:53.240> it's

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
next hour or whatever but I think it's

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.380 
next hour or whatever but I think it's
it's<00:05:53.990> it's<00:05:54.260> definitely<00:05:54.740> worth<00:05:54.940> trying<00:05:55.940> it<00:05:56.270> if

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
it's it's definitely worth trying it if

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.990 
it's it's definitely worth trying it if
it's<00:05:56.570> free<00:05:56.870> and<00:05:57.140> you<00:05:58.070> know<00:05:58.190> even<00:05:58.640> if<00:05:58.880> you're

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
it's free and you know even if you're

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.790 
it's free and you know even if you're
driving<00:05:59.270> I<00:05:59.510> think<00:05:59.690> it's<00:05:59.810> I<00:06:00.080> think<00:06:00.410> it's<00:06:00.620> even

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
driving I think it's I think it's even

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.750 
driving I think it's I think it's even
better<00:06:00.950> than<00:06:01.310> than<00:06:02.000> doing<00:06:02.300> like<00:06:02.420> a<00:06:02.510> voice<00:06:02.690> memo

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
better than than doing like a voice memo

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.430 
better than than doing like a voice memo
