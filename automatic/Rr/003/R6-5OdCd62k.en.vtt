00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
if you have acne prone skin and this is

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.550 
if you have acne prone skin and this is
the<00:01:36.240> color<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:40.189> it<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:42.270> not<00:01:42.750> too<00:01:43.170> thick

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
the color and it is it's not too thick

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.920 
the color and it is it's not too thick
it<00:01:45.799> goes<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:47.100> very<00:01:47.579> smooth<00:01:48.090> kind<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.509> like<00:01:48.720> a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
it goes on very smooth kind of like a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.920 
it goes on very smooth kind of like a
primer<00:01:49.380> would<00:01:50.280> feel<00:01:50.610> very<00:01:51.000> silicone<00:01:51.899> II

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
primer would feel very silicone II

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.499 
primer would feel very silicone II
that's<00:01:52.799> probably<00:01:53.189> why<00:01:53.460> my<00:01:53.610> skin<00:01:54.060> didn't<00:01:54.360> like

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
that's probably why my skin didn't like

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.880 
that's probably why my skin didn't like
it<00:01:55.549> um<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.119> goes<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.479> very<00:01:57.840> well<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.530> blends

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
it um but it goes on very well it blends

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.530 
it um but it goes on very well it blends
well<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:02.280> never<00:02:02.640> used<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.030> brush<00:02:03.270> or
