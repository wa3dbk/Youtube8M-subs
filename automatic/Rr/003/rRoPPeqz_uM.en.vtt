00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:19.560
 the rgr valve inspection spoke 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:24.000
 we have the recirculation valve 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:28.740
 exhaust gases to which we are going 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.009
 remove its electrical part to see the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.500
 communication and observe if dirt on the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:42.750
 same 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:49.910
 for this we will remove the screws that 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.910
 to hold the valve head and the outlet 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:07.010
 this valve consists of an electric motor 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:10.880
 a small motor that opens said valve 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.900
 generally when the engine is running. 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:20.990
 working temperature and the 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:24.490
 acceleration is between 1 3 and 10% 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:28.910
 opening i.e. when circulating 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:32.360
 basically at a cruising speed 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:36.740
 when removing this valve 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.590
 you see we have a metal joint 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.700
 that is to say that it arrives 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:47.360
 and that we can observe two 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:51.619
 we see the support that ends against 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.410
 on the head which has these two 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.790
 conduits of them that come internally 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:03.230
 by the head from a branch of this 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:06.140
 the exhaust manifold and the other is that 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:09.679
 drift or corrugated pipe that can 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.959
 to watch down there that it will fall until the 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.350
 Intake manifold 1 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:19.070
 between these two with ducts allen said 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:22.670
 support a metal joint 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.459
 we have the peace or the derivation that in this 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.739
 moment is closed by the electric fifa 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.130
 and we can see there 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:34.910
 this valve toss and sink observe 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.580
 that we press and in this case opens and 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.420
 this is the price you make when the unit 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:45.830
 control electronics sends an end to 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.170
 electric sector and opens valve edital 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.860
 for which you were a small 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:55.760
 amount of exhaust gas 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:59.620
 again remember that the admission 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:03.440
 recirculated or pass burnt gaffe 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.120
 again the admission decreases 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.790
 temperature of combustion 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.950
 and thus reduce the oxides of 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:18.989
 Let's remember that this squid 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:23.569
 and gr is generally applied much more in 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:26.879
 diesel engines in gasoline engines 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:31.110
 this xii cap has the purpose of 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:36.060
 check for dirt in this fable 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:40.400
 remember that when the engine has some 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:44.340
 oil consumption can come a lot of coal 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:47.430
 albay peace of the valve which we should 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.140
 clean this cleaning 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:54.390
 we can do it by removing this body 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.690
 raising with a solvent 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.930
 in this case it is an engine with 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.840
 few kilometers with little use and that 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.560
 has a good functioning so it does not 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.700
 you will need to perform any type of 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.940
 cleaning 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.229
 the metallica joint must also 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:19.459
 check there and in case there is 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:22.680
 difficulty with it we should replace the 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.830
 here we prove that it is in good 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.979
 cleaning state the valve that the gasket 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.940
 is well and that the conduits at the 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.700
 bottom 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.750
 also a clean one with no 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:42.120
 type of obstruction so here only 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:45.349
 Let's ride to continue with others. 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.349
 cheka weight 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:58.120
 we set screws to prevent leaks 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:05:01.690
 exhaust gas and that we have the 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.979
 pneumatic actuation of the device 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:08.020
 which changes the direction of the airflow 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:12.699
 using a language is also 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:16.090
 find inside the snail collector 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:21.669
 intake manifold as in this case the 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:24.729
 motor is off there is no vacuum and the 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:28.449
 no facul is not activated 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:32.410
 pneumatic device when 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:33.669
 start the engine and run at low 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.780
 revolutions 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:42.550
 see that the device is triggered then 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:46.389
 air in the intake manifold will 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.090
 when the engine is 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:53.070
 moment to accelerate 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:56.229
 you see that the 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.960
 changing the pneumatic device 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:02.729
 direction of air circulation 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.530
 then the air is already going to do less 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.000
 turbulence within the 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.659
 admission 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.280
 this system is usually called the 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:19.470
 evolutionary collector type or 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.470
 a varied tiar flow
