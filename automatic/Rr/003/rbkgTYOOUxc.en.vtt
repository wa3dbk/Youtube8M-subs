00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 ladies and gentlemen salvo we all are 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.390
 in the same position as a video 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.730
 previous and then there will be I think 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.040
 others because I take this opportunity to do one 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.120
 kind of little mini tutorial on how 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.839
 some pieces of hardware are mounted 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.490
 computer 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.420
 much advice also today 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.100
 let's talk about the of today I am 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.410
 doing at the same time that I have 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.160
 made a previous video but will be released in 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.789
 different days 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.009
 today we will see how to assemble a branch e 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.270
 on ours on our motherboard is 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:41.420
 in addition I will give you some say a few 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.420
 first trick to use then 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.090
 let's say you mount the ram maybe in between 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.329
 I think it 's the easiest piece of 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.600
 the whole computer is enough as well 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.940
 from above you see you have a cleat 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.739
 here a small space in the meantime if 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.120
 you want to see the unboxing of the range 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.210
 just go always in mine 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.799
 playlist of the second channel that you are there 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.510
 already I think and nothing to watch them unboxing 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.189
 I made you there will also be this 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.310
 I spoke really really well about 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.500
 this time you are seeing that in 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.439
 this ram is a ddr3 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.290
 there is a tacchettina here try to 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.009
 see here also on the motherboard 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.009
 there is a cleat you see which is the verse 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.070
 where the wand will go in this case 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:38.450
 here it is heel and space is called 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:42.840
 therefore, let us enlarge, let us say the retainers e 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.430
 position the card on the motherboard 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.740
 I was saying the ram 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.090
 however, before positioning it I give you a 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.060
 other advice as well because so much is 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.520
 easy then in the end when we are in 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.700
 presence of a motherboard that has the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.860
 slots here and slots here 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.110
 what we have to put in order 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.240
 for example if we have only three banks 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.299
 of ram I'll give you the usual example 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.020
 they always go hand in hand but someone can 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.170
 say that I know what 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.030
 I have three of them 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.680
 it is easy to make the order of the benches 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.670
 because they also correspond to colors 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.650
 different 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.510
 I'll give you an example in the case of 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:28.600
 class normal consumer consumers dell 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.590
 mtv you will usually find blue and yellow or 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.870
 red and yellow 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.670
 this is the example I give you 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.590
 imagine that these two notches are 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.380
 here too it will be red yellow red 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.080
 yellow therefore if you have two banks of ram 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.690
 what you do put the first one on red 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.350
 I second bench not on the yellow one there 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.300
 even if next to the other red 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.070
 they work this way 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.290
 then we have the yellow one we put 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.540
 the yellow one the same thing if there are any 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.510
 8 in my as in my motherboard 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:06.580
 there are eight banks of ram 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:11.770
 you have to make brown with blue brown with 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.660
 blue first on your left then a 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.540
 leave ours on your left 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.870
 right then red put first 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:24.550
 return to amd put the ram desk 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:26.080
 first on the blues cus excuse me blue of the 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.890
 yours on your left and then the 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.770
 red 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.480
 however it is very easy because it is enough 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.040
 orient yourself with the first color that 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.500
 found on the left I know that in the 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.480
 world of computer hardware 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.060
 everything travels in a fast way 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.920
 maybe the colors I'll be saying but between 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.020
 a month maybe they will change even if not 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.590
 have been changed for about 10 years 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.120
 almost lost or always make yourself with the 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.010
 first color you find on the left 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.260
 if the first blue room 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.120
 put the ram bank automatically 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.360
 on the other hand I give you an example 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.550
 always in line where there will be another blue 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.959
 then attacked the second ram bank 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.209
 then the ram bank that will be on 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.120
 second ram bank that will be on 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.290
 left will be you put the ram on 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.319
 the bench itself the yellow bench 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.120
 automatically put the other ram if 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.699
 you have another ram module 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.300
 in this case we are already at three moments 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.740
 in the fourth place your other counter 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.199
 of ram 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.020
 on the first on the first yellow you see 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.940
 on your right 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.449
 sorry I was off I was saying 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.250
 the ram has been put or little battery 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.840
 I thank you again for the minutes you have given me 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.509
 you have dedicated and this explanation 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.910
 I also show him violated is 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:48.099
 guys, please follow me 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.099
 sign up and I salute you for the fig tree
