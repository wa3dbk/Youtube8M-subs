00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 or people out focus in this episode 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:08.390
 let's talk about the movie of the 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.390
 Planet of the Apes' confrontation 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.020
 he did not tell me 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.570
 this movie is about the second 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.730
 part of the new saga that was created from the 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.949
 planet of the apes for we have to 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.620
 this successor to the film in front of 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.320
 children revolution and is directed by 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.570
 the director matt reeves who runs a 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.120
 movie version and 'let me in' 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.519
 and we have the main character of 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.239
 excite and I know exactly you can tell 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.949
 and we have the actor andy serkins 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.409
 interpreting the role of this ape 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.570
 leading leader that surely you 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:06.350
 sounds this man's face because 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.240
 is who makes the character of gollum and 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.340
 we also have actor jason clark 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.800
 playing the character of malcom 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.200
 who on this occasion will have the role 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.399
 protagonist who had james franco in the 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.770
 first part of the country between 60 and 100 of 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.869
 them and basically in this movie we 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.479
 we are 10 years after what we saw 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.000
 in the first part and most of 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.670
 the human race is extinct 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.480
 due to a virus that expanded 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.510
 around 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.250
 everyone without me already formed 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.190
 a society in which a small 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.750
 well-formed community and 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.120
 as the title says it is going to narrate 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.300
 a confrontation a confrontation 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.280
 among the apes and among humans 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.800
 will arise from the interests of 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.840
 each of the groups mainly 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.850
 on the side of humans the truth is that 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.840
 this movie starts a little slow if 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.400
 You are one of the people who are 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.260
 used to a movie 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.090
 start already with the conflict however 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.650
 this movie is little by little 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.480
 posing the situation is going 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.030
 presenting the characters so that 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.730
 go knowing and then start a 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.070
 movie full of action conflicts 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.050
 of very good battles the truth is that 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.000
 the story is very good and I liked it 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.730
 quite the approach of this 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.290
 history and how things are happening 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.420
 although the truth is that if you take away the 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.730
 simian factor you realize that it is a 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.470
 very typical story let's say a little 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.220
 clichÃ© where you have the character 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.970
 hero to the antihero to the villain to the 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.550
 family to the drama does not remain however 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.190
 and obviously very respectable mind 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.680
 adding 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.890
 if everything becomes much more interesting 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.770
 there are kids 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.080
 it's her 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.970
 and have animal reactions against 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.120
 humans but now animals with 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.610
 Semi human feelings makes it 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.860
 obviously very special the performances 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.530
 They are pretty good but it's very strange 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.660
 say that apes act better than 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.130
 the humans in this movie obviously 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.860
 the apes are made to 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.660
 computers previously operated by 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.030
 humans but it is that the aspects 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.070
 specials and the gestures of the apes and 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.320
 the reactions and the sound of their voices 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.630
 It is very shocking and it makes 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.640
 surpass the performance of humans 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.250
 which is also pretty good but 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.340
 surpassed by the apes the battles are 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.230
 excellent all the animations are very 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.180
 good and they make you immerse yourself in 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.730
 much more history is 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.500
 excellently built and I also 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.240
 I would like to mention that the soundtrack or 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.770
 the music of this movie is 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.360
 very good has some themes that 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.770
 refer a little to the movies 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.790
 old gives you this idea more 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.560
 post-apocalyptic because they eat a little bit 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.870
 old with the new and the truth is that 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.290
 the music was very father in this 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.980
 film and I for that reason I'm going to give 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.689
 stars and a half of five if you already 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.519
 saw in this movie tell me how about them 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:02.579
 it seemed and if they liked it better the first 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.560
 part or this second part and leave everything 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.030
