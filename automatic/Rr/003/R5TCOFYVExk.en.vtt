00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
you know so all together the way that

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:30.059 
you know so all together the way that
should<00:04:23.120> sound<00:04:23.330> is

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:30.069 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:32.050 

something<00:04:31.069> like<00:04:31.190> that<00:04:31.220> then<00:04:31.580> you<00:04:31.669> play<00:04:31.880> that

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
something like that then you play that

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.120 
something like that then you play that
twice<00:04:32.300> so<00:04:32.930> that's<00:04:33.110> actually<00:04:33.289> the<00:04:33.650> entire<00:04:33.889> song

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
twice so that's actually the entire song

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.430 
twice so that's actually the entire song
of<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.310> chords<00:04:35.020> you're<00:04:36.020> going<00:04:36.139> to<00:04:36.199> have<00:04:36.289> to<00:04:36.350> do

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
of the chords you're going to have to do

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.800 
of the chords you're going to have to do
the<00:04:36.560> inner<00:04:36.680> loop<00:04:36.830> twice<00:04:37.160> I<00:04:37.400> know<00:04:37.460> that<00:04:37.729> so<00:04:38.630> for

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
the inner loop twice I know that so for

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.450 
the inner loop twice I know that so for
that<00:04:38.900> interlude<00:04:39.380> you<00:04:39.410> go<00:04:39.590> back<00:04:39.770> to<00:04:39.919> the<00:04:40.009> you<00:04:40.400> do

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
that interlude you go back to the you do

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.029 
that interlude you go back to the you do
the<00:04:40.550> chorus<00:04:40.880> I'm<00:04:40.970> pretty<00:04:41.150> sure<00:04:41.860> then<00:04:42.860> you<00:04:42.889> go

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
the chorus I'm pretty sure then you go

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.809 
the chorus I'm pretty sure then you go
to<00:04:43.099> the<00:04:43.220> verse<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:45.620> that's<00:04:46.280> the<00:04:46.370> last<00:04:46.520> verse

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
to the verse and that's the last verse

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:47.950 
to the verse and that's the last verse
then<00:04:47.000> you<00:04:47.090> do<00:04:47.180> a<00:04:47.210> course<00:04:47.539> and<00:04:47.720> they<00:04:47.780> need<00:04:47.900> to

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
then you do a course and they need to

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.150 
then you do a course and they need to
interlude<00:04:48.380> and<00:04:48.530> then<00:04:48.620> you<00:04:48.710> do<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:48.919> course

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
interlude and then you do the course

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.490 
interlude and then you do the course
since<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.550> final<00:04:49.729> course<00:04:50.030> and<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:51.169> course

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
since the final course and the course
