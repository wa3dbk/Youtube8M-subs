00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.970
 nothing new will be a regular 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.399
 daily if there are several news 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.329
 on different topics the ascetic 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.220
 the universe and the life meet 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.360
 be up to date 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.490
 in the sidebar you can see now 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.020
 different categories we ins 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.140
 have called the life on the one hand the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.250
 Fundamentals of the fundamentals should be 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.320
 mainly about it 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.930
 start playing the game easier 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.679
 Say if you are very much 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.489
 have progressed 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.980
 then maybe that is not necessarily 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.599
 which for you but it definitely should 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.849
 facilitate the entry 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.439
 So that's a basic section 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.980
 That's why we take the basics 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:23.680
 kaizen yes we go underneath the others 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.870
 categories would like to time later today 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.510
 I like to enter a champion 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.000
 So we also have a special champion 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.770
 For example , here we go 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.830
 let's go a chain 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.180
 we'll look at each other when the chain goes to the 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.530
 champion clearly as follows 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.070
 from up here you always have that 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.630
 start picture of the champions as they do 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.390
 would see in the game if they did not 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.760
 Skin has all the skills here 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.460
 again you listed qw and l as well 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.190
 you passively if you get over it 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.720
 to a tooltip what exactly is the true 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.720
 now actually does what has effects 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.670
 what harm he does cpp left here 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.730
 next to it you will see some more 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.600
 baseline the catlin without items 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.830
 Stage 18 has got a giant 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.750
 crisis area homemade we show 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.360
 now the level 18 values ​​we show the 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.410
 Level 1 values with level scales and 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.700
 and so on 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.680
 I think it's just personal 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.450
 matter of taste and we have it now 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.430
 finally decided here stage 18 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.010
 values ​​of basic values 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.870
 so here you see below again 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.690
 the skills in something bigger 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.500
 presentation and a little more detailed 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.090

 inclusive costs of my costs 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.050
 range et cetera pp displayed yes 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.330
 if I go further down we see 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.830
 first in the main area here still from 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.020
 headshot this is the first guide 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.020
 provided that for catlin already online 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.370
 I have been in this case 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.510
 last update you can see when 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.640

 you can get it up already 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.430
 or down were calculated afterwards 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.870
 of course that percentage would have that 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.400
 and of course you can also see the 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.930
 Comment on guides to give feedback 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.209
 to ask questions 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.680
 that's just the standard procedure that 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.410
 fundamentally on every website 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.400

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.440
 Here you can see that champion 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.850
 Of course, spotlight also knows each one of them 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.160

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.030
 unfortunately we could not force that 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.360
 Add this chain is it the 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.280

 look back to catlin oh so one 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.400
 important thing I still have you 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.539
 but forget to say for example 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.389
 you see here 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.590
 picture over peacemaker so if you 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.879
 but now for example you are used 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.169
 league of legends in English too 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:49.229
 play as I am for example 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.449
 I did not know how this thing is 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.069

 Of course, maker is relative now 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.639
 but clearly behind here you can 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.080
 look into something rested font 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.490
 We each have the English names of 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.470
 skills again extra for you 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.270
 added so that also the players 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.750
 really only the English little one 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.509

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.340
 also here with the skills and so on 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:16.620
 cope or if it's a friend 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.710
 he is said to use this here 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.330
 Often you do not have to go to the cabaret 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.789
 use and say okay 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.289
 catlin what is a cabinet then 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:27.030

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.259
 actually know what else is there 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.840
 to show kitten I would say 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:38.430
 let that stand for the first time and we 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.830
 can then look at the next time 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.419
 what a guide to catlin looks like 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.710
 and how to create the guides 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.710
 So good until next time
