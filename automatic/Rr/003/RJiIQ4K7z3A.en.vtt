00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.170
 well the kids do not know how everything will go 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.970
 I hope that everything goes well 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.090
 previous days in the other items 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.600
 Well, I played with Wilbert, now I'm going 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.980
 to aquarium only to see how it's going 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.990
 we are going to look for a new departure that 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.640
 see that this has not been searched but 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:39.309
 we are playing at 720p these days because 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.080
 it's more but I'm still playing with the 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.750
 cat I think that you will also see a 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.629
 improvement in quality I hope you like it 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.220
 and I will try to improve the quality 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.070
 because the rendering of sony vegas 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.199
 I do not have it entirely well 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.629
 placed for that they lose a lot of quality 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:59.320
 because the cat the truth is that it is 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:04.370
 majestic and records very well but 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:08.120
 but but to the adjustments of the 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.190
 sony vegas rendering, not the ones 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.210
 I have well placed then I'm going 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.049
 little bad 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.659
 but let's see what comes out let's eat and 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.920
 well I'm going to put today I have not been given 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:28.729
 for thinking now and let's see I'm going to 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:31.570
 put me down because I do not wear this 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:35.350
 presidential to all the people 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.390
 let's put the target finder 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.220
 let's see what comes out is the first 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.400
 game that I play alone the truth is 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.400
 not 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:53.219
 sometimes it 's just a game only 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.549
 so it does not come out 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:02:02.130
 I'm going to recharge the only bad thing about this 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.130
 broad both are unprepared and not 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.240
 what evil s 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.490
 I do not know why 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.750
 kobe ​​as it is small have not bad 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.900
 response and what appear for all 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.010
 parts of the same as what it causes is 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.090
 good to close this can appear in 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.470
 any time back or by 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:27.220
 ahead as the first days do not 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:33.640
 I kept on the backups 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:36.010
 then it was a companion 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.379
 22 I go 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.040
 you always have to stay until the end 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.040
 Must see 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.900
 let's see if it's okay with this 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.830
 but I'm asking for the floor 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:58.340
 very well 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.510
 pretty good 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.480
 before I did not like it much but now 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.480
 it is well drawn and reflections 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.730
 and the truth is that it 's fine 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.330
 others 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.090
 yes yes yes 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.430
 good 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.190
 we go 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.580
 die 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.420
 Yes Yes Yes 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.930
 ok you have to be careful because here 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.930
 you can notice 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:59.710
 we will have to surrender is campeando 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:01.720
 that is playing but yes more or less 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.330
 I'm changing but and he has said for the 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.210
 delays that there are shit but nothing more 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.580
 yes no new field already with time 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.970
 as they are first days because in the end they 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.970
 give away 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.540
 but I hope you fix it as much 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.260
 before because it is that they appear for all 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.720
 parts 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.640
 they will appear 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.070
 If any could pass some guide of 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.560
 popularity of these magicians or maybe now 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.780
 I have a response guide that seems 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.140
 say one for the comments if you want 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.289
 to make a backup guide just 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:38.070
 the truth would be fine 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:41.540
 I think so 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.540
 what I can say to you 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.890
 you have to be leaving those who are 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.870
 leaving things out there when I look with the 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.380
 look so I 'm blind because I do not see 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.380
 nothing is 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.880
 I will decide 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:58.849
 we'll see 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.729
 the truth is that it is a map pretty me 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:10.539
 like because it 's the style of nu that 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:16.599
 I said it in the video of all the 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:19.770
 maps that is like this I do not know if you understand me 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:22.930
 which is very small or very large birds 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.550
 is fine and above all to conclude and 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.099
 everything so I've played quite 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.250
 Space sofía cic then make challenges 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:32.110
 well with the uicc and I still have challenges 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.330
 that you have proposed to me but now as 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.169
 be in for a few days then you can not 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.249
 do it until 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.559
 return 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:43.769
 so do not worry, but yes 

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:46.249
 I will make a challenge because they proposed me the 

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:48.079
 challenge to make them dish 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:49.129
 and well I'm rolling a little and not 

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:51.230
 I'm attentive to the game that they are 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:54.320
 killing so 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.620
 but any of surrendering but being 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.620
 attentive 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.680
 this lady 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.520
 that gave me some vibrations 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:10.240
 it would be different for me I knew 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.240
 several 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:16.669
 let's get there 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.560
 here 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:40.340
 he is a thief 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:42.670
 there is a thief approaching 17 of 0 in 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.670
 another day 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.190
 because this happened to me yes 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.510
 low 

00:06:52.529 --> 00:07:00.539
 Now I'm sure we 're more interested 

00:06:58.049 --> 00:07:01.499
 or less are explanatory things of the 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:03.539
 new maps that is that is a 

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:06.239
 responsive I have a new title that I 

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:08.249
 love to look down is that I was 

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:10.079
 pretty good I like a few have 

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:11.459

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:13.439

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:17.119
 you want me to follow and I do not come bye bye 

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:17.119
 and until another
