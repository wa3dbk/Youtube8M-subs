00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:04.940
 the routes of asia 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.149

 essentials for export that we can save the prosecutor tonight 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.260

 to experience this acceptance of nervousness that we can not barnier 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.789
 that although we are tired we go around and around 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.329
 but we can not give him the hospital 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.310
 and we are going to use for this case 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.569
 first thing we are going to use 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:31.710

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.109

 rest improvements so we can be more relaxed so we do not suffer insomnia 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.249
 then planet we are with a body expressed by the daily problems 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:49.270
 plan 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.850
 mind starts trying to solve them but in reality we should be 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.750
 sleeping and we can not then had were going to get essential oil from 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.890
 ideal lavender for these cases, are some droplets of course the j go to 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.960
 depend on the amount of grass we have because this is not a 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.610
 preparation that we base brings about about katie the then vacant does 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.110
 before we can regulate 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.120
 we mix a little if you like to air another essential aspect that is the one of Iran 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.870
 Iran 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.900
 what's up with this oil suddenly people to all these concerns let's 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.380
 to find we begin to feel confident with fear with thoughts 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.470
 negative we think I will not be able to go wrong everything that is studied I do not know 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.070
 If you have everything done, you will not notice, I'm going to fail. This is what 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.830
 may seem and is what can cause insomnia therefore henceforth 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.260
 you will feel more secure, it will allow us to feel confident that 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.670
 give what we know and therefore it will allow us to calm down and relax 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.420
 Carlos says that if he is not accusing, they will not be going well 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.360
 then we also mix this essential oil 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.420
 finally we added an herb told a very particular aroma that is the stain 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.290
 minsa 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.690
 as we know it also has a sedative effect 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.789
 and when 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.270
 We were active all day but so active that we were 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.270
 hyperactive we are tired we are going to oppose 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.609
 but we did not reach some friends 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.410
 the Portuguese press will sweat us to relax 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.520
 tapial this nervousness can not pay the bad mood and before any stimulus 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.110
 Any Spartan noise that is estimated to be angry at that story 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.540
 stayed with the destination he paid us with a relative and so we started to fight 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.339
 why because we do not reach are in a bad mood 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:38.949
 and also another faculty is so that it can be repeated last night they wake up 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:39.779
 I wanted to record 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:43.489
 if they do not do an activity but walk if they do not fix something if there is not a plan 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.529
 well can not see base my part because it has a lot of activity a lot 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:50.360
 energy and this will allow calms 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.600
 finally we combine all these parties well and place them in a container 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.169
 it is evident that we can not cover 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:02.019
 so that we start only at that moment that we feel that we are very 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.009
 nervous then now we do the materials 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:27.019
 let's respect the Aztec band 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.919
 mansally is affected 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.109

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.399
 to be able to perceive but when they really need it 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.809
 and so he hopes that this practice 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:46.819
 however folder relax rest reheat 

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:48.859
 Argentina 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.449
 with energy with desire ten houses 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:52.969
