00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.200
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.000
 new video 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.970
 today we meet to talk 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.279
 whole class zobals so there this 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.330
 that I'm doing right after the sacrier all 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.960
 just because it's a duo 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.930
 extremely well known multi pib and I 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.090
 think the changes at the ball 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.150
 must be done around this duo drogba 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.510
 sacred yesterday that is completely safe 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.400
 so already use the zobal is a 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.479
 class this is one of two classes that 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.739
 came out a little after the others so 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:46.229
 I remind you that classes of 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.760
 dofus at the beginning were eleven 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.290
 I'm going to you and the panda but it's 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.809
 for a very long time that we consider that it is 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.870
 one of the original classes then are 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.720
 got out rogues and zobals a whole 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.970
 little before the taste the number 3 which 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.519
 so saw a rogue and a ball zoo 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.840
 in each team since there were 4 2 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.130
 to the rogue ballet by server 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.610
 so necessarily that year a zoo 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.619
 Basel won 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.730
 and otherwise we have never seen others at 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.590
 prom in the final 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.520
 when they are born there with annie so 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.230
 we ovale that combine well that the 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.520
 ca crime and how we CEOOR 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.000
 has seen more in recent years during 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.590
 goultarminator finals which I 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.540
 remember before continuing this video 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.770
 we only talk about pvp multi 3v 3 and 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:35.740
 especially 84 so if we refer a little 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.080
 little at the 10-year tournament the zobal is 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.820
 not a cup very represented there is 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.490
 there none of the eight finalists 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.390
 announced if you can stupidity maybe a 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.520
 no-place anna paquin does not have I believe 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.320
 not an 11 0 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.610
 I think the team that has one and 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.770
 disqualified in fact she can not 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.660
 come to Lille so in the end he will not have 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.640
 just something like this finally in 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.240
 any case in the end the zobal which in 3v 3 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.360
 does not necessarily have a place 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.430
 finally they actually bring the 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.000
 protection but that's all it is 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.140
 problem of the ball zoo in 3d 3 in case of 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.840
 beckett he can bring his dose of 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.820
 damage and especially the masquerade that is 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.980
 the spell that I want to see change on the 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.870
 ground otherwise what do I have to say about 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.820
 the ball jump frankly to the image of 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.060
 denial trophy of sram which we will speak 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:29.110
 later for me it's class 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.810
 balanced of dofus is to say the head 2 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.090
 3 4 like that where hardly anything 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.130
 touched because these classes are very 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.220
 Nice to play in Grenoble for 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.100
 play versatile do a lot of 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.440
 things can them the game several 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.450
 game modes everything is viable every 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.489
 spells are useful it's really his 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.870
 declasse there are classes like that where these 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.310
 are the areas been well done by ankama 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.230
 it must be said is for me the zobal 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.959
 is a class that is balanced and very 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.580
 well done after the filament that kits 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.489
 of dofus comes from other classes for 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.870
 my part and not those classes there so 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.010
 some modifications to do everything from 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.959
 even maybe a little modification 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.900
 of picasa and retention which are 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.540
 spells air their retention do not have 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.100
 inevitably it is rather banal by cons 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.580
 perhaps cada pie 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:19.130
 the malus tac change it or so everything 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:23.710
 there simply increase peace or 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:27.860
 particular fate bring peace to the 02 base 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:29.330
 for 20.1 to be able to remove from the tackle 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.720
 to someone who is tackling you all 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.610
 simply 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.810
 knowing that already if we go under 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.490
 coward unless you 're wanted 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.410
 weightlessness we can do bandas so 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.440
 in fact the interest of tuvalu stack of 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.820
 year pika not not crazy it's 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.170
 really one fault under gravity is 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.150
 tapped by something to see the site and 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.140
 tonight's other for the damage 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.450
 obviously guys who will be 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.260
 relatively weak it must be said 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.720
 how does it know that they do not bring 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.260
 that 1.2 of the guys that is a little ridiculous 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.160
 as much a year now it's calm 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.950
 otherwise for me all the spells are 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.300
 really nice something that 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:05.000
 I will not do it again but it is relative 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:07.850
 to the laughter combos actually when a 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.290
 laughing bags and under shield and that he has 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:15.140
 typed his punishment is boosted but in 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.209
 same time when he is at 50% vita and 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.880
 that he is under shield his punishment is 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.290
 performed as if he had 50% vita so 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.930
 there I find that there is a problem 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.310
 either we consider that the points of 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.280
 shields one hundred health points for the 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.440
 sacred and so suddenly never is it to 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.930
 50% vita but he put the pv in fact 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.490
 it's not 50% it's at 65 70 on 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.770
 consider that these babies are points 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.500
 of life in fact is to say if magic 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.600
 so he is at 3000 on 6000 syllable 1500 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.060
 pb on the head actually he at 4500 on 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.800
 7500 of a sudden it is no longer really at the 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.780
 half I pass I have you pretty much 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.520
 what I mean is simply 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.650
 when a sakhri takes damage under 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.710
 no shields we consider that who 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.150
 do not chastise that punishment does me 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.190
 only when the sacrier loses 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.330
 points of life I find that it's in 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.010
 does it's this running on 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.330
 punishment is punishment 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.009
 it's a can have butter and 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.419
 the money of the butter of my opinion 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:10.159
 if not a boom to change its the 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:14.449
 masquerade and almost only to modify 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:16.069
 had the shot of youngster two rounds know 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.199
 it's not it's not enough 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:20.589
 so obviously we can not do that 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:23.239
 without having a huge pvm nerve 

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:26.229
 because the ballet jump the class 

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:28.819
 main of all teams th l anpm 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:32.329
 especially on free 3 it's the broken mass 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:34.729
 it is life that is what serves all 

00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:36.769
 so does an air of masca impact 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.539
 necessarily the pvm but loose 

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:42.229
 sorry but in pm and we can better paid 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:43.819
 tonight is too strong and especially combined 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:44.659
 precisely at the ball who can this 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:47.139
 shield etc 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:49.669
 when a fact case I do not even speak 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.289
 we can really use masquerade without 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.879
 no problem is besides the only one 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:54.739
 power of the congo at the ball made case that's 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:55.999
 not protection is precisely the 

00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:57.739
 being able to masquerade 

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:59.779
 while being virtually immune and 

00:05:57.739 --> 00:06:01.569
 so be able to threaten your opponents 

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:04.479
 every two rounds without any problem 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:10.009
 and in addition if you are aux sacrier 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:13.699
 maska more punishment it is relatively 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:16.999
 also fart from where the head modification 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:19.039
 on the principle of punishment under point 

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:20.599
 of shields you can be a little bit 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:21.979
 too farting but as I saw the 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.419
 most changes to the basics are 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:26.779
 related to the presence of the sacrier in his 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:28.909
 team if not very honestly the zobal 

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:30.199
 is a very balanced class I find 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:31.279
 that obama did a good job creating 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:34.129
 this class because in addition it did not 

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:38.389
 been for that reason or since 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:41.449
 out the case is almost not out 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:43.459
 as such but she was the base is there 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:44.739
 what extremely rogue who suffered no 

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:46.819
 badly 

00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:48.139
 good I think I have read everything about this 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:49.639
 obviously class equilibrium and so 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:51.409
 I do not have much to say 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.830
 so the next piece we are you 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:54.540
 liras I think it's 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.950
 the same trophe nudes a class 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.960
 balanced where it takes a few all 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.390
 small changes then would attack 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.910
 the unbalanced classes of dofus and that 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.200
 I 'm not telling you yet which one will be 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.790
 so then I wish you all a 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.440
 excellent game a very good day 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.060

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.070

 papaya everyone
