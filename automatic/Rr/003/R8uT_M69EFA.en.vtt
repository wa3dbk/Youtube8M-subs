00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
hi this is Robert from aqua sonic today

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.249 
hi this is Robert from aqua sonic today
we're<00:00:02.939> trying<00:00:03.240> this<00:00:03.449> violin<00:00:03.840> on<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.049> water

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
we're trying this violin on the water

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.829 
we're trying this violin on the water
the<00:00:04.890> first<00:00:04.920> underwater<00:00:05.850> violin<00:00:06.420> in<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.569> world

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
the first underwater violin in the world

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.549 
the first underwater violin in the world
made<00:00:07.560> by<00:00:07.710> man<00:00:07.950> supportive<00:00:08.420> so<00:00:09.420> here<00:00:10.050> we<00:00:10.170> go<00:00:10.320> in

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
made by man supportive so here we go in

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:36.110 
made by man supportive so here we go in
the<00:00:10.710> aquarium<00:00:10.950> see<00:00:11.550> how<00:00:11.670> it<00:00:11.940> sounds

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.880 

we<00:00:37.120> learned<00:00:37.360> last<00:00:37.570> time<00:00:37.900> that<00:00:38.140> the<00:00:38.320> strings

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
we learned last time that the strings

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.380 
we learned last time that the strings
are<00:00:39.160> changing<00:00:39.820> pitch<00:00:40.059> differently<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:42.250> that

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
are changing pitch differently so that

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.049 
are changing pitch differently so that
for<00:00:43.390> example<00:00:43.839> the<00:00:43.960> high<00:00:44.320> string<00:00:44.650> goes<00:00:45.610> to<00:00:45.879> one

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
for example the high string goes to one

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.660 
for example the high string goes to one
half<00:00:46.360> tone<00:00:46.750> below<00:00:46.989> but<00:00:47.559> the<00:00:47.710> second<00:00:48.370> string

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
half tone below but the second string

00:00:48.670 --> 00:01:01.229 
half tone below but the second string
the<00:00:49.329> a<00:00:49.510> string<00:00:49.540> goes<00:00:50.290> one<00:00:50.680> aft<00:00:50.980> semitone<00:01:00.239> so

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
the a string goes one aft semitone so

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.390 
the a string goes one aft semitone so
actually<00:01:01.750> tuning<00:01:02.080> it<00:01:02.320> under<00:01:02.710> water<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:03.280> get

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
actually tuning it under water to get

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.219 
actually tuning it under water to get
the<00:01:04.470> regular<00:01:05.470> shooting<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:07.750> also<00:01:07.900> tried

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
the regular shooting we also tried

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.539 
the regular shooting we also tried
different<00:01:08.530> microphones<00:01:09.220> we<00:01:09.369> have<00:01:09.520> a

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
different microphones we have a

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.679 
different microphones we have a
microphone<00:01:10.060> here<00:01:10.510> the<00:01:11.260> red<00:01:11.439> one<00:01:11.470> and<00:01:12.689> contact

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
microphone here the red one and contact

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.630 
microphone here the red one and contact
microphone<00:01:14.260> which<00:01:14.500> is<00:01:14.530> situated<00:01:15.070> on<00:01:15.580> the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
microphone which is situated on the

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.719 
microphone which is situated on the
violin<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:17.320> you<00:01:17.590> can<00:01:17.770> also<00:01:17.950> hear<00:01:18.610> the

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
violin so you can also hear the

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:38.350 
violin so you can also hear the
difference<00:01:19.090> here

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:59.870 

what's<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.450> pickup

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.730 

it's<00:02:00.880> very<00:02:01.090> different

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
it's very different

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.730 
it's very different
so<00:02:03.370> yes<00:02:04.090> we<00:02:04.450> are<00:02:04.630> going<00:02:05.050> on<00:02:05.320> without<00:02:05.560> the

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
so yes we are going on without the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.680 
so yes we are going on without the
