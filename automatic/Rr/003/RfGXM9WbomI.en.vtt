00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.810
 a pleasure to greet you again 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.149
 of Mexican cuisine presented as 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.810
 prepare poblano chili stuffed with cheese 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:14.450
 fresh in tomato sauce on video 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.939
 earlier I have shown how one is khalfan 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.330
 that is, how the skin of the 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:24.890
 chilies cut pieces of fresh cheese 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:28.110
 of approximately 100 grams we proceed 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:32.220
 to fill the chiles 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:36.690
 Once stuffed the flourings 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:39.780
 Everywhere this will make the preparation 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.640
 of beaten egg stick on the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.020
 surface of chili 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.059
 we separate clear and yolk this what 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.360
 I recommend doing one on one 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:56.199
 we put the yolk in a bowl and the clear 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.250
 in another it is important to separate the eggs 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.380
 one by one 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.770
 in case someone should go wrong 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.490
 with the balloon whisk we proceed to 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:11.160
 Beat the whites at high speed 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:15.210
 should be about to nougat is 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:19.830
 say hard once beaten we incorporate 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.870
 the yolks and we will beat a few more seconds 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.630
 to mix with the clear 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:30.770
 we introduce the chiles in the egg 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:34.010
 shake and fry them in a pan with 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.250
 previously hot oil you have to 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.000
 bathe the egg cover with the 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.040
 oil 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.310
 so that it cooks everywhere 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.450
 once cooked we retired and 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.969
 we will put on absorbent paper 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.439
 for the tomato sauce we put in 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:02:01.049
 the blender jar 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:02:01.049
 onion garlic tomato and water we liquefy 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.290
 in a clay pot or saucepan 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.930

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:15.790
 heat and add the strained tomato 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.790
 cover and let it boil 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:25.819

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.060

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.599
 to be well cooked tomatoes one 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.410
 Once it has boiled, place the chiles 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:38.860

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.010
