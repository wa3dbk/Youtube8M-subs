right<00:00:01.290> it's<00:00:01.439> a<00:00:01.500> Derick<00:00:01.770> Scion<00:00:02.190> tC<00:00:03.620> Derick<00:00:05.660> and

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
right it's a Derick Scion tC Derick and

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.940 
right it's a Derick Scion tC Derick and
we<00:00:07.379> have<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.500> throttle<00:00:07.799> issue<00:00:08.130> with<00:00:08.460> it<00:00:09.800> you<00:00:10.800> can

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
we have a throttle issue with it you can

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.410 
we have a throttle issue with it you can
see<00:00:11.160> we<00:00:11.309> have<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.519> backing<00:00:11.910> plate<00:00:12.090> screwed

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
see we have this backing plate screwed

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.270 
see we have this backing plate screwed
on<00:00:12.599> now<00:00:12.809> instead<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.200> riveted<00:00:13.590> on<00:00:13.710> because<00:00:14.160> we

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
on now instead of riveted on because we

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.390 
on now instead of riveted on because we
changed<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.870> an<00:00:15.960> rx-8<00:00:16.470> throttle<00:00:16.890> body

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
changed it this is an rx-8 throttle body

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.830 
changed it this is an rx-8 throttle body
I<00:00:18.650> just<00:00:19.650> dropped<00:00:20.930> here<00:00:21.930> there<00:00:22.140> hold<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.609> and

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
I just dropped here there hold that and

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.330 
I just dropped here there hold that and
that<00:00:24.840> backing<00:00:25.230> plate<00:00:25.619> right<00:00:25.800> there<00:00:26.099> is

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
that backing plate right there is

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.519 
that backing plate right there is
actually<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.510> Scion<00:00:27.900> tC<00:00:27.930> backing<00:00:28.800> plate<00:00:30.529> as

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
actually the Scion tC backing plate as

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.270 
actually the Scion tC backing plate as
you<00:00:31.650> can<00:00:31.769> see<00:00:32.009> oh<00:00:34.160> no<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.370> all<00:00:35.520> good<00:00:37.280> yeah

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
you can see oh no it's all good yeah

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.200 
you can see oh no it's all good yeah
that's<00:00:38.430> fine<00:00:40.640> anyway<00:00:43.129> this<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> RX<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
that's fine anyway this is the RX a

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.350 
that's fine anyway this is the RX a
backing<00:00:45.600> plate<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.079> for<00:00:46.680> some<00:00:46.890> reason<00:00:47.360> it

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
backing plate and for some reason it

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.180 
backing plate and for some reason it
wasn't<00:00:49.079> getting<00:00:49.379> any<00:00:49.500> power<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> motor

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
wasn't getting any power to the motor

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.850 
wasn't getting any power to the motor
and<00:00:50.570> you<00:00:51.570> know<00:00:51.899> obviously<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.500> can't<00:00:52.710> crack

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and you know obviously you can't crack

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.180 
and you know obviously you can't crack
these<00:00:53.100> things<00:00:53.160> open<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.760> looked<00:00:54.559> so<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:56.010> took

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
these things open and looked so we took

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.849 
these things open and looked so we took
the<00:00:56.309> Scion<00:00:56.670> tC<00:00:56.699> backing<00:00:57.660> plate<00:00:57.840> off<00:00:58.020> as<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.559> last

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
the Scion tC backing plate off as a last

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.529 
the Scion tC backing plate off as a last
resort<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.460> bolted<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.300> throttle

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
resort and bolted it to the throttle

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.130 
resort and bolted it to the throttle
body<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:02.120> surprisingly<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.359> works<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:04.110> just

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
body and surprisingly it works we just

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.399 
body and surprisingly it works we just
had<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.530> switch<00:01:05.060> these<00:01:06.170> connection<00:01:07.170> wires

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
had to switch these connection wires

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.109 
had to switch these connection wires
which<00:01:07.710> doesn't<00:01:08.280> make<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.400> lot<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.610> sense<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.000> me

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
which doesn't make a lot of sense to me

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.440 
which doesn't make a lot of sense to me
but<00:01:10.100> for<00:01:11.100> some<00:01:11.250> reason<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.610> open<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.119> motor<00:01:12.299> up

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
but for some reason to open the motor up

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.990 
but for some reason to open the motor up
backward<00:01:12.869> or<00:01:13.049> open<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> throttle<00:01:14.640> up

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
backward or open the throttle up

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.560 
backward or open the throttle up
backwards<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:16.250> now<00:01:17.250> here's<00:01:17.490> first<00:01:17.790> test<00:01:18.090> with

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
backwards but now here's first test with

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.370 
backwards but now here's first test with
the<00:01:18.720> wire<00:01:18.869> switched<00:01:19.200> up<00:01:20.990> all<00:01:21.990> right<00:01:22.170> there

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the wire switched up all right there

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.600 
the wire switched up all right there
give<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.710> whirl<00:01:23.299> yeah<00:01:24.299> all<00:01:25.259> right<00:01:25.610> full

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
give it a whirl yeah all right full

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:34.270 
give it a whirl yeah all right full
throttle<00:01:26.790> real<00:01:27.000> quick<00:01:27.650> off<00:01:29.810> roll<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:30.960> slow

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.109 

quarter<00:01:35.280> throttle<00:01:36.770> half<00:01:37.770> throttle<00:01:38.119> full

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
quarter throttle half throttle full

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.090 
quarter throttle half throttle full
throttle<00:01:39.680> yeah

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
throttle yeah

00:01:41.100 --> 00:02:40.559 
throttle yeah
alright<00:01:41.610> shut<00:01:42.090> er<00:01:42.119> down
