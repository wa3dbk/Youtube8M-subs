painting<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.910> figuring<00:02:37.269> out<00:02:37.269> really<00:02:37.660> quickly

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
painting and figuring out really quickly

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.780 
painting and figuring out really quickly
in<00:02:38.109> my<00:02:38.230> head<00:02:38.470> how<00:02:38.650> fast<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.160> could<00:02:39.220> paint<00:02:39.549> it<00:02:39.639> and

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
in my head how fast I could paint it and

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.610 
in my head how fast I could paint it and
I<00:02:40.239> counted<00:02:40.480> each<00:02:40.720> figure<00:02:41.079> and<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.290> figured<00:02:41.560> I

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
I counted each figure and I figured I

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.530 
I counted each figure and I figured I
could<00:02:41.769> paint<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:42.010> figure<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.340> day<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:42.970> then<00:02:43.389> when

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
could paint a figure a day and then when

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.000 
could paint a figure a day and then when
I<00:02:43.569> got<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.959> smaller<00:02:44.260> figures<00:02:44.470> i<00:02:44.680> could<00:02:44.859> pay

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
I got to the smaller figures i could pay

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.340 
I got to the smaller figures i could pay
two<00:02:45.069> figures<00:02:45.609> a<00:02:45.639> day<00:02:45.910> so<00:02:46.420> I<00:02:46.450> gave<00:02:46.569> him<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.959> the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
two figures a day so I gave him the the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.340 
two figures a day so I gave him the the
figure<00:02:47.650> 22<00:02:48.340> days<00:02:48.730> in<00:02:49.090> which<00:02:49.540> they<00:02:49.660> said<00:02:49.870> 22

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
figure 22 days in which they said 22

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.830

days<00:02:50.560> okay<00:02:51.280> sounds<00:02:51.549> good<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.420> day<00:02:52.630> that

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
days okay sounds good and that day that

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.990 
days okay sounds good and that day that
I<00:02:52.870> said<00:02:53.109> 22<00:02:53.680> days<00:02:53.859> that<00:02:54.190> Canada<00:02:54.609> is<00:02:54.639> the<00:02:54.790> first

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
I said 22 days that Canada is the first

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.530 
I said 22 days that Canada is the first
day<00:02:55.209> so<00:02:56.019> it<00:02:56.170> was<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.319> very<00:02:56.410> high<00:02:56.950> stress<00:02:57.389> type<00:02:58.389> of

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
day so it was a very high stress type of

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.809 
day so it was a very high stress type of
job<00:02:58.750> but<00:02:59.590> at<00:02:59.799> the<00:03:00.040> end<00:03:00.069> of<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.400> all<00:03:00.489> it's<00:03:00.670> been<00:03:00.790> a

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
job but at the end of it all it's been a

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.300 
job but at the end of it all it's been a
hell<00:03:01.090> of<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:01.269> lot<00:03:01.389> of<00:03:01.420> fun<00:03:01.690> because<00:03:01.989> it's<00:03:02.950> it's

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
hell of a lot of fun because it's it's

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.680 
hell of a lot of fun because it's it's
publicized<00:03:03.819> everywhere<00:03:04.269> it's<00:03:04.420> been<00:03:04.569> on<00:03:04.660> the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
publicized everywhere it's been on the

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.199 
publicized everywhere it's been on the
subways<00:03:05.170> of<00:03:05.440> New<00:03:05.590> York<00:03:05.769> City<00:03:06.040> I<00:03:06.280> think<00:03:07.120> it

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
subways of New York City I think it

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.640 
subways of New York City I think it
still<00:03:07.389> is<00:03:07.540> on<00:03:07.690> subways<00:03:08.049> New<00:03:08.200> York<00:03:08.319> City<00:03:08.410> if

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
still is on subways New York City if

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.699 
still is on subways New York City if
I've<00:03:08.799> seen<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.160> in<00:03:09.250> San<00:03:09.430> Francisco<00:03:09.579> on

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
I've seen it in San Francisco on

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.830 
I've seen it in San Francisco on
different<00:03:11.709> advertising<00:03:12.130> standees<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.150> I

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
different advertising standees and I

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.569 
different advertising standees and I
think<00:03:14.079> animal<00:03:14.349> has<00:03:14.680> more<00:03:14.919> of<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.069> life<00:03:15.220> even

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
think animal has more of a life even

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.849 
think animal has more of a life even
after<00:03:15.700> that<00:03:16.000> so<00:03:16.329> it's<00:03:16.930> really<00:03:17.169> fun<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:17.620> see<00:03:17.769> the

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
after that so it's really fun to see the

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.110 
after that so it's really fun to see the
results

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120
