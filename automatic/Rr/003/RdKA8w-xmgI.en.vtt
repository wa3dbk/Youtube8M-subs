00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.840
 what the gate was a data hsv will be mine 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.840
 dear days chemistry vendetta 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.430
 yes, everyone can do that 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.720
 claim 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.340
 I do not like it too much when I am 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.830
 People pee into the brain, however, is 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.490
 not yet come before except in the stick 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.990
 to the 1 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.600
 and maybe stuff and ID 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.559
 not that was with those the brain 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.489
 and so the first game needs thinking 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.070
 I had to see that 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.260
 the style is pretty similar yes but it 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.430
 plays totally different because here is 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.039
 So it takes on a two-dimensional 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.809
 level instead of what is also due to that 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.180
 the figures and the scenes are all out 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.110
 The cardboard is made and you can do it that way 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.110
 tear off properly 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.230
 that is the whole background there 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.730
 I can pull off the wiso wallpaper here 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.379
 or is that only certain make that 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.060
 only goes to certain places is everything 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.140
 very pretend where you can do something 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.810
 everything is quite linear and the whole thing is spinning 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.970
 It's about who this guy has 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.729
 a tentacle that grows out of his head 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.710
 the topic can happen and 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.290
 On the one hand, this allows him to think 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.250
 read others and on the other hand 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.000
 telekinetic the environment 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.820
 manipulate 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.530
 well that this purple was served exactly 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.829
 that only sees way and the player 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.040
 of course and we hear what the people are 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.040
 think 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.710
 yes and why you do that is now 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.610
 not because you are now legally and 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.430
 Of course we know what all people are 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.440
 think but it's about that one 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.000
 by doing what the whole npcs experiences 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.280
 many levels are what they are 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.660
 actually need 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.080
 dennis ticket element is basically a 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.360
 adventure and I have to say it 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.490
 solving puzzles which are on it 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.000
 just limit what to find 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.009
 npc needs and bring him that 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.100
 This nice gentleman about need a gift 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:21.630
 for his adored but works 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:23.520
 that's not all that annoying one 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.980
 noted already agree there has been a 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.140
 very quirky humor i must have at 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.860
 to laugh a lot 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.300
 probably will be synonymous 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.520
 that the old lucasarts adventures 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.050
 I liked it and I think it's a game 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.190
 Already very strongly oriented on it 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.320
 in the whole videos humor generated and 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.790
 The version is only in English 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.830
 so i have german subtitles and 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.420
 english spokesman right that's it 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.180
 the English language edition 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.250
 really very good and the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.630
 subtitles are not even always 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.510
 perfect because they try too 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.040
 to translate certain word games 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.810
 but also for german players the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.269
 come with it also clear what to see first 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.220
 is a concrete puzzle example say 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.769
 but puzzles in quotation marks just 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.650
 we just have to smile 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.120
 happy father because you yes 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.549
 such a smile with just in the 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.170
 pants pocket can bring to it 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.560
 we now this stuntman that first 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.510
 which then jumps on the target then 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.880
 we can tear it off like any other 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.090
 we can then target the 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.579
 steal flying over there 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.590
 place 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.350
 and then it will, but I do not know 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.700
 why we serve apple the channels but 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.650
 The hat definitely takes that 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:44.599
 next target in sight and 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:47.370
 but just before laying and then believe 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.590
 all stickers so the eponymous 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.049
 stickers to get these objects and 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.340
 Just pope her back where it is 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.989
 is everything crazy you have too 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.790
 This style is really charming 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:01.950
 but of course totally oblique and is that 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.709
 Demanding or does one come there as well 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.629
 adventure by yes so totally 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.650
 if you do not need an adventure 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.510
 does not matter then it is not 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.549
 right point click adventure where you 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.230
 now really ponder long it must 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.239
 It's just about reading the thoughts 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.139
 then to get the items so you can 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:21.329
 virtually nothing wrong except when it does 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.669
 that's what the distributed guards are about 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.190
 shake off because now and then that mutates 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.810
 play together a bit together japan 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.340
 although there is never really 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.100
 so it will have to be demanding 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.199
 dodge and try to level 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.820
 but you do not have to 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.130
 do not shoot or fight at all 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.570
 case there is then only the possibility from 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.710
 and you can be such an action sticker 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.080
 then you can wake up to such 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.400
 sleep a high 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.539
 Schwierigkeitgrad Baumann really at 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.639
 but not to be expected 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.919
 not too long playing time because that is 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:53.960
 with four and a half hours quite short though 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.960
 it also makes a whim
