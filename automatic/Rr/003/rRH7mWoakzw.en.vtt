spots on the trunk I think the previous

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.590 
spots on the trunk I think the previous
owners<00:00:46.950> may<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.190> put<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> tarp<00:00:48.329> or<00:00:48.539> something

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
owners may have put a tarp or something

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.270

on<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.500> colored<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.920> paint<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.250> little

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
bit otherwise you can drive this car

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.040

of<00:00:55.289> looks<00:00:55.500> with<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.940> aren't<00:00:57.210> many

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
of looks with it then just aren't many

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.400

of<00:00:57.480> these<00:00:57.570> around<00:00:57.930> anymore<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:59.539> I<00:01:00.539> think<00:01:01.170> one

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
of these around anymore and I think one

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.490 
of these around anymore and I think one
day<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:02.390> this<00:01:03.390> car<00:01:03.629> will<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:04.049> its<00:01:04.260> day<00:01:04.470> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
day this this car will have its day and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.850 
day this this car will have its day and
and<00:01:05.570> they'll<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.689> worth<00:01:06.900> quite<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.619> bit<00:01:07.680> of

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and they'll be worth quite a bit of

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.789 
and they'll be worth quite a bit of
money<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.400> find<00:01:08.640> them<00:01:09.439> where<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.470> live

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799
