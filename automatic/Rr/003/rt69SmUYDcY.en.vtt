as<00:00:15.500> well

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:16.779 
as well

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.530 
as well
the<00:00:17.950> we've<00:00:18.950> got<00:00:19.099> five<00:00:19.460> days<00:00:19.790> to<00:00:20.119> turn<00:00:20.330> you<00:00:20.509> from

so<00:00:23.660> it's<00:00:24.019> a<00:00:24.170> pretty<00:00:24.439> intensive<00:00:25.099> week<00:00:25.779> you'll

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
so it's a pretty intensive week you'll

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.290 
so it's a pretty intensive week you'll
start<00:00:26.960> off<00:00:27.289> most<00:00:27.650> mornings<00:00:28.130> I'm<00:00:28.400> having<00:00:29.179> done

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
start off most mornings I'm having done

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.619 
start off most mornings I'm having done
your<00:00:29.539> safety<00:00:29.960> brief<00:00:30.170> on<00:00:30.349> the<00:00:30.470> first<00:00:30.710> morning

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:31.629 
your safety brief on the first morning

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:33.970 
your safety brief on the first morning
with<00:00:32.629> a<00:00:32.660> little<00:00:32.809> bit<00:00:33.050> of<00:00:33.140> theory<00:00:33.379> so<00:00:33.680> we'll<00:00:33.860> go

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
with a little bit of theory so we'll go

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.009 
with a little bit of theory so we'll go
through<00:00:34.010> things<00:00:34.460> like<00:00:34.550> cause<00:00:34.910> the<00:00:35.089> steer<00:00:35.360> will

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
through things like cause the steer will

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:37.720 
through things like cause the steer will
go<00:00:36.199> through<00:00:36.500> things<00:00:36.860> like<00:00:37.010> estimated

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
go through things like estimated

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.369 
go through things like estimated
position<00:00:37.850> or<00:00:38.660> go<00:00:38.840> through<00:00:39.079> things<00:00:39.290> like

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
position or go through things like

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.110 
position or go through things like
secretary<00:00:39.770> ports<00:00:40.250> title<00:00:40.489> calculations<00:00:41.000> etc

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
secretary ports title calculations etc

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.139 
secretary ports title calculations etc
etc<00:00:41.420> learn<00:00:42.260> how<00:00:42.379> to<00:00:42.410> passage<00:00:42.890> plan

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
etc learn how to passage plan

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.900 
etc learn how to passage plan
so<00:00:44.809> that'll<00:00:45.170> typically<00:00:45.920> be<00:00:46.100> what<00:00:46.309> you<00:00:46.460> do<00:00:46.610> each

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
so that'll typically be what you do each

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.610 
so that'll typically be what you do each
morning<00:00:47.329> different<00:00:47.930> parts<00:00:48.379> of<00:00:48.469> the

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
morning different parts of the

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.100 
morning different parts of the
theoretical<00:00:49.370> course<00:00:49.670> we'll<00:00:50.329> go<00:00:50.510> over<00:00:50.690> again

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
theoretical course we'll go over again

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.740 
theoretical course we'll go over again
to<00:00:51.620> make<00:00:51.800> sure<00:00:52.070> that<00:00:52.309> you<00:00:52.550> are<00:00:52.730> up<00:00:53.149> to<00:00:53.210> speed<00:00:53.570> on

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
to make sure that you are up to speed on

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.580 
to make sure that you are up to speed on
all<00:00:54.020> those<00:00:54.140> elements

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
all those elements

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.979 
all those elements
well<00:00:55.129> then<00:00:55.280> garden<00:00:55.610> practice<00:00:55.940> them<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:56.390> we'll

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
well then garden practice them and we'll

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.110 
well then garden practice them and we'll
get<00:00:57.109> you<00:00:57.379> into<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:57.859> groove<00:00:58.129> of<00:00:58.399> actually

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
get you into the groove of actually

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.060 
get you into the groove of actually
skippering<00:00:59.660> the<00:00:59.809> boat<00:00:59.989> not<00:01:00.289> straightaway

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
skippering the boat not straightaway

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.590 
skippering the boat not straightaway
we'll<00:01:01.579> get<00:01:01.670> you<00:01:01.850> comfortable<00:01:02.120> with<00:01:02.390> a<00:01:02.449> boat

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
we'll get you comfortable with a boat

possible we'll get you practicing some
of<00:01:06.950> those<00:01:07.039> theoretical<00:01:07.670> points<00:01:08.180> which<00:01:08.300> we

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
of those theoretical points which we

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.449 
of those theoretical points which we
just<00:01:08.570> discussed<00:01:08.720> like<00:01:09.170> plotting<00:01:09.920> a<00:01:09.979> course<00:01:10.190> to

00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:10.459 
just discussed like plotting a course to

sell<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.360> will<00:03:16.540> be<00:03:16.690> doing<00:03:17.340> more<00:03:18.340> Theory<00:03:18.880> so<00:03:19.600> we

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
sell you will be doing more Theory so we

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.130 
sell you will be doing more Theory so we
can<00:03:19.900> make<00:03:20.079> sure<00:03:20.350> that<00:03:20.380> you<00:03:20.769> really

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
can make sure that you really

up-to-speed obligated or samples will

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.120 
up-to-speed obligated or samples will

understood you've already done the

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.590 
understood you've already done the
theory<00:03:33.260> but<00:03:33.950> um<00:03:34.370> we<00:03:34.880> can't<00:03:35.090> often<00:03:35.209> find<00:03:35.540> that

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
theory but um we can't often find that

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.470 
theory but um we can't often find that
people<00:03:35.690> need<00:03:36.050> to<00:03:36.080> revisit<00:03:36.850> their<00:03:37.850> theory<00:03:38.300> and

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
people need to revisit their theory and

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.220 
people need to revisit their theory and
do<00:03:38.660> it<00:03:38.750> again

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
do it again

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.470 
do it again
we'll<00:03:40.220> also<00:03:40.340> that<00:03:40.610> you<00:03:40.700> have<00:03:40.850> a<00:03:40.880> go<00:03:41.030> passage

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
we'll also that you have a go passage

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.990 
we'll also that you have a go passage
planning<00:03:42.580> and<00:03:43.580> making

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
planning and making

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.340 
planning and making
pilotage<00:03:44.420> notes<00:03:44.690> into<00:03:45.020> various<00:03:45.320> different

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
pilotage notes into various different

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.330 
pilotage notes into various different
forms<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.490> harbours<00:03:46.880> etc<00:03:47.770> so<00:03:48.770> it<00:03:48.860> is<00:03:48.980> a<00:03:49.010> fairly

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
forms and harbours etc so it is a fairly

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.580 
forms and harbours etc so it is a fairly
intensive<00:03:49.730> week<00:03:49.940> but<00:03:50.150> you<00:03:50.510> know<00:03:50.630> this<00:03:50.810> we<00:03:51.470> have

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
intensive week but you know this we have

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.000 
intensive week but you know this we have
an<00:03:51.709> awful<00:03:51.950> lot<00:03:51.980> of<00:03:52.069> fun<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:53.140> in<00:03:54.140> the<00:03:54.650> evenings

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
an awful lot of fun and in the evenings

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.530 
an awful lot of fun and in the evenings
when<00:03:55.100> we're<00:03:55.250> not<00:03:55.310> doing<00:03:55.370> shore-based<00:03:55.760> having

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
when we're not doing shore-based having

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.830 
when we're not doing shore-based having
done<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.810> theory<00:03:57.200> we<00:03:57.830> will<00:03:58.160> go<00:03:58.340> short

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
done the theory we will go short

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.690 
done the theory we will go short
typically<00:03:59.840> we<00:03:59.989> always<00:04:00.200> go<00:04:00.380> into<00:04:00.500> a<00:04:00.680> marina<00:04:01.640> so

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
typically we always go into a marina so

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.020 
typically we always go into a marina so

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
you have a hot shower and we go sure and

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.880 
you have a hot shower and we go sure and
have<00:04:05.120> dinner<00:04:05.300> at<00:04:05.480> a<00:04:05.540> public<00:04:05.900> or<00:04:06.530> whatever

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
have dinner at a public or whatever

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.500 
have dinner at a public or whatever
people<00:04:07.340> want<00:04:07.519> to<00:04:07.700> do<00:04:07.880> if<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.120> want<00:04:08.269> to<00:04:08.330> go<00:04:08.450> off

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
people want to do if you want to go off

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.270 
people want to do if you want to go off
on<00:04:08.540> your<00:04:08.720> own<00:04:08.840> that's<00:04:09.019> up<00:04:09.230> to<00:04:09.380> you<00:04:09.500> but

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
on your own that's up to you but

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.330 
on your own that's up to you but
typically<00:04:10.670> we<00:04:10.790> tend<00:04:11.060> to<00:04:11.120> stay<00:04:11.330> together<00:04:11.480> and

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
typically we tend to stay together and

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.699 
typically we tend to stay together and
