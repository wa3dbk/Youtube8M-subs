wanted to show a little 55 and 2
gameplay<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.069> then<00:00:05.190> I<00:00:05.220> got<00:00:05.460> actually<00:00:06.150> quite<00:00:06.390> a

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420

gameplay and then I got actually quite a
while<00:00:06.629> ago<00:00:06.810> unfortunately<00:00:07.049> you'll<00:00:07.770> see<00:00:07.980> some

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
while ago unfortunately you'll see some

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.669 
while ago unfortunately you'll see some
heavy<00:00:08.460> ammo<00:00:08.900> dropped<00:00:09.900> when<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.139> kill<00:00:10.349> people

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
heavy ammo dropped when I kill people

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.680 
heavy ammo dropped when I kill people
and<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:11.429> doesn't<00:00:11.700> happen<00:00:11.820> anymore<00:00:12.059> so<00:00:12.480> this

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
and that doesn't happen anymore so this

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.970 
and that doesn't happen anymore so this
is<00:00:12.809> definitely<00:00:12.960> an<00:00:13.230> old<00:00:13.349> game<00:00:13.590> but<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:13.830> thought

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
is definitely an old game but I thought

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.250 
is definitely an old game but I thought
I'd<00:00:14.130> post<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.460> cause<00:00:14.580> it's<00:00:14.700> kind<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:14.910> funny<00:00:15.260> but

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
I'd post it cause it's kind of funny but

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.410 
I'd post it cause it's kind of funny but
you<00:00:16.379> can<00:00:16.529> go<00:00:16.740> 55<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.520> 2<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.850> game<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.240> you

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
you can go 55 and 2 in a game and you

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.170 
you can go 55 and 2 in a game and you
can<00:00:18.600> still<00:00:18.869> lose<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.800> check<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:20.760> out<00:00:20.970> I'm

happening anytime I transition there's

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.230 
happening anytime I transition there's
honestly<00:00:26.279> like<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.490> minute<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> half

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
honestly like a minute and a half

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.670 
honestly like a minute and a half
which<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.539> nothing<00:00:27.750> happened<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.260> could<00:00:28.500> not

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
which is nothing happened I could not

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
find anyone there's a couple nice plays

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.190 
find anyone there's a couple nice plays
in<00:00:32.009> here<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> few<00:00:32.369> triples<00:00:32.790> Snipes<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.870> stuff

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
in here a few triples Snipes and stuff

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.799 
in here a few triples Snipes and stuff
like<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.760> overall<00:00:35.760> though<00:00:35.969> you're<00:00:36.750> gonna

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
like that overall though you're gonna

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.990 
like that overall though you're gonna
see<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> lot<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.230> supers<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.100> lot<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.489> heavy

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
see a lot of supers and a lot of heavy

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.530 
see a lot of supers and a lot of heavy
because<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:40.020> was<00:00:40.260> trying<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:41.300> definitely<00:00:42.300> rack

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
because I was trying to definitely rack

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.520 
because I was trying to definitely rack
up<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> kills<00:00:42.809> near<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.200> end<00:00:43.350> when<00:00:43.500> I

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
up the kills near the end when I

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.869 
up the kills near the end when I
realized<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.250> was<00:00:44.370> almost<00:00:44.550> impossible

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
realized that it was almost impossible

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.240 
realized that it was almost impossible
to<00:00:45.270> carry<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:45.629> team<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:46.079> do<00:00:46.620> recognize<00:00:47.219> that

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
to carry this team I do recognize that

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.920 
to carry this team I do recognize that
objectively<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.180> probably<00:00:48.480> could<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.780> played

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
objectively I probably could have played

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.090 
objectively I probably could have played
better<00:00:48.960> there's<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.469> couple<00:00:49.649> times<00:00:49.890> where<00:00:50.070> I

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
better there's a couple times where I

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.369 
better there's a couple times where I
honestly<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.000> should<00:00:51.480> have<00:00:51.510> probably<00:00:51.809> capped

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
honestly I should have probably capped

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.670 
honestly I should have probably capped
the<00:00:52.590> spot<00:00:52.860> but<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.219> felt<00:00:54.000> hey<00:00:54.360> if<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.230> kill<00:00:55.530> them

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the spot but I felt hey if I kill them

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.889 
the spot but I felt hey if I kill them
faster<00:00:56.100> than<00:00:56.129> they<00:00:56.699> kill<00:00:56.910> my<00:00:57.059> team<00:00:57.329> then<00:00:57.570> we'll

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
faster than they kill my team then we'll

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.540 
faster than they kill my team then we'll
be<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.170> good<00:00:58.289> spot<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.890> honestly<00:00:59.340> still

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
be in a good spot and it honestly still

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.450 
be in a good spot and it honestly still
didn't<00:00:59.850> work<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.390> think<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.559> mostly<00:01:02.070> lost<00:01:02.280> this

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
didn't work I think we mostly lost this

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.609 
didn't work I think we mostly lost this
just<00:01:02.670> because<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.120> didn't<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.539> control<00:01:03.989> to

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
just because we didn't have control to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.410 
just because we didn't have control to
points<00:01:04.979> almost<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.610> entire<00:01:05.850> game<00:01:06.119> there's

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
points almost the entire game there's

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.260 
points almost the entire game there's
time<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.900> review<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.170> triple<00:01:07.500> cap<00:01:08.119> it<00:01:09.119> just

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
higher velocity is better something like

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.580 
higher velocity is better something like
the<00:01:47.130> truth<00:01:47.460> or<00:01:47.880> if<00:01:48.300> you<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.479> get<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.320> think

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.430 

at<00:02:52.730> this<00:02:52.879> point<00:02:53.120> I'm<00:02:53.360> a<00:02:53.390> greedy<00:02:53.870> son<00:02:54.290> of<00:02:54.379> a

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
at this point I'm a greedy son of a

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.619 
at this point I'm a greedy son of a
batch<00:02:54.769> because<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.489> don't<00:02:56.090> wait<00:02:56.209> for<00:02:56.330> my<00:02:56.420> team

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
batch because I don't wait for my team

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.259 
batch because I don't wait for my team
but<00:02:57.379> they<00:02:57.500> ran<00:02:57.709> past<00:02:57.980> it<00:02:58.190> three<00:02:58.519> times<00:02:58.790> earlier

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
but they ran past it three times earlier

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.000 
but they ran past it three times earlier
that<00:02:59.450> game<00:02:59.629> so<00:03:00.049> I<00:03:00.080> wasn't<00:03:00.440> really<00:03:00.650> gonna<00:03:00.769> wait

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
that game so I wasn't really gonna wait

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.979 
that game so I wasn't really gonna wait
around<00:03:01.190> for<00:03:01.430> ten<00:03:01.580> seconds<00:03:02.000> while<00:03:02.540> they<00:03:02.720> capped

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
around for ten seconds while they capped

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.080 
around for ten seconds while they capped
a<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.590> wanted<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.310> make<00:03:04.430> sure<00:03:04.459> I<00:03:04.640> was<00:03:04.790> up<00:03:04.909> here

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
a I wanted to make sure I was up here

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.089 
a I wanted to make sure I was up here
grabbing<00:03:05.690> that<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.019> stopping<00:03:06.709> that<00:03:06.830> cap

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
grabbing that and stopping that cap

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.030 
grabbing that and stopping that cap
because<00:03:07.819> they<00:03:08.330> weren't<00:03:08.480> helping<00:03:08.840> out<00:03:08.930> or<00:03:09.890> they

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
because they weren't helping out or they

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.930 
because they weren't helping out or they
you<00:03:10.190> know<00:03:10.280> they<00:03:10.400> weren't<00:03:10.519> grabbing<00:03:10.879> the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
you know they weren't grabbing the

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.850

that guy and that dude actually ended up

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.129 
that guy and that dude actually ended up
destroying<00:04:37.280> what<00:04:37.700> my<00:04:37.790> teammates<00:04:38.180> so<00:04:38.450> that

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
destroying what my teammates so that

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.720 
destroying what my teammates so that
doesn't<00:04:39.320> help<00:04:39.500> that<00:04:39.770> was<00:04:39.889> a<00:04:39.919> poor<00:04:40.190> play<00:04:40.370> by<00:04:40.580> me

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
doesn't help that was a poor play by me

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.420 
doesn't help that was a poor play by me
I<00:04:41.320> needed<00:04:42.320> to<00:04:42.410> apply<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:42.830> little<00:04:43.190> bit<00:04:43.280> better

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
I needed to apply a little bit better

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.310 
I needed to apply a little bit better
pressure<00:04:43.669> and<00:04:44.030> right<00:04:44.210> there<00:04:44.419> I<00:04:44.450> think<00:04:44.600> I

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
pressure and right there I think I

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.440 
pressure and right there I think I
dodged<00:04:45.800> a<00:04:46.010> nova<00:04:46.250> bomb<00:04:46.400> on<00:04:46.610> accident<00:04:47.120> I<00:04:47.210> didn't

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
dodged a nova bomb on accident I didn't

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:57.520 
dodged a nova bomb on accident I didn't
mean<00:04:47.600> to<00:04:47.810> but<00:04:48.139> I'm<00:04:48.590> pretty<00:04:48.919> sure<00:04:49.220> I<00:04:55.930> lost<00:04:56.930> so

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
mean to but I'm pretty sure I lost so

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.650 
mean to but I'm pretty sure I lost so
right<00:04:58.400> now<00:04:58.550> I<00:04:58.580> see<00:04:58.940> that<00:04:58.970> a<00:04:59.150> is<00:04:59.180> getting<00:04:59.419> capped

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660

right now I see that a is getting capped
I<00:04:59.840> have<00:04:59.930> a<00:04:59.990> idea<00:05:00.680> that<00:05:00.950> maybe<00:05:01.130> I<00:05:01.280> should<00:05:01.490> shoot

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
I have a idea that maybe I should shoot

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.120 
I have a idea that maybe I should shoot
a<00:05:01.669> rocket<00:05:01.910> and<00:05:02.360> it<00:05:02.450> wasn't<00:05:02.919> definite<00:05:03.919> right

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
a rocket and it wasn't definite right

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.340 
a rocket and it wasn't definite right
choice<00:05:04.370> there<00:05:04.639> gotta<00:05:04.850> easy<00:05:05.090> careful<00:05:05.479> and

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
choice there gotta easy careful and

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.379 
choice there gotta easy careful and
that's<00:05:06.470> gonna<00:05:06.710> help<00:05:06.889> out<00:05:07.100> our<00:05:07.130> team<00:05:07.430> hardly

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
that's gonna help out our team hardly

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:09.550 
that's gonna help out our team hardly
any<00:05:08.510> because<00:05:08.930> we're<00:05:09.080> still<00:05:09.260> trailing

severely<00:05:10.389> it<00:05:11.389> was<00:05:11.540> a<00:05:11.570> pretty<00:05:12.169> depressing

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
severely it was a pretty depressing

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.560 
severely it was a pretty depressing
every<00:05:12.860> time<00:05:13.010> I'd<00:05:13.130> get<00:05:13.280> a<00:05:13.340> like<00:05:13.910> a<00:05:13.940> triple<00:05:14.389> or

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
every time I'd get a like a triple or

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.909 
every time I'd get a like a triple or
I'd<00:05:14.690> get<00:05:14.810> a<00:05:14.870> few<00:05:15.020> kills<00:05:15.260> I<00:05:15.380> guess<00:05:15.530> yeah<00:05:15.740> we're

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
I'd get a few kills I guess yeah we're

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.200 
I'd get a few kills I guess yeah we're
gonna<00:05:16.040> catch<00:05:16.310> up<00:05:16.490> and<00:05:16.669> then<00:05:16.790> look<00:05:17.000> at<00:05:17.090> the

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
gonna catch up and then look at the

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.409 
gonna catch up and then look at the
score<00:05:17.450> we're<00:05:17.660> still<00:05:17.840> like<00:05:18.020> 4000<00:05:18.889> behind<00:05:19.419> and

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
score we're still like 4000 behind and

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:21.940 
score we're still like 4000 behind and
honestly<00:05:20.870> it's<00:05:21.080> just<00:05:21.229> because<00:05:21.380> we<00:05:21.500> have<00:05:21.620> one

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
honestly it's just because we have one

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.560 
honestly it's just because we have one
zone<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:22.520> whole<00:05:22.700> time<00:05:23.000> we'll<00:05:23.270> just<00:05:23.360> keep

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
zone the whole time we'll just keep

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.110 
zone the whole time we'll just keep
getting<00:05:23.870> that<00:05:24.250> keep<00:05:25.250> getting<00:05:25.340> captain<00:05:25.850> I<00:05:25.970> I

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
getting that keep getting captain I I

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.000 
getting that keep getting captain I I
usually<00:05:26.360> try<00:05:26.690> to<00:05:26.720> stay<00:05:26.870> around<00:05:27.260> one<00:05:27.560> area<00:05:27.889> and

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
usually try to stay around one area and

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.490 
usually try to stay around one area and
hold<00:05:28.220> it<00:05:28.340> down<00:05:28.419> but<00:05:29.419> it<00:05:29.720> just<00:05:29.930> seemed<00:05:30.169> that<00:05:30.350> no

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
hold it down but it just seemed that no

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.500 
hold it down but it just seemed that no
matter<00:05:30.620> what<00:05:30.950> I<00:05:31.190> was<00:05:31.610> getting<00:05:31.880> either<00:05:31.970> overrun

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
matter what I was getting either overrun

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.540 
matter what I was getting either overrun
and<00:05:32.690> I'd<00:05:32.780> have<00:05:32.960> to<00:05:32.990> leave<00:05:33.770> because<00:05:34.220> I<00:05:34.370> didn't

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
and I'd have to leave because I didn't

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.469 
and I'd have to leave because I didn't
have<00:05:34.669> team<00:05:34.880> support<00:05:35.919> or<00:05:37.000> there's<00:05:38.000> just<00:05:38.060> no<00:05:38.300> one

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
have team support or there's just no one

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.240 
have team support or there's just no one
