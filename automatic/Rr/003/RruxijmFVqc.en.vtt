 hello today I will prepare a tart 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:22.470
 fruit for my husband's birthday 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:25.160
 now these are nests with ingredients 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:32.390
 the ingredients for shortcrust pastry 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:44.070
 then a 200 g of flour 1 whole egg 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:49.320
 plus an egg yolk 100 g of sugar 100 g of 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:53.699
 butter a pinch of salt 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.729
 let's mix the flour and it 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.729
 sugar 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:15.119
 let's go and cut the butter into pieces 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.119
 it must be soft 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:44.759
 in which they are inside the flour then 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:48.270
 let's go and put a whole egg around 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.270
 of another man 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.060
 let's add that there can be 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.740
 we knead lightly 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:36.170
 now let's rest in the fridge 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:43.189
 for half an hour we go to put a sheet 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:46.189
 a baking sheet of parchment paper and we put the 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:50.920

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.750
 degrees for 30 minutes 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:31.120
 this is the freshly baked tart in the
