00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.930 

this<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.459> where<00:03:29.670> it<00:03:29.790> falls

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.200 

these<00:03:36.270> are<00:03:36.450> my<00:03:36.630> elect<00:03:37.280> Cambodian<00:03:38.280> pair<00:03:40.190> course

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
these are my elect Cambodian pair course

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.230 
these are my elect Cambodian pair course
earlier<00:03:42.210> guess<00:03:43.250> let's<00:03:44.250> Cambodian<00:03:44.880> one<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.150> the

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
earlier guess let's Cambodian one of the

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.470 
earlier guess let's Cambodian one of the
rear<00:03:45.420> curl<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:45.930> what<00:03:46.110> they<00:03:46.410> called<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.770> so<00:03:47.730> and

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
rear curl is what they called it so and

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.990 
rear curl is what they called it so and
again<00:03:48.600> it's<00:03:48.900> about<00:03:50.330> seven<00:03:51.330> point<00:03:51.720> lamps<00:03:53.000> leave

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
again it's about seven point lamps leave

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.050 
again it's about seven point lamps leave
one<00:03:54.240> more<00:03:54.390> bundle<00:03:55.040> there's<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.130> piece<00:03:56.310> of<00:03:56.460> here

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
one more bundle there's a piece of here

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.630 
one more bundle there's a piece of here
I<00:03:57.090> figured<00:03:57.660> maybe<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:58.110> was<00:03:58.200> really<00:03:58.860> doesn't<00:03:59.280> it

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
I figured maybe it was really doesn't it

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.200 
I figured maybe it was really doesn't it
but<00:04:00.210> it<00:04:00.300> can<00:04:00.420> fit<00:04:00.690> in<00:04:00.930> between<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.970> can't

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
but it can fit in between you can't

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.730 
but it can fit in between you can't
really<00:04:03.360> tell<00:04:04.020> and<00:04:04.350> also<00:04:07.910> these<00:04:08.910> are<00:04:09.000> high

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
really tell and also these are high

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:16.250 
really tell and also these are high
