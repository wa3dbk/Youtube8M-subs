which is a radically small car for a
Lincoln<00:00:17.520> well<00:00:17.880> it's<00:00:18.000> actually<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.359> pioneering

Lincoln well it's actually a pioneering
small<00:00:19.410> car<00:00:19.680> because<00:00:20.490> what<00:00:20.699> we're<00:00:20.850> looking<00:00:21.210> at

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
small car because what we're looking at

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.320 
small car because what we're looking at
is<00:00:21.510> premium<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.769> small<00:00:23.010> package<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.970> what

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
is premium in a small package and what

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.150 
is premium in a small package and what
we've<00:00:24.480> done<00:00:24.689> with<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:25.830> haven't

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
we've done with this is that we haven't

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.519 
we've done with this is that we haven't
compromised<00:00:26.820> anything<00:00:27.359> on<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.779> roominess<00:00:28.170> of

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
compromised anything on the roominess of

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.919 
compromised anything on the roominess of
the<00:00:28.980> vehicle<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.580> fact<00:00:30.029> what<00:00:30.269> we've<00:00:30.449> done<00:00:30.630> is

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
the vehicle in fact what we've done is

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.139 
the vehicle in fact what we've done is
we've<00:00:31.140> expanded<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.009> what<00:00:32.579> we've<00:00:32.730> done<00:00:32.940> is

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
we've expanded it so what we've done is

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.700 
we've expanded it so what we've done is
we<00:00:33.329> have<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> vehicle<00:00:34.050> that's<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.290> C<00:00:34.440> segment

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
we have a vehicle that's a C segment

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.440 
we have a vehicle that's a C segment
that<00:00:35.010> puts<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.280> vehicle<00:00:35.610> around<00:00:35.730> 40<00:00:36.090> 200

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
that puts a vehicle around 40 200

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.479 
that puts a vehicle around 40 200
millimeters<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.079> length<00:00:37.140> about<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.309> length

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
millimeters in length about the length

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.729 
millimeters in length about the length
of<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.700> Ford<00:00:38.969> Focus<00:00:39.200> but<00:00:40.200> what<00:00:40.350> we've<00:00:40.500> done<00:00:40.530> is

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
of a Ford Focus but what we've done is

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.920 
of a Ford Focus but what we've done is
we<00:00:41.040> widen<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> vehicle<00:00:42.000> by<00:00:42.149> about<00:00:42.360> 70

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
we widen the vehicle by about 70

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.810 
we widen the vehicle by about 70
millimeters<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.620> what<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.399> does<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.789> gives

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
millimeters and what that does it gives

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.229 
millimeters and what that does it gives
us<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.270> roominess<00:00:45.629> inside<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:47.039> 61<00:00:47.640> Lincoln

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
us the roominess inside of a 61 Lincoln

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
whole Lincoln range we have a very

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.280 
whole Lincoln range we have a very
formal<00:01:11.430> seat<00:01:11.880> pillar<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> vehicle<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.080> it

that's<00:01:14.939> also<00:01:15.270> from<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.720> 39<00:01:16.140> Lincoln<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
that's also from the 39 Lincoln and

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.679 
that's also from the 39 Lincoln and
you'll<00:01:17.070> notice<00:01:17.280> here<00:01:17.549> we<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.909> very<00:01:18.240> strong

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
you'll notice here we have a very strong

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.140 
you'll notice here we have a very strong
belt<00:01:19.259> line<00:01:19.470> that's<00:01:19.979> actually<00:01:20.400> set<00:01:20.610> very<00:01:20.880> low

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
belt line that's actually set very low

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.960 
belt line that's actually set very low
it<00:01:21.630> gives<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.080> car<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.560> very<00:01:22.950> go-kart<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.759> like

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
it gives the car a very go-kart and like

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.630 
it gives the car a very go-kart and like
stance<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.840> with<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.110> very<00:01:25.439> upright<00:01:25.650> side<00:01:26.130> cabin

stance if with a very upright side cabin

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.060 
stance if with a very upright side cabin
that<00:01:27.030> allows<00:01:27.270> three<00:01:27.689> across<00:01:27.960> seating<00:01:28.470> but

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
that allows three across seating but

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.030 
that allows three across seating but
really<00:01:29.880> looking<00:01:30.689> at<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.259> overall<00:01:31.590> proportion

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
really looking at the overall proportion

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.160 
really looking at the overall proportion
of<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.189> vehicle<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:32.850> creating<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.900> max

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
of the vehicle it's creating the max

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.429 
of the vehicle it's creating the max

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
amount of intelligent space out of this

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.160 
amount of intelligent space out of this
footprint<00:01:37.890> we've<00:01:38.460> coined<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.939> phrase<00:01:38.990> early<00:01:39.990> on

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
footprint we've coined a phrase early on

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.550 
footprint we've coined a phrase early on
within<00:01:40.530> design<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:41.759> call<00:01:42.140> you<00:01:43.140> know<00:01:43.259> this

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
years and this is not something that we

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.740 
years and this is not something that we
came<00:02:10.250> up<00:02:10.310> with<00:02:10.640> in<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:10.940> last<00:02:10.970> three<00:02:11.569> months

this<00:02:12.319> is<00:02:12.379> something<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.160> within<00:02:13.550> our

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
this is something that within our

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.790 
this is something that within our
studios<00:02:14.360> we<00:02:14.540> actually<00:02:14.870> went<00:02:15.080> back<00:02:15.170> three

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
studios we actually went back three

studios we actually went back three
years<00:02:16.040> ago<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.700> started<00:02:17.180> developing<00:02:17.330> the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
years ago and started developing the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.470 
years ago and started developing the
whole<00:02:18.129> lineup<00:02:19.129> what<00:02:19.310> we<00:02:19.459> felt<00:02:19.700> was<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.090> design

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
whole lineup what we felt was the design

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.869 
whole lineup what we felt was the design
DNA<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:21.230> future<00:02:21.769> products<00:02:22.220> for<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.519> Lincoln

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
brand and really that's where we could

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.430 
brand and really that's where we could
we<00:02:25.549> coined<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.030> phrase<00:02:26.269> guilt<00:02:26.780> free<00:02:26.989> luxury

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.220 
we coined the phrase guilt free luxury
we<00:02:27.830> wanted<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.310> create<00:02:28.489> a<00:02:28.670> brand<00:02:28.970> that<00:02:29.750> was<00:02:29.989> not

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
about just simple opulent luxury well

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.550 
about just simple opulent luxury well
it's<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.260> really<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.560> radical<00:02:34.160> interesting<00:02:34.910> idea

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560
