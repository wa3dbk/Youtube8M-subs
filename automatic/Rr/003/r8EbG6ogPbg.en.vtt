00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.720 
crazy periodization techniques and all
of<00:01:41.720> these<00:01:41.810> different<00:01:42.020> exercises<00:01:42.740> they<00:01:43.490> need

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
of these different exercises they need

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.240 
of these different exercises they need
something<00:01:44.360> with<00:01:44.780> structure<00:01:45.500> but<00:01:46.040> that

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
something with structure but that

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.980 
something with structure but that
doesn't<00:01:46.610> mean<00:01:46.730> give<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.180> same<00:01:47.420> program<00:01:47.870> to

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
doesn't mean give the same program to

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.690 
doesn't mean give the same program to
every<00:01:48.200> single<00:01:48.380> person<00:01:48.680> because<00:01:49.100> everyone<00:01:49.550> has

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
every single person because everyone has

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.790 
every single person because everyone has
individual<00:01:50.270> preferences<00:01:50.870> things<00:01:51.380> they<00:01:51.530> can

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
individual preferences things they can

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.100 
individual preferences things they can
and<00:01:51.950> cannot<00:01:52.220> do<00:01:52.430> past<00:01:52.790> history<00:01:53.110> experiences

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
and cannot do past history experiences

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.470 
and cannot do past history experiences
so<00:01:54.560> you<00:01:54.590> have<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:55.070> create<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.400> program<00:01:55.670> based<00:01:56.240> on

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
so you have to create a program based on

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.240 
so you have to create a program based on
the<00:01:56.570> information<00:01:57.020> that<00:01:57.350> they<00:01:57.710> give<00:01:58.040> you

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
the information that they give you

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.820 
the information that they give you
ignore<00:01:59.060> safety<00:01:59.600> and<00:01:59.750> health<00:01:59.990> issues<00:02:00.440> if<00:02:00.620> your

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
ignore safety and health issues if your

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.830 
ignore safety and health issues if your
current<00:02:01.310> coach<00:02:01.490> or<00:02:01.670> trainer<00:02:01.910> throw<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:02.660> right

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
current coach or trainer throw you right

can't done

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.060 
can't done
just<00:02:29.240> because<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:30.110> like<00:02:30.320> that<00:02:30.560> lifting<00:02:30.920> and

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
just because you like that lifting and

just because you like that lifting and
you<00:02:31.100> want<00:02:31.490> them<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.700> deadlift<00:02:32.150> if<00:02:32.360> they<00:02:32.810> can't

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
do it maybe because of an injury it

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.670 
do it maybe because of an injury it
doesn't<00:02:35.510> mean<00:02:35.660> that<00:02:35.690> they<00:02:36.020> have<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.290> do<00:02:36.530> it

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
doesn't mean that they have to do it

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.230 
doesn't mean that they have to do it
because<00:02:36.740> that's<00:02:37.040> what<00:02:37.160> your<00:02:37.280> program<00:02:37.700> said<00:02:38.030> so

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
because that's what your program said so

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.810 
because that's what your program said so
you<00:02:38.300> have<00:02:38.600> to<00:02:38.750> take<00:02:38.960> their<00:02:39.710> safety<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.580> health

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
you have to take their safety and health

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.360 
you have to take their safety and health
into<00:02:41.150> consideration<00:02:41.930> he<00:02:42.710> or<00:02:42.860> she<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.190> not

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
into consideration he or she is not

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.880 
into consideration he or she is not

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
taking notes or charting if your trainer

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.710 
taking notes or charting if your trainer

that<00:04:25.660> is<00:04:25.840> simply<00:04:26.260> something<00:04:26.530> that<00:04:26.680> you<00:04:26.860> typed

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
that is simply something that you typed

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.490

up really quick sent out and that was it

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.860 
up really quick sent out and that was it
so<00:04:29.740> you<00:04:29.980> just<00:04:30.190> directed<00:04:30.970> them<00:04:31.150> to<00:04:31.180> do

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
so you just directed them to do

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.600 
so you just directed them to do
something<00:04:32.200> and<00:04:32.560> you<00:04:32.680> didn't<00:04:33.010> actually<00:04:33.190> coach

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610

them through the process so that is the

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.110 
them through the process so that is the

difference between being a coach and
being<00:04:37.420> an<00:04:37.540> asshole<00:04:37.930> so<00:04:38.410> if<00:04:38.620> someone<00:04:38.890> is<00:04:38.980> paying

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160
