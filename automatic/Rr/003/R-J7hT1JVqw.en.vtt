automatic<00:02:03.899> movement<00:02:04.320> as<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.500> mentioned<00:02:04.920> and

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
automatic movement as I mentioned and

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.950 
automatic movement as I mentioned and
what<00:02:05.880> you'll<00:02:06.000> notice<00:02:06.149> obviously<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.840> that

different colored tint and as I

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.619 
different colored tint and as I
mentioned<00:02:20.640> this<00:02:20.700> model<00:02:20.970> specifically<00:02:21.390> has

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
mentioned this model specifically has

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.280 
mentioned this model specifically has
this<00:02:21.660> blue<00:02:22.050> tint<00:02:22.319> which<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:24.720> know<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.020> you

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
this blue tint which you know it you

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.540 
this blue tint which you know it you
know<00:02:25.349> to<00:02:25.500> be<00:02:25.530> frank<00:02:25.709> it's<00:02:25.950> not<00:02:26.099> my<00:02:26.190> favorite

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
know to be frank it's not my favorite

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.720 
know to be frank it's not my favorite
but

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
but

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.160 
but
but<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:27.000> think<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.510> does<00:02:27.629> add<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.780> little<00:02:27.900> bit<00:02:28.080> of

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
but I think it does add a little bit of

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.540 
but I think it does add a little bit of
character<00:02:28.379> for<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.680> watch<00:02:28.860> end<00:02:29.190> if<00:02:29.400> you're

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
character for the watch end if you're

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.890 
character for the watch end if you're
interested<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.120> watch<00:02:30.300> obviously<00:02:30.510> not

interested in this watch obviously not
afraid<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.170> some<00:02:31.379> power<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.489> might<00:02:32.670> be

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
afraid of some power so it might be

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.570 
afraid of some power so it might be
something<00:02:32.849> that<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.360> really<00:02:33.510> enjoy<00:02:37.129> so<00:02:38.129> here

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
we're taking a closer look at the dial

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.530 
we're taking a closer look at the dial
of<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.470> orient<00:02:40.830> disc<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:41.970> really<00:02:42.239> this<00:02:42.360> is<00:02:42.420> the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
of the orient disc so really this is the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
of this color and sort of unique design

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.699 
of this color and sort of unique design
is<00:02:47.400> coming<00:02:47.819> from<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.900> for<00:02:49.080> before<00:02:49.410> we<00:02:49.500> get<00:02:49.590> to

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
is coming from so for before we get to

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:50.960 
is coming from so for before we get to
the<00:02:49.799> main<00:02:49.920> feature<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.340> disc<00:02:50.519> let's<00:02:50.730> look<00:02:50.849> at

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
the main feature the disc let's look at

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.580 
the main feature the disc let's look at
the<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.510> general<00:02:51.720> markings<00:02:52.230> on<00:02:52.349> the<00:02:52.440> watch

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
the the general markings on the watch

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.699 
the the general markings on the watch
you<00:02:52.620> have<00:02:53.010> these<00:02:53.569> gray<00:02:54.569> markers<00:02:55.290> along<00:02:55.680> a

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
you have these gray markers along a

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.490 
you have these gray markers along a
raised<00:02:56.040> internal<00:02:56.640> bezel<00:02:57.000> at<00:02:57.780> each<00:02:57.900> hour<00:02:58.170> which

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
raised internal bezel at each hour which

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.650 
raised internal bezel at each hour which
are<00:02:58.650> nice<00:02:58.940> they<00:02:59.940> sort<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.180> match<00:03:00.360> well<00:03:00.629> with

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
are nice they sort of match well with

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.500 
are nice they sort of match well with
the<00:03:00.930> gunmetal<00:03:01.260> black<00:03:01.879> colorway<00:03:02.879> of<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.299> watch

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
the gunmetal black colorway of the watch

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.110 
the gunmetal black colorway of the watch
and<00:03:04.410> then<00:03:04.890> moving<00:03:05.099> in<00:03:05.310> towards<00:03:05.609> the<00:03:05.670> main<00:03:05.879> dial

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
and then moving in towards the main dial

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.410 
and then moving in towards the main dial
space<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.690> have<00:03:07.010> gray<00:03:08.010> minute<00:03:08.940> or<00:03:09.090> second

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
space you have gray minute or second

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.550 
space you have gray minute or second
indices<00:03:09.780> depending<00:03:10.140> on<00:03:10.200> how<00:03:10.290> you're<00:03:10.410> reading

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
indices depending on how you're reading

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.830 
indices depending on how you're reading
it<00:03:10.829> and<00:03:11.760> then<00:03:11.970> you<00:03:12.090> see<00:03:12.239> these<00:03:12.359> perforations

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
it and then you see these perforations

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.210 
it and then you see these perforations
in<00:03:13.140> that<00:03:13.290> portion<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.799> dial<00:03:13.980> where

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
in that portion of the dial where

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.520 
in that portion of the dial where
underneath<00:03:14.549> you<00:03:14.700> can<00:03:14.849> see<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:16.200> green<00:03:16.500> color

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
underneath you can see the green color

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.140 
underneath you can see the green color
for<00:03:17.129> the<00:03:17.250> hour<00:03:17.340> markers<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.920> then<00:03:20.519> you<00:03:20.970> also

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
for the hour markers and then you also

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.390 
for the hour markers and then you also
see<00:03:21.299> here<00:03:21.450> we<00:03:21.720> have<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.840> date<00:03:22.049> window<00:03:22.370> which<00:03:23.370> is

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
see here we have a date window which is

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.449 
see here we have a date window which is
a<00:03:23.579> black<00:03:24.450> background<00:03:24.750> with<00:03:25.200> white<00:03:25.440> text<00:03:25.709> and

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
a black background with white text and

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.400 
a black background with white text and
it's<00:03:26.640> outlined<00:03:27.000> in<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.329> green<00:03:27.629> which<00:03:28.290> I

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
it's outlined in that green which I

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.740 
it's outlined in that green which I
think<00:03:28.590> is<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:28.739> sort<00:03:28.920> of<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.099> nice<00:03:29.329> little<00:03:30.329> detail

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
think is a sort of a nice little detail

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.819 
think is a sort of a nice little detail
there<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.139> just<00:03:31.290> kind<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.470> bring<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:31.709> all

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
there to just kind of bring it all

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.940 
there to just kind of bring it all
together<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:33.470> then<00:03:34.470> moving<00:03:34.680> all<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.889> way

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
together and then moving all the way

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.050 
together and then moving all the way
into<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.250> center<00:03:35.489> of<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.609> dial<00:03:35.760> this<00:03:35.910> is

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
into the center of the dial this is

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.280 
into the center of the dial this is
where<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.359> disk<00:03:36.540> gets<00:03:36.690> its<00:03:36.900> name

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
where the disk gets its name

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.460 
where the disk gets its name
so<00:03:37.889> the<00:03:37.980> hour<00:03:38.130> marker<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.840> watch<00:03:40.200> is

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
so the hour marker of the watch is

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.229 
so the hour marker of the watch is
actually<00:03:40.799> not<00:03:40.919> an<00:03:41.069> active<00:03:41.430> hand<00:03:41.639> so<00:03:41.940> much<00:03:42.090> as

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
actually not an active hand so much as

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.150 
actually not an active hand so much as
it's<00:03:42.389> this<00:03:42.569> rotating<00:03:43.049> disk<00:03:43.319> with<00:03:44.130> a

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
it's this rotating disk with a

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.539 
it's this rotating disk with a
perforation<00:03:44.669> that<00:03:45.000> displays<00:03:45.389> color<00:03:45.829> on<00:03:46.829> a<00:03:46.889> on

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
perforation that displays color on a on

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.069 
perforation that displays color on a on
a<00:03:47.639> you<00:03:47.849> know<00:03:47.970> sort<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.269> sub<00:03:48.480> dial<00:03:48.720> beneath

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
a you know sort of a sub dial beneath

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.720 
a you know sort of a sub dial beneath
the<00:03:49.260> top<00:03:49.440> dial<00:03:49.739> so<00:03:49.980> let<00:03:50.130> me<00:03:50.220> just<00:03:50.400> sort<00:03:50.489> of<00:03:50.579> show

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
the top dial so let me just sort of show

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.650 
the top dial so let me just sort of show
you<00:03:50.790> what<00:03:50.880> this<00:03:51.120> looks<00:03:51.329> like

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
you what this looks like

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.970 
you what this looks like
so<00:03:52.109> as<00:03:52.169> we<00:03:52.290> rotate<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:54.630> crown<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.859> hour

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
so as we rotate the crown and the hour

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.909 
so as we rotate the crown and the hour
moves<00:03:56.400> you<00:03:56.669> see<00:03:56.880> that<00:03:57.090> there<00:03:57.299> is<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.919> triangular

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
moves you see that there is a triangular

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.470 
moves you see that there is a triangular
indicator<00:03:59.340> for<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.579> hour<00:03:59.760> that's<00:04:00.090> green<00:04:00.359> at

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
indicator for the hour that's green at

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.599 
indicator for the hour that's green at
the<00:04:00.569> bottom<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:00.930> white<00:04:01.109> towards<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.530> tip<00:04:01.709> but

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
the bottom and white towards the tip but

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.300 
the bottom and white towards the tip but
as<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:02.880> turn<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:04.440> color<00:04:04.650> that<00:04:05.040> will<00:04:05.160> actually

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
as you turn the color that will actually

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.970 
as you turn the color that will actually
change<00:04:05.489> as<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.870> colour<00:04:07.079> of<00:04:07.169> the<00:04:07.440> very<00:04:07.590> bottom

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
change as the colour of the very bottom

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.420 
change as the colour of the very bottom
layer<00:04:08.130> of<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.459> dial<00:04:08.930> changes<00:04:10.040> so<00:04:11.040> it's<00:04:11.190> you

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
layer of the dial changes so it's you

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.369 
layer of the dial changes so it's you
know<00:04:11.519> it's<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:12.030> pretty<00:04:12.450> simple<00:04:12.660> mechanism<00:04:13.260> that

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
know it's a pretty simple mechanism that

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.539 
know it's a pretty simple mechanism that
has<00:04:13.760> you<00:04:14.760> know<00:04:14.879> sort<00:04:15.750> of<00:04:15.780> interesting<00:04:16.549> effect

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
has you know sort of interesting effect

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.909 
has you know sort of interesting effect
and<00:04:18.450> as<00:04:18.989> you'll<00:04:19.139> see<00:04:19.169> you<00:04:19.680> know<00:04:19.799> it

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
and as you'll see you know it

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.589 
and as you'll see you know it
transitioned<00:04:20.639> from<00:04:20.940> green<00:04:21.359> on<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.570> bottom

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
transitioned from green on the bottom

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.960 
transitioned from green on the bottom
right<00:04:21.959> at<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.139> top<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.590> all<00:04:22.710> green<00:04:23.010> so<00:04:23.789> now<00:04:23.820> you

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
right at the top to all green so now you

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.370 
right at the top to all green so now you
have<00:04:24.090> white<00:04:24.300> on<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.510> bottom<00:04:24.660> green<00:04:25.110> on<00:04:25.260> the

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
have white on the bottom green on the

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.860 
have white on the bottom green on the
top<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.949> then<00:04:26.849> as<00:04:27.060> you<00:04:27.120> can<00:04:27.240> imagine<00:04:27.360> it<00:04:27.690> turns

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
top and then as you can imagine it turns

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.810 
top and then as you can imagine it turns
all<00:04:28.050> white<00:04:28.080> here<00:04:28.530> so<00:04:29.130> you<00:04:29.190> know<00:04:29.610> throughout

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
all white here so you know throughout

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.420 
all white here so you know throughout
your<00:04:29.970> day<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:31.470> color<00:04:31.680> of<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:31.919> hour<00:04:32.010> indicator

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
your day the color of the hour indicator

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.120 
your day the color of the hour indicator
actually<00:04:32.550> changes<00:04:33.030> it's<00:04:33.449> a<00:04:33.539> nice<00:04:33.690> detail<00:04:34.130> you

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
actually changes it's a nice detail you

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.469 
actually changes it's a nice detail you
know<00:04:35.219> again<00:04:35.460> it's<00:04:35.580> not<00:04:35.669> for<00:04:35.820> everybody<00:04:36.030> but<00:04:36.240> if

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
know again it's not for everybody but if

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:37.370 
know again it's not for everybody but if
you're<00:04:36.599> interested<00:04:36.960> in<00:04:37.050> this<00:04:37.110> sort<00:04:37.320> of

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
you're interested in this sort of

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.030 
you're interested in this sort of
designed<00:04:37.740> youthful<00:04:38.669> interesting<00:04:39.060> watch<00:04:39.210> that

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
designed youthful interesting watch that

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.320 
designed youthful interesting watch that
is<00:04:40.100> very<00:04:40.400> likely<00:04:40.580> something<00:04:40.880> that'll<00:04:41.180> really

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
is very likely something that'll really

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.090 
is very likely something that'll really
interest<00:04:42.260> you<00:04:42.320> quite<00:04:42.560> a<00:04:42.590> bit<00:04:43.480> the<00:04:44.890> minute<00:04:45.890> and

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
interest you quite a bit the minute and

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.550 
interest you quite a bit the minute and
second<00:04:46.610> indicator<00:04:46.790> on<00:04:47.120> the<00:04:47.150> watch<00:04:47.390> are<00:04:48.380> very

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
second indicator on the watch are very

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.020 
second indicator on the watch are very
simple<00:04:48.860> they<00:04:48.950> kept<00:04:49.130> it<00:04:49.250> clean<00:04:49.460> to<00:04:49.700> sort<00:04:49.880> of<00:04:49.910> not

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
simple they kept it clean to sort of not

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.930 
simple they kept it clean to sort of not
distract<00:04:50.450> from<00:04:50.710> the<00:04:51.710> otherwise<00:04:52.070> pretty<00:04:52.640> sort

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
distract from the otherwise pretty sort

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.120 
distract from the otherwise pretty sort
of<00:04:53.030> out<00:04:53.120> there<00:04:53.270> design<00:04:53.630> of<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:53.900> dial<00:04:54.140> with<00:04:55.010> the

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
of out there design of the dial with the

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.800 
of out there design of the dial with the
green<00:04:55.310> and<00:04:55.460> whatnots<00:04:55.760> are<00:04:55.910> just<00:04:56.090> plain<00:04:56.450> simple

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
green and whatnots are just plain simple

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.700 
green and whatnots are just plain simple
white<00:04:57.340> minute<00:04:58.340> and<00:04:58.520> second<00:04:59.300> indicator<00:04:59.710> and

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
white minute and second indicator and

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.770 
white minute and second indicator and
just<00:05:00.950> you<00:05:01.490> know<00:05:01.520> generally<00:05:02.300> speaking<00:05:02.630> you

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
just you know generally speaking you

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.230 
just you know generally speaking you
know<00:05:02.870> I<00:05:02.900> think<00:05:03.670> it's<00:05:04.670> a<00:05:04.760> simple<00:05:04.970> movement

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
know I think it's a simple movement

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.380 
know I think it's a simple movement
three<00:05:05.630> hand<00:05:05.840> with<00:05:06.020> a<00:05:06.050> date<00:05:06.260> window<00:05:06.700> and<00:05:07.700> this

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
three hand with a date window and this

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.510 
three hand with a date window and this
sort<00:05:08.960> of<00:05:09.020> the<00:05:09.080> technology<00:05:09.680> behind<00:05:09.830> the<00:05:10.190> effect

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
sort of the technology behind the effect

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.830 
sort of the technology behind the effect
is<00:05:10.700> very<00:05:10.730> simple<00:05:11.210> as<00:05:11.300> well<00:05:11.480> but<00:05:11.690> I<00:05:11.750> think

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
is very simple as well but I think

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.700 
is very simple as well but I think
they've<00:05:12.530> implemented<00:05:12.950> it<00:05:13.690> nicely<00:05:14.690> and<00:05:14.930> into<00:05:15.680> a

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
they've implemented it nicely and into a

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.690 
they've implemented it nicely and into a
really<00:05:15.950> nice<00:05:16.100> effect<00:05:18.280> all<00:05:19.280> right<00:05:19.400> so<00:05:19.520> now<00:05:19.640> you

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
really nice effect all right so now you

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.480 
really nice effect all right so now you
can<00:05:19.880> see<00:05:20.060> the<00:05:20.990> orient<00:05:21.290> disc<00:05:21.470> on<00:05:21.710> my<00:05:21.890> wrist<00:05:22.250> and

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
can see the orient disc on my wrist and

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.920 
can see the orient disc on my wrist and
as<00:05:22.640> I<00:05:22.760> mentioned<00:05:23.150> it's<00:05:23.510> a<00:05:23.570> really<00:05:23.750> comfortable

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
as I mentioned it's a really comfortable

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.450 
as I mentioned it's a really comfortable
size<00:05:24.290> it's<00:05:24.620> a<00:05:24.650> little<00:05:24.830> less<00:05:24.920> than<00:05:25.100> forty<00:05:25.340> one

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
size it's a little less than forty one

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.250 
size it's a little less than forty one
and<00:05:25.490> a<00:05:25.610> half<00:05:25.730> millimeters<00:05:25.940> in<00:05:26.360> diameter<00:05:26.510> and

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
and a half millimeters in diameter and

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.920 
and a half millimeters in diameter and
the<00:05:27.500> log<00:05:27.650> to<00:05:27.830> log<00:05:28.010> is<00:05:28.280> just<00:05:28.910> forty<00:05:29.540> seven<00:05:29.570> and<00:05:29.900> a

the log to log is just forty seven and a

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.480 
the log to log is just forty seven and a
half<00:05:30.080> so<00:05:30.380> it's<00:05:30.560> just<00:05:30.740> very<00:05:30.980> nicely<00:05:31.220> on<00:05:31.430> my

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
half so it's just very nicely on my

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.190 
half so it's just very nicely on my
wrist<00:05:31.760> I<00:05:32.000> have<00:05:32.420> a<00:05:32.480> sort<00:05:32.780> of<00:05:32.840> slightly<00:05:33.020> larger

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
wrist it's out a half inches but I think

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.990 
wrist it's out a half inches but I think
it<00:05:34.820> would<00:05:34.880> fit<00:05:35.120> most<00:05:36.020> wrist<00:05:36.320> pretty<00:05:36.560> nicely
