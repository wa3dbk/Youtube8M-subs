 changes with temperature 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:56.690
 so the current pressure change catalog 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.909
 height can also be changed 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:07.869

 The clock has a convenient mechanism and 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.930
 yourself changing the battery yourself

 not really possible to dive to 10 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.120
 meters and clean at the same time will 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:57.070
 show your depth he order 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.480
 hours of our site with time. 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:05.070
 Thank you for your attention so watch suunto core
