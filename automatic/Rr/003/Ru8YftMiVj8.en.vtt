what<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:10.860> very<00:00:11.040> special<00:00:11.430> thing<00:00:11.610> about<00:00:11.670> it

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:13.720 
what is very special thing about it

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.860 
what is very special thing about it
this<00:00:13.840> is<00:00:14.020> that<00:00:14.620> macrophages<00:00:15.280> decided<00:00:16.090> that

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:16.870 
this is that macrophages decided that

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.050 
this is that macrophages decided that
this<00:00:17.170> antigen<00:00:17.530> could<00:00:18.100> be<00:00:18.250> labeled<00:00:18.700> in<00:00:18.760> a<00:00:18.880> very

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
this antigen could be labeled in a very

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.810 
this antigen could be labeled in a very
specific<00:00:19.300> way<00:00:19.840> this<00:00:20.380> labelled<00:00:20.980> antigen<00:00:21.460> along

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
specific way this labelled antigen along

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.970 
specific way this labelled antigen along
with<00:00:22.029> this<00:00:22.210> red<00:00:22.420> molecule<00:00:22.630> now<00:00:23.560> should<00:00:23.950> be

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
with this red molecule now should be

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.280

are<00:07:38.039> two<00:07:38.370> identical<00:07:38.669> twins<00:07:39.470> their<00:07:40.470> class<00:07:40.830> 2

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:41.100 
are two identical twins their class 2

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.830 
are two identical twins their class 2
and<00:07:41.280> class<00:07:41.310> 1<00:07:41.729> molecules<00:07:42.210> will<00:07:42.330> be<00:07:42.449> absolutely

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 
and class 1 molecules will be absolutely

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.040 
and class 1 molecules will be absolutely
identical<00:07:43.940> but<00:07:44.940> my<00:07:45.240> class<00:07:45.539> 1<00:07:45.750> and<00:07:45.870> class<00:07:45.900> 2

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.050 
identical but my class 1 and class 2

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.719 
identical but my class 1 and class 2
molecules<00:07:46.650> should<00:07:46.889> be<00:07:46.979> very<00:07:47.190> different<00:07:47.430> from

00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:47.729 
molecules should be very different from

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:50.689 
molecules should be very different from
class<00:07:48.330> 1<00:07:48.539> and<00:07:48.660> class<00:07:48.690> 2<00:07:48.870> molecules<00:07:49.410> of<00:07:49.699> vikas

00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:50.699 
class 1 and class 2 molecules of vikas

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:52.969 
class 1 and class 2 molecules of vikas
is<00:07:51.330> the<00:07:51.479> right<00:07:51.660> so<00:07:51.990> our<00:07:52.139> tissue<00:07:52.500> then<00:07:52.680> we<00:07:52.800> are

00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:52.979 
is the right so our tissue then we are

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:55.189 
is the right so our tissue then we are
not<00:07:53.280> considered<00:07:53.759> compatible<00:07:54.300> we<00:07:55.080> have<00:07:55.169> a

00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:55.199 
not considered compatible we have a

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:57.290 
not considered compatible we have a
hysto<00:07:55.560> incompatibility<00:07:56.250> this<00:07:57.000> isn't<00:07:57.210> right

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:57.300 
hysto incompatibility this isn't right

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.610 
hysto incompatibility this isn't right
so<00:07:58.099> these<00:07:59.099> molecules<00:07:59.430> were<00:08:00.240> called<00:08:00.620> MHC

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:01.620 
so these molecules were called MHC

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.270 
so these molecules were called MHC

determining molecules later on we

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.469 
determining molecules later on we
discovered<00:08:08.159> these<00:08:08.699> molecules<00:08:09.180> have<00:08:09.240> some
