00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.740
 Y 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.010
 something so everyday that practices all 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.530
 hours could be so common that maybe 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.700
 you think it does not matter 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.320
 we ask what is communication and we 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.560
 we respond 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.330
 The simplest notion of communication is 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.750
 share ideas interests 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.890
 feelings and share experiences 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.570
 man could not live without 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.579
 communication 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.700
 society is part of communication 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:44.160
 nation together the primitive man started 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.460
 the language of united and shrieks that 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.070
 they formed the onomatopoeic language 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.800
 imitate the sounds of nature 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.800
 and then became oral language 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.329
 when the 20th century arrived, the human being 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.180
 I had invented many forms of 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.920
 communication both group and 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.509
 individually 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:10.060
 the cinema the radio and television 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:12.939
 all this added to the telegraph on the telephone 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.580
 to the cable and even the satellites of 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:18.370
 communication 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.930
 the communication must follow a process 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.300
 several comunicólogos have studied the 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.860
 communicative process the history we 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.560
 traces the first communication model 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.070
 of aristóteles until you get to roman 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:37.560
 jakobson which it is the next emitter 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:39.659
 receiver message code channel and context 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.360
 besides mentioning certain functions 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.580
 of the language that we use which 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.710
 are 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:53.080
 emotive poetic appellative 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.080
 metalinguistics talk and reference 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.980
 There are communication barriers that 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.150
 reduce accuracy or distort the 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.460
 communication such as physiological 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.460
 ideological cultural semantics and 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.289
 psychological is important to mention that 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.350
 the functions of language have certain 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.540
 link with the communicative process 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.310
 as mentioned below is the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.860
 emotive function is related to the 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.800
 issuer the appellative function with the 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.740
 receiver phatic function with the channel 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.370
 the referential function with the context 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.730
 the poetic function with the message and the 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.830
 linguistic goal function with the code 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.150
 we humans have codes 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.730
 very complex symbolic 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.620
 exchange information between them 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.379
 emphasizes verbal language through 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.670
 phonemes grouped in syllables words and 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.409
 phrases 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.569
 nonverbal language is called the 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.840
 silent language or communication 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.489
 without language the written language is the 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.819
 testimony of the passage of man by 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:00.230
 planet is what gives permanence to 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.230
 human being and its culture 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.269
 it took many years for man 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.790
 will create your first written code that happened 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.489
 from the drawings to the hieroglyphics and 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.010
 then to the letters the words are 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:16.069
 our greatest wealth when a 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:20.329
 language of her other words arise 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.129
 evolve some are born others die but 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.620
 we must respect good spelling and 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.900
 the grammar 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.230
 spelling is not a fad that changes 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.840
 according to the trends write well is and 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.409
 will always be synonymous with culture and 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.409
 education
