00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
it takes in it's very logical it goes

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.680 
it takes in it's very logical it goes
like<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.400> syncopation<00:02:20.030> book<00:02:20.330> which<00:02:20.480> I<00:02:20.570> have

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
like the syncopation book which I have

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.660 
like the syncopation book which I have
in<00:02:20.810> here<00:02:20.930> too<00:02:21.110> which<00:02:21.320> is<00:02:21.440> really<00:02:21.470> good<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:22.160> don't

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
in here too which is really good I don't

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.400 
in here too which is really good I don't
think<00:02:22.850> it's<00:02:22.970> as<00:02:23.150> logical<00:02:23.750> as<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:23.990> book<00:02:24.200> is

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
think it's as logical as this book is

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.040 
think it's as logical as this book is
because<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:25.850> goes<00:02:26.060> straight<00:02:26.270> from<00:02:26.630> quarters

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
because it goes straight from quarters

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.890 
because it goes straight from quarters
quarter<00:02:27.410> rest<00:02:27.650> eggs<00:02:28.070> eight<00:02:28.490> breasts<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.750> know

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
quarter rest eggs eight breasts you know

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.980 
quarter rest eggs eight breasts you know
to<00:02:30.530> sixteen<00:02:31.070> then<00:02:31.880> I<00:02:31.910> mean<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.270> has<00:02:32.510> all<00:02:32.540> the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
to sixteen then I mean it has all the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.660 
to sixteen then I mean it has all the
snare<00:02:33.260> stuff<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.680> you<00:02:33.770> need<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.130> has<00:02:34.280> clams

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
snare stuff that you need that has clams

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.150 
snare stuff that you need that has clams
it<00:02:35.030> gets<00:02:35.180> into<00:02:35.420> accents<00:02:36.050> it<00:02:36.500> even<00:02:36.830> talks<00:02:36.980> about

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
it gets into accents it even talks about

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.070 
it gets into accents it even talks about
dynamical<00:02:38.090> levels<00:02:39.520> and<00:02:40.520> it<00:02:40.700> it's<00:02:41.150> just<00:02:41.420> it's

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
dynamical levels and it it's just it's

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.220 
dynamical levels and it it's just it's
