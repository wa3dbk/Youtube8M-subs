00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.120
 we have changed our top ten already butter 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:13.380
 poured 10-60 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.730
 bought a sensor dmrv sensor mass 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.220
 air flow 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.250
 regulator idle new filter and 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.480
 I bought new candles for ford but 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.240
 that's worth it so you put it here 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.150
 aspirated ik16 made we froze 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.780
 now you will see it now we are all 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.079
 change business and immediately make a new one 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.620
 froze in the same conditions on the same day 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.620
 let's get started 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:34.880
 so pulled out the first candle candles here 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:37.180
 some kind of call on them like that and oil 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.060
 there in my floor a well 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.210
 but now we put on baking I think 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:49.300
 but what to wipe from the campaign began we 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:53.000
 we put ik16 so she focused 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.880
 tendency to 16 iridium electrode visible 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.430
 excellent at filling something will not give but in 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.890
 As a result, the oil was only in the first wells 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.290
 In the rest, everything was fine, we changed 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.350
 dmrv changed candles 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.780
 changed the idle control but 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.540
 erected everything works fine now we 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.140
 see at the place of measurement and measure 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.540
 look gave us this what you go no 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.130
 would come to the place of measurement 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:26.780
 let's see the last vidos again 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:30.230
 at 14 52 to the hundred the equator was 1950 we 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.680
 changed the candles and dmrv the idea should be 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.700
 the best we are done now as usual two 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.140
 three runs 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.140
 you see the best 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.450
 did we stop watching what we have 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:24.770
 got release time you see zero 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.490
 Stone became 1418 that is, three dozen we 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.820

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.480
 in the next issue we will put another 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.550
 choke put another receiver rather 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.620
 just two releases of the first chokes 2 to 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.160
 the receiver after that we will build up 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.430
 online and see what gives the firmware on 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.290
 the receiver on the throttle what happens 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.020
 result and try with someone already 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.840
 call in if the weather permits all the same 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.850
