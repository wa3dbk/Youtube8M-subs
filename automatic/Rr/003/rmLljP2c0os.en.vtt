00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
original a city in the new tech we took

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.520 
original a city in the new tech we took
we<00:01:11.910> are<00:01:12.000> very<00:01:12.300> very<00:01:12.390> specific<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.229> make<00:01:13.380> sure

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530

we are very very specific to make sure
that<00:01:13.680> things<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.160> the<00:01:14.369> art<00:01:14.520> direction

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
that things like the art direction

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.060 
that things like the art direction
compliment<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.930> open<00:01:16.229> over<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.590> top<00:01:16.830> game

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
compliment that open over the top game

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.340 
compliment that open over the top game
for<00:01:17.520> example<00:01:17.970> there's<00:01:18.509> very<00:01:18.780> few<00:01:18.869> straight

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
for example there's very few straight

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.050 
for example there's very few straight
lines<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.890> break<00:01:20.100> up<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.340> Philly<00:01:20.520> or<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:20.850> God's

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
kind of come through a yard direction so

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.050 
kind of come through a yard direction so
we<00:01:26.900> really<00:01:28.160> capitalizing<00:01:29.160> on<00:01:29.250> our<00:01:29.580> previous

view with that with starting out that

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.330 
view with that with starting out that
way<00:02:14.320> is<00:02:14.380> we<00:02:14.530> can<00:02:14.650> give<00:02:14.770> players<00:02:14.980> really
