00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
the perimeter some edges and then they

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.660 
the perimeter some edges and then they
started<00:03:53.380> widening<00:03:53.620> their<00:03:54.040> techniques<00:03:54.490> are

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
taking something away from Monty's

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.740 
taking something away from Monty's
records<00:04:50.950> that<00:04:51.130> he's<00:04:51.760> doing<00:04:51.940> these<00:04:52.270> games<00:04:52.540> when

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
records that he's doing these games when

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.480 
records that he's doing these games when
he<00:04:52.780> can't<00:04:53.050> believe

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
he can't believe

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.070 
he can't believe
yeah<00:04:55.490> I<00:04:55.700> mean<00:04:56.270> I<00:04:56.390> get<00:04:56.870> where<00:04:56.960> you're<00:04:56.990> coming

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080

from<00:04:57.290> but<00:04:57.590> I<00:04:58.420> think<00:04:59.420> he<00:04:59.840> knew<00:04:59.960> what<00:05:00.140> went<00:05:00.710> into

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
from but I think he knew what went into

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.290 
from but I think he knew what went into
that<00:05:00.890> touchdown<00:05:01.220> today<00:05:01.640> when<00:05:01.820> he<00:05:01.880> got<00:05:02.000> it<00:05:02.180> that

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
that touchdown today when he got it that

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
down your unit well I think two things

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.640 
down your unit well I think two things
if<00:06:20.060> we<00:06:20.210> if<00:06:20.450> we<00:06:20.480> get<00:06:20.720> the<00:06:20.840> field<00:06:21.080> goal<00:06:21.290> you<00:06:21.530> know

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
if we if we get the field goal you know

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.840 
if we if we get the field goal you know
you're<00:06:21.770> going<00:06:21.890> to<00:06:21.950> need<00:06:22.070> a<00:06:22.100> touchdown<00:06:22.490> anyways

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
you're going to need a touchdown anyways

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.410 
you're going to need a touchdown anyways
to<00:06:23.060> win<00:06:23.750> so<00:06:24.100> it<00:06:25.100> just<00:06:25.310> felt<00:06:25.490> good<00:06:25.730> about<00:06:26.210> the

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:26.420 
to win so it just felt good about the

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.360 
to win so it just felt good about the
call<00:06:26.600> or<00:06:26.810> is<00:06:26.900> there<00:06:27.140> were<00:06:27.230> some<00:06:27.410> you<00:06:27.650> know

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
big was the momentum swing when the

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.040 
big was the momentum swing when the
overplay<00:06:40.250> and<00:06:40.490> the<00:06:40.700> replay<00:06:41.090> overturn<00:06:41.930> the

know juggle

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.190 
know juggle
and<00:06:49.760> obviously<00:06:50.240> came<00:06:50.540> out<00:06:50.720> I<00:06:50.750> thought<00:06:50.870> another

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:51.200 
and obviously came out I thought another

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.080 
and obviously came out I thought another
critical<00:06:51.680> one<00:06:51.830> you<00:06:52.550> know<00:06:52.670> and<00:06:52.760> I<00:06:52.820> know<00:06:52.880> they

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090 
critical one you know and I know they

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.640 
critical one you know and I know they
stop<00:06:53.330> it<00:06:53.480> i<00:06:53.570> call<00:06:53.780> timeout<00:06:54.200> because<00:06:54.320> like<00:06:54.500> we

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:54.650 
stop it i call timeout because like we

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.960 
stop it i call timeout because like we
were<00:06:54.770> pretty<00:06:54.860> sure<00:06:55.130> that<00:06:55.310> ball<00:06:55.490> was<00:06:55.640> out<00:06:55.790> with

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:55.970 
were pretty sure that ball was out with

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.820 
were pretty sure that ball was out with
my<00:06:56.000> table<00:06:56.420> kind<00:06:56.540> of<00:06:56.720> flip<00:06:57.290> the<00:06:57.320> guy<00:06:57.530> and<00:06:57.680> ripped

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
my table kind of flip the guy and ripped

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.010 
my table kind of flip the guy and ripped
it<00:06:57.920> out<00:06:58.070> and<00:06:58.430> obviously<00:06:58.850> they<00:06:59.030> buzzed<00:06:59.840> it

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020 
it out and obviously they buzzed it

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.080 
it out and obviously they buzzed it
right<00:07:00.770> when<00:07:00.890> i<00:07:00.950> called<00:07:01.190> timeout<00:07:01.550> as<00:07:01.730> well<00:07:01.880> so

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.090 
right when i called timeout as well so

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.780 
right when i called timeout as well so
it<00:07:02.150> had<00:07:02.270> to<00:07:02.330> be<00:07:02.420> closed<00:07:02.890> you<00:07:03.890> just<00:07:04.070> think<00:07:04.610> one

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:04.790 
it had to be closed you just think one

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.190 
it had to be closed you just think one
of<00:07:05.240> these<00:07:05.360> times<00:07:05.510> that<00:07:05.660> breaks<00:07:05.930> been<00:07:06.050> in<00:07:06.140> the

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.200 
of these times that breaks been in the

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.990 
of these times that breaks been in the
war<00:07:06.350> away<00:07:07.780> but<00:07:08.780> there's<00:07:08.930> a<00:07:08.990> couple<00:07:09.760> does<00:07:10.760> had<00:07:10.970> a

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000 
war away but there's a couple does had a

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.670 
war away but there's a couple does had a
interception<00:07:11.870> opportunity<00:07:12.350> in<00:07:12.410> the<00:07:12.470> first

interception opportunity in the first
half<00:07:12.830> there<00:07:13.100> that<00:07:13.250> would<00:07:13.340> have<00:07:13.430> been<00:07:13.520> might

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:13.730 
half there that would have been might

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:14.890 
half there that would have been might
have<00:07:13.820> been<00:07:13.910> a<00:07:13.940> pick-six<00:07:14.360> going<00:07:14.570> the<00:07:14.690> other<00:07:14.720> way

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:14.900 
have been a pick-six going the other way

have been a pick-six going the other way
a<00:07:15.200> couple<00:07:15.710> of<00:07:15.830> them<00:07:15.950> bounced<00:07:16.250> off<00:07:16.340> our<00:07:16.520> fingers

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:16.820 
a couple of them bounced off our fingers

a couple of them bounced off our fingers
out<00:07:16.970> there<00:07:17.210> just<00:07:18.080> need<00:07:18.230> to<00:07:18.350> make<00:07:18.440> a<00:07:18.500> big<00:07:18.710> play

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
out there just need to make a big play

where<00:07:21.080> was<00:07:21.200> the<00:07:21.350> proof<00:07:21.500> time<00:07:21.710> on<00:07:21.890> that<00:07:22.040> third

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:22.610 
where was the proof time on that third

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.130 
where was the proof time on that third
to<00:07:22.820> fourth<00:07:23.090> down<00:07:23.330> touch<00:07:23.570> them<00:07:23.750> and<00:07:23.930> fourth

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:24.140 
to fourth down touch them and fourth

to fourth down touch them and fourth
down<00:07:24.320> to<00:07:24.500> ass<00:07:24.560> it<00:07:24.950> looked<00:07:25.220> like<00:07:25.310> it<00:07:25.430> was<00:07:25.520> a<00:07:25.580> deep

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:25.760 
down to ass it looked like it was a deep

out to number three work one was out

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.430 
out to number three work one was out
there<00:07:29.240> but<00:07:29.420> I<00:07:29.450> see<00:07:29.750> they<00:07:29.870> played<00:07:30.080> off<00:07:30.230> really

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440
