 forage trees for you culture is the 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.030
 science that is responsible for the study 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.689
 general and special of the prairies and 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.849
 forage plants 47% of the 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.730
 global surfaces is classified 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:25.430
 as grassland in mexico the pastures 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.119
 natural resources occupy more than 60% of 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.119

 legumes in the final parts of the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.200
 Roots develop tubers 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.590
 producing nitrogen that helps the
