basis is the exact same go to your

can look around for an option called
port<00:02:16.110> forwarding<00:02:16.590> there<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.069> for<00:02:17.280> me<00:02:17.400> port

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
see something called an ipv4 address

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.490 
see something called an ipv4 address
which<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:08.070> up<00:03:08.310> here<00:03:08.519> and<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.630> can<00:03:09.690> see<00:03:09.840> my<00:03:09.870> ipv4

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
which is up here and you can see my ipv4

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.509 
which is up here and you can see my ipv4
address<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.220> 192.168<00:03:11.940> point<00:03:12.660> zero<00:03:12.930> point<00:03:13.260> two

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
address is 192.168 point zero point two

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.490 
address is 192.168 point zero point two
so<00:03:14.519> on<00:03:14.850> this<00:03:15.420> little<00:03:15.570> bit<00:03:15.720> here<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:16.200> want<00:03:16.380> to

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
so on this little bit here you want to

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.920 
so on this little bit here you want to
simply<00:03:16.830> put<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.340> two<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:17.940> then<00:03:18.750> all<00:03:18.870> you

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
simply put that to two and then all you

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.380 
simply put that to two and then all you
have<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.140> do<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:19.440> just<00:03:19.470> apply<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.220> add<00:03:21.180> it
