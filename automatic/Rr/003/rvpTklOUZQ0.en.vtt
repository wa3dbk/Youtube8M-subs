have<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.180> look<00:00:21.359> at<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.630> video<00:00:22.050> really<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.949> a

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
have a look at this video really is a

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.759 
have a look at this video really is a
useful<00:00:23.220> technique<00:00:25.010> pick<00:00:26.010> up<00:00:26.689> two<00:00:27.689> beads<00:00:28.050> you

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
useful technique pick up two beads you

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.269 
useful technique pick up two beads you
won't<00:00:28.949> need<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.189> stop<00:00:29.609> bead<00:00:30.710> and<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.830> take<00:00:32.040> them

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
won't need to stop bead and we take them

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.250 
won't need to stop bead and we take them
down<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:33.500> nice<00:00:34.500> length<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:35.010> tail<00:00:35.280> thread<00:00:35.640> and

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
down to nice length of tail thread and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.299 
down to nice length of tail thread and
then<00:00:37.260> pass<00:00:37.940> through<00:00:38.940> both<00:00:39.390> beads<00:00:40.230> once<00:00:40.980> more

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
then pass through both beads once more

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.190 
then pass through both beads once more
in<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> same<00:00:41.940> direction<00:00:44.629> and<00:00:45.629> I'm<00:00:45.870> going<00:00:46.140> to

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
in the same direction and I'm going to

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.529 
in the same direction and I'm going to
throw<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.620> pass<00:00:46.860> once<00:00:47.340> more<00:00:47.730> through<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.360> very

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
throw it pass once more through the very

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.090 
throw it pass once more through the very
first<00:00:48.870> bead<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.260> picked<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:50.840> and<00:00:51.949> pull<00:00:52.949> it

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
first bead I picked up and pull it

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.490 
first bead I picked up and pull it
tightly<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:55.050> see<00:00:55.610> that<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.760> beads

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
tightly and you can see that the beads

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.609 
tightly and you can see that the beads
sit<00:00:58.730> side<00:00:59.730> by<00:00:59.760> side<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:01.320> their<00:01:01.590> holes<00:01:02.090> facing

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
sit side by side with their holes facing

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.649 
sit side by side with their holes facing
outwards<00:01:04.619> not<00:01:05.339> next<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.180> each<00:01:06.240> I'm<00:01:06.510> not

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
outwards not next to each I'm not

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.260 
outwards not next to each I'm not
together

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
together

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.560 
together
so<00:01:09.270> from<00:01:09.540> there<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.760> pick<00:01:11.760> up<00:01:11.939> another<00:01:12.060> seed

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
so from there I pick up another seed

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.219 
so from there I pick up another seed
bead<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:15.270> thread<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.570> coming<00:01:15.900> out<00:01:16.170> of

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
bead and the thread is coming out of

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.859 
bead and the thread is coming out of
this<00:01:16.710> side<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.490> bead<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.390> I'm<00:01:18.570> going<00:01:18.780> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
this side of the bead so I'm going to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.020 
this side of the bead so I'm going to
pass<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.350> needle<00:01:19.670> into<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.330> other<00:01:22.229> side

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
pass the needle into the other side

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.550 
pass the needle into the other side
again<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.360> I'm<00:01:24.479> making<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.990> loop<00:01:25.380> around<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:27.560> and

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
again so I'm making a loop around it and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.440 
again so I'm making a loop around it and
I'll<00:01:28.710> pull<00:01:28.950> up<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.280> thread<00:01:29.549> tightly<00:01:29.880> so

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
I'll pull up the thread tightly so

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.530 
I'll pull up the thread tightly so
there's<00:01:30.689> new<00:01:31.200> bead<00:01:31.500> sits<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.130> top<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.360> one

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
there's new bead sits on top of the one

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.620 
there's new bead sits on top of the one
below<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> pass<00:01:34.950> through<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.150> new<00:01:36.329> bead

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
below for the pass through the new bead

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.270 
below for the pass through the new bead
ready<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.979> pick<00:01:38.159> up<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.549> next<00:01:38.850> bead<00:01:39.890> once<00:01:40.890> more

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
ready to pick up the next bead once more

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.149 
ready to pick up the next bead once more
then<00:01:42.270> thread<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.840> now<00:01:43.229> coming<00:01:43.500> out<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.770> this

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
then thread is now coming out of this

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.420 
then thread is now coming out of this
side<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.820> bead<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.630> I'm<00:01:45.780> going<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.140> pass

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
side of the bead so I'm going to pass

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.179 
side of the bead so I'm going to pass
through<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.850> way<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:49.560> make<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.799> loop

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
through it this way to make a loop

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.010 
through it this way to make a loop
around<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:51.829> and<00:01:52.829> as<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.220> pull<00:01:53.520> tightly<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.810> new

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
around it and as I pull tightly the new

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.500 
around it and as I pull tightly the new
bead<00:01:55.290> sits<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.860> top<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:57.140> and

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
bead sits on top of it and

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.760 
bead sits on top of it and
I<00:01:58.600> passed<00:01:59.500> through<00:01:59.830> the<00:01:59.980> newbies<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.590> in<00:02:02.650> that

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
I passed through the newbies so in that

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.740 
I passed through the newbies so in that
fact<00:02:03.100> what<00:02:03.280> is<00:02:03.400> happening<00:02:03.850> is<00:02:04.030> I'm<00:02:04.210> pretty

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
fact what is happening is I'm pretty

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.180 
fact what is happening is I'm pretty
much<00:02:04.960> making<00:02:05.290> a<00:02:05.680> ladder<00:02:06.220> out<00:02:06.670> of<00:02:06.730> beads<00:02:07.240> and

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
much making a ladder out of beads and

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.740 
much making a ladder out of beads and
this<00:02:09.190> is<00:02:09.490> a<00:02:10.450> really<00:02:11.050> useful<00:02:11.230> stitch<00:02:11.800> for

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
this is a really useful stitch for

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.610 
this is a really useful stitch for
extending<00:02:13.750> bead<00:02:13.990> work<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.580> for<00:02:15.580> starting<00:02:16.330> off

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
extending bead work and for starting off

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.470 
extending bead work and for starting off
stitches<00:02:17.620> like<00:02:18.190> brick<00:02:18.730> stitch<00:02:19.090> and

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
stitches like brick stitch and

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.630 
stitches like brick stitch and
herringbone<00:02:20.410> stitch<00:02:20.770> I'll<00:02:21.700> just<00:02:21.970> do<00:02:22.240> one<00:02:22.480> more

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
herringbone stitch I'll just do one more

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.000 
herringbone stitch I'll just do one more
I'm<00:02:24.640> passing<00:02:25.570> through<00:02:25.780> it<00:02:26.200> again<00:02:26.710> in<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:26.980> same

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
I'm passing through it again in the same

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.270 
I'm passing through it again in the same
direction<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:28.000> make<00:02:28.210> a<00:02:28.240> loop<00:02:28.540> around<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:29.280> and

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
direction to make a loop around it and

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.650
