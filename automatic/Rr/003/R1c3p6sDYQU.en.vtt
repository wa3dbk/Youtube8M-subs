the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette as well
as<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.700> little<00:00:06.029> bit<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.390> comparison<00:00:06.930> between

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
as a little bit of a comparison between

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.960 
as a little bit of a comparison between
it<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.620> naked<00:00:07.770> one<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.429> two<00:00:08.639> so<00:00:08.820> if<00:00:08.910> you

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
it and a naked one and two so if you

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.700 
it and a naked one and two so if you
want<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.210> see<00:00:09.330> all<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.630> let's<00:00:10.170> get<00:00:10.349> into<00:00:10.410> it

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
want to see all that let's get into it

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.770 
want to see all that let's get into it
the<00:00:11.340> first<00:00:11.580> thing<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:11.940> want<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.150> talk<00:00:12.300> about<00:00:12.360> is

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
the first thing I want to talk about is

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.959 
the first thing I want to talk about is
the<00:00:13.080> packaging<00:00:13.559> obviously<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.700> very

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
the packaging obviously it is very

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.820 
the packaging obviously it is very
similar<00:00:15.299> if<00:00:15.599> not<00:00:15.630> identical<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.379> naked<00:00:16.529> to

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
similar if not identical to the naked to

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.140 
similar if not identical to the naked to
the<00:00:16.859> only<00:00:17.220> difference<00:00:17.550> really<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.910> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
the only difference really is the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.760 
the only difference really is the
texture<00:00:18.510> here<00:00:18.779> on<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.960> outside<00:00:19.320> has<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> ripple

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
texture here on the outside has a ripple

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.080 
texture here on the outside has a ripple
effect<00:00:19.949> but<00:00:20.340> for<00:00:20.550> all<00:00:20.609> practical<00:00:20.789> purposes

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
effect but for all practical purposes

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.540 
effect but for all practical purposes
it's<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.080> same<00:00:22.320> hard<00:00:22.680> case<00:00:22.949> with<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> firm

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
it's the same hard case with a firm

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.160 
it's the same hard case with a firm
closure<00:00:23.939> which<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.330> personally<00:00:24.630> like<00:00:24.990> for

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
closure which I personally like for

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.870 
closure which I personally like for
traveling<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.099> hard<00:00:26.310> case<00:00:26.519> means<00:00:26.789> you

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
traveling and the hard case means you

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.070 
traveling and the hard case means you
don't<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> worry<00:00:27.420> about<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.960> getting

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
don't have to worry about it getting

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.589 
don't have to worry about it getting
dirtier<00:00:29.039> must<00:00:29.400> up<00:00:29.640> kind<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.029> like<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.359> did

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
dirtier must up kind of like you did

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.150 
dirtier must up kind of like you did
with<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.140> naked<00:00:31.380> one<00:00:31.529> as<00:00:31.679> well<00:00:31.800> as<00:00:31.920> having<00:00:32.130> a

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
with the naked one as well as having a

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.069 
with the naked one as well as having a
label<00:00:32.340> worn<00:00:33.180> off<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.750> little<00:00:33.960> bit

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
label worn off it's just a little bit

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.660 
label worn off it's just a little bit
more<00:00:34.200> durable<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.800> personally<00:00:35.280> like<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.520> for

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
more durable I personally like it for

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.610 
more durable I personally like it for
travel<00:00:36.030> then<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.600> open<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:36.989> up<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.440> have

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
travel then you open it up and you have

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.680 
travel then you open it up and you have
the<00:00:37.770> same<00:00:38.070> nice<00:00:38.579> big<00:00:38.879> mirror<00:00:39.090> here<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.629> you

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the same nice big mirror here that you

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.319 
the same nice big mirror here that you
didn't<00:00:39.930> make<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.610> actually<00:00:41.610> love<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.180> for

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
didn't make it to I actually love it for

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.940 
didn't make it to I actually love it for
getting<00:00:42.570> ready<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:43.020> really<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.410> practical<00:00:43.920> for

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
getting ready it really is practical for

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.400 
getting ready it really is practical for
that<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.460> then<00:00:44.969> inside<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.690> have<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.140> brush

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
that and then inside you have the brush

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.979 
that and then inside you have the brush
which<00:00:46.800> fits<00:00:47.129> nicely<00:00:47.760> right<00:00:48.180> there<00:00:48.450> now<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
which fits nicely right there now the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.020 
which fits nicely right there now the
brush<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> little<00:00:50.070> bit<00:00:50.190> different<00:00:50.670> from<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
brush is a little bit different from the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.930 
brush is a little bit different from the
Naked<00:00:51.629> 2<00:00:51.870> palette<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.590> flat<00:00:52.920> blending<00:00:53.579> here

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
Naked 2 palette the flat blending here

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.840 
Naked 2 palette the flat blending here
is<00:00:54.149> what<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:55.020> naked<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.500> naked<00:00:56.280> 3<00:00:56.579> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
is what we have naked to naked 3 and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.900 
is what we have naked to naked 3 and
then<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.809> naked<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> naked<00:00:58.559> 3<00:00:59.010> flat<00:00:59.489> shader

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
then the naked to a naked 3 flat shader

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.090 
then the naked to a naked 3 flat shader
brushes<00:01:00.359> are<00:01:00.570> identical<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:01.559> all<00:01:01.739> practical

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
brushes are identical for all practical

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.009 
brushes are identical for all practical
purposes<00:01:02.250> however<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.210> flip<00:01:03.420> them<00:01:03.600> over<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
purposes however you flip them over and

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.570 
purposes however you flip them over and
the<00:01:04.559> blending<00:01:04.890> brushes<00:01:05.070> are<00:01:05.309> slightly

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
the blending brushes are slightly

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.039 
the blending brushes are slightly
different<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.119> find<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> naked<00:01:06.659> too<00:01:06.869> as<00:01:07.020> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
different I find the naked too as a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.410 
different I find the naked too as a
little<00:01:07.290> longer<00:01:07.560> has<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> broader<00:01:08.400> edge<00:01:08.760> which<00:01:09.299> I

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
little longer has a broader edge which I

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.630 
little longer has a broader edge which I
found<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:10.170> little<00:01:10.530> harder<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.130> get<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.280> precise

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
found a little harder to get a precise

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.850 
found a little harder to get a precise
blend<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> crease<00:01:12.479> whereas<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.409> naked<00:01:13.710> 3

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
blend in the crease whereas the naked 3

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.310 
blend in the crease whereas the naked 3
is<00:01:14.159> shorter<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.580> stockier<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.750> person

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
is shorter and stockier and I person

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.350 
is shorter and stockier and I person
like<00:01:16.470> more<00:01:16.710> regardless<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.610> your<00:01:17.670> opinion<00:01:17.790> it

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
like more regardless of your opinion it

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.359 
like more regardless of your opinion it
is<00:01:18.630> different<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.170> do<00:01:19.409> get<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.740> somewhat

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
is different so you do get a somewhat

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.770 
is different so you do get a somewhat
different<00:01:20.520> brush<00:01:20.939> which<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.270> kind<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.750> it

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
different brush which I kind of like it

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.060 
different brush which I kind of like it
adds<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.110> little<00:01:22.200> something<00:01:22.439> new<00:01:22.860> and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
adds a little something new and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.859 
adds a little something new and
different<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.610> palette<00:01:24.060> then<00:01:24.479> moving<00:01:24.689> on

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
different to this palette then moving on

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.300 
different to this palette then moving on
to<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> shadows<00:01:25.470> I'm<00:01:25.650> not<00:01:25.830> going<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.100> talk<00:01:26.250> too

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
to the shadows I'm not going to talk too

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.190 
to the shadows I'm not going to talk too
much<00:01:26.670> about<00:01:26.729> each<00:01:27.180> individual<00:01:27.840> shadow

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
much about each individual shadow

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.420 
much about each individual shadow
because<00:01:28.500> I'm<00:01:28.590> assuming<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.220> probably

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
because I'm assuming this is probably

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.190 
because I'm assuming this is probably
not<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.909> first<00:01:30.090> review<00:01:30.540> you've<00:01:30.750> watched<00:01:30.990> you

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
not the first review you've watched you

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.530 
not the first review you've watched you
probably<00:01:31.560> heard<00:01:32.159> all<00:01:32.490> about<00:01:32.640> each<00:01:33.060> individual

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
probably heard all about each individual

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.800 
probably heard all about each individual
shade<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.290> texture<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.570> finish<00:01:36.570> so

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
shade in the texture and the finish so

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.899 
shade in the texture and the finish so
rather<00:01:37.020> I'm<00:01:37.290> going<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.470> let<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.909> close-ups

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
rather I'm going to let the close-ups

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.640 
rather I'm going to let the close-ups
and<00:01:39.060> swatches<00:01:39.420> do<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.810> talking<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.200> all<00:01:40.439> that

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
and swatches do the talking for all that

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.620 
and swatches do the talking for all that
and<00:01:40.920> instead<00:01:41.340> I'm<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.670> focus<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.150> kind

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
and instead I'm going to focus on kind

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.179 
and instead I'm going to focus on kind
of<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> overall<00:01:43.200> highlights<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.979> lowlights

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
of the overall highlights and lowlights

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.950 
of the overall highlights and lowlights
so<00:01:44.700> as<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.909> can<00:01:45.000> see<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> spectrum<00:01:45.630> here<00:01:45.840> is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
so as you can see the spectrum here is

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.469 
so as you can see the spectrum here is
primarily<00:01:46.350> rose<00:01:46.770> gold<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.340> mom<00:01:47.880> there<00:01:48.270> are

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
primarily rose gold and mom there are

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.389 
primarily rose gold and mom there are
two<00:01:49.229> matte<00:01:49.920> shades<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.670> few<00:01:50.850> satin<00:01:51.240> shades<00:01:51.600> some

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
two matte shades a few satin shades some

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.520 
two matte shades a few satin shades some
metallic<00:01:53.399> shades<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.030> then<00:01:54.299> dust<00:01:54.810> over<00:01:55.229> here

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
metallic shades and then dust over here

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.940 
metallic shades and then dust over here
on<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.920> far<00:01:56.189> your<00:01:56.670> left<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.180> suppose<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.950> kind

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
on the far your left I suppose is kind

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.440 
on the far your left I suppose is kind
of<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.549> aptly<00:01:59.820> named<00:02:00.060> because<00:02:00.090> it

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
of just that it's aptly named because it

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.179 
of just that it's aptly named because it
has<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> very<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.229> one<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.560> micro<00:02:01.829> closer<00:02:02.009> so

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
has a very is one of the micro closer so

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.910 
has a very is one of the micro closer so
it<00:02:02.280> has<00:02:02.399> very<00:02:02.579> dusty<00:02:03.149> sort<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.990> texture<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.799> I

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
it has very dusty sort of texture and I

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.350 
it has very dusty sort of texture and I
have<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.100> say<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.430> my<00:02:05.610> least<00:02:05.820> favorite<00:02:06.240> in

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
have to say it's my least favorite in

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.059 
have to say it's my least favorite in
this<00:02:06.479> palette<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.140> know<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.290> few<00:02:07.680> other<00:02:07.829> people

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
this palette I know a few other people

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.680 
this palette I know a few other people
feel<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> same<00:02:08.340> way<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.910> typically<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.300> don't

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
feel the same way and typically I don't

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.240 
feel the same way and typically I don't
have<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.959> mic

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
have a mic

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.770 
have a mic
glitters<00:02:10.550> in<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.759> naked<00:02:11.030> palettes<00:02:11.390> but<00:02:11.600> this

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
glitters in the naked palettes but this

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.600 
glitters in the naked palettes but this
one<00:02:11.960> in<00:02:12.050> particular<00:02:12.170> is<00:02:12.560> very<00:02:12.740> dusty<00:02:13.400> and

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
one in particular is very dusty and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.790 
one in particular is very dusty and
unless<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.270> apply<00:02:14.510> it<00:02:14.600> wet<00:02:14.990> they're<00:02:15.650> really

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
unless you apply it wet they're really

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.640 
unless you apply it wet they're really
even<00:02:16.400> over<00:02:16.580> a<00:02:16.610> primer<00:02:16.970> it<00:02:17.240> is<00:02:17.480> very<00:02:17.810> sparse<00:02:18.350> and

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
even over a primer it is very sparse and

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.590 
even over a primer it is very sparse and
patchy<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.280> I'm<00:02:19.400> not<00:02:19.610> personally<00:02:20.150> one<00:02:20.330> for

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
patchy and I'm not personally one for

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.270 
patchy and I'm not personally one for
glitter<00:02:20.840> overspray<00:02:21.410> shadow<00:02:21.710> so<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.100> just

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
glitter overspray shadow so it just

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.610 
glitter overspray shadow so it just
didn't<00:02:22.520> do<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:22.640> whole<00:02:22.730> lot<00:02:22.940> for<00:02:23.420> me<00:02:23.570> dust<00:02:24.260> aside

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
didn't do a whole lot for me dust aside

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.560 
didn't do a whole lot for me dust aside
though<00:02:24.890> all<00:02:25.130> of<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.640> other<00:02:25.850> shadows<00:02:26.390> in<00:02:26.480> this

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
though all of the other shadows in this

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.750 
though all of the other shadows in this
palette<00:02:26.959> truly<00:02:27.440> are<00:02:27.650> consistent<00:02:28.280> with<00:02:28.370> the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
palette truly are consistent with the

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.490 
palette truly are consistent with the
quality<00:02:29.600> of<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.780> shadows<00:02:30.110> from<00:02:30.200> both<00:02:30.380> the

naked one and the naked 2 and urban
decay<00:02:32.600> in<00:02:32.780> general<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.230> mean<00:02:33.380> they're<00:02:33.500> really

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
decay in general I mean they're really

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.980 
decay in general I mean they're really
great<00:02:33.950> quality<00:02:34.250> very<00:02:34.670> smooth<00:02:35.030> evenly

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
great quality very smooth evenly

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.410 
great quality very smooth evenly
pigmented<00:02:36.470> apply<00:02:37.070> fantastically<00:02:37.940> blend

smoothly<00:02:38.840> they<00:02:39.200> just<00:02:39.410> they're<00:02:39.800> great<00:02:40.190> for

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
smoothly they just they're great for

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.729 
smoothly they just they're great for
creating<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.880> beautiful<00:02:41.480> looks<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:42.590> think

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
creating a beautiful looks and I think

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.350 
creating a beautiful looks and I think
it's<00:02:42.830> great<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.010> that<00:02:43.250> can<00:02:43.400> be<00:02:43.520> said<00:02:43.790> for<00:02:43.820> all

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
it's great that that can be said for all

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.090 
it's great that that can be said for all
the<00:02:44.570> shadows<00:02:44.930> in<00:02:45.020> this<00:02:45.110> palette<00:02:45.590> regardless

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
the shadows in this palette regardless

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.979 
the shadows in this palette regardless
of<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.310> texture<00:02:46.700> saved<00:02:47.120> us<00:02:47.390> which<00:02:47.630> was<00:02:47.810> of

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
of the texture saved us which was of

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.020 
of the texture saved us which was of
course<00:02:48.020> a<00:02:48.290> little<00:02:48.500> dusty<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.400> only<00:02:49.670> issue<00:02:49.820> I

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
course a little dusty the only issue I

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.340 
course a little dusty the only issue I
had<00:02:50.330> which<00:02:50.510> is<00:02:50.630> kind<00:02:50.840> of<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:50.989> big<00:02:51.170> issue

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
had which is kind of a big issue

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.020 
had which is kind of a big issue
depending<00:02:51.890> on<00:02:52.010> whether<00:02:52.370> this<00:02:52.520> is<00:02:52.580> important

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
depending on whether this is important

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.180 
depending on whether this is important
to<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.239> or<00:02:53.270> not<00:02:53.510> is<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:54.170> lack<00:02:54.380> of<00:02:54.410> contrast

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
to you or not is the lack of contrast

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.400 
to you or not is the lack of contrast
and<00:02:55.430> what<00:02:55.520> I<00:02:55.550> mean<00:02:55.820> by<00:02:55.880> that<00:02:56.060> is<00:02:56.510> in<00:02:56.810> trying<00:02:57.320> to

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
and what I mean by that is in trying to

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.530 
and what I mean by that is in trying to
create<00:02:57.650> different<00:02:58.160> looks<00:02:58.540> experimenting

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540

create different looks experimenting
with<00:02:59.570> all<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.230> looks<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:00.500> could<00:03:00.650> create<00:03:00.830> with

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
with all the looks you could create with

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.140 
with all the looks you could create with
this<00:03:01.130> palette<00:03:01.489> throughout<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.850> week<00:03:02.000> that

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
this palette throughout the week that

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.690 
this palette throughout the week that
I've<00:03:02.270> had<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:02.630> so<00:03:02.810> far<00:03:03.020> I<00:03:03.250> kept<00:03:04.250> trying<00:03:04.520> to

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
I've had it so far I kept trying to

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.670 
I've had it so far I kept trying to
figure<00:03:04.940> out<00:03:05.060> why<00:03:05.360> I<00:03:05.390> could<00:03:05.930> only<00:03:06.080> come<00:03:06.410> up<00:03:06.440> with

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
figure out why I could only come up with

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.310 
figure out why I could only come up with
like<00:03:06.800> two<00:03:07.340> or<00:03:07.640> three<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:08.090> i<00:03:08.150> finally<00:03:08.540> realized

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
like two or three and i finally realized

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.500 
like two or three and i finally realized
because<00:03:09.950> there<00:03:10.370> isn't<00:03:10.790> quite<00:03:11.300> enough

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
because there isn't quite enough

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.750 
because there isn't quite enough
contrast<00:03:12.440> amongst<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.130> shadows<00:03:13.580> you<00:03:13.730> have

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
contrast amongst the shadows you have

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.000 
contrast amongst the shadows you have
this<00:03:14.000> great<00:03:14.060> spectrum<00:03:14.750> obviously<00:03:15.440> going<00:03:15.680> from

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
this great spectrum obviously going from

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.220 
this great spectrum obviously going from
very<00:03:16.220> light<00:03:16.489> over<00:03:16.790> here<00:03:16.820> to<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.510> blackened

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
very light over here to a blackened

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.979 
very light over here to a blackened
purple<00:03:18.709> over<00:03:19.010> here<00:03:19.340> so<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:19.940> have<00:03:20.600> it<00:03:20.720> in<00:03:20.810> that

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
purple over here so you have it in that

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.979 
purple over here so you have it in that
respect<00:03:21.470> but<00:03:21.890> if<00:03:22.040> you<00:03:22.190> look<00:03:22.580> at<00:03:22.790> say<00:03:23.239> naked<00:03:23.600> one

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
respect but if you look at say naked one

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.170 
respect but if you look at say naked one
or<00:03:24.230> make<00:03:24.470> it<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:25.459> can<00:03:25.670> see<00:03:25.880> that<00:03:26.030> there

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
or make it to you can see that there

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.210 
or make it to you can see that there
really<00:03:26.330> isn't<00:03:26.720> that<00:03:26.780> same<00:03:27.170> smooth<00:03:27.590> gradient

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
really isn't that same smooth gradient

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.670 
really isn't that same smooth gradient
instead<00:03:28.640> like<00:03:28.910> with<00:03:29.090> naked<00:03:29.269> too<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:30.410> have

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
instead like with naked too you have

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.710 
instead like with naked too you have
silvers<00:03:31.519> mixed<00:03:31.790> with<00:03:31.910> browns<00:03:32.209> mixed<00:03:32.570> with<00:03:32.660> a

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
little bit of purples and goals there

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.000 
little bit of purples and goals there
just<00:03:34.580> are<00:03:34.730> more<00:03:35.090> color<00:03:35.930> options<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.560> same<00:03:36.860> can

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
just are more color options the same can

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.590 
just are more color options the same can
be<00:03:37.040> said<00:03:37.160> for<00:03:37.549> one<00:03:37.760> where<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.060> have<00:03:38.239> black

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
be said for one where you have black

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.390 
be said for one where you have black

purple tone brown mixed with light
champagne<00:03:43.640> shades<00:03:44.120> really<00:03:45.049> this<00:03:45.440> rose<00:03:45.980> gold

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
champagne shades really this rose gold

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.210 
champagne shades really this rose gold
palette<00:03:47.239> is<00:03:47.390> just<00:03:47.989> that<00:03:48.140> it's<00:03:48.410> a<00:03:48.500> spectrum<00:03:49.040> of

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
palette is just that it's a spectrum of

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.100 
palette is just that it's a spectrum of
rose<00:03:49.459> gold<00:03:49.850> and<00:03:50.060> I<00:03:50.120> find<00:03:50.450> that<00:03:50.570> when<00:03:50.630> you<00:03:50.810> break

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
rose gold and I find that when you break

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.220 
rose gold and I find that when you break
it<00:03:51.260> apart<00:03:51.459> really<00:03:52.459> write<00:03:52.670> down<00:03:52.940> in<00:03:53.209> half<00:03:53.480> these

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
it apart really write down in half these

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.289 
it apart really write down in half these
over<00:03:54.590> here<00:03:54.620> very<00:03:55.040> similar<00:03:55.489> and<00:03:55.519> these<00:03:55.970> over

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
over here very similar and these over

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.819 
over here very similar and these over
here<00:03:56.329> very<00:03:56.720> similar<00:03:57.200> obviously<00:03:57.680> there's

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
here very similar obviously there's

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.110 
here very similar obviously there's
quite<00:03:58.220> a<00:03:58.250> difference<00:03:58.340> when<00:03:58.760> you<00:03:58.820> swatch<00:03:59.090> them

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
quite a difference when you swatch them

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.569 
quite a difference when you swatch them
but<00:03:59.600> I<00:03:59.780> found<00:04:00.200> in<00:04:00.560> application<00:04:01.280> like<00:04:01.459> in

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
but I found in application like in

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.240 
but I found in application like in
practical<00:04:02.060> application<00:04:02.690> they<00:04:03.530> really<00:04:03.860> create

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
practical application they really create

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.220 
practical application they really create
more<00:04:04.850> or<00:04:05.030> less<00:04:05.209> the<00:04:05.420> same<00:04:05.450> look<00:04:05.959> when<00:04:05.989> you

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
more or less the same look when you

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.720 
more or less the same look when you
combine<00:04:06.560> them<00:04:06.709> all<00:04:06.829> together<00:04:07.010> and<00:04:07.459> they<00:04:07.549> get<00:04:07.700> a

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
combine them all together and they get a

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.940 
combine them all together and they get a
little<00:04:07.880> muddy<00:04:08.360> that<00:04:08.959> is<00:04:09.140> the<00:04:09.290> one<00:04:09.470> sort<00:04:09.890> of

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
little muddy that is the one sort of

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.009 
little muddy that is the one sort of
significant<00:04:10.850> downside<00:04:11.120> I<00:04:11.420> found<00:04:11.750> with<00:04:11.840> this

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
significant downside I found with this

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.960 
significant downside I found with this
palette<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:12.680> really<00:04:13.040> tried<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:13.519> work<00:04:13.610> maybe

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
palette and I really tried to work maybe

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.820 
palette and I really tried to work maybe
it<00:04:14.150> is<00:04:14.299> absolutely<00:04:14.870> me

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
it is absolutely me

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.440 
it is absolutely me
not<00:04:15.980> working<00:04:16.280> with<00:04:16.400> these<00:04:16.519> shadows<00:04:16.940> correctly

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
not working with these shadows correctly

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.780 
not working with these shadows correctly
but<00:04:17.720> I<00:04:18.080> just<00:04:18.380> kept<00:04:18.560> finding<00:04:18.799> that<00:04:19.250> regardless

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
but I just kept finding that regardless

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.910 
but I just kept finding that regardless
of<00:04:20.060> which<00:04:20.269> lighter<00:04:20.810> shadows<00:04:21.260> I<00:04:21.380> was<00:04:21.530> using<00:04:21.709> in

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
of which lighter shadows I was using in

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.650 
of which lighter shadows I was using in
which<00:04:22.070> darker<00:04:22.520> shadows<00:04:22.850> I<00:04:22.970> was<00:04:23.120> using<00:04:23.360> I

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
which darker shadows I was using I

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.570 
which darker shadows I was using I
always<00:04:24.290> kind<00:04:24.530> of<00:04:24.650> came<00:04:24.890> up<00:04:24.920> with<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.340> same

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
always kind of came up with the same

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.150 
always kind of came up with the same
sort<00:04:26.180> of<00:04:26.300> look<00:04:26.900> and<00:04:27.200> I'm<00:04:27.590> really<00:04:27.830> hoping<00:04:28.100> that

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
sort of look and I'm really hoping that

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.950 
sort of look and I'm really hoping that
makes<00:04:28.490> sense<00:04:28.760> that<00:04:28.970> doesn't<00:04:29.300> sound<00:04:29.510> like<00:04:29.690> I'm

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
makes sense that doesn't sound like I'm

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.050 
makes sense that doesn't sound like I'm
just<00:04:30.080> in<00:04:30.290> depth<00:04:30.530> it<00:04:30.710> using<00:04:31.160> eyeshadow<00:04:31.400> but

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
just in depth it using eyeshadow but

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.630 
just in depth it using eyeshadow but
regardless<00:04:32.960> that<00:04:33.530> being<00:04:33.770> said<00:04:34.010> it's<00:04:34.400> not<00:04:34.580> a

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
regardless that being said it's not a

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.010 
regardless that being said it's not a
bad<00:04:34.850> palette<00:04:35.180> at<00:04:35.270> all<00:04:35.390> like<00:04:35.600> i<00:04:35.690> said<00:04:35.900> the

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
bad palette at all like i said the

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.840 
bad palette at all like i said the
quality<00:04:36.470> is<00:04:36.560> fantastic<00:04:36.680> and<00:04:37.220> absolutely<00:04:37.640> in

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
quality is fantastic and absolutely in
