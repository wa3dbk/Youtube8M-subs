basic rules and you'll be able to figure

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.209 
basic rules and you'll be able to figure
out<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> lot<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.079> your<00:00:34.230> own<00:00:34.410> some<00:00:35.190> of

that<00:02:02.200> it<00:02:02.380> gets<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.649> fire<00:02:02.829> power<00:02:03.069> of<00:02:03.159> four<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:04.360> a

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
that it gets a fire power of four and a

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.600 
that it gets a fire power of four and a
range<00:02:04.659> of<00:02:04.810> ten<00:02:05.079> you<00:02:05.860> can<00:02:05.890> either<00:02:06.189> fire<00:02:06.429> with

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
range of ten you can either fire with

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.160 
range of ten you can either fire with
the<00:02:06.700> inherent<00:02:07.119> fire<00:02:07.329> power<00:02:07.630> which<00:02:07.869> would<00:02:07.989> be<00:02:08.140> a

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
the inherent fire power which would be a

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.660 
the inherent fire power which would be a
four<00:02:09.329> or<00:02:10.329> with<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.349> combined<00:02:11.799> firepower<00:02:12.040> for

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
four or with the combined firepower for

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.390 
four or with the combined firepower for
four<00:02:13.060> of<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.269> an<00:02:13.360> eight<00:02:13.630> or<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:15.069> could<00:02:15.220> fire

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
four of you an eight or you could fire

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.740 
four of you an eight or you could fire
it<00:02:15.430> just<00:02:15.760> with<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:15.970> machine<00:02:16.299> gun<00:02:16.450> which<00:02:16.599> would

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
it just with the machine gun which would

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.960 
it just with the machine gun which would
be<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.870> four<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.319> save<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:17.829> guy's<00:02:18.040> inherent

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
be a four and save this guy's inherent

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.120 
be a four and save this guy's inherent
fire<00:02:19.150> power<00:02:19.450> which<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:20.530> squad's<00:02:20.829> fire

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
fire power which is the squad's fire

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.490 
fire power which is the squad's fire
power<00:02:21.400> bar<00:02:21.610> itself<00:02:21.940> for<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.180> different<00:02:22.569> target

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
power bar itself for a different target

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.670 
power bar itself for a different target
or<00:02:23.680> for<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.950> different<00:02:24.250> time<00:02:24.459> but<00:02:25.500> I'll<00:02:26.500> explain

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
or for a different time but I'll explain

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.770 
or for a different time but I'll explain
that<00:02:26.920> more<00:02:27.069> we<00:02:27.220> get<00:02:27.400> into<00:02:27.549> the<00:02:27.610> actual<00:02:27.849> firing

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
that more we get into the actual firing

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.530 
that more we get into the actual firing
combat<00:02:29.500> so<00:02:30.250> that's<00:02:30.430> how<00:02:30.549> you<00:02:30.640> attach<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.090> and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
combat so that's how you attach it and

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.319 
combat so that's how you attach it and
this<00:02:31.989> is<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.319> leader<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.790> leader<00:02:33.819> can<00:02:34.209> also

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
this is the leader the leader can also

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.380 
this is the leader the leader can also
be<00:02:34.569> in<00:02:34.690> a<00:02:34.780> sext<00:02:36.000> these<00:02:37.000> are<00:02:37.150> pretty<00:02:37.299> good

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
be in a sext these are pretty good

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.180 
be in a sext these are pretty good
leader<00:02:37.660> here's<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:37.989> negative<00:02:38.290> two<00:02:38.680> which<00:02:39.010> is<00:02:39.160> a

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
leader here's a negative two which is a

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.039 
leader here's a negative two which is a
good<00:02:39.459> thing<00:02:39.489> and<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.819> I<00:02:39.850> saw<00:02:40.120> this<00:02:40.239> attract<00:02:40.660> and

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
good thing and a I saw this attract and

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.620 
good thing and a I saw this attract and
I'll<00:02:41.560> put<00:02:41.769> more<00:02:41.920> about<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.400> later<00:02:42.459> so<00:02:43.060> so

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
I'll put more about that later so so

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.940 
I'll put more about that later so so
we're<00:02:43.750> gonna<00:02:43.810> talk<00:02:43.989> about<00:02:44.139> the<00:02:44.410> rally<00:02:44.620> phase

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
we're gonna talk about the rally phase

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.890 
we're gonna talk about the rally phase
so<00:02:45.819> to<00:02:45.940> demonstrate<00:02:46.420> this<00:02:46.569> we're<00:02:46.810> gonna

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
so to demonstrate this we're gonna

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.650 
so to demonstrate this we're gonna
pretend<00:02:47.319> that<00:02:47.530> this<00:02:47.950> Russian<00:02:48.700> squad<00:02:49.060> is

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
pretend that this Russian squad is

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.699 
pretend that this Russian squad is
broken<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.319> we<00:02:50.440> flip<00:02:50.620> them<00:02:50.799> over<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.930> normally

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
broken so we flip them over and normally

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:54.840 
broken so we flip them over and normally
when<00:02:53.799> something's<00:02:54.190> broken<00:02:54.459> it's<00:02:54.670> going<00:02:54.790> to

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
when something's broken it's going to

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.309 
when something's broken it's going to
have<00:02:55.470> this<00:02:57.030> DM<00:02:58.030> on<00:02:58.239> it<00:02:58.359> now<00:02:58.510> show<00:02:59.079> you<00:02:59.139> what

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
have this DM on it now show you what

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.080 
have this DM on it now show you what
that<00:02:59.350> means<00:02:59.709> all<00:03:00.670> right

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
that means all right

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.620 
that means all right
when<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.540> unit<00:03:01.900> is<00:03:02.049> broken<00:03:02.350> for<00:03:02.799> the<00:03:02.859> first<00:03:02.889> time

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
when a unit is broken for the first time

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.330 
when a unit is broken for the first time
when<00:03:04.630> you<00:03:04.660> get<00:03:04.900> shot<00:03:04.959> at<00:03:05.380> you<00:03:05.950> put<00:03:06.190> one<00:03:06.310> of

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
when you get shot at you put one of

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.849 
when you get shot at you put one of
these<00:03:06.459> DM<00:03:06.910> markers<00:03:07.359> on<00:03:07.510> them

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
these DM markers on them

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.160 
these DM markers on them
desperation<00:03:08.859> morale<00:03:09.340> which<00:03:10.269> has<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.510> +4

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
desperation morale which has a +4

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.650 
desperation morale which has a +4
modifier<00:03:11.739> you<00:03:11.769> can<00:03:12.069> see<00:03:12.160> that<00:03:12.310> +4<00:03:12.849> what<00:03:13.510> that

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
modifier you can see that +4 what that

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.330 
modifier you can see that +4 what that
means<00:03:13.900> is<00:03:14.170> going<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.410> be<00:03:14.470> harder<00:03:14.859> for<00:03:14.889> this<00:03:15.160> guy

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
means is going to be harder for this guy

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.870 
means is going to be harder for this guy
to<00:03:15.810> flip<00:03:16.810> back<00:03:16.989> through<00:03:17.319> his<00:03:17.650> active<00:03:18.370> site<00:03:18.639> or

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
to his combat ready side it's gonna be

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.640 
to his combat ready side it's gonna be
for<00:03:21.819> harder<00:03:22.239> because<00:03:23.139> what<00:03:23.260> we're<00:03:23.349> gonna<00:03:23.440> have

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
for harder because what we're gonna have

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.629 
for harder because what we're gonna have

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
dice to flip him over so right now he

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.479 
dice to flip him over so right now he

has to roll a four or less on two dice

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.270 
has to roll a four or less on two dice
but<00:03:43.329> if<00:03:43.599> he<00:03:43.750> was<00:03:43.900> in<00:03:43.930> this<00:03:44.919> building

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
or in woods he gets plus water he gets

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.640 
or in woods he gets plus water he gets
negative<00:03:50.510> one<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:50.960> the<00:03:50.990> dire<00:03:51.200> role<00:03:51.410> so<00:03:51.620> it

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
negative one to the dire role so it

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.190 
negative one to the dire role so it
would<00:03:51.860> really<00:03:52.040> go<00:03:52.490> up<00:03:52.520> to<00:03:52.790> a<00:03:52.820> five<00:03:53.660> or<00:03:53.840> less<00:03:53.870> so

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
would really go up to a five or less so

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.570 
would really go up to a five or less so
if<00:03:54.290> I<00:03:54.350> rolled<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:54.590> five<00:03:54.860> or<00:03:55.040> less<00:03:55.070> on<00:03:55.280> two<00:03:55.400> dice

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
if I rolled a five or less on two dice

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.490 
if I rolled a five or less on two dice
he<00:03:55.730> would<00:03:55.850> flip<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:56.810> then<00:03:56.960> if<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:57.320> put<00:03:57.470> a

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
he would flip and then if you put a

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.110 
he would flip and then if you put a
leader<00:03:57.800> let's<00:03:58.190> say<00:03:58.280> there's<00:03:58.460> a<00:03:58.550> leader<00:03:58.790> in

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
leader let's say there's a leader in

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.530 
leader let's say there's a leader in
that<00:03:59.180> stack<00:04:00.130> so<00:04:01.130> now<00:04:01.280> he's<00:04:01.640> in<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.880> wood<00:04:02.090> or<00:04:02.360> in

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
that stack so now he's in the wood or in

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.600 
that stack so now he's in the wood or in
the<00:04:02.630> building<00:04:03.020> and<00:04:03.770> he<00:04:03.950> has<00:04:03.980> a<00:04:04.070> leader<00:04:04.340> which

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
the building and he has a leader which

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.100 
the building and he has a leader which
is<00:04:04.760> a<00:04:04.790> negative<00:04:05.240> to<00:04:05.420> the<00:04:05.570> leader<00:04:05.750> guess<00:04:05.960> that

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
is a negative to the leader guess that

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.860 
is a negative to the leader guess that
is<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:08.800> leader<00:04:09.800> gets<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.130> add<00:04:10.280> his<00:04:10.870> his

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
is the leader gets to add his his

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.260 
is the leader gets to add his his
negative<00:04:12.320> two<00:04:12.500> so<00:04:13.070> this<00:04:13.220> guy<00:04:13.490> in<00:04:13.760> order<00:04:14.030> to<00:04:14.150> be

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
negative two so this guy in order to be

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.660 
negative two so this guy in order to be
rallied<00:04:14.630> he<00:04:15.080> would<00:04:15.200> have<00:04:15.320> to<00:04:15.440> roll<00:04:15.650> an<00:04:15.950> eight

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
rallied he would have to roll an eight

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.880 
rallied he would have to roll an eight
but<00:04:17.420> then<00:04:17.570> he<00:04:17.630> has<00:04:17.750> plus<00:04:18.049> four<00:04:18.350> so<00:04:18.560> he's<00:04:18.680> down

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
but then he has plus four so he's down

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.970 
but then he has plus four so he's down
to<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.100> four<00:04:19.750> then<00:04:20.750> he's<00:04:20.900> got<00:04:21.109> minus<00:04:21.500> two<00:04:21.680> which

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
to a four then he's got minus two which

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.700 
to a four then he's got minus two which
is<00:04:22.130> a<00:04:22.160> good<00:04:22.370> thing<00:04:22.400> so<00:04:22.670> he's<00:04:22.820> back<00:04:23.000> up<00:04:23.030> to<00:04:23.270> a<00:04:23.300> six

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
is a good thing so he's back up to a six

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.870 
is a good thing so he's back up to a six
then<00:04:24.710> he's<00:04:24.800> in<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:25.040> building<00:04:25.220> so<00:04:25.550> he's<00:04:25.670> up<00:04:25.760> to

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
then he's in the building so he's up to

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.550 
then he's in the building so he's up to
a<00:04:25.910> seven<00:04:26.360> so<00:04:26.600> he<00:04:26.750> would<00:04:26.870> only<00:04:27.050> need<00:04:27.230> to<00:04:27.380> roll

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
a seven so he would only need to roll

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.160 
a seven so he would only need to roll
seven<00:04:28.040> on<00:04:28.190> two<00:04:28.460> dice<00:04:28.670> for<00:04:28.910> him<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.150> flip<00:04:29.390> and

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
seven on two dice for him to flip and

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.990 
seven on two dice for him to flip and
let's<00:04:30.440> say<00:04:30.560> that<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:31.130> roll<00:04:31.280> your<00:04:31.370> two<00:04:31.520> dice<00:04:31.700> he

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
let's say that you roll your two dice he

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.600 
let's say that you roll your two dice he
rolls<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.390> seven<00:04:32.780> so<00:04:32.930> you'd<00:04:33.080> get<00:04:33.170> rid<00:04:33.320> of<00:04:33.440> this

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
rolls the seven so you'd get rid of this

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.050 
rolls the seven so you'd get rid of this
you<00:04:34.610> flip<00:04:34.820> him<00:04:34.970> back<00:04:35.150> over<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:37.370> he's<00:04:37.520> ready<00:04:38.030> to

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
you flip him back over and he's ready to

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.570 
you flip him back over and he's ready to
go<00:04:38.150> back<00:04:38.390> in<00:04:38.540> the<00:04:38.660> battle<00:04:39.100> now<00:04:40.100> let's<00:04:40.250> say<00:04:40.400> that

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
go back in the battle now let's say that

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.270 
go back in the battle now let's say that
you<00:04:40.730> rolled<00:04:41.000> and<00:04:41.480> you<00:04:41.600> did<00:04:41.780> not<00:04:41.990> succeed<00:04:42.950> in

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.260 

rolling<00:04:46.280> a<00:04:46.400> seven<00:04:46.700> let's<00:04:46.820> say<00:04:46.910> you<00:04:47.000> rolled<00:04:47.210> an

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
rolling a seven let's say you rolled an

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.990 
rolling a seven let's say you rolled an
eight<00:04:47.419> or<00:04:47.660> a<00:04:47.750> nine<00:04:47.870> well<00:04:48.860> in<00:04:48.980> that<00:04:49.100> case<00:04:49.160> what

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
eight or a nine well in that case what

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.940 
eight or a nine well in that case what
you<00:04:50.030> do<00:04:50.360> is<00:04:50.510> you<00:04:50.630> just<00:04:50.660> get<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.110> room<00:04:51.320> every<00:04:51.800> at

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
you do is you just get the room every at

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.260 
you do is you just get the room every at
the<00:04:52.070> end<00:04:52.190> of<00:04:52.280> every<00:04:52.460> rally<00:04:52.610> phase<00:04:52.910> you<00:04:53.060> get<00:04:53.150> to

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
the end of every rally phase you get to

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.500 
the end of every rally phase you get to
remove<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.260> DM<00:04:54.890> so<00:04:55.100> you<00:04:55.190> remove<00:04:55.310> the<00:04:55.430> DM<00:04:55.700> any

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
remove the DM so you remove the DM any

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.800 
remove the DM so you remove the DM any
stays<00:04:56.900> like<00:04:57.200> that<00:04:57.820> until<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:58.970> next<00:04:59.240> turn<00:04:59.419> and

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
stays like that until the next turn and

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.190 
stays like that until the next turn and
on<00:05:00.350> the<00:05:00.440> next<00:05:00.710> turn<00:05:00.860> you<00:05:01.010> need<00:05:01.130> at<00:05:01.280> eight<00:05:02.200> then

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
on the next turn you need at eight then

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.380 
on the next turn you need at eight then
you<00:05:03.320> get<00:05:03.440> the<00:05:03.590> building<00:05:04.010> so<00:05:04.400> you<00:05:04.460> need<00:05:04.880> a<00:05:04.910> nine

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
you get the building so you need a nine

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.960 
you get the building so you need a nine
and<00:05:05.720> then<00:05:06.440> you<00:05:06.560> get<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.919> minus<00:05:07.280> two<00:05:07.430> litre<00:05:07.640> ten

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
and then you get the minus two litre ten

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.490 
and then you get the minus two litre ten
or<00:05:08.090> eleven<00:05:08.390> so<00:05:08.540> really<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:08.960> only<00:05:09.229> number<00:05:09.470> you

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
or eleven so really the only number you

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.190 
or eleven so really the only number you
could<00:05:09.710> roll<00:05:09.919> so<00:05:10.070> he<00:05:10.190> wouldn't<00:05:10.610> fix<00:05:11.000> would<00:05:11.960> be<00:05:12.169> a

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
could roll so he wouldn't fix would be a

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.940 
could roll so he wouldn't fix would be a
twelve<00:05:12.590> so<00:05:13.010> he'll<00:05:13.850> come<00:05:14.000> back<00:05:14.180> to<00:05:14.360> fight<00:05:14.950> now

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
twelve so he'll come back to fight now

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.610 
twelve so he'll come back to fight now
also<00:05:16.340> if<00:05:16.430> you<00:05:16.550> notice<00:05:16.850> on<00:05:17.030> the<00:05:17.180> back<00:05:17.620> this

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
also if you notice on the back this

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.460 
also if you notice on the back this
leader<00:05:18.950> has<00:05:19.220> a<00:05:19.250> morale<00:05:20.150> that's<00:05:20.660> a<00:05:20.780> nine<00:05:21.020> it's

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
leader has a morale that's a nine it's

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.070 
leader has a morale that's a nine it's
pretty<00:05:21.710> high<00:05:21.830> but<00:05:22.370> it's<00:05:22.550> also<00:05:22.729> a<00:05:22.970> squared<00:05:23.780> out

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
pretty high but it's also a squared out

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.740 
pretty high but it's also a squared out
line<00:05:24.380> see<00:05:24.919> where<00:05:25.070> this<00:05:25.190> eight<00:05:25.490> is<00:05:26.330> not<00:05:26.690> a

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
line see where this eight is not a

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.060 
line see where this eight is not a
squared<00:05:27.380> out<00:05:27.530> line<00:05:27.940> in<00:05:29.320> order<00:05:30.320> to<00:05:30.530> try<00:05:31.010> to

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
squared out line in order to try to

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.340 
squared out line in order to try to
rally<00:05:31.490> you<00:05:32.120> either<00:05:32.270> have<00:05:32.630> to<00:05:32.660> have<00:05:32.810> a<00:05:32.960> square

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
rally you either have to have a square

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.740 
rally you either have to have a square
outline<00:05:34.150> or<00:05:35.169> be<00:05:36.169> with<00:05:36.530> a<00:05:36.890> leader<00:05:37.520> so<00:05:38.510> if<00:05:38.600> this

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
outline or be with a leader so if this

he cannot even attempt to rally himself
on<00:05:46.190> the<00:05:46.700> turn<00:05:46.990> all<00:05:47.990> right<00:05:48.229> he<00:05:48.710> can't<00:05:48.950> even

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
on the turn all right he can't even

on the turn all right he can't even

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:58.349 
if it was a leader himself because it's

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:01.339 
if it was a leader himself because it's
boxed<00:05:59.180> because<00:06:00.180> it's<00:06:00.360> boxed<00:06:00.780> it<00:06:00.870> means<00:06:01.050> he<00:06:01.199> can

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
boxed because it's boxed it means he can

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:04.159 
boxed because it's boxed it means he can
try<00:06:01.560> to<00:06:01.620> self<00:06:01.919> rally<00:06:02.599> so<00:06:03.599> you<00:06:03.659> have<00:06:03.870> to<00:06:04.050> be

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
try to self rally so you have to be

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.290 
try to self rally so you have to be
either<00:06:04.259> boxed<00:06:04.830> or<00:06:04.919> with<00:06:05.039> the<00:06:05.129> leader<00:06:05.370> to<00:06:05.849> self

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
either boxed or with the leader to self

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.180 
either boxed or with the leader to self
rally<00:06:06.539> and<00:06:06.900> there's<00:06:07.259> one<00:06:07.409> exception<00:06:07.860> is<00:06:08.009> that

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
rally and there's one exception is that

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.149 
rally and there's one exception is that
the<00:06:08.520> person<00:06:09.360> whose<00:06:09.479> turn<00:06:09.690> it<00:06:09.840> is<00:06:09.960> gets<00:06:10.710> one

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:11.159 
the person whose turn it is gets one

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:12.890 
the person whose turn it is gets one
self<00:06:11.580> rally<00:06:11.879> attempt<00:06:12.240> so<00:06:12.419> and<00:06:12.599> you<00:06:12.659> were<00:06:12.750> on<00:06:12.870> a

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
self rally attempt so and you were on a

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.450 
self rally attempt so and you were on a
map<00:06:13.169> you<00:06:13.440> can<00:06:14.039> choose<00:06:14.310> one<00:06:14.909> unit<00:06:15.349> in<00:06:16.349> Dedic<00:06:17.250> and

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
map you can choose one unit in Dedic and

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.700 
map you can choose one unit in Dedic and
indicate<00:06:18.120> that<00:06:18.300> he's<00:06:18.599> going<00:06:18.750> to<00:06:18.840> try<00:06:19.020> his<00:06:19.139> self

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
indicate that he's going to try his self

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.219 
indicate that he's going to try his self
rally<00:06:20.009> attempt<00:06:20.550> with<00:06:20.789> that<00:06:21.180> unit<00:06:21.599> so<00:06:22.169> you

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
rally attempt with that unit so you

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:25.040 
rally attempt with that unit so you
could<00:06:22.409> still<00:06:22.650> possibly<00:06:22.800> do<00:06:23.310> it<00:06:23.430> so<00:06:23.970> let's<00:06:24.900> say

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
could still possibly do it so let's say

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.800 
could still possibly do it so let's say
that<00:06:25.229> this<00:06:25.409> guy<00:06:25.530> was<00:06:26.009> he<00:06:26.970> wanted<00:06:27.330> to<00:06:27.419> try<00:06:27.629> it<00:06:27.690> on

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810 
that this guy was he wanted to try it on

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.399 
that this guy was he wanted to try it on
him<00:06:27.900> so<00:06:28.139> he<00:06:28.319> would<00:06:28.440> need<00:06:28.650> an<00:06:28.919> 8<00:06:29.449> +<00:06:30.449> 4<00:06:30.750> so<00:06:31.139> it<00:06:31.259> goes

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:31.409 
him so he would need an 8 + 4 so it goes

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:33.709 
him so he would need an 8 + 4 so it goes
down<00:06:31.620> to<00:06:31.680> a<00:06:31.889> 4<00:06:32.280> he's<00:06:33.090> not<00:06:33.300> in<00:06:33.449> the<00:06:33.539> woods

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:33.719 
down to a 4 he's not in the woods

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:35.869 
down to a 4 he's not in the woods
there's<00:06:34.020> no<00:06:34.169> leader<00:06:34.409> and<00:06:35.039> because<00:06:35.550> there's<00:06:35.699> no

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:35.879 
there's no leader and because there's no

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:38.450 
there's no leader and because there's no
leader<00:06:36.210> with<00:06:36.509> him<00:06:36.719> it's<00:06:37.169> also<00:06:37.440> one<00:06:37.919> more<00:06:38.190> plus

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
leader with him it's also one more plus

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.580 
leader with him it's also one more plus
one<00:06:38.759> which<00:06:38.969> is<00:06:39.000> bad<00:06:39.360> so<00:06:39.960> now<00:06:39.990> I<00:06:40.110> said<00:06:40.409> anything

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
one which is bad so now I said anything

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.520 
one which is bad so now I said anything
about<00:06:40.650> 4<00:06:41.009> he'll<00:06:41.610> need<00:06:41.759> a<00:06:41.819> 3<00:06:42.300> so<00:06:43.169> you'll<00:06:43.319> need<00:06:43.409> a

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
about 4 he'll need a 3 so you'll need a

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.249 
about 4 he'll need a 3 so you'll need a
3<00:06:43.979> or<00:06:44.280> less<00:06:44.879> to<00:06:45.210> rally<00:06:45.449> so<00:06:45.690> his<00:06:45.870> odds<00:06:46.050> of

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:46.259 
3 or less to rally so his odds of

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:48.709 
3 or less to rally so his odds of
rallying<00:06:46.680> are<00:06:46.830> very<00:06:47.099> slim<00:06:47.490> but<00:06:48.270> you'll<00:06:48.419> find

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:48.719 
rallying are very slim but you'll find

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:51.439 
rallying are very slim but you'll find
in<00:06:48.900> some<00:06:49.110> games<00:06:49.349> you<00:06:49.560> have<00:06:49.770> to<00:06:49.949> try<00:06:50.159> that<00:06:50.449> it

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:51.449 
in some games you have to try that it

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:52.850 
in some games you have to try that it
could<00:06:51.659> be<00:06:51.780> the<00:06:51.930> difference<00:06:52.349> or<00:06:52.500> not<00:06:52.530> if<00:06:52.740> you

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
could be the difference or not if you

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.490 
could be the difference or not if you
win<00:06:53.009> the<00:06:53.099> scenario
