 is the video presentation of the model x 10 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:10.370
 of the signature gerson is a quadrocopters 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:14.090
 micro small initiation notice the 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.279
 size fits in the palm of the hand 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.130
 ideal to start in anyone what 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.519
 can handle 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.449
 let's see what is included in the box 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.449
 she is very little 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.539
 it comes included of course the 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.340
 quadrocopters complete with their propellers 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.860
 installed 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.579
 and then here we have the radio equipment 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.079
 which is 4 channels 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.739
 Now let's see a little bit of 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.960
 functions comes a usb charger and four 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.480
 spare legs and of course in 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.130
 instruction manual 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.850
 let's quickly see the 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.370
 we have here the ignition 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.440
 we're going to light the quadrocopters what 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.079
 we leave quiet it is essential that 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.400
 still and then we turn on the team of 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.110
 radio 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.390
 once I made those two sounds of 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.280
 confirmation to activate and that 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.890
 work the quadrocopters we have to 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.490
 accelerate and decelerate with this 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.670
 left lever there we can see that 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.620
 is ready to work the controls are 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.360
 with this lever up and towards 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.790
 down a left lever the 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.230
 quadrocopters goes up or down if we move it 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.870
 towards the sides we turn it 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.780
 on its axis it turns on its axis to the 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.480
 left or right and with the lever 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.780
 right we move forward 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.700
 lateral back to the right side 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.270
 to the left and here we have the 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.799
 trinks settings for this command 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.799
 let's see how they fly 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.380
 we can move it in every way we have 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.380
 the four channels 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:05.250
 to turn it off 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.049
 we turned off the fundamental quadrocopters not 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.720
 forget it on if the battery is 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.780
 exhausting completely it can be ruined and 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.390
 we turn off the radio equipment 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.280
 in the next video look at it we are going to 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.200
 teach some other functions that 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.450
 has the radio equipment as per 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.430
 example to do stunts and modify 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.850
 the amount of control and centering of the 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.850
 accelerometers
