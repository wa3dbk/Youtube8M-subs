00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 friends way very much to be again 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.799
 with you today we are going to talk 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.410
 about the thyroid gland we're going to 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.070
 discover its operation a little 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.010
 in a way as always absolutely 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:20.340
 simple then it is written that the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.640
 Thyroid gland is composed of two 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.269
 lobes left and right and the same 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.349
 that binds these lobes is also known 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:35.550
 that the functional unit the unit 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:40.350
 functional of the thyroid gland is 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:44.460
 flame follicle thyroid follicle 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.340
 what is something like a sachet 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.000
 It's like a balloon like a little bag that 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.489
 it has a content inside let's see 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.210
 which then imagine that this is the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.320
 balloon that is surrounded by cells 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.570
 with cells 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.720
 if they are follicle cells guess 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.260
 how are called follicular cells is very 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.260
 easy 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.360
 this balloon this sachet composed by 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.450
 follicular cells has inside 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.720
 in the center a substance called color 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.940
 and later in the class we will 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.369
 study in detail what is this the color 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.100
 of and of the proteins that are there 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.880
 inside and what happens inside the color 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.979
 but for now we are getting to know and 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.909
 familiarize tones with our gland 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.490
 thyroid and your unit works the folic 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.810
 as we know the thyroid gland tells 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.520
 with great irrigation 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.070
 there are a lot of glasses that 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.000
 they cross the gland and the deep one 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.750
 then here I'm going to draw 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.280
 simply in a schematic way 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:09.789
 some little glasses we modify 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.560
 the shape of the ovule and let's do some 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.480
 glasses just as to exemplify 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.000
 the fact that the gland contains 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.540
 great irrigation 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.300
 this irrigation these little capillaries 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.890
 allow the proper functioning of 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.380
 follicular cells has also been 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.990
 determined the presence of some 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.140
 small cells 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.980
 in today's class I will only mention 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.350
 because it requires a special class to 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:50.890
 talk about how they work and are the 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:53.810
 cells cells that produce calcitonin 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.910
 calcitonin 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.300
 then take them into account within the 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.060
 parenchyma of the thyroid gland 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.130
 find the follicles and the cells 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.860
 be of other structures that we are going to 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.980
 study later but in this 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:15.260
 moment I want us to focus on 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:18.880
 our follicular cell because because 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.390
 it turns out that in this place 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:27.319
 follicular cell is where you cook 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:30.739
 where thyroid hormone is prepared 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:34.519
 so today we are going to see how we prepare 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:37.700
 how we cook the thyroid hormone for 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.010
 that works in our organism like this 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.510
 what 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:46.569
 let's increase I'm going to expand this 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.230
 small follicular cell and observe web 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:53.049
 how it works in detail remember what 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.959
 important in this case is not to memorize 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.870
 the processes but understand them and so 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.720
 surely we will not forget 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.620
 to start I want to talk about 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:09.849
 the recipe the recipe the formula with the 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:13.299
 which we prepare the thyroid hormone as 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:17.019
 can see this cell works like a 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:20.139
 restaurant in which it is prepared 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.570
 hormone is packaged 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.540
 thyroid we are going to see in detail how 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.510
 but first I want to tell you in general 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.820
 what is the thyroid hormone recipe 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.510
 what should you do to 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:38.050
 create and form the hormone cymbal 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:42.750
 thyroid first thing they should do is 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.750
 go to the market and get some yogurts 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.790
 they go to the market they get some iodide 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.450
 probably what they will find is 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:55.630
 the salt to table salt now 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:58.990
 It contains a small amount of 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:01.660
 iodide allows us to maintain our 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.840
 constant requirements with that 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:08.440
 small amount of iodide that is 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.280
 administer that is added to salt today 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.920
 in day it is enough to supply 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.670
 our needs then the first 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:22.320
 step to cook thyroid hormone and 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:25.200
 get the iodide the second 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.950
 with this iodide we are going to prepare a 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:33.060
 sauce a very special sauce 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:35.490
 Neapolitan type but it is rusty 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.470
 rusted 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.110
 we are going to see how calm 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.509
 we are just getting in touch 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.180
 with our history 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:49.300
 in third place we are going to prepare the 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:53.110
 clear meat like any good dish 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.990
 to bring a good piece of meat and very 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:00.270
 well prepared then in this case 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.270
 we have our meat preparation 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:09.200
 fourth let's apply the sauce 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.960
 apply the sauce that we have created to that 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.320
 meat then let's ride let's go 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.389
 fill our meat with this sauce 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.380
 rusty very delicious that surely 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.380
 we will stay 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.730
 once applied the meat in the meat 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.160
 sauce well basically we already have 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:33.280
 our plate ready and the only thing that we 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.280
 lack is to serve then in fifth place 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:39.110
 let's serve 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.630
 where this happens in the restaurant and 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.570
 I told them what our restaurant is 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:48.920
 follicular centra and as in all good 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:51.320
 restaurant we need a good chef a 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.650
 good cook that's why I invited 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:57.240
 I want a very special chef 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:00.320
 know at this moment 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:04.040
 his name is Pedro 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:06.610
 our cook Peter later on we 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:09.650
 will accompany and will help us 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:12.200
 cook make the recipe 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.540
 organize it in your kitchen in your 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.970
 restaurant where in the cell 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:21.370
 follicular so very connected I'm going to 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.370
 modify the drawing a bit
