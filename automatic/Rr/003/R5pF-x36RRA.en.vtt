00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
let's show it a little bit over sure

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.039 
let's show it a little bit over sure
this<00:02:43.080> is<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.260> pin<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.769> came<00:02:43.980> with<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:45.049> here

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
this is a pin that it came with and here

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.670 
this is a pin that it came with and here
we<00:02:46.200> go<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.880> this<00:02:47.880> slot<00:02:48.330> can<00:02:48.690> have<00:02:49.019> micro<00:02:49.500> SD

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
we go and this slot can have micro SD

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.680 
we go and this slot can have micro SD
card<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.220> dual<00:02:50.760> sim<00:02:51.030> card<00:02:51.269> in<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.480> same

time they can't come they cannot come in
the<00:02:55.980> same<00:02:56.130> time<00:02:56.459> so<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.760> got<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.060> choose<00:02:57.269> one

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
the same time so you got to choose one

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.970 
the same time so you got to choose one
if<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.780> want<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:58.049> use<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.290> dual<00:02:58.500> sim<00:02:58.680> or<00:02:58.860> the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
if you want to use the dual sim or the

is<00:03:11.580> a<00:03:11.610> fingerprint<00:03:12.180> sensor<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:12.780> like<00:03:13.650> most<00:03:14.160> of

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
is a fingerprint sensor and like most of

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.650 
is a fingerprint sensor and like most of
the<00:03:14.400> fingerprint<00:03:14.790> sensors<00:03:15.060> that<00:03:15.180> we<00:03:15.299> see<00:03:15.510> on

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
the fingerprint sensors that we see on

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.900 
the fingerprint sensors that we see on
the<00:03:15.780> androids<00:03:16.140> smartphones<00:03:17.040> this<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.700> can

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
the androids smartphones this you can

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.150 
the androids smartphones this you can
just<00:03:18.120> hold<00:03:19.019> on<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.590> then<00:03:19.799> it's<00:03:19.950> going<00:03:20.100> to

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
just hold on it and then it's going to

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.099 
just hold on it and then it's going to
recognize<00:03:20.609> your<00:03:20.730> fingerprint<00:03:21.180> unlike<00:03:21.989> the

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
recognize your fingerprint unlike the

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.840 
recognize your fingerprint unlike the
most<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.380> them<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.590> have<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.739> swipe<00:03:23.100> or<00:03:23.430> scroll

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
most of them you have to swipe or scroll

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.420 
most of them you have to swipe or scroll
this<00:03:24.359> is<00:03:24.570> just<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.049> tap<00:03:25.290> just<00:03:25.950> like<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.250> one

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
this is just the tap just like the one

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.150 
this is just the tap just like the one
found<00:03:26.850> on<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.239> iphone<00:03:27.540> 5s<00:03:27.930> or<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.350> six<00:03:28.620> or<00:03:28.829> 6

found on the iphone 5s or the six or 6

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.729 
found on the iphone 5s or the six or 6
plus<00:03:29.400> alright<00:03:30.209> so<00:03:30.510> on<00:03:30.870> there's<00:03:31.049> probably<00:03:31.410> logo

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
plus alright so on there's probably logo

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.400 
plus alright so on there's probably logo

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
side of the phone is actually known to

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.660 
side of the phone is actually known to
be<00:03:36.540> quite<00:03:36.569> similar<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.290> an<00:03:37.620> HTC<00:03:38.130> device<00:03:38.160> this

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
be quite similar to an HTC device this

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.890 
be quite similar to an HTC device this
is<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.819> one<00:03:39.090> m7<00:03:39.329> but<00:03:40.250> HTC<00:03:41.250> One<00:03:41.549> max<00:03:41.910> was<00:03:42.660> known<00:03:42.870> to

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
is a one m7 but HTC One max was known to

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.610 
is a one m7 but HTC One max was known to
be<00:03:43.139> really<00:03:43.590> similar<00:03:44.600> that<00:03:45.600> probably<00:03:46.019> due<00:03:46.590> to

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
be really similar that probably due to

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.550 
be really similar that probably due to
the<00:03:47.250> camera<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.329> line<00:03:48.900> that<00:03:49.139> follows

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
the camera and the line that follows

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.789 
the camera and the line that follows
through<00:03:50.120> here<00:03:51.120> we<00:03:51.269> go<00:03:51.389> and<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:52.260> gets<00:03:52.620> more

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
through here we go and it gets more

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.500 
through here we go and it gets more
similar<00:03:53.160> in<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.340> one<00:03:53.489> max<00:03:53.670> but<00:03:53.910> we<00:03:54.030> only<00:03:54.239> have

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
similar in the one max but we only have

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.930 
similar in the one max but we only have
the<00:03:54.600> one<00:03:54.750> m7<00:03:55.019> for<00:03:55.500> now<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:55.980> that's<00:03:56.280> what<00:03:56.670> we're

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
the one m7 for now so that's what we're

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.110 
the one m7 for now so that's what we're
going<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.150> have<00:03:57.180> so<00:03:57.810> this<00:03:58.049> is<00:03:58.319> the<00:03:58.590> polymn<00:03:59.280> 87

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
going to have so this is the polymn 87
