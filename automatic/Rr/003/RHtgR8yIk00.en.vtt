00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
handled these is

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.040 
handled these is
that<00:01:58.410> they<00:01:58.590> feel<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:59.340> little<00:01:59.910> thinner<00:02:00.330> or<00:02:01.260> later

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
that they feel a little thinner or later

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.410 
that they feel a little thinner or later
they<00:02:04.050> just<00:02:04.350> don't<00:02:04.620> have<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:05.070> same<00:02:05.430> feel<00:02:05.880> as<00:02:06.210> a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
they just don't have that same feel as a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.719 
they just don't have that same feel as a
regular<00:02:06.870> Lego<00:02:07.080> minifigure<00:02:07.500> maybe<00:02:08.430> it's<00:02:08.610> just

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
regular Lego minifigure maybe it's just

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.450 
regular Lego minifigure maybe it's just
me<00:02:09.210> but<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:10.020> before<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.649> even<00:02:10.770> notice<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.340> they

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460

recent pirate themes i'm assuming

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.110 
recent pirate themes i'm assuming
looking<00:04:01.049> at<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.260> torso<00:04:01.680> because<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.250> collected

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
looking at the torso because I collected

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.900 
looking at the torso because I collected
pirates<00:04:03.540> from<00:04:03.690> 1989<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.830> year<00:04:04.980> 2000<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:05.849> I

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
pirates from 1989 to the year 2000 and I

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.930 
pirates from 1989 to the year 2000 and I
never<00:04:06.120> remember<00:04:06.330> seeing<00:04:06.959> a<00:04:07.050> parrot<00:04:07.349> like<00:04:07.500> this
