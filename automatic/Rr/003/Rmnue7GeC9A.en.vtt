what's<00:03:47.049> also<00:03:47.230> important<00:03:47.769> to<00:03:47.920> is<00:03:48.430> we<00:03:48.640> can<00:03:48.790> bust

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
what's also important to is we can bust

this<00:03:49.120> run<00:03:49.329> outside<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:50.109> full-back<00:03:50.410> dive<00:03:50.620> has

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
this run outside the full-back dive has

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.670 
this run outside the full-back dive has
the<00:03:51.010> ability<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.340> with<00:03:51.850> layoffs<00:03:52.660> turbo<00:03:53.230> you

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
the ability to with layoffs turbo you

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.039 
the ability to with layoffs turbo you
can<00:03:53.920> cut<00:03:54.579> quickly<00:03:55.180> to<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.390> right<00:03:55.600> and<00:03:55.870> get

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
can cut quickly to the right and get

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.960 
can cut quickly to the right and get
outside<00:03:56.500> so<00:03:56.739> here<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:57.010> defense<00:03:57.340> is<00:03:57.459> stacking

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
outside so here the defense is stacking
