 I'm making some rubber. 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:01.509
 What happened to the code bit ? 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.899

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.899
 Well 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:14.600
 As everyone knows, LG Electronics is now behind the iPhone 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:20.180
 Four buttons are physical buttons one side has about eopguyo button beoleojyeo 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:23.990
 Unlike the Galaxy S6, which was made with the all-in-one experience, the detachable battery 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.810
 So built-in case 0 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.810
 I can only ship batteries for a while. 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.840

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:57.230
 Indeyo black color negative feeling than you think 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:00.560
 Well, you know a little seed. 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.560
 It should be hard . 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.280
 Switching between them 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:12.620
 Servant this thing's really what a family looks like this 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.150
 What gives one kind of fly in the ointment there is bosim you know, is now printing 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.510
 there is 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.090
 g4 I made it to me 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.409
 Oh, think about it. 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.870
 Uh, so it's kinda like this. 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:32.069
 What do something Uncle Pin 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:38.549
 4 The outer surface is a number smaller than q 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:41.270
 This itguyo thickness control is in any way ah If this is before that 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:46.430
 3,000 of performances 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:52.910
 It has a share of about'm looking at this slightly out the words 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:57.770
 Was about what to inde yijeongdo screen is something that I do not seem right window 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:01.730
 So what did it with whipped much sense because I have water 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:04.520
 Since finding a fixed position, the screen itself barely swiwodo 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.420
 I could get some sense of the immersion. 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.010
 As previously written, even when warped in time to see yoreotge So what do we see 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:15.350
 I had a good feeling. 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:19.850
 Lotto I do not think that's what I was looking for. So the thinnest part 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:22.520
 I went side-by-side. Thin part entry 3 days and j now thick 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.670
 About 9.8 mi in the middle 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:31.130
 The weight is 155g. 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:34.610
 So I guess I'll have to tell you that it's a little weird . 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:39.950
 I got a lot of women talking about having a lot . 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:46.090
 UG 500 Process Qualcomm Snap Dragon 805 is now ng battlefield 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:49.190
 When Qualcomm, for a total of 18 months ago, talk was already awkward are 8 gongpa 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:53.690
 The mount is expanded. 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.629
 So how do you do it so much now that the 8-day gold issue is too big 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.509
 In the wind 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:02.710
 I think I got a little bad timing. 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:07.689
 I was just going back well before that . 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.889
 808've even that did not seem to be such a big issue. What water 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:13.930
 I have a feeling 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:17.169
 So once the display shows its lg display according to the content store, 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.349
 There's an I-pass panel to talk to. 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.580
 Especially the phd is saint so 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:26.500
 U 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:29.229
 The number of pixels per inch bpi 538 Can I recommendation 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.400
 Oh, now I'm sleeping. 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:39.580
 A human body that can be recognized by a human being is required 300 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:41.320
 I told you it was Zoom, and it's only in LG. 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.220
 now 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:47.740
 Eopeun products not when's protocol was as g pro round even up to four times 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:53.199
 What talk this way it is possible haeteotneunde 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:55.990
 I think you should see that the level has already jumped already. 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:06:01.000
 The rear 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:05.830
 I do not know what to do. 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.789
 Then internally dslr off mail to any user experience 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:12.880
 I have some things like a professional camera board. 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:19.900
 I briefly explained something . 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:25.530
 I try to use more products later, and I do not know much about it 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.530
 Well, let's look at it for that ux look good
