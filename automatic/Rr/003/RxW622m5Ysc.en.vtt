and<00:01:25.200> we're<00:01:25.440> done<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.520> most<00:01:26.670> common<00:01:27.060> thing

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
and we're done so the most common thing

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.670 
and we're done so the most common thing
you<00:01:27.270> probably<00:01:27.510> want<00:01:27.660> to<00:01:27.690> do<00:01:27.840> right<00:01:28.440> there<00:01:28.620> in

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
you probably want to do right there in

you probably want to do right there in
the<00:01:28.770> front<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.100> screen<00:01:29.370> is<00:01:30.270> either<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.660> set

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
the front of the screen is either to set

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.240 
the front of the screen is either to set
somebody's<00:01:31.110> password<00:01:31.530> or<00:01:31.680> search<00:01:31.890> for<00:01:32.160> them

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
somebody's password or search for them

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.040 
somebody's password or search for them
and<00:01:32.310> then<00:01:32.520> set<00:01:32.790> their<00:01:32.940> password<00:01:33.360> very<00:01:33.810> very

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
and then set their password very very

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.340 
and then set their password very very
simple<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.380> do<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:36.600> search<00:01:36.780> capabilities

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
simple to do and the search capabilities

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.980 
simple to do and the search capabilities
are<00:01:37.500> very<00:01:37.620> powerful<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.520> if<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.180> was<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> user<00:01:39.690> in

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
are very powerful so if I was a user in

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.050 
are very powerful so if I was a user in
Redmond<00:01:40.800> I<00:01:40.890> might<00:01:41.130> often<00:01:41.310> want<00:01:41.580> to<00:01:41.610> search<00:01:41.850> all

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060

Redmond I might often want to search all
the<00:01:42.090> users<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:42.900> in<00:01:43.020> Redmond<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:44.100> I

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the users that I have in Redmond so I

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.900 
the users that I have in Redmond so I
would<00:01:44.370> just<00:01:44.400> type<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.760> Redmond<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:45.180> here

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910

search<00:01:48.980> their<00:01:49.980> MOU<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:52.400> could<00:01:53.400> have<00:01:53.490> actually

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
search their MOU I could have actually

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.740 
search their MOU I could have actually
saved<00:01:54.150> that<00:01:54.360> query<00:01:54.630> from<00:01:54.990> here<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:56.450> if<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.600> had

saved<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.229> then<00:02:05.720> then<00:02:06.720> I<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:07.020> run<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.260> again

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
saved it then then I can run it again

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.730 
saved it then then I can run it again
