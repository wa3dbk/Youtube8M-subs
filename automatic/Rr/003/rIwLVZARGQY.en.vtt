00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:18.150
 the screening 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:22.450
 we need to take a dazzling measure 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.689
 just wash off the part and that way 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:30.029
 we are going to multiply by two the ones of 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.029
 lunchbox will be zero 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:44.340
 Let's do something similar to a 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:47.340
 rectangle angle later we go 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.340
 increase 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:01:32.740
 centering the first part two 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:38.470
 inches of shoulder and two months 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:41.710
 to measure dolls branches to expand 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:53.680
 everything and sleeve and in this case 11 centimeters 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:57.430
 by day 11 a small curve that will not 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:05.970
 allow to integrate of clay to see its 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:08.970
 sister in triangle shape brother in 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.970
 Athens 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.040
 we are looking for a corner 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:27.900
 and we take in the measure of tone and stumbles 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.880
 from London to a washing aggregating 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.440
 three or four centimeters 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:38.450
 this measure we will delay athena 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:44.640
 we gained from the blur and later 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:48.150
 we started rolling and marking the triangle 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.650
 what is the result this result keeps 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.470
 a triangle and once the center in 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.680
 sent bullet to be a cut of 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:13.140
 approximately another centimeter 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:26.690
 in vertex so that this is the vertex of 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:26.690
 wool on the head it would be clay 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:53.780
 respond to a script so please understand 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.780
 two sleeves 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:07.329
 the robe he mantles and he kisses
