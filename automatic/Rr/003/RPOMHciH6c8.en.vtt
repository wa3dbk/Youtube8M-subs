00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.480
 hello today we will do to our 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.429
 traditional dishes of the meeting that 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.250
 is an accompaniment we will do a year 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.590
 Voice potatoes not revisit this 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.100
 I'm going to do a little pilaf way 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:23.699
 so the traditional relationship is 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.849
 turmeric rice and sweet potatoes 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.429
 cooked in the pot on the fire there I 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.199
 go add onions a little bit 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.670
 of time a little garlic that is optional 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:42.140
 garlic and I go and bake 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:46.320
 so for that we need some rice 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.659
 it takes about 45 to 50 grams 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.720
 per person 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:55.710
 potatoes onions from 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:01.379
 turmeric a little bit of thyme salt from 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:05.850
 oil pepper so the saq latif and 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:09.030
 see the value first step of the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.660
 cooking we will precook the potatoes five 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.660
 minutes in boiling water 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.580
 after 5 to 8 minutes of cooking my 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.560
 little potatoes are cooked I have them 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.090
 listened cooled a little bit with water 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.140
 cold 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.119
 they are still a little firm 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.610
 it's normal because they will finish 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:38.229
 to cook after clovis we will go to the 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.600

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:45.070
 pot to heat with two draws when 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.569

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:44.390

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.200
 I could add olive oil 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.260
 but at the meeting the olive oil 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:31.710
 we do not use much so I put 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:34.650
