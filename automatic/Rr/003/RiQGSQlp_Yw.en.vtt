00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.110
 hello friends with you tiberian 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.570
 and this is the 49th edition heading master for all 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.820
 tanks heading in which i get a mark 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.300
 klassnost master on technique name 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.529
 which you specify in the comments 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.660
 I remind you that in the description of this video 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.000
 There is a list of tanks that have already been 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.640
 received a mark of class master therefore 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.079
 before you offer your candidate 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.539
 please look at this list 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.850
 Well, today especially for you and me 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:39.339
 I'll hurt a bit on British hard 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.739
 tank level six Churchill 7 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.929
 for starters let's see what is 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.449
 cause of suffering for me personally this 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:48.789
 Churchill's dynamics though no what I'm saying 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.530
 the dynamics of the british just great straight 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.690
 like a mouse he is very quickly gaining 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.120
 its maximum speed and can it 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.219
 maintain the problem is that this 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.319
 maximum speed is only 20 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.659
 kilometers per hour and how do you understand it 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:03.309
 imposes certain restrictions on 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.620
 movement on the map 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.660
 so at the beginning of the battle you have to 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.790
 make a choice either go for some 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.190
 direction and fight there until victory 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.350
 well, or to drain or stay on 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.570
 base and defit artillery because 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.790
 opportunities to return on or change 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.820
 Unfortunately, you have no referral 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.860
 low maximum speed on the idea when 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.850
 low maximum speed should be 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.980
 good armor 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.020
 to say truth teacher by the standards 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.780
 classmates really good 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.080
 booking lower armorliner 140 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.910
 millimeters upper plank and forehead towers 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.700
 152a sides of the turret and hull have 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.100
 booking 95 millimeters that is yes 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.530
 quite good booking for heavy 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.220
 tank level six is another 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.240
 who can tank such indicators 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.820
 for example tanks of the fourth and fifth 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.800
 level in the forehead will not punch also 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.510
 medium tanks of the sixth level will be 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.850
 have some problems with 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.470
 breaking through but they have the opportunity of you 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.630
 twist due to low mobility 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.970
 british and have the ability to charge 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.880
 premium shells and already they have enough 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.889
 confidently break through classmates 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.749
 as well as the hulls punch through without 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:13.020
 problems of course if they do not shoot where 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:15.390
 horrible but the tower still somehow 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.430
 keeps hitting but as soon as you meet 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.010
 opponent of the seventh level or do not let 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.530
 god 8 is something about armor you can absolutely 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.720
 forget and more often or have one 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.790
 unpleasant feature shooting him right 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.920
 in the caterpillar you can not only with a beat 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.740
 but also cause damage because 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.660
 tracks is part of the body in 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.000
 you can end up booking this tank 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.790
 say the following in the top it is more or less 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.760
 tanks and in the middle or bottom of the list he 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.870
 turtle without a shell further let's 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.580
 let's talk about the instrument 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.280
 can she please with anything 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.980
 penetration of an armor-piercing shell almost 150 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.680
 millimeters subcaliber 208 single 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.180
 damage is 140 units such 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.980
 armor penetration rates 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.990
 and one-time damage in my opinion more 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.080
 would fit the average tank rather than 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.610
 heavy but let's look further 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.280
 accuracy of the guns a good spread of 100 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.800
 036 meters information is comfortable and 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.570
 two point three seconds and very 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.630
 high rate of fire and rammer 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.580
 gun recharges in 4 seconds 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.010
 vertical alignment angles are absolutely not 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.070
 please drop guns only 4 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.080
 degrees and rises to 12 in the end 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.910
 Churchill's gun is quite specific and 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.400
 bad vertical angles are not 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.530
 the best break through and one-time damage but 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.980
 but good accuracy and high damage 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.959
 a minute 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.880
 to implement which will only in 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.130
 the case when you are in the top 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.780
 list there is a possibility more or less 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.280
 tank while staying in 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.620
 recharge opponent 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.450
 getting into fights with machine tools of the seventh and 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.060
 eighth level mode is activated 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.280
 oppression and the british starts to suffer 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.320
 as I said a little earlier in such conditions 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.810
 this tank becomes a turtle without 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.430
 shell it creeps very slowly and when 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.950
 This has no protection against 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.800
 Opponents are somehow games 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.900
 there is a possibility but do not forget that 150 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.790
 enough millimeters 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.530
 just to punch some 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.959
 the words armored tanks of the seventh 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.060
 level in most cases will have 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.160
 use premium shells either 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.709
 somehow enter opponents in 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.690
 board and stern that turns out very rarely 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.940
 due to low maximum speed 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.160
 Well, in conclusion to somehow 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.020
 brighten up the life of this British should 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.370
 to mention that his review is the best among 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.669
 heavy tanks on 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.979
 the sixth level it is 360 meters i 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.900
 I advise you to carry with you a stereo in 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:34.110
 In some situations, it can be very 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.699
 very useful but now the most 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.040
 time to talk about how well 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.260
 suffer master on churchill for this 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.660
 need to get about 1200 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.850
 pure experience I think you guessed it 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.100
 what is the easiest thing to do when 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.199
 you are in the top of the list again 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.300
 the opportunity to realize 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.220
 high damage per minute and armor piercing 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.650
 shells generally enough to normally 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.199
 damage the enemy 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.729
 if you are in greenhouse conditions 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:01.830
 I recommend to risk and crawl on the most 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.960
 popular direction hoping 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.210
 that there will be a large number of red 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.130
 Tanchiki you can on them well 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.199
 do some shooting but try not to 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.330
 substitute for enemy pt and 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.800
 artillery because armor is against them 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.260
 Churchill is unlikely to help 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.410
 I have the very first fight on this tank 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.060
 was just the same in the top on the steppe map 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.370
 unexpectedly for myself, I decided to go on 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.800
 direction where usually the butts are 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.870
 tanks without any problems managed there 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.000
 all shoot after which I crawled to 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.150
 enemy base shot a little there and 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.039
 surprisingly for it gave the master something 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.380
 I did not think so here somehow all 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.690
 too easy and simple and decided to roll 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.880
 I don't need a few more fights 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.190
 say that these fights were with sevens and 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.940
 eights and they are filled with pain and 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.460
 suffering 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.200
 but sometimes it happens that wbr 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.330
 turns to you not astern 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.150
 and even in such conditions you can get 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.190
 masters in this al-Khaluf battle which 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.320
 you are watching me very much now 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.599
 lucky that while I crawled to the place where 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.000
 usually butting heavy tanks none of 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:04.820
 teams did not merge as a result of me 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.400
 managed to reach your destination 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:10.289
 exchange strength points with stock 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.930
 t69 and then teleport behind 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.880
 back and soo third in this way because 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.590
 the fact that the damage was mostly carried 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.130
 tanks that were superior to mine 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.440
 level 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.020
 gave additional experience it in the end 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.030
 enough for getting a master so 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.550
 friends even being at the bottom of the list 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.090
 don't get upset with proper 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.460
 of luck 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.710
 and in such conditions, you can get achivku 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.890
 believe in miracles and be with you 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.330
 master on this for today all all 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.009
 Thanks for attention 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.870
 they were now on subscribe to 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:42.300
 the channel is fan and do not forget to look 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:45.710
 on my channel there are also many different 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.710
 masters to new meetings
