looked fine I had no issues with it and
because<00:02:10.090> of<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.300> fact<00:02:10.509> that<00:02:10.599> she's<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:10.840> model<00:02:11.110> I

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
because of the fact that she's a model I

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.500 
because of the fact that she's a model I
believe<00:02:11.739> that<00:02:12.430> she<00:02:12.640> gained<00:02:12.879> far<00:02:13.300> more

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
believe that she gained far more

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.600 
believe that she gained far more
publicity<00:02:14.080> because<00:02:14.560> of<00:02:14.800> what<00:02:15.040> she<00:02:15.220> wore<00:02:15.400> and

publicity because of what she wore and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.949 
publicity because of what she wore and

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
people were tuning in and because she

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.250

getting that much more publicity then

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.110 
getting that much more publicity then
