00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.690 

okay<00:00:05.330> hi<00:00:05.480> guys<00:00:05.689> so<00:00:06.050> I<00:00:06.260> decided<00:00:06.979> to<00:00:07.160> come<00:00:07.460> today

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
okay hi guys so I decided to come today

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.940 
okay hi guys so I decided to come today
and<00:00:08.059> actually<00:00:08.510> show<00:00:09.170> you<00:00:09.200> the<00:00:09.440> install<00:00:09.800> and

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
and actually show you the install and

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.039 
and actually show you the install and
this<00:00:10.639> is<00:00:10.790> what<00:00:10.940> it<00:00:11.030> looks<00:00:11.240> like<00:00:12.099> and<00:00:13.749> I<00:00:14.749> think

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
this is what it looks like and I think

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.240 
this is what it looks like and I think
the<00:00:15.289> top<00:00:15.769> layer<00:00:16.010> is<00:00:16.039> from<00:00:16.880> 14<00:00:17.840> to<00:00:17.870> 16<00:00:18.410> and<00:00:18.770> then

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
the top layer is from 14 to 16 and then

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.550 
the top layer is from 14 to 16 and then
from<00:00:19.670> down<00:00:19.970> there<00:00:20.240> it<00:00:20.510> is<00:00:20.870> from<00:00:22.030> 22<00:00:23.030> to<00:00:23.060> 24<00:00:23.990> so

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
from down there it is from 22 to 24 so

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.440 
from down there it is from 22 to 24 so
let<00:00:24.740> me<00:00:24.770> stand<00:00:25.040> up<00:00:25.130> so<00:00:25.340> you<00:00:25.400> can<00:00:25.850> get<00:00:26.000> like<00:00:26.180> a

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
or did anything to it because I didn't

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.630

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
so the only thing I usually do is just

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.350 
so the only thing I usually do is just
wash<00:01:12.920> it<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.369> then<00:01:13.579> it<00:01:13.670> ends<00:01:13.880> up<00:01:14.000> coming<00:01:14.270> out

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
wash it and then it ends up coming out

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.690 
wash it and then it ends up coming out
like<00:01:14.509> this

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.840

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
didn't buy enough because i think that

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.710 
didn't buy enough because i think that
the<00:01:46.530> top<00:01:47.530> is<00:01:47.830> not<00:01:48.310> as<00:01:48.520> thick<00:01:48.850> as<00:01:49.000> i<00:01:49.180> like<00:01:49.420> it<00:01:49.600> and

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
not as big as I like it I go over here I

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.380 
not as big as I like it I go over here I
usually<00:01:54.460> like<00:01:54.550> I<00:01:54.670> think<00:01:54.910> it<00:01:55.000> should<00:01:55.120> have<00:01:55.270> been

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
usually like I think it should have been

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.480 
usually like I think it should have been
more<00:01:55.600> fuller<00:01:55.900> but<00:01:56.170> that<00:01:56.260> wasn't<00:01:56.620> my<00:01:56.890> mistake

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
more fuller but that wasn't my mistake

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.190 
more fuller but that wasn't my mistake
because<00:01:57.790> I<00:01:57.940> thought<00:01:58.120> since<00:01:58.270> I<00:01:58.390> have<00:01:58.570> a<00:01:58.750> small

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
because I thought since I have a small

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.280 
because I thought since I have a small
head<00:01:59.470> that<00:02:00.070> I<00:02:00.400> had<00:02:01.360> more<00:02:01.570> than<00:02:01.600> enough<00:02:01.780> it

head that I had more than enough it

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.660 
head that I had more than enough it
wouldn't<00:02:02.620> matter<00:02:02.800> so<00:02:03.780> yeah<00:02:04.780> I<00:02:04.990> should<00:02:05.290> have

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
wouldn't matter so yeah I should have

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.730

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.130 
wanted to get now there was um one
length<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.240> saw<00:02:37.420> which<00:02:37.660> was<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:37.900> think<00:02:37.930> the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
length that I saw which was I think the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.650 
length that I saw which was I think the
22<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.709> 24<00:02:39.130> which<00:02:39.280> is<00:02:39.400> very<00:02:39.640> similar<00:02:39.820> but<00:02:40.240> it

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
22 to 24 which is very similar but it

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.500 
22 to 24 which is very similar but it
was<00:02:40.780> way<00:02:41.140> thicker<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.920> way<00:02:42.160> fuller<00:02:42.550> but<00:02:43.209> it

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
was way thicker and way fuller but it

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.540 
was way thicker and way fuller but it
was<00:02:43.900> too<00:02:44.140> expensive<00:02:44.260> so<00:02:44.709> I<00:02:44.890> was<00:02:45.250> just<00:02:45.280> like<00:02:45.430> I

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
was too expensive so I was just like I

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.190 
was too expensive so I was just like I
can't<00:02:46.060> afford<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:46.720> I'm<00:02:46.870> just<00:02:47.019> going<00:02:47.140> to

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
can't afford that so I'm just going to

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.100 
can't afford that so I'm just going to
get<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.980> know<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.340> length<00:02:48.550> where<00:02:49.110> same

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
get you know the length where same

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.009 
get you know the length where same
length<00:02:50.410> but<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.950> was<00:02:51.250> actually<00:02:51.489> a<00:02:52.120> little<00:02:52.780> bit

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
length but it was actually a little bit

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.050 
length but it was actually a little bit
thinner<00:02:53.230> which<00:02:53.560> is<00:02:53.709> this<00:02:53.860> one<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.250> it

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
thinner which is this one and it

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.970 
thinner which is this one and it
actually<00:02:55.239> looks<00:02:55.600> exactly<00:02:55.989> like<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:58.330> picture

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
actually looks exactly like the picture

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.560

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
yeah this is pretty much it so you can

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:41.230 
yeah this is pretty much it so you can
see<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.630> bag<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.530> how<00:03:30.459> long<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.820> comes

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.770 

alrighty<00:03:42.240> so<00:03:43.110> um<00:03:43.700> that's<00:03:44.700> pretty<00:03:45.030> much<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.390> and

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
alrighty so um that's pretty much it and

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.130 
alrighty so um that's pretty much it and
usually<00:03:46.170> I<00:03:46.980> do<00:03:47.400> I<00:03:47.850> did<00:03:48.060> get<00:03:48.210> a<00:03:48.240> diffuser<00:03:48.720> just

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
usually I do I did get a diffuser just

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.660 
usually I do I did get a diffuser just
so<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.380> can<00:03:49.530> make<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.860> curls<00:03:50.160> pop<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.430> little

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
so it can make the curls pop a little

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.610 
so it can make the curls pop a little
bit<00:03:50.880> more<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.240> so<00:03:51.420> could<00:03:51.660> be<00:03:51.810> like<00:03:52.020> bigger

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
bit more and so could be like bigger

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.880 
bit more and so could be like bigger
because<00:03:52.980> I<00:03:53.160> want<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.400> bigger<00:03:53.640> so<00:03:54.630> I<00:03:54.660> do<00:03:54.810> i<00:03:55.410> do

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
because I want it bigger so I do i do

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:03.550
