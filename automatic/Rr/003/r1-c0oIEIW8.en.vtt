00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
an estimate on repairs based on the

particular property now the roof and
things<00:04:12.290> like<00:04:12.440> that<00:04:12.500> major<00:04:12.950> you<00:04:13.220> you<00:04:13.610> would

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
things like that major you you would

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.490 
things like that major you you would
have<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:14.000> get<00:04:14.090> father<00:04:14.360> there's<00:04:14.989> an<00:04:15.110> entire

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
have to get father there's an entire

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.320 
have to get father there's an entire
house<00:04:15.800> around<00:04:16.280> whatever<00:04:16.640> which<00:04:16.970> that's<00:04:17.090> not

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
house around whatever which that's not

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.479 
house around whatever which that's not
difficult<00:04:17.630> but<00:04:18.109> they'll<00:04:18.830> give<00:04:19.130> you<00:04:19.250> an<00:04:19.340> idea

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
difficult but they'll give you an idea

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.380 
difficult but they'll give you an idea
what<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.180> actual<00:04:20.480> material<00:04:21.940> total<00:04:22.940> or<00:04:23.090> cost

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
what the actual material total or cost

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.960 
what the actual material total or cost
will<00:04:23.690> be<00:04:24.160> only<00:04:25.160> thing<00:04:25.340> you<00:04:25.430> have<00:04:25.520> to<00:04:25.610> do<00:04:25.760> from

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
will be only thing you have to do from

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.090 
will be only thing you have to do from
there<00:04:26.150> is<00:04:26.180> double<00:04:26.660> it<00:04:26.780> and<00:04:26.979> that's

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
there is double it and that's

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.610 
there is double it and that's
going<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:28.370> give<00:04:28.640> you<00:04:28.850> an<00:04:29.120> estimated<00:04:29.660> amount<00:04:30.440> of

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
going to give you an estimated amount of

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.440 
going to give you an estimated amount of
repairs<00:04:30.980> and<00:04:31.160> this<00:04:31.460> is<00:04:31.580> just<00:04:31.820> an<00:04:31.910> estimation

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
repairs and this is just an estimation

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.480 
repairs and this is just an estimation
now<00:04:33.290> once<00:04:33.470> you<00:04:33.560> get<00:04:33.650> into<00:04:33.800> heating<00:04:34.130> there<00:04:34.310> and

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
now once you get into heating there and

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.830 
now once you get into heating there and
things<00:04:34.670> like<00:04:34.820> that<00:04:34.880> then<00:04:35.420> you<00:04:35.570> know<00:04:35.690> they<00:04:35.810> can

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
things like that then you know they can

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.110 
things like that then you know they can
take<00:04:36.140> that<00:04:36.320> also<00:04:36.800> you<00:04:37.160> know<00:04:37.280> whether<00:04:37.520> the

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
take that also you know whether the

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.290 
take that also you know whether the
house<00:04:38.300> needs<00:04:38.600> to<00:04:38.750> be<00:04:38.900> totally<00:04:39.820> done<00:04:40.820> as<00:04:41.090> for

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
house needs to be totally done as for

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.550 
house needs to be totally done as for
seating<00:04:41.660> there<00:04:41.810> or<00:04:41.990> just<00:04:42.020> needs<00:04:42.350> to<00:04:42.440> be

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
seating there or just needs to be

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.780 
seating there or just needs to be
replaced<00:04:42.860> or<00:04:43.010> they<00:04:43.100> still<00:04:43.370> give<00:04:43.610> you

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
replaced or they still give you

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.230 
replaced or they still give you
information<00:04:44.690> on<00:04:45.230> that<00:04:45.440> and<00:04:45.680> so<00:04:46.100> that's<00:04:47.030> how

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
information on that and so that's how

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.730 
information on that and so that's how
you<00:04:47.300> turn<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:47.870> presidency<00:04:48.260> you<00:04:48.290> don't<00:04:48.590> have

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
you turn the presidency you don't have

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.710 
you turn the presidency you don't have
to<00:04:48.920> be<00:04:49.070> exact<00:04:49.520> you<00:04:49.760> just<00:04:49.940> need<00:04:50.120> a<00:04:50.150> number<00:04:50.420> to

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
to be exact you just need a number to

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.640 
to be exact you just need a number to
work<00:04:50.960> with<00:04:51.260> in<00:04:51.920> order<00:04:52.190> to<00:04:52.750> determine<00:04:53.750> what

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
work with in order to determine what

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.540 
work with in order to determine what
your<00:04:55.220> repair<00:04:55.580> cost<00:04:55.970> is<00:04:56.240> for<00:04:56.510> is<00:04:57.550> determining

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
your repair cost is for is determining

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.700 
your repair cost is for is determining
whether<00:04:59.000> you<00:04:59.180> have<00:04:59.330> a<00:04:59.360> deal<00:04:59.720> or<00:04:59.750> not<00:04:59.930> based<00:05:00.470> on

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
whether you have a deal or not based on

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.560 
whether you have a deal or not based on
the<00:05:00.950> formula<00:05:01.400> that<00:05:01.430> you<00:05:01.610> can<00:05:01.760> use<00:05:01.910> to<00:05:02.240> do<00:05:02.390> that

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
the formula that you can use to do that

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.060 
the formula that you can use to do that
so<00:05:02.930> um<00:05:03.290> this<00:05:04.220> is<00:05:04.280> just<00:05:04.670> a<00:05:04.820> simple<00:05:05.390> way<00:05:05.570> to<00:05:06.170> get

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
so um this is just a simple way to get

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.360 
so um this is just a simple way to get
comfortable<00:05:07.460> with<00:05:07.880> adding<00:05:08.630> or<00:05:08.810> using<00:05:09.530> repairs

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
determine if you have a deal not a total
