00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
opposing team spawn here it comes and we

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.849 
opposing team spawn here it comes and we
see<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.890> bank<00:04:14.340> off<00:04:14.610> the<00:04:14.670> deck<00:04:15.330> of<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:15.750> hut<00:04:16.049> then

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
see a bank off the deck of the hut then

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.520 
see a bank off the deck of the hut then
off<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.459> railing<00:04:17.790> bouncing<00:04:18.570> backwards<00:04:19.200> and

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
off the railing bouncing backwards and

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.190 
off the railing bouncing backwards and
it<00:04:19.680> comes<00:04:19.889> back<00:04:20.010> down<00:04:20.510> so<00:04:21.510> it<00:04:21.660> comes<00:04:21.840> back<00:04:22.139> down

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
it comes back down so it comes back down

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.100 
it comes back down so it comes back down
to<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.680> deck<00:04:23.040> and<00:04:23.280> it<00:04:23.790> flips<00:04:24.150> through<00:04:24.900> the

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
to the deck and it flips through the

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.250 
to the deck and it flips through the
crack<00:04:25.500> between<00:04:25.770> those<00:04:26.280> planks<00:04:26.639> right<00:04:26.940> there

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
crack between those planks right there

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.150 
crack between those planks right there
falls<00:04:28.260> under<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.860> hood<00:04:29.220> and<00:04:30.110> then<00:04:31.110> it<00:04:31.500> banks

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
falls under the hood and then it banks

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.219 
falls under the hood and then it banks
off<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.639> rock<00:04:32.880> and<00:04:33.210> hits<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.690> poor<00:04:33.990> guy

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
climbing up the ladder I hope that guy

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.159 
climbing up the ladder I hope that guy
watched<00:04:38.669> the<00:04:38.910> killcam<00:04:39.419> because<00:04:39.840> that<00:04:40.020> was

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
watched the killcam because that was

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:41.840 
watched the killcam because that was
probably<00:04:40.380> one<00:04:40.680> of<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:40.860> most<00:04:41.010> ridiculous

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
probably one of the most ridiculous

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.779 
probably one of the most ridiculous
things<00:04:42.180> I've<00:04:42.450> ever<00:04:42.510> seen<00:04:43.039> so<00:04:44.039> that<00:04:44.310> sums<00:04:44.610> up

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
things I've ever seen so that sums up
