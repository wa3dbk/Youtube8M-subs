3d effect and when I started doing it in
the<00:01:00.379> early<00:01:00.739> 80s<00:01:01.100> I<00:01:01.370> use<00:01:02.180> some<00:01:02.449> of<00:01:02.480> my

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
the early 80s I use some of my

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.780 
the early 80s I use some of my
perspective<00:01:03.440> techniques<00:01:03.829> that<00:01:04.100> I<00:01:04.129> had<00:01:04.460> used

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
perspective techniques that I had used

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.820 
perspective techniques that I had used
in<00:01:04.940> at<00:01:05.300> NASA<00:01:05.570> to<00:01:06.790> alter<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:07.880> geometry<00:01:08.540> and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
in at NASA to alter the geometry and

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.410 
in at NASA to alter the geometry and
therefore<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:10.130> forms<00:01:10.490> could<00:01:10.760> then<00:01:10.940> rise<00:01:11.180> out

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
therefore the forms could then rise out

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.910 
therefore the forms could then rise out
of<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.600> ground<00:01:11.840> and<00:01:12.110> look<00:01:12.229> three-dimensional

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
of the ground and look three-dimensional
