jalapeno plant here that I've been

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.330 
jalapeno plant here that I've been
growing<00:00:06.899> for<00:00:07.170> three<00:00:07.379> years<00:00:07.560> it's<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.919> it<00:00:08.220> was<00:00:08.309> a

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
growing for three years it's a it was a

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.759 
growing for three years it's a it was a
hybrid<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:09.000> so<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:09.780> is<00:00:09.929> an<00:00:10.050> F<00:00:10.230> it's<00:00:10.500> an<00:00:10.620> F<00:00:10.740> for

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
hybrid and so this is an F it's an F for

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.240 
hybrid and so this is an F it's an F for
now<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.690> I'm<00:00:12.690> D<00:00:12.900> hybridizing<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.860> so<00:00:14.070> for

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
now and I'm D hybridizing it and so for

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.519 
now and I'm D hybridizing it and so for
the<00:00:14.309> first<00:00:14.490> three<00:00:14.820> years<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.870> saved<00:00:16.260> seeds

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
the first three years that I saved seeds

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.529 
the first three years that I saved seeds
from<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.369> wasn't<00:00:17.760> hot<00:00:17.910> at<00:00:18.090> all<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
from this it wasn't hot at all the the

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.570 
from this it wasn't hot at all the the
jalapeno<00:00:19.080> was<00:00:19.260> actually<00:00:19.529> pretty<00:00:19.680> mild<00:00:19.890> well<00:00:20.550> a

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
jalapeno was actually pretty mild well a

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.859 
jalapeno was actually pretty mild well a
little<00:00:20.880> bit<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.210> heat<00:00:21.359> but<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.570> could<00:00:21.750> to

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
little bit of heat but I could to

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.179 
little bit of heat but I could to
actually<00:00:22.109> take<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> handful<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.830> seeds<00:00:23.039> and

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
actually take a handful of the seeds and

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.009 
actually take a handful of the seeds and
crunch<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.580> him<00:00:23.699> then<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:24.300> would<00:00:24.420> be<00:00:24.570> hot<00:00:24.779> but

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
crunch on him then it would be hot but

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.800 
crunch on him then it would be hot but
it<00:00:25.109> wouldn't<00:00:25.320> be<00:00:25.410> like<00:00:25.910> jalapeno<00:00:26.910> hot<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.779> I

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
it wouldn't be like jalapeno hot so I

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.560 
it wouldn't be like jalapeno hot so I
was<00:00:28.109> kind<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.910> mean<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:29.970> was<00:00:30.090> just<00:00:30.240> wondering

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
was kind of I mean I was just wondering

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.150 
was kind of I mean I was just wondering
what<00:00:30.750> what<00:00:31.289> was<00:00:31.410> really<00:00:31.590> going<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.920> with<00:00:32.070> him

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
what what was really going on with him

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.340 
what what was really going on with him
but<00:00:32.189> anyways<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:33.300> got<00:00:33.540> very<00:00:33.570> careless<00:00:34.079> with

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
but anyways so I got very careless with

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.990 
but anyways so I got very careless with
him<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:34.770> every<00:00:35.010> year<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.250> would<00:00:35.340> just<00:00:35.610> save

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
him and so every year I would just save

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.360 
him and so every year I would just save
the<00:00:36.180> seeds<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.600> throw<00:00:36.780> them<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:36.930> an<00:00:37.020> envelope

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
the seeds and throw them in an envelope

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.459 
the seeds and throw them in an envelope
but<00:00:38.370> what<00:00:38.550> happened<00:00:39.000> was<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.390> year<00:00:39.870> now

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469

being<00:00:40.739> at<00:00:40.890> f4<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.760> saved<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.719> seeds<00:00:43.020> from<00:00:43.410> one

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
I didn't think about it and all of a

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.910 
I didn't think about it and all of a
sudden<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.820> was<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> back<00:00:57.870> working<00:00:58.649> on<00:00:58.739> my
