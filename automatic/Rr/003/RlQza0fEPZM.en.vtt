00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.360
Hello and welcome back to module 4, where
hopefully you will agree that there is a lot

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.000
of short and sharp activities for you to explore
and to go and find new interesting things

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.570
about how we can learn from games.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.340
We have had a little look at augmented reality
already, then we have looked at the reverse

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.980
of that where we are using a GPS or a mobile
phone to actually find a physical object rather

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.330
than a virtual object, and now we are going
to talk a little bit about gamification.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.500
And what gamification is is how can we use
some of the concepts from computer games to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.840
improve something which maybe is a little
bit more boring traditionally.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.449
I am not saying that Microsoft Office is boring,
because it is obviously a very important software

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.710
application, but it is also an important software
application because we teach about it in a

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.479
lot of schools.

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:59.730
Unfortunately, even though most kids get the
basics of Microsoft Office straight away because

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.360
it is very easy to use, sometimes they struggle
with the more advanced tutorials.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.320
One of the nice things that Microsoft Research
have done is they gamified some of these tutorials

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:17.420
using a free plugin for Office 2007, 2010
and 2013, called Ribbon Hero.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.580
Instead of working your way through the tutorials,
the types of the tutorials that have been

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.360
around for a long period of time, you play
your way through the tutorials and the nice

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.680
thing about this is that you play your way
through the tutorials using a little character.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.650
The character is called a Clippy.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.380
The quicker that you produce the tutorials,
the more points that you get.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.170
It has got a social aspect to it as well so
you can share and compete via Facebook.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.600
There is just something about it which is
fresh and up if you like, that traditional

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.670
tutorial, that traditional ICT tutorial with
this kind of gamified approach.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.510
As you move along, you gain points and these
points come into achievements.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.659
Once you have gained all your achievement
points, you unlock another level, and in this

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.600
case you unlock a more advanced tutorial,
so it is learning from the domain of computer

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.410
games and actually taking some of these ideas
into more traditional activities.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.980
The character that you play with is a character
that is called Clipppy.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.319
Some of you might remember Clippy, he was
the help assistant from Office 2000.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.790
Again, there is quite a quirky nature to that
as well.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.140
You will set these tasks that you have to
complete and as I say, once you have completed

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.120
it, you are given more challenges and you
move on.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.560
The whole of the game is set in this kind
of pseudo Medieval realm, that you can compete

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.790
in with your friends.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.099
We have put this into a couple of schools
in Stirling in Scotland in a business education

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.700
class and the teacher, Alan Hamilton, would
quite openly say that sometimes he struggled

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.269
to get the kids motivated to learn the more
advanced aspects of Microsoft Office, but

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.969
actually the kids really liked it.

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:03.709
He offered to install it on the machines in
school, and then a few of them replied that

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.499
it was ok because they had already done it
at home, so high praising indeed for something

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.549
which is a very simple and yet effective idea.

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.260
There are other ways that we can gamify other
products as well.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.840
A Microsoft PowerPoint presentation can for
example be gamified by using a little programme

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.919
called Mouse Mischief.

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:26.139
And what Mouse Mischief is is it means that
you can connect more than 1 USB mouse to a

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.769
computer using a USB hub.

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.889
This means that you can actually create all
kinds of interesting quizzes, sorts of quizzes

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.379
that we probably already got, you can connect
these mice to it and you can add up to 24

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.609
mice and 24 people actually in the environment
and moving around.

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:47.650
Very quick way to add a degree of interactivity
and a degree of gamification into what can

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.659
be called a traditional PowerPoint presentation.

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.099
That is all I have got to say there.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.170
What donâ€™t you have a think about other
things that you have across that have been

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.359
gamified?
