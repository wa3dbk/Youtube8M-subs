 peeled and cut 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.440
 then these three ingredients come all 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.780
 together in a pot as well as 240 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.970
 milliliters of water you bring 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.860
 then cook and leave it for so long 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.120
 cook until the vegetables are soft and that 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.280
 water has evaporated 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.840
 once the vegetables have finished cooking 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.190
 Can you do it with the others? 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.190
 puree in blender together 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.610
 and then it's done 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:18.550
 vegan cheese soup then you like me 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.550
 noodles or serve as najib 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.030
 and finished is the short I have here 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.250
 two variants in front of me once macaroni 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.370
 with cheese the well-known macken cheese 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.349
 america and then also luxury with 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.510
 you have not really cheese for a long time 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.450
 I had a taste for carrots and something 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.090
 but potatoes through all the spices 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.640
 as well as the lemon juice of mustard salt and 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.440
 Pepper is not that noticeable 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.780
 and of consistency I have to 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.060
 say that is really very close to real 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.099
 cheese sauce rankommt I have on the internet 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.500
 also read that you loose this 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.110
 for example, asparagus can use 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.730
 or about potatoes and that too 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.920
 can bake that there is genuine 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.420
 a thousand variations how to make this church 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.000
 sauce can use 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.890
 I think it's super good, maybe 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.060
 Try it one of you too 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.230
