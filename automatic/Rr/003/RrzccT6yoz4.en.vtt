00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 palus today I will present 

00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:11.309
 how to make a computer for 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:15.150
 your doll you need a rule 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:19.460
 internal paper glue an eraser 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:23.609
 at 6o of the cardboard a sheet of colors 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:28.650
 and v felt so there is only one color 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.779
 obligatory the black otherwise down the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.369
 rest you take the color that you 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.399
 want me I took for example the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:41.570
 gray to make the keyboard then rest 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:47.070
 down to make the go stupid image so 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:51.030
 you take your piece of cardboard 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.059
 dream is the paper clone so we're going 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:03.480
 start by doing the basics so it's up to 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:05.610
 say what all the support so here it is 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.720
 I finished tracing the same time I 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.369
 drawn a line in the middle now on 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.950
 will cut out this no here and now 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.090
 with the 6th we will come to pass a shot 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.330
 on the middle and hand line and a 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.990
 once we have passed the six highs and lows 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:34.909
 here so we're going to fold one for that 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:39.200
 both sides brown closes on them 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.200
 and the other in the and beyond 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:58.780
 and now that we will come body and 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.340
 both there together 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.320
 but before gluing them and going away already 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.790
 take the measure to be able to 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.960
 flight 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.760
 behind another 2 cuil paper 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.470
 you put on your hunger and so 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.440
 you can already see that I have 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.980
 already two titles and benchmarks so 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.840
 take bigger ones especially you 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.470
 are you sure it's okay so it happens 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:30.590
 here and here 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:34.660
 so here it is cut off and now 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.660
 we are going to take this part 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.090
 sorry I'm really sorry I 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:46.670
 wanted to say that part and we're going 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:49.700
 come on the top there you see well 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.470
 it's over it's great and 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.310
 now precisions not come 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.560
 cut out what is too much 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.170
 now so we're going to come and stick the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.170
 two pieces together 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:09.110
 so that's one more time we are 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.360
 together we will go to the decor for them 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:16.370
 but maybe not his right computer 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.940
 and now we are going to come very much into 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.890
 color all there is a black here 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.420
 so you do pretty much so if you 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.090
 have a computer so you can 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.980
 look at how that's where you see that 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:36.890
 normally here it's bigger than 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:44.510
 there is against here for the screen is 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:52.610
 everything is the same size so here in 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:57.650
 high we fall 0.4 here it's 0.2 sa of which 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.910
 you do 0.4 0.4 0.2 0.2 so I 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.990
 first advise two lines in pencil 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:10.890
 Unbeknownst paper 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:15.470
 for a long time sorry so here we have zero 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:21.390
 screw a little by am wrong so that's 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:24.840
 on the sides one to 0.3 and here also 0.3 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:30.390
 and if on the other hand nice 0,6 so that's it 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:32.130
 will do all this but here is a 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.700
 once it's done and well now 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.520
 will come put everything in black and then 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.510
 a pretty dry crack frolics with eraser 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:46.620
 we will come all as and traits 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:48.990
 so here I have to color and now 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:53.670
 we will come to color also there especially 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.370
 edges if here and here for that 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:05:01.590
 make it more beautiful 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:08.420
 so here I have that coloring here so you 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:12.090
 now we will go to the keyboard 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:15.110
 so for that in pencil of paper you 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.390
 will come father full of small loans 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.310
 horizontal and vertical to redo 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.430
 like a small grid once 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.690
 these effect you will come back to iron 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.740
 with your black felt 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.740
 each stroke 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.910
 so here's the grid is done and 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.040
 now with your trump fire 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.810
 I took gray near you take 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:44.790
 whatever you want we will become 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:47.930
 colored every little box no that and 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:51.000
 now we will go to the screen so 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.100
 then you do like bourgi like 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.840
 you want me on the screen the jirs 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:06:01.380
 represent a little so youtube so 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:05.160
 with your pencil you go 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:08.670
 do so if you want to do like 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.730
 youtube like that that is clearly seen 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.730
 at 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:18.910
 rectangle like that here we have several 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:29.930
 here so normally the little bar a 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.850

 colored I finished and you have a 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.570
 beautiful little computer 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:52.330
 as you can see I changed a 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:55.220
 little color here is red cinema 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:07:00.680
