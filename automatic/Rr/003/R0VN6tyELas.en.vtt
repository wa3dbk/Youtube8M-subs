these<00:00:14.139> figures<00:00:14.530> do<00:00:14.740> have<00:00:14.919> landing<00:00:15.400> gear<00:00:15.639> in

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:15.849 
these figures do have landing gear in

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.169 
these figures do have landing gear in
the<00:00:15.909> past<00:00:16.119> i<00:00:16.299> said<00:00:16.480> they<00:00:16.599> don't<00:00:17.699> if<00:00:18.699> we<00:00:18.849> look<00:00:19.000> at

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:19.179 
the past i said they don't if we look at

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:20.849 
the past i said they don't if we look at
the<00:00:19.359> underside<00:00:20.050> here<00:00:20.080> in<00:00:20.349> the<00:00:20.439> robot<00:00:20.710> mode

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:20.859 
the underside here in the robot mode

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:22.800 
the underside here in the robot mode
chest<00:00:21.250> you'll<00:00:21.970> see<00:00:22.210> that<00:00:22.330> we<00:00:22.539> have<00:00:22.570> these

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
chest you'll see that we have these

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.509 
chest you'll see that we have these
little<00:00:22.960> fans<00:00:23.320> here<00:00:23.650> and<00:00:24.160> you<00:00:24.250> can<00:00:24.369> actually

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:24.519 
little fans here and you can actually

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.700 
little fans here and you can actually
fold<00:00:24.970> those<00:00:25.150> out<00:00:25.449> and<00:00:25.689> they<00:00:26.019> sort<00:00:26.289> of<00:00:26.410> act<00:00:26.560> as

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
fold those out and they sort of act as

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.909 
fold those out and they sort of act as
wheels<00:00:27.509> in<00:00:28.509> the<00:00:28.570> jet<00:00:29.140> mode<00:00:29.320> however<00:00:29.710> they

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
wheels in the jet mode however they

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.460 
wheels in the jet mode however they
don't<00:00:30.099> roll<00:00:30.400> of<00:00:30.550> course<00:00:30.789> but<00:00:31.150> there<00:00:32.140> is

landing gear so I was wrong yep okay so
enough<00:00:37.360> of<00:00:37.450> that<00:00:37.510> let's<00:00:38.410> get<00:00:38.590> out<00:00:38.740> into<00:00:38.890> the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
enough of that let's get out into the

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.490 
enough of that let's get out into the
actual<00:00:39.310> figure<00:00:39.640> itself<00:00:40.080> now<00:00:41.080> let<00:00:41.260> me<00:00:41.290> do<00:00:41.440> a

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
actual figure itself now let me do a

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.020 
actual figure itself now let me do a
side-by-side<00:00:41.770> comparison<00:00:42.220> here<00:00:43.000> with

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
side-by-side comparison here with

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
a much longer employer knows if we look

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.490 
a much longer employer knows if we look
at<00:00:59.050> ramjet<00:00:59.560> it's<00:00:59.740> a<00:00:59.920> much<00:01:00.190> shorter<00:01:00.460> and<00:01:01.500> much

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
at ramjet it's a much shorter and much

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.020 
wings on Starscream here you'll see that
they<00:01:07.960> started<00:01:08.380> about<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:09.610> middle<00:01:09.880> of<00:01:09.970> the

they started about the the middle of the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.630 
they started about the the middle of the
jet<00:01:10.330> and<00:01:10.510> they<00:01:11.110> ended<00:01:11.470> about<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:12.070> middle<00:01:12.580> of

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
jet and they ended about the middle of

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.110 
jet and they ended about the middle of
the<00:01:12.700> thrusters<00:01:13.180> here<00:01:13.890> looking<00:01:14.890> at<00:01:15.010> ramjet<00:01:15.460> you

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
the thrusters here looking at ramjet you

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.300 
the thrusters here looking at ramjet you
can<00:01:16.270> see<00:01:16.450> that<00:01:16.659> the<00:01:16.750> wings<00:01:17.020> started<00:01:17.980> about<00:01:18.159> the

and looking once again here at

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.680 
and looking once again here at
starstream<00:01:27.490> you'll<00:01:27.670> see<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:27.970> starstream<00:01:28.450> has

some rear tail fins here and if we look

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.930 
some rear tail fins here and if we look
at<00:01:31.810> thrust<00:01:32.170> one<00:01:32.440> or<00:01:32.710> look<00:01:33.340> at<00:01:33.460> thrust<00:01:33.729> if<00:01:33.850> we

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
at thrust one or look at thrust if we

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.910 
at thrust one or look at thrust if we
look<00:01:34.090> at<00:01:34.150> ramjet<00:01:34.600> once<00:01:34.780> more<00:01:35.050> you'll<00:01:35.560> see<00:01:35.770> that

look at ramjet once more you'll see that

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.870 
look at ramjet once more you'll see that
there<00:01:36.100> are<00:01:36.130> no<00:01:36.580> our<00:01:37.450> rear<00:01:37.750> tail<00:01:37.990> fins<00:01:38.260> here

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
which are attached to the main wings

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.170 
which are attached to the main wings
here<00:01:43.290> now<00:01:44.290> we<00:01:44.350> turn<00:01:44.620> the<00:01:44.950> figures<00:01:45.610> around<00:01:45.729> here

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
here now we turn the figures around here

and look at their underside you'll see
it<00:01:49.150> on<00:01:49.270> Starscream<00:01:49.900> the<00:01:50.409> missile<00:01:50.740> launchers

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
it on Starscream the missile launchers

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.770 
it on Starscream the missile launchers
are<00:01:51.250> attached<00:01:51.549> to<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.880> wings<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.420> main<00:01:52.570> wings

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
are attached to the wings the main wings

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.140 
are attached to the wings the main wings
of<00:01:52.900> course<00:01:53.110> and<00:01:53.350> that<00:01:54.280> puts<00:01:54.490> those<00:01:54.670> that<00:01:54.909> about

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
of course and that puts those that about

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.050 
of course and that puts those that about
the<00:01:55.390> center<00:01:55.870> of<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:56.080> jet<00:01:56.290> mode<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:57.580> looking

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
the center of the jet mode and looking

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.120 
the center of the jet mode and looking
over<00:01:58.240> here<00:01:58.390> ramjet<00:01:58.990> you'll<00:01:59.650> see<00:01:59.860> that<00:01:59.979> the

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
over here ramjet you'll see that the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.050 
over here ramjet you'll see that the
missile<00:02:00.400> launchers<00:02:00.670> are<00:02:00.820> once<00:02:00.970> again

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
missile launchers are once again

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.390 
missile launchers are once again
attached<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.810> main<00:02:01.960> wings<00:02:02.400> however

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
attached to the main wings however

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.490 
attached to the main wings however
because<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.210> wings<00:02:04.510> are<00:02:04.720> pushed<00:02:05.049> much

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
because the wings are pushed much

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.830 
because the wings are pushed much
further<00:02:05.770> back<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:07.270> missile<00:02:07.540> launches

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
further back the missile launches

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.449 
further back the missile launches
actually<00:02:08.259> appear<00:02:08.560> at<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:08.829> rear<00:02:09.099> of<00:02:09.129> the<00:02:09.279> jet

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
actually appear at the rear of the jet

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:10.800 
actually appear at the rear of the jet
mode

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
mode

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.270 
mode
so<00:02:11.810> that's<00:02:11.960> pretty<00:02:12.200> much<00:02:12.350> it<00:02:12.410> as<00:02:12.740> far<00:02:12.920> as<00:02:13.190> the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
so that's pretty much it as far as the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.070 
so that's pretty much it as far as the
differences<00:02:13.700> are<00:02:13.970> concerned<00:02:14.510> on<00:02:14.750> these<00:02:14.930> two

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
differences are concerned on these two

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.990 
differences are concerned on these two
molds<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:15.650> let<00:02:16.130> me<00:02:16.190> get<00:02:16.340> star<00:02:16.550> screen<00:02:16.760> out<00:02:16.910> of

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
molds so let me get star screen out of

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.110 
molds so let me get star screen out of
the<00:02:17.060> way<00:02:17.150> here<00:02:17.360> now<00:02:18.040> is<00:02:19.040> for<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.820> color<00:02:19.970> scheme

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
the way here now is for the color scheme

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.600 
the way here now is for the color scheme

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
we also have some dark gray which if we

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.060 
we also have some dark gray which if we
look<00:02:43.130> on<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:44.320> nose<00:02:45.320> here<00:02:45.620> you<00:02:45.770> can<00:02:45.860> see<00:02:45.980> the

the<00:02:54.260> rear<00:02:54.530> thrusters<00:02:55.040> here<00:02:55.280> are<00:02:55.430> gray<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.000> if

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
the rear thrusters here are gray and if

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.880 
the rear thrusters here are gray and if
people<00:02:56.720> have<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.020> figure<00:02:57.170> round<00:02:57.500> you'll<00:02:57.709> see

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
people have to figure round you'll see

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.070 
people have to figure round you'll see
that<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.160> missiles<00:02:58.520> are<00:02:58.580> also<00:02:58.760> gray<00:02:59.270> as<00:02:59.510> well

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
that the missiles are also gray as well

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.040 
that the missiles are also gray as well
as<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.320> missile<00:03:00.620> launchers<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.900> that's

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
as the missile launchers so that's

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.840 
as the missile launchers so that's
pretty<00:03:03.320> much<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.530> as<00:03:03.860> far<00:03:04.040> as<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.459> colors<00:03:04.700> are

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
pretty much it as far as the colors are

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.410 
pretty much it as far as the colors are
concerned<00:03:05.180> we<00:03:05.720> also<00:03:05.870> have<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:07.090> rub<00:03:08.090> symbol

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
concerned we also have the rub symbol

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.840 
concerned we also have the rub symbol
over<00:03:08.600> here<00:03:08.810> on<00:03:08.990> the<00:03:09.200> left<00:03:10.010> side<00:03:10.190> of<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.580> jet

transformation to robot mode and to do

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.060 
transformation to robot mode and to do
that<00:03:16.850> if<00:03:17.090> you're<00:03:17.209> familiar<00:03:17.600> with<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.560> Stars

that if you're familiar with the Stars
being<00:03:19.310> transformation<00:03:19.940> it's<00:03:20.090> pretty<00:03:20.390> much

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
being transformation it's pretty much

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.800 
being transformation it's pretty much
identical<00:03:21.280> we'll<00:03:22.280> just<00:03:22.489> remove<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.820> missile

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
identical we'll just remove the missile

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.449 
identical we'll just remove the missile
launchers<00:03:24.170> here<00:03:25.300> we'll<00:03:26.300> start<00:03:26.600> by<00:03:27.459> pulling

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
launchers here we'll start by pulling

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.460 
launchers here we'll start by pulling
the<00:03:28.610> rear<00:03:29.209> section<00:03:29.660> of<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.810> jetpack<00:03:30.230> like

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
the rear section of the jetpack like

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.380 
the rear section of the jetpack like
that<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:30.890> separate<00:03:31.370> them<00:03:31.459> these<00:03:32.060> will<00:03:32.269> become

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
that and separate them these will become

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.780 
that and separate them these will become
the<00:03:32.510> legs<00:03:32.780> as<00:03:32.989> you<00:03:33.110> can<00:03:33.230> see<00:03:33.550> we'll<00:03:34.550> go<00:03:34.700> ahead

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
the legs as you can see we'll go ahead

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.370 
the legs as you can see we'll go ahead
and<00:03:34.940> fold<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.780> wings<00:03:36.769> back<00:03:37.100> like<00:03:37.430> so<00:03:38.230> fold<00:03:39.230> the

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
and fold the wings back like so fold the

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:46.600 
and fold the wings back like so fold the
feet<00:03:39.590> down<00:03:42.040> like<00:03:43.040> so<00:03:43.570> and<00:03:44.570> now<00:03:45.049> a<00:03:45.580> step<00:03:46.580> that

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
feet down like so and now a step that

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.060 
feet down like so and now a step that
you<00:03:47.180> don't<00:03:47.390> have<00:03:47.480> to<00:03:47.600> do<00:03:47.959> on<00:03:48.230> Starscream<00:03:48.890> is

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
you don't have to do on Starscream is

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.940 
you don't have to do on Starscream is
you<00:03:49.549> grab<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:50.170> front<00:03:51.170> sections<00:03:51.560> of<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.799> wing

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
you grab the front sections of the wing

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.490 
you grab the front sections of the wing
here<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.549> you<00:03:52.970> rotate<00:03:53.360> them<00:03:53.630> around<00:03:53.660> like<00:03:54.140> so

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.260 

now<00:03:58.500> next<00:03:58.890> we'll<00:03:59.250> raise<00:03:59.490> up<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.970> nose<00:04:00.930> here<00:04:02.270> go

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
now next we'll raise up the nose here go

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.640 
now next we'll raise up the nose here go
ahead<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:03.480> separate<00:04:03.959> that<00:04:04.200> from<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.470> main

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
ahead and separate that from the main

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.970 
ahead and separate that from the main
portion<00:04:05.100> body<00:04:05.400> rotate<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:06.120> around<00:04:06.180> here

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
portion body rotate that around here

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.809 
portion body rotate that around here
rotate<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.130> nose<00:04:08.370> around<00:04:08.610> 180<00:04:09.510> degrees<00:04:10.819> go

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
rotate the nose around 180 degrees go

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.180 
rotate the nose around 180 degrees go
ahead<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.950> push<00:04:13.950> that<00:04:14.130> down<00:04:14.370> into<00:04:14.700> place

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
ahead and push that down into place

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.949 
ahead and push that down into place
rotate<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.220> arms<00:04:17.790> out<00:04:17.970> here<00:04:20.810> go<00:04:21.810> ahead<00:04:21.930> and

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.850 
ramjet in robot mode the color scheme is
pretty<00:05:05.520> much<00:05:05.699> identical<00:05:06.690> to<00:05:07.350> the<00:05:07.470> jet<00:05:07.680> mode

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
pretty much identical to the jet mode

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.700 
pretty much identical to the jet mode

360<00:05:29.699> degrees<00:05:29.910> oh<00:05:30.449> I<00:05:31.130> mean<00:05:32.130> there<00:05:32.610> we<00:05:32.760> go<00:05:32.880> they

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
360 degrees oh I mean there we go they

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.430 
360 degrees oh I mean there we go they
can<00:05:33.570> rotate<00:05:33.840> 360<00:05:34.289> degrees<00:05:34.500> but<00:05:36.139> not<00:05:37.139> with<00:05:37.350> the

there to move it it will move a little
bit<00:06:29.430> but<00:06:29.699> only<00:06:31.310> very<00:06:32.310> slightly<00:06:32.789> from<00:06:33.150> the<00:06:33.180> left

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
and to the right as you can see it's

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.300 
and to the right as you can see it's
pretty<00:06:36.419> much<00:06:36.660> just<00:06:36.930> a<00:06:37.080> straight<00:06:37.349> on<00:06:37.500> look<00:06:38.099> for

pretty much just a straight on look for

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.110 
pretty much just a straight on look for
this<00:06:38.430> figure<00:06:39.500> overall<00:06:40.500> it's<00:06:40.830> a<00:06:40.979> really<00:06:41.120> really

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
this figure overall it's a really really

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.420 
this figure overall it's a really really
great<00:06:42.300> figure<00:06:42.690> nice<00:06:43.169> remould<00:06:43.650> I<00:06:43.860> love<00:06:44.310> the

color scheme I hope we get the rest of
the<00:06:47.520> coneheads<00:06:47.969> as<00:06:48.150> well<00:06:48.360> as
