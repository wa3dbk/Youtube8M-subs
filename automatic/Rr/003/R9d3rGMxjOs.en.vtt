it in to through to steamapps common
terraria<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.170> assuming<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.829> on

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
terraria it's assuming you have it on

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.020 
terraria it's assuming you have it on
Steam<00:00:41.190> which<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.579> would<00:00:41.700> think<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.969> you

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
Steam which I would think that you

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.139 
Steam which I would think that you
probably<00:00:42.149> do<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.860> then<00:00:44.100> paste<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.030> in

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
probably do so you then paste that in

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.000 
probably do so you then paste that in
the<00:00:45.270> obviously<00:00:45.510> I've<00:00:45.870> done<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.289> already<00:00:46.590> so

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
the obviously I've done this already so

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.529 
the obviously I've done this already so
we<00:00:47.100> don't<00:00:47.280> really<00:00:47.370> need<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.700> do<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.059> then

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
we don't really need to do that and then

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.660 
we don't really need to do that and then
what<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.379> create<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.800> shortcut

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
what you do is you create a shortcut

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.360 
what you do is you create a shortcut
once<00:00:51.120> again<00:00:51.270> already<00:00:51.629> done<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.190> now<00:00:53.190> once

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
once again already done that now once

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.830 
once again already done that now once
you've<00:00:53.489> done<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.760> shortcut<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.719> go

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
you've done the shortcut you can go

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.990 
you've done the shortcut you can go
through<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.140> properties<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.879> you'll<00:00:56.879> see

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
through the properties and you'll see

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.760 
through the properties and you'll see
the<00:00:57.120> shortcut<00:00:57.480> tab<00:00:57.660> right<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:57.899> now<00:00:58.500> what<00:00:58.680> you

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
the shortcut tab right here now what you

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.080 
the shortcut tab right here now what you
need<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.190> provide<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.520> command<00:00:59.879> line

by<00:01:18.000> 720<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:18.990> case<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.380> tend<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> run<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.860> the

by 720 in this case I tend to run in the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.640 
by 720 in this case I tend to run in the
window<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.970> tend<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.240> film<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.659> 720p<00:01:22.170> so

on with it now I'm beat I'm told that

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.350 
on with it now I'm beat I'm told that
really<00:01:47.040> high<00:01:47.159> resolutions<00:01:47.700> there<00:01:47.820> are<00:01:47.939> some

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
really high resolutions there are some

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.749 
really high resolutions there are some
problems<00:01:48.990> sometimes<00:01:49.500> with<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.979> sky<00:01:50.369> not

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
problems sometimes with the sky not

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.149 
problems sometimes with the sky not
fully<00:01:51.030> covering<00:01:51.479> everything<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.530> 720p

fully covering everything but in 720p

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.370 
fully covering everything but in 720p
I'm<00:01:53.369> certainly<00:01:53.790> not<00:01:53.970> seeing<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.479> now<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
I'm certainly not seeing that now the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.630 
I'm certainly not seeing that now the
game<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.829> running<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.159> bit<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.430> slow

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640

because natively it runs at 800 by 600 I
can't<00:02:25.160> remember<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.460> last<00:02:25.550> game<00:02:25.760> actually

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
can't remember the last game actually

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.520 
can't remember the last game actually
ran<00:02:26.330> at<00:02:26.450> that<00:02:26.570> resolution<00:02:26.840> but<00:02:27.260> there<00:02:27.410> you<00:02:27.470> go

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
ran at that resolution but there you go

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.870 
ran at that resolution but there you go
hopefully<00:02:28.220> this<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.520> something<00:02:28.730> they<00:02:28.820> will

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
hopefully this is something they will

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.400 
hopefully this is something they will
actually<00:02:29.210> put<00:02:29.360> in<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.480> game<00:02:29.750> options<00:02:30.230> in<00:02:30.350> a

actually put in the game options in a
future<00:02:30.710> patch<00:02:30.890> but<00:02:31.100> for<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.340> time<00:02:31.520> being<00:02:31.790> that
