00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
center it's kind of a caveman move but

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.390 
center it's kind of a caveman move but
it<00:03:21.880> can<00:03:22.000> be<00:03:22.090> very<00:03:22.120> still<00:03:22.840> no<00:03:22.990> night<00:03:23.400> actually

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
develop trades are still good and will

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.910 
develop trades are still good and will
be<00:04:29.640> for<00:04:29.820> the<00:04:29.910> rest<00:04:29.970> of<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.180> game<00:04:30.360> so<00:04:31.290> basically

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
be for the rest of the game so basically

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.920 
be for the rest of the game so basically
we<00:04:32.190> have<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.430> figure<00:04:32.580> out<00:04:32.700> our<00:04:32.760> strategy<00:04:32.940> as<00:04:33.390> my

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
we have to figure out our strategy as my

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.350 
we have to figure out our strategy as my
opponent<00:04:34.200> el<00:04:34.530> meadows<00:04:34.890> is<00:04:35.640> being<00:04:35.970> highly

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
opponent el meadows is being highly

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.750 
opponent el meadows is being highly
aggressive<00:04:36.600> in<00:04:36.930> every<00:04:37.200> game<00:04:37.610> so<00:04:38.610> we're<00:04:38.700> going

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
aggressive in every game so we're going

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.470 
aggressive in every game so we're going
to<00:04:38.880> have<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.120> coordinate<00:04:39.570> either<00:04:39.780> openings<00:04:40.380> or

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
to have to coordinate either openings or

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.030 
to have to coordinate either openings or
coordinate<00:04:43.010> trade<00:04:44.010> issues<00:04:44.430> as<00:04:44.820> far<00:04:44.880> as

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
coordinate trade issues as far as

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.580 
coordinate trade issues as far as
picking<00:04:47.040> two<00:04:47.280> openings<00:04:47.760> that<00:04:48.170> will<00:04:49.170> work<00:04:49.320> well

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
picking two openings that will work well

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.620 
picking two openings that will work well
together<00:04:51.560> so<00:04:52.560> right<00:04:52.770> now<00:04:52.970> will<00:04:53.970> is<00:04:54.180> actually

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
together so right now will is actually

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.810 
together so right now will is actually
long<00:04:55.050> time<00:04:55.410> so<00:04:55.710> he<00:04:55.830> doesn't<00:04:56.160> have<00:04:56.340> the<00:04:56.400> option

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
long time so he doesn't have the option

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.660 
long time so he doesn't have the option
of<00:04:56.850> city<00:04:57.180> so<00:04:57.960> he's<00:04:58.140> gonna<00:04:58.260> have<00:04:58.470> to<00:04:58.770> sit<00:04:59.520> out<00:04:59.550> a

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
of city so he's gonna have to sit out a

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.730 
of city so he's gonna have to sit out a
few<00:05:00.000> can<00:05:00.240> move<00:05:00.620> stelian<00:05:01.620> coke<00:05:01.830> from<00:05:02.040> there<00:05:02.280> and

few can move stelian coke from there and

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.470 
few can move stelian coke from there and
trade<00:05:04.740> as<00:05:04.890> little<00:05:05.280> as<00:05:05.370> possible<00:05:05.400> as<00:05:06.120> you<00:05:06.390> can

it's usually pretty passive print oh
I've<00:05:12.720> got<00:05:12.930> a<00:05:12.960> little<00:05:13.260> pride<00:05:13.890> sit<00:05:14.220> I've<00:05:14.430> got

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
I've got a little pride sit I've got

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.850 
I've got a little pride sit I've got
some<00:05:14.880> hopes<00:05:15.120> of<00:05:15.360> them<00:05:15.450> said<00:05:15.660> one<00:05:16.200> pawn<00:05:16.410> Mason

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
some hopes of them said one pawn Mason

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.760 
some hopes of them said one pawn Mason
food<00:05:17.070> and<00:05:17.540> there<00:05:18.540> it<00:05:18.630> is<00:05:18.690> again<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.050> factor<00:05:19.740> of

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
food and there it is again the factor of

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.300 
food and there it is again the factor of
lag<00:05:20.220> fact<00:05:20.820> that<00:05:21.060> L<00:05:21.720> meadows<00:05:22.140> had<00:05:22.500> lagged<00:05:22.770> 11

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
lag fact that L meadows had lagged 11

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.380 
lag fact that L meadows had lagged 11
seconds<00:05:23.850> to<00:05:24.380> apparently<00:05:25.490> its<00:05:26.490> decisive<00:05:26.910> yeah

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
seconds to apparently its decisive yeah

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.020 
seconds to apparently its decisive yeah
very<00:05:27.840> decisive<00:05:28.410> you<00:05:28.560> can<00:05:28.680> see<00:05:28.860> VA<00:05:29.190> Boris<00:05:29.640> is<00:05:29.820> up

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
very decisive you can see VA Boris is up

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.159 
very decisive you can see VA Boris is up
time<00:05:30.300> against<00:05:30.840> Vance<00:05:31.730> but<00:05:32.730> al<00:05:33.420> menos<00:05:33.720> lagged

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
time against Vance but al menos lagged

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.140 
time against Vance but al menos lagged
so<00:05:34.500> much

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
so much

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.270 
so much
maybe<00:05:36.990> that's<00:05:37.200> why<00:05:37.320> VN<00:05:37.650> Boris's<00:05:37.980> have<00:05:38.130> time

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
maybe that's why VN Boris's have time

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.430 
maybe that's why VN Boris's have time
otherwise<00:05:38.460> maybe<00:05:38.820> we'd<00:05:39.030> be<00:05:39.120> equal<00:05:39.690> I<00:05:39.900> don't

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
otherwise maybe we'd be equal I don't

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.300 
otherwise maybe we'd be equal I don't
know<00:05:40.500> it's<00:05:40.620> not<00:05:40.770> to<00:05:40.890> say<00:05:41.960> it<00:05:42.960> looks<00:05:43.170> like<00:05:43.440> since

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
know it's not to say it looks like since

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.120 
know it's not to say it looks like since
he<00:05:44.490> likes<00:05:44.730> so<00:05:45.000> much<00:05:45.060> al<00:05:45.420> menos<00:05:45.920> you<00:05:46.920> got<00:05:47.100> a

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
he likes so much al menos you got a

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.340 
he likes so much al menos you got a
slight<00:05:47.490> edge<00:05:47.630> as<00:05:48.630> you<00:05:48.750> can<00:05:48.900> see<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.140> light

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
slight edge as you can see the light

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.410 
slight edge as you can see the light
comparison<00:05:49.980> to<00:05:50.070> let's<00:05:50.310> go<00:05:50.460> it's<00:05:50.790> versus<00:05:51.150> five

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
comparison to let's go it's versus five

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.910 
comparison to let's go it's versus five
six<00:05:51.690> so<00:05:51.900> I'm<00:05:52.110> going<00:05:52.260> to<00:05:52.290> try<00:05:52.410> to<00:05:52.470> drop<00:05:52.740> this

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
six so I'm going to try to drop this

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.310 
six so I'm going to try to drop this
check<00:05:53.310> so<00:05:54.300> that<00:05:54.330> we<00:05:54.510> don't<00:05:54.630> lose<00:05:54.720> immediately

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
check so that we don't lose immediately

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.020 
check so that we don't lose immediately
but<00:05:55.440> i'm<00:05:55.530> going<00:05:55.650> to<00:05:55.710> wait<00:05:55.860> until<00:05:56.130> we're<00:05:56.790> way

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
but i'm going to wait until we're way

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.970 
but i'm going to wait until we're way
down<00:05:57.060> on<00:05:57.420> time<00:05:57.660> right<00:05:58.380> so<00:05:58.560> they<00:05:58.620> may<00:05:58.800> get<00:05:58.950> a

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 
down on time right so they may get a

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.680 
down on time right so they may get a
