00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:11.450
 oh well that's it everyone knows 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.550
 to do that taken are found for a 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.380
 new video in whose company the 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.060
 big night we take it the unique will be 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.759
 so today we will make you a 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.460
 little top 5 fun villages and what the 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.409
 fuck so this is the second edition 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.229
 I have a part we continue the adventure 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:30.829
 that's exactly and then we have nothing 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:32.840
 else to say 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:41.690
 we start right away will be fetwa 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:44.679
 like it's bart so we're on the 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.030
 first village is an eiffel tower 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.289
 he told us that even renting out 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.629
 make the Eiffel Tower just in case 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.489
 would not be to the bigger ones so that's 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.579
 paris here for those who did not know 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.559
 not that's amazing good news the 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.379
 little little thing he may have 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.670
 forgot about the tourists because there are 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.040
 often a lot of tourists below 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.480
 of the eiffel tower and not in fact there 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.000
 did not forget the lega the king and the 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.410
 queen good to the queen but actually when 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.510
 we send the king the queen in battle 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.830
 usually they visit others 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.150
 buildings not what we would want 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.010
 gioria the town hall of dreux he 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.660
 go off on the other hand so here it is 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.810
 are the two tourists downstairs so that's 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.950
 very very realistic remembers there are the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.630
 military camps with all the troops 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.100
 a lot and it's a very very good 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.470
 village but to these silhouettes of women 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.660
 still I think yes and then it must 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.370
 to be surely a Frenchman and he 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.720
 is not usable because there are all 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.280
 gold resources I would like 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.060
 pierce the village like this 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.090
 very bad 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.060
 or you see it's an American 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.400
 who is on vacation in paris and who of 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.890
 it's a village like that 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.460
 okay okay it's a hypothesis it's 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.110
 a hypothesis 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.910
 I want to see when he will be in Dubai 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.920
 you know, we'll go around and everything will 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.230
 do the burj khalifa with cams 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.350
 alright let's go to the fourth 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.350
 position 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.650
 and that's fourth place with 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.360
 a village bart simpson so that's 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.820
 really following the first episode where 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.080
 there had been father homer simpson so 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.640
 there we meet at the door 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.980
 what are these strong times will be on the 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.590
 low hurdle and second episode it's 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.870
 normal we see the super nice son and 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.340
 to and then frankly I find it 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.040
 is very very pretty very well done 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.269
 it's hard not to be 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.060
 how difficult it is to 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.890
 to make villages in the shape of some 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.629
 unless they wish to 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.390
 get help from someone he's already 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.590
 done but if it is he who did it 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.890
 his own hands who has imagined everything 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.700
 himself frankly huge I 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.129
 really bravo because he is 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.660
 beautiful but good the dishes very useful 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.660
 yes clearly 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.810
 and so we end up with our 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.480
 beautiful country here is France that 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.540
 cassetti france for the moment she has 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.950
 lost no defense clearly so the 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.690
 suddenly what do we do we will 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.700
 to make a village in the shape of France 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.430
 here it is downright I advise you 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.900
 this village because it's pretty good and the 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.370
 voice who lives earlier in brittany I 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.690
 will say that the most powerful side 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.400
 of this base it is rather the west side 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.560
 but this let pass totally of 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.680
 our year but here is a very beautiful 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.480
 village rather well done and what is 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.879
 what does it tell you but beautiful 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.489
 in addition to the dear sir who did it 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.350
 it's a french it's sir h 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.209
 Ben actually if the champions poite handsome 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:36.459
 he has a village that is very well done 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.870
 there are finally usable defenses which 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.639
 not all the main resources 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.060
 village of deco it is usable 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:45.760
 hermens rather not bad we are stopping 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.040
 but besides that we look you go on 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.859
 of the ribs he could have put the 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.090
 sea ​​you like me down there is the sea 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.139
 they could have put the village a 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.819
 little more down and like that 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.470
 heard the Atlantic Ocean 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.680
 yeah I confess coming from the selfs a little 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.680
 still 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:10.709
 and we end up for the second 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.480
 position carefully an iphone it is 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.930
 beautiful even if there are not all 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.849
 buildings 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.190
 frankly it is very well done 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.950
 I love the little button that is the machined 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.500
 of spells and then and then yes the pretty ones 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.000
 what do you wear spell we know 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.490
 not then we all ask ourselves the question 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.440
 what iphone models then is it 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.380
 it's the iphone 3s it's the iphone 6 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.630
 if we look at the buildings cases on 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.970
 so we can clearly see the castle 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.510
 of clans so it's safari 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.940

 gold mine 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.919
 what shock launched icons in yellow is 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.229
 there the gold reserve 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.510

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.070

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.350

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.820
 yeah yeah that's fine anyway 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.820
 village let's move to the first place 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:07.240
 and we are in first place 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.590
 podium with mp4 crane so stopped one even 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.030

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.010
 was not there it's a very building site 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.330
 known to be a little pessimistic 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.190
 a little bit of a bad mood 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.930
 it's a little less in the morning a little bit 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.030
 everyone does it in the morning that's it 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.620
 can very well identify with this village 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.210
 very sad is this a village of 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.590
 clan wars 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.820
 here and one is tired of being at war 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.800

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.610
 he made a village group icade 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.590
