on<00:00:16.219> your<00:00:16.400> break<00:00:16.580> early<00:00:17.180> cuz<00:00:17.660> you<00:00:17.779> collect<00:00:18.199> that

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:18.349 
on your break early cuz you collect that

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.540 
on your break early cuz you collect that
energy<00:00:18.710> as<00:00:18.830> regen<00:00:19.279> and<00:00:21.009> it<00:00:22.009> wouldn't<00:00:22.310> all<00:00:22.400> that

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
energy as regen and it wouldn't all that

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.060 
energy as regen and it wouldn't all that
energy<00:00:22.730> now<00:00:23.000> back<00:00:23.210> into<00:00:23.480> your<00:00:23.570> battery

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.000 

better<00:00:27.070> not<00:00:27.280> to<00:00:27.550> come<00:00:27.730> to<00:00:27.850> a<00:00:27.880> complete<00:00:28.210> stop<00:00:29.010> at

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
better not to come to a complete stop at

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.040 
better not to come to a complete stop at
this<00:00:30.160> point<00:00:30.490> at<00:00:30.670> this<00:00:30.730> point<00:00:30.910> they<00:00:31.840> don't<00:00:31.960> have

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
this point at this point they don't have

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.690 
this point at this point they don't have
much<00:00:32.200> which<00:00:32.410> ones<00:00:32.650> you're<00:00:33.250> going<00:00:33.370> to<00:00:33.430> come<00:00:33.580> to

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
much which ones you're going to come to

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.700 
much which ones you're going to come to
a<00:00:33.730> complete<00:00:33.940> stop<00:00:34.030> regardless<00:00:34.780> it's<00:00:35.440> at<00:00:35.560> that

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
a complete stop regardless it's at that

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.710 
a complete stop regardless it's at that
point<00:00:35.950> in<00:00:36.070> time<00:00:36.100> one<00:00:37.060> of<00:00:37.180> the<00:00:37.239> other<00:00:37.360> tricks

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
point in time one of the other tricks

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.979 
point in time one of the other tricks
you<00:00:38.200> can<00:00:38.230> do<00:00:38.500> is<00:00:38.710> put<00:00:39.580> it<00:00:39.700> in<00:00:39.760> neutral<00:00:39.880> and<00:00:40.330> take

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
you can do is put it in neutral and take

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.600 
you can do is put it in neutral and take
your<00:00:41.140> foot<00:00:41.260> off<00:00:41.320> the<00:00:41.559> brake

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
your foot off the brake

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.170 
your foot off the brake
you<00:00:43.030> do<00:00:43.180> that<00:00:43.390> you're<00:00:44.350> not<00:00:44.470> using<00:00:44.740> energy<00:00:45.550> for

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
you do that you're not using energy for

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.050 
you do that you're not using energy for
the<00:00:46.270> lights<00:00:46.450> right<00:00:47.440> right<00:00:47.920> so<00:00:48.400> those<00:00:48.910> are<00:00:49.030> all

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.060 
the lights right right so those are all

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.760 
the lights right right so those are all
didn't<00:00:49.690> even<00:00:49.870> think<00:00:49.960> about<00:00:50.080> that<00:00:50.230> Oh<00:00:50.470> tiny

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
didn't even think about that Oh tiny

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.540 
didn't even think about that Oh tiny
tricks<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:52.570> don't<00:00:52.720> even<00:00:52.780> think<00:00:52.960> about<00:00:53.080> really

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
tricks you don't even think about really

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.330 
tricks you don't even think about really
and<00:00:54.550> that's<00:00:54.910> it<00:00:55.000> I<00:00:55.060> mean<00:00:55.180> it's<00:00:55.420> just

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.220 

two<00:01:01.970> lights<00:01:02.210> ahead<00:01:02.330> of<00:01:02.600> you<00:01:02.720> there's<00:01:03.140> a

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
two lights ahead of you there's a

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.930 
two lights ahead of you there's a
vehicle<00:01:03.530> it's<00:01:03.650> already<00:01:03.950> gone<00:01:04.100> through<00:01:04.160> it's<00:01:04.910> a

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
vehicle it's already gone through it's a

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.000 
vehicle it's already gone through it's a
high<00:01:05.120> probability<00:01:05.360> that<00:01:06.110> if<00:01:06.590> these<00:01:06.740> lights

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
high probability that if these lights

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.060 
high probability that if these lights
are<00:01:07.160> on<00:01:07.220> sensors<00:01:07.700> has<00:01:07.880> been<00:01:08.060> tripped<00:01:08.390> so<00:01:09.380> you

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
are on sensors has been tripped so you

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.650 
are on sensors has been tripped so you
want<00:01:10.280> to<00:01:10.400> you<00:01:10.610> know<00:01:10.700> prepare<00:01:11.210> your<00:01:11.479> one

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
want to you know prepare your one

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.450 
want to you know prepare your one
accelerate<00:01:12.080> vestige<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:13.100> right<00:01:13.250> now<00:01:13.280> you're

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
accelerate vestige so right now you're

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.380 
accelerate vestige so right now you're
going<00:01:13.640> downhill<00:01:13.820> tip<00:01:14.150> out<00:01:14.300> just<00:01:16.210> you've<00:01:17.210> got

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
going downhill tip out just you've got

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.140 
going downhill tip out just you've got
all<00:01:17.540> that<00:01:17.570> in<00:01:18.290> your

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
all that in your

all that in your
your<00:01:20.660> favorite<00:01:21.020> doing<00:01:21.560> over<00:01:21.800> 60<00:01:22.580> plus<00:01:22.790> it's

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
your favorite doing over 60 plus it's

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.350 
your favorite doing over 60 plus it's
gay

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.380 

as<00:01:28.930> your<00:01:29.260> normal<00:01:29.710> vehicle<00:01:30.160> gets<00:01:30.700> worse<00:01:31.000> fuel

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
as your normal vehicle gets worse fuel

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.410 
as your normal vehicle gets worse fuel
in<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:32.440> city<00:01:32.710> that<00:01:32.950> it<00:01:33.790> does<00:01:33.910> on<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.090> highway

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
in the city that it does on the highway

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.640 
in the city that it does on the highway
and<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:35.770> is<00:01:35.950> just<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.430> opposite<00:01:36.820> 41<00:01:37.330> city

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
and this is just the opposite 41 city

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.690 
and this is just the opposite 41 city
3600

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
3600

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.160 
3600
it's<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.149> way<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.390> system<00:01:40.600> works<00:01:40.810> in

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
it's the way the system works in

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.690 
it's the way the system works in
conjunction<00:01:41.409> with<00:01:41.799> the<00:01:42.009> electric<00:01:42.369> motors

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
conjunction with the electric motors

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.130 
conjunction with the electric motors
that's<00:01:43.420> it's<00:01:44.229> that<00:01:44.469> whole<00:01:44.969> dynamic<00:01:46.140> you're

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
that's it's that whole dynamic you're

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.320 
that's it's that whole dynamic you're
not<00:01:47.259> using<00:01:47.649> fuel<00:01:48.189> as<00:01:48.340> you're<00:01:48.520> standing<00:01:48.729> still

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.030 

do<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.020> think<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.290> could<00:01:52.440> this<00:01:52.710> would<00:01:52.890> work

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
do you think you could this would work

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.510 
do you think you could this would work
for<00:01:53.280> your<00:01:53.400> commute<00:01:53.670> Amanda<00:01:53.970> oh<00:01:54.290> yeah<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:56.130> so

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
much better to have a car like this when

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.140 
much better to have a car like this when
I'm<00:01:58.350> sitting<00:01:58.590> at<00:01:58.770> red<00:01:59.070> light<00:01:59.280> after<00:01:59.670> red<00:01:59.940> light

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
I'm sitting at red light after red light

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.550 
I'm sitting at red light after red light
after<00:02:00.780> red<00:02:01.110> light<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.740> my<00:02:02.550> commute<00:02:03.110> because<00:02:04.110> a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
after red light on my commute because a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.950 
after red light on my commute because a
lot<00:02:05.010> of<00:02:05.040> times<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.760> would<00:02:06.510> be<00:02:06.600> there<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.780> lot
