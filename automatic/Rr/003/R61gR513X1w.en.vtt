smooth ran in the four threes had an

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.240 
smooth ran in the four threes had an
excellent<00:00:36.329> showing<00:00:36.840> dark<00:00:37.260> was<00:00:37.500> Denard<00:00:37.950> ran<00:00:38.219> a

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
excellent showing dark was Denard ran a

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.979 
excellent showing dark was Denard ran a
little<00:00:38.399> bit<00:00:38.579> slower<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.180> fourth<00:00:39.510> fourth<00:00:39.780> a

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
little bit slower in the fourth fourth a

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.200 
little bit slower in the fourth fourth a
little<00:00:40.440> bit<00:00:40.559> tighter<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.129> terms<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.969> some<00:00:42.120> of

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
little bit tighter in terms of some of

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.430 
little bit tighter in terms of some of
the<00:00:42.270> transition<00:00:42.930> change<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> direction

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the transition change the direction

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.200 
the transition change the direction
things<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.129> think<00:00:44.219> coming<00:00:44.940> out<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
things so I think coming out of the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.420 
things so I think coming out of the
combine<00:00:45.690> Gilbert<00:00:46.410> might<00:00:46.620> nudge<00:00:46.920> ahead<00:00:47.250> now

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
combine Gilbert might nudge ahead now

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.100 
combine Gilbert might nudge ahead now

combine studs in an earlier video was

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.290 
combine studs in an earlier video was
Bradley<00:00:52.289> Roby<00:00:52.559> from<00:00:52.890> Ohio<00:00:53.219> State<00:00:53.610> he'll<00:00:54.090> and

Bradley Roby from Ohio State he'll and

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.580 
Bradley Roby from Ohio State he'll and
in<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.510> fourth<00:00:54.780> three<00:00:55.020> showed<00:00:55.289> excellent

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
in the fourth three showed excellent

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.040 
in the fourth three showed excellent

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.529 
cover Jared Abbrederis against Wisconsin
during<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.930> season<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:01.770> over<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.550> course<00:01:03.239> of

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
during the season but over the course of

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.870 
during the season but over the course of
time<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.229> think<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.680> pro<00:01:04.920> scouts<00:01:05.250> see<00:01:05.519> him<00:01:05.729> as

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
time I think the pro scouts see him as

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.140 
time I think the pro scouts see him as
somebody<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.630> can't<00:01:06.960> teach<00:01:07.350> or<00:01:07.590> coach<00:01:07.799> 4:35<00:01:08.640> we

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
somebody we can't teach or coach 4:35 we

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.730 
somebody we can't teach or coach 4:35 we
can<00:01:09.330> clean<00:01:09.570> up<00:01:09.600> some<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.020> his<00:01:10.080> technique<00:01:10.560> in

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
can clean up some of his technique in

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.830 
can clean up some of his technique in
his<00:01:10.770> eye<00:01:11.130> control<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.060> think<00:01:12.510> you'll<00:01:12.659> see

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
his eye control so I think you'll see

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.410 
his eye control so I think you'll see

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
excellent workout at the combine I think

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.710 
excellent workout at the combine I think
he's<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> fringe<00:01:26.729> first<00:01:27.060> rounder<00:01:27.509> now

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
he's a fringe first rounder now

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.510 
he's a fringe first rounder now
certainly<00:01:28.470> no<00:01:28.619> less<00:01:28.770> than<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.040> second<00:01:29.369> round

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
certainly no less than the second round

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.310 
certainly no less than the second round

about<00:03:18.440> Terrence<00:03:19.220> Brooks<00:03:19.489> from<00:03:19.700> Florida<00:03:20.120> State

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
about Terrence Brooks from Florida State

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.599 
about Terrence Brooks from Florida State
now<00:03:21.019> his<00:03:21.290> agents<00:03:21.739> told<00:03:22.010> me<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:22.280> he<00:03:22.340> was<00:03:22.459> going

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
now his agents told me that he was going

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.940 
now his agents told me that he was going
to<00:03:22.670> run<00:03:22.880> fast<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:23.870> believed<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:24.530> he<00:03:24.739> did

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
to run fast and I believed it and he did

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.009 
to run fast and I believed it and he did
he<00:03:25.100> ran<00:03:25.280> in<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.459> low<00:03:25.639> for<00:03:25.940> force<00:03:26.269> I<00:03:26.510> think<00:03:26.660> that

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
he ran in the low for force I think that

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.110 
he ran in the low for force I think that
certainly<00:03:27.380> helps<00:03:27.769> keep<00:03:28.040> him<00:03:28.310> probably<00:03:28.850> in<00:03:29.000> the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
certainly helps keep him probably in the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.780 
certainly helps keep him probably in the
third<00:03:29.329> or<00:03:29.480> fourth<00:03:29.720> round<00:03:29.810> area<00:03:30.380> and<00:03:30.590> then<00:03:31.100> Deon

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
third or fourth round area and then Deon

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.849

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
I'm not mistaken there's a bigger

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.110 
I'm not mistaken there's a bigger
physical<00:03:45.440> safety<00:03:45.739> that<00:03:46.340> has<00:03:46.370> shown<00:03:46.760> more

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
physical safety that has shown more
