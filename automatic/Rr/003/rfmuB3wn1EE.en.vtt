need to read the back of the box with

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.250 
need to read the back of the box with
these<00:00:40.399> because<00:00:41.399> one<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.030> gonna<00:00:45.260> there's

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
these because one is gonna there's

these because one is gonna there's
another<00:00:46.530> version<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
another version of this but it's a

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.130 
another version of this but it's a
straight<00:00:48.329> up

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.290

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
will break off my hair because my hair

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.979 
will break off my hair because my hair
don't<00:00:58.949> need<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.219> much<00:00:59.480> if<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.629> have<00:01:00.660> finer

hair straighter hair you probably need

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.429 
hair straighter hair you probably need
more<00:01:02.579> protein<00:01:03.090> than<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.329> would<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.049> would

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
more protein than I would so I would

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.250 
more protein than I would so I would
advise<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:05.339> take<00:01:05.610> protein<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.840> very

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
conditioner and at first I was kind of

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.420 
conditioner and at first I was kind of
skeptical<00:01:31.500> because<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:32.009> thought<00:01:32.159> my<00:01:32.310> hair

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
skeptical because I thought my hair

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.910 
skeptical because I thought my hair
would<00:01:32.549> be<00:01:32.640> hard<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.810> my<00:01:34.110> hair<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:34.409> not<00:01:34.470> hard

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
would be hard but my hair was not hard

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.190 
would be hard but my hair was not hard
at<00:01:35.070> all<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.549> was<00:01:35.670> very<00:01:36.000> moisturized<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:37.049> was

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
at all it was very moisturized it was

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.560 
at all it was very moisturized it was
very<00:01:37.409> strong<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.579> elasticity<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.420> my

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
very strong and the elasticity in my

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.749 
very strong and the elasticity in my
hair<00:01:39.780> was<00:01:39.990> corrected<00:01:41.479> it<00:01:42.479> has<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> nice<00:01:43.020> smell

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
hair was corrected it has a nice smell

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.280 
hair was corrected it has a nice smell
but<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:45.770> use<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.799> like<00:01:47.040> three<00:01:47.310> times<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.079> was

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
but I use it like three times and I was

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.800 
but I use it like three times and I was
like<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:50.430> when<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.820> used<00:01:51.060> 14<00:01:51.360> conditioner

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
like this when I used 14 conditioner

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.450 
like this when I used 14 conditioner
okay<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> first<00:01:52.229> time<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.560> works<00:01:52.710> out<00:01:52.890> fine<00:01:53.100> I

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
okay the first time it works out fine I

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.740 
okay the first time it works out fine I
want<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.030> see<00:01:54.090> what<00:01:54.210> happens<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.630> next

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
want to see what happens on the next

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.120 
want to see what happens on the next
time<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.110> next<00:01:55.259> time<00:01:55.439> wash<00:01:55.590> my<00:01:55.740> hair<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.920> had<00:01:56.040> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
time so next time wash my hair I had the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.030 
time so next time wash my hair I had the
same<00:01:56.310> result<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.820> third<00:01:57.000> time<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.719> same

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
same result the third time the same

same result the third time the same
result<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.159> was<00:01:59.369> thinking<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.969> with<00:02:00.119> my

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
result I was thinking that it with my

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.139 
result I was thinking that it with my
hair<00:02:00.509> will<00:02:00.659> visually<00:02:01.079> get<00:02:01.290> hard<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.030> it<00:02:03.030> would

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
hair will visually get hard and it would

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.959 
hair will visually get hard and it would
be<00:02:03.240> too<00:02:03.450> much<00:02:03.630> protein<00:02:04.189> for<00:02:05.189> my<00:02:05.369> hair<00:02:05.670> because

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
be too much protein for my hair because

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.010 
be too much protein for my hair because
sickle<00:02:06.299> me<00:02:06.420> silk<00:02:07.049> amino<00:02:07.469> acids<00:02:08.069> are<00:02:08.310> protein

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
sickle me silk amino acids are protein

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.760 
sickle me silk amino acids are protein
hydrolyzed<00:02:10.020> wheat<00:02:10.229> protein

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
hydrolyzed wheat protein

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.370 
hydrolyzed wheat protein
is<00:02:10.950> protein<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.820> coconut<00:02:12.780> oil<00:02:12.960> helps<00:02:13.110> retain

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
is protein and coconut oil helps retain

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.160 
is protein and coconut oil helps retain
the<00:02:13.740> proteins<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.610> your<00:02:14.760> hair<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.690> figured

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
the proteins in your hair so I figured

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.640 
the proteins in your hair so I figured
that<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.440> would<00:02:16.560> be<00:02:16.650> too<00:02:16.950> much<00:02:17.360> protein<00:02:18.360> for<00:02:19.230> my

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
that it would be too much protein for my

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.810 
that it would be too much protein for my
hair<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.070> take<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:21.650> conditioner<00:02:22.650> form<00:02:23.310> and

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
hair to take in a conditioner form and

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.340 
hair to take in a conditioner form and
just<00:02:24.090> for<00:02:24.300> co-washing<00:02:24.690> i'll<00:02:24.930> have<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.200> do<00:02:25.320> a

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
just for co-washing i'll have to do a

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.710 
just for co-washing i'll have to do a
moisturizing<00:02:25.860> treatment<00:02:26.220> but<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.030> didn't

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
moisturizing treatment but I didn't

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.050

the<00:02:39.150> major<00:02:39.420> problem<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.900> had<00:02:40.080> with<00:02:40.170> this

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
the major problem I had with this

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.250 
the major problem I had with this
conditioner<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:41.100> finding<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.120> same<00:02:42.480> exact

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
conditioner is finding the same exact

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.920 
conditioner is finding the same exact
one<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.950> think<00:02:44.610> also<00:02:44.820> has<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.420> same<00:02:45.630> as<00:02:45.810> that

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
one I think also has the same as that

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.190 
one I think also has the same as that
version<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:47.030> Walmart<00:02:48.030> does<00:02:48.180> not<00:02:48.420> right

as soon not long rains or not they have

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.110 
as soon not long rains or not they have
the<00:02:52.350> other<00:02:52.530> version<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.070> it<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:53.940> was<00:02:54.060> the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
the other version of it so that was the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.790 
the other version of it so that was the
only<00:02:54.180> problem<00:02:54.600> with<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:55.020> conditioner<00:02:55.620> was

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
only problem with this conditioner was

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.370 
only problem with this conditioner was
finding<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.370> same<00:02:57.230> conditioner<00:02:58.230> and

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
finding the same conditioner and

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.410 
finding the same conditioner and
actually<00:02:58.770> have<00:02:58.890> enough<00:02:59.250> another<00:02:59.760> enough<00:03:00.210> in

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
actually have enough another enough in

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.910 
actually have enough another enough in
here<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.600> do<00:03:00.810> another<00:03:01.080> wash<00:03:01.350> with<00:03:01.620> like<00:03:01.800> I

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
here to do another wash with like I

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.100 
here to do another wash with like I
think<00:03:01.980> there's<00:03:02.280> like<00:03:02.370> this<00:03:02.580> much<00:03:02.850> in<00:03:03.030> here<00:03:03.240> so

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
think there's like this much in here so

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.410 
think there's like this much in here so
I<00:03:04.140> could<00:03:04.380> do<00:03:04.470> like<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.620> fourth<00:03:05.420> protein

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
I could do like a fourth protein

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.160 
I could do like a fourth protein
