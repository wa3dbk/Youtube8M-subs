 I want to introduce this game if you 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.789
 Are you thinking of taking a card this game is? 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.739
 used in many countries as a 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.590
 training before you leave for the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.780
 street in russia including this match was 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.280
 developed there and is used there in the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.500
 auto schools 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.710
 Can you see the cart with 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.510
 marrow graphics - but you will see that 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.060
 despite the more or less graphics 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.430
 the game is super complete you are 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.400
 seeing who is here warned the guess 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.320
 despite the fact that it has a wide range 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.700
 our panela division faces and 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.670
 deep 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.130
 although you may have several things for 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.960
 Example Let's talk button to 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:34.829
 call the car of the time 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.770
 second thing stop and parking brake 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.329
 third thing so security if not 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.530
 just the seat belt 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:49.119
 still have to connect a button s that 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:52.490
 clean glass is not light only the beast 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.710
 so that's how I'm going to show you 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.789
 she is on let it viralata do 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:03.229
 that is connected to this cheat sheets to 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:06.110
 Behold, this head cable, I did not study 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:10.700
 with the controls that I set myself 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:14.150
 let's go there and go on and on 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.120
 connected at night is very useful physics of 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.540
 alert and let's go, it's time to put 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.750
 to run they had family fights 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.950
 sees all that failed to run 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.840
 pointing to the left made a 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.120
 Interesting video takes a look at the 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.860
 my little feet 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.519
 I need to get my foot in the clutch to 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.950
 to walk or imitate a car of 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:44.630
 true if you take your foot off the clutch 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.079
 The car dies is car died 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.840
 You need to start the car again. 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:55.430
 to make a noise in the street that 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:58.459
 Geez, let's turn right in the hour, right? 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.440
 Who is learning to drive the sonso? 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.810
 car is very well made will you 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.269
 when you have to do the 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.370
 change of gear by the sound of the car you 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.609
 You will not have to keep looking there pro 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.470
 turn of rpm for who will direct if 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.530
 a great thing to get you started 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.720
 Pick up some car keys to 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.420
 start driving well do not start 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.430
 driving that crisis is matec to 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.250
 in the whole system I speak and 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.660
 lane traffic is true 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.610
 finally 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.830
 There are more things to do with the game. Let's go. 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.500
 There are going to continue and more things to 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.500
 show the tractor here another environment 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:41.360
 I'm going to give a little something the car will solve 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.320
 the same ritual before connecting the 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.820
 car 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:49.730
 the handbrake seat belt in the 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.560
 to look back and then yes 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.360
 get out of my car 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.750
 or are they things you need 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.060
 to take a self-study test there 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.220
 You're taking the mothers here because 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.680
 you really need to make you do not 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.110
 you have so much sense of distance because 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.000
 a virtual thing without going to see it 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.480
 in game today the first time I'm 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.880
 playing he looks at me doing shit 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.520
 when I saw the car following what I 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.170
 to hear the vision look on the side also this 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.780
 the game setting 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.940
 your vision does not stare at 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.030
 front with many locals 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.380
 she accompanies the action scene all 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.660
 simulator in my opinion should be 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.940
 that's not the square thing. 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.970
 looking forward and accompanying 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.240
 This is a scene and this cable sucks. 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.030
 the beauty action scenes something else that 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.550
 I want to show the game, is this it? 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.830
 this is the career mode is an oil 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.050
 What are you going to do as a school? 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.419
 it will be a scale of 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.490
 Fucking you, you talk, you never finished. 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.860
 drove a car in my life 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.470
 it gives you information on the screen of what you have 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.810
 what to do there written for example that is 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.220
 a simple exercise and it begins to 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.030
 talking it is important to wear the 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.100
 safety 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.560
 Let's put the seat belt on then. 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.540
 the asepsis to start the car 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.790
 you have to turn left 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.220
 Why are you leaving? You need to download. 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.800
 the parking brake is needed to engage 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.570
 first gear and needs to accelerate everything 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.180
 it gives you information in the 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:23.090
 screen you need to do and if you knew 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.790
 very stupid even if it solves more 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:29.980
 for the front that thing takes more to 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:33.350
 in front of you without making you 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.780
 Tucão Dude you have the city in the hour 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.240
 of the peak this is interesting in this game 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.240
 nato 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.210
 he has a time in one hour there is one 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.569
 hour cycle you get morning hours and 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:49.919
 afternoon hours if you pick up pico pancho from 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:51.960
 Dog Happens Face Transit And 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.330
 it still rains it rains 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.690
 there is this transit of the field with rain 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:00.000
 Then, for those who enjoy, you'll find a lot of 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.669
 time it's really worth giving a 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.599
 you are seeing g27 there 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:07.770
 in the corner today 27 bit perfectly 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.490
 game 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.409
 Beauty, this was my tip today. 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:16.169
 I'll drive the next few days 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:18.569
 bring much more content I want to bring 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:20.819
 mold this game you will see that it has 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:24.449
 too much hate that adds real car 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:27.690
 here I have seen on the internet on youtube the 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:30.180
 dodge charger baguí picking up 200 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.550
 kilometers per hour face much of the time 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.349
 and how you are Brazilian of course you 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.270
 Go get this game and do one of the 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:39.840
 The things we do here in Brazil 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:41.370
 that's fucking talk and they're such ask it 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.159
 here you can not extrapolate in life 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.199
 real but here you may not true 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:47.849
 so stay tuned on the channel in the next 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:50.490
 I'm going to bring some more stuff over there. 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:54.509
 remember that we have that series g 27 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:56.849
 next topic of that series g 27 and this 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:59.490
 our cable in the plane of God that 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:02.039
 search next topic of that series g 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.800
 27min is easy to beck force feedback 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:07.229
 also works in this game so let's 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.750
 joining all this is the simulation blog 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:11.669
 What is the simulation channel was the trick? 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.340
 is bringing the union 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:16.560
 I'm bringing 27 content by adding 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.719
 progressively 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.130
