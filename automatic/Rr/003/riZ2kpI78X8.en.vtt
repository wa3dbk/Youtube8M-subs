00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.680
 hi planeta hobby with you today 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.360
 today in our video review 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.309
 consider a boat radio-controlled 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.730
 firms tandyr keygen 

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:35.480
 seven hundred avanti offshore 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.040
 twenty millimeters long and wide 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:44.690
 210 millimeters and and weighing 12 kilograms 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.690
 let's start to consider its configuration 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:14.860
 as we see the set we have stand 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:27.780
 the wooden structure itself is still in 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:30.610
 we have a two-channel remote control 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.229
 with the possibility of adjustments and setting 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:39.760
 remote cult we come up a little later 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.830
 when we check the boat also for 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.110
 boat launch will be needed 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.479
 battery as we see in the kit 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.910
 charging and battery them not included 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.490
 it will be necessary to buy from it 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.990
 separately, all this can be found here 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.960
 on the website in the battery section and 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.710
 battery charger here 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:11.800
 required for three banks 11 1 volts 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:16.209
 with a capacity from 1000 1800 to 2000 mm 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:27.120
 boats made of hard plastic bs 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:27.120
 plastic here is also a plastic cover 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.820
 inside mounted brushless 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.820
 engine 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:44.290
 outrunner rotor outer also visible 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:49.440
 for the sake of the block opens here we see 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:52.630
 40 amp servo control 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.959
 on the boat installed power connector three 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:59.190
 connector and receiver 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.190
 up to 2 tons 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.519
 the boat is fully assembled that is 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.860
 you only need to insert the battery 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:14.660
 put a finger-type battery with a remote 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:18.549
 the remote will need 6 pieces at this stage 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.549
 we will put our checks 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:47.709
 well and now we will start checking our 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:50.680
 the boat for this we take the battery 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:56.290
 firm jeans from 2,200 milliamps hours 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:04:05.080
 on three banks as we see it always 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:07.660
 perfectly weeping fit now 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.819
 let's go to the beer control function first 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.880
 turn on the remote 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:18.510
 see the indication on the right charging 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.489
 battery and power here by 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.190
 battery drain when they are 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.860
 the red indicator will already sit 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.350
 also all standard lights up 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.350
 settings here on albeit double 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:36.600
 costs 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:39.970
 trim trim tab trimmer 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:43.000
 here and also limiting extreme 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.840
 provisions now we will check it all on 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.669
 on sky test after turning on the remote 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.669
 we connect the connector 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:09.570
 it can check the steering 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:12.570
 first you have to remove the steering wheel now 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:16.460
 we remove double expenses at least once 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.870
 see rice complete elimination 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.250
 Steering wheel handles 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:27.060
 deviates by only a few 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:29.000
 degrees can also be increased and all 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:34.230
 the settings are regulated in a separate 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.760
 also check the work knock out control 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.760
 here are very proportional 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.760
 and 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:56.760
 You can also limit the course and also have 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.910
 control trimmer 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.860
 peers and which sets the direction 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.600
 movements that is and the village with constantly 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.820
 somewhere you swim away either to the right or 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.540
 you can always adjust to the left 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.610
 any position is a standard set 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:15.390
 functions for 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:18.090
 channel equipment and boats Katya 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.100
 reaches speeds of up to 50 kilometers 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:24.750
 hour by water 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:27.600
 Here is a very powerful well, and it is desirable to let 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:32.520
 on large open reservoirs also on 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:34.830
 the boat has a drain plug 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.970
 the boat got water can be pulled out 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:43.350
 cork 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:47.460
 do not drain the water is also important 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:51.660
 transom plates installed here 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:54.510
 this kinda stabilizers have them from 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.090
 genes in miss or drive your top 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.680
 the boat will either come off the water or 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.770
 Conversely stick podi 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:05.520
 factory boat is adjusted that is you 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:08.420
 don't have to bend them let's say that is 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.550
 she is complete and ready to swim 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.980
