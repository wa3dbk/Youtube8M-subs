 detailed instructions with this lever 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.219
 is the blinklicht and 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.219
 switched off 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.890
 to the right the lever will flash upwards 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.940
 press in the dashboard will this 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.739
 indicated by a green pilot light 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.530
 if you want to flash to the left the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.510
 lever down press this too 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.530
 is in the dashboard by a green

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.340
 the flashing light switches on 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.229
 Normally, this should automatically 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.479
 not the case then the lever with 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.340
 press the finger and here one 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.439
 trick how to remember if the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.259
 lever when flashing upwards or downwards 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.930
 must be pressed down when looking for 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.189
 right then the left moves 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.420
 hand up 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:36.600
 that means we notice us flashing right 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.490
 lever up if you turn left 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.210
 then the left hand moves 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.360
 below 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.619
 that means we remember left flashing 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.619
 lever down 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:53.780
 with this switch you turn that on 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.850
 warning flashing light, and again from 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.740
 with steering of pedals 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.630
 Parking brake and the circuit 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.060
 we still deal separately in 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.250
