00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:04.580
 welcome back to my physicist 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.000
 the physicists have 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 is the instrument 

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:13.679
 because the ball nurse again 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.809
 Spohn Mining 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.640
 the side effects exaggerated 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.539
 how he puts her into my fitness routine 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.550
 and then 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.550
 Just Stone 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.140
 and how does the program look 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.500
 move with the MMOs 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.500
 Netzhoppers 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.340
 Hold on to museums and they can solve the problem 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.450
 BÃ¶bel desired direction 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.280
 and with sprint you raced to hold on and 10 can do this 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.810
 Percent become optimal so 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.600
 Binzen physicists could he can also percent feet lying air 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.240
 Merck lay 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.320
 capture sparkling by report Tiger in May 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.020
 and let go is the wishful feeling 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.710
 and percent physicists take 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.420
 in Chile ranking once at my feet therefore kicking 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.240
 Tilts the desired turban 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.500
 a little bit of air 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.500
 push backwards with the mouse wheel in this form 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.280
 or with them 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.300
 hold on and how and is 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.300
 also push cool forward to the front 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.800
 Now I show you some important Zumiez 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.450
 For example, they would not have that 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.120
 the Wild School 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.159
 since you can attach it with it you can attach 2 60% wears UBS Annener 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.030
 This will be discussed by Swatch Group VIG, which is now happening 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.560
 Kuntz at the flier song also own 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.160
 there's the other one 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.320
 now the only physicists and resented 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.320
 I'm criticized together 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.829
 with the song "Me you can start renting a car 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:21.069
 and the specialist continues 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.069
 stuck for this one 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.259
 secondly, as in Winnenden 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:30.069
 and Sophia Matthes is desired 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.519
 we would have out 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.539
 have there 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:37.539
 they placed 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.529
 often heel 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:46.749
 on feet 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.169
 now you already have that o2 o 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.949
 There is dry looks pushing physics serious 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.089
 or simply more important life 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:58.089
 Mertes worked correctly 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.929
 Combo to another major wing percent frost 

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:05.979
 the 1 4 mill 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:08.939
 Suter Foster 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.939
 subject a specialist Spehr Holocaust times 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.249
 Garbage can here then you can extract your text in Sorbian 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:23.299
 and then it went around 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.299
 New York Kenzo and here could be the strength 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.199
 Set percent 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:33.429
 From a percentage shot, the castle saw the close of March instead of small 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.719
 and percent 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:39.089
 fresh cock push wakes up and ten assists back 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.709
 2 CDs 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.709
 and now dedicate to the name Black Keys 8 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.489
 I set myself a lot myself 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.529
 and then five more tests and heart
