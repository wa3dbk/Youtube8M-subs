this week's episode of parasite the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.800 
this week's episode of parasite the
maximum<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:59.069> very<00:02:59.610> heavy<00:02:59.940> episode<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.720> was

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
effective in showing like how this whole

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.550 
effective in showing like how this whole

ran into this other random parasite just
makes<00:04:26.039> me<00:04:26.160> think<00:04:26.310> oh<00:04:26.849> genichi<00:04:27.750> you

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.180 
makes me think oh genichi you
probably<00:04:28.560> better<00:04:28.710> get<00:04:28.889> back<00:04:29.009> to<00:04:29.099> that

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
probably better get back to that

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.010 
probably better get back to that
hospital<00:04:29.699> real<00:04:29.910> soon<00:04:30.180> because<00:04:30.389> she<00:04:30.780> could<00:04:30.930> be

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
hospital real soon because she could be

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.619 
hospital real soon because she could be
anywhere<00:04:31.470> at<00:04:31.620> any<00:04:31.770> moment<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:32.539> that's<00:04:33.539> the

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:33.629 
anywhere at any moment and that's the

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:35.059 
anywhere at any moment and that's the
thing<00:04:33.810> he<00:04:33.990> can't<00:04:34.169> really<00:04:34.379> sense<00:04:34.620> like<00:04:34.770> what
