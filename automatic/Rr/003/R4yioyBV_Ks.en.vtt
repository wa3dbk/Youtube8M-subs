00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 the love goes here now is a very 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.750
 spontaneous video I have completely 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.760
 spontaneously determined the camera 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.320
 to turn on and briefly to make a video 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.759
 That's why I do not think big 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.900
 prepared my hair one then 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.450
 a little bit bad for that reason I have 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.310
 first dicaprio put on and yes me 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.380
 wanted to share my opinion on the topic 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.830
 because I have just a moment just a 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.619
 video on teeth whitening seen 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.939
 and yes, I've had it a few times already 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.460
 video I just thought and thought so 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.590
 my video with my opinion about it because 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.149
 pitching this with this subject teeth 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.370
 on youtube in my opinion one 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.649
 is handled a bit recklessly 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.719
 that is always said so yes then goes 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.910
 your teeth at home and he 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.969
 could do it and then do that and 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.200
 yes no problem and not me 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.660
 Some believe they are not in it 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.700
 clear that no beating too very much 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.940
 bad teeth is missing i am too 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.239
 no dentist no profi i know that 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.350
 just because I read it or 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.160
 have heard or 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.170
 yes you are just white yourself 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.260
 whitening is very very bad for the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.939
 Teeth is attacking the enamel and 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.040
 The enamel is a very important one 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.869
 substance in our body 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.479
 I believe the hardest substance in the world 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.950
 body and yes is the top layer 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.299
 the cell that protects the teeth and also 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.909
 very important and if that the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.229
 Once enamel is gone then he comes 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.780
 is not there again and again 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.240
 but was very important for 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:37.140
 us and he can be damaged by 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:41.360
 acidic foods and just as well 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.380
 yes no flowers and yes somehow 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.140
 the trend has been around for quite some time 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.960
 teeth just to offer at home 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.299
 with such beijing strip or also 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.939
 with even beache suits us in small 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.000
 device or similar or two small ones 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.619
 What else is there in any case 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.689
 have just seen a video and thought 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.070
 oh god how can one so easily gets 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.189
 persuade to look there 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.129
 no idea you look at the age of 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.979
 No idea 12 to 17 years 18 years 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.420
 or older and you just think 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.710
 also that no problem that one can 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.320
 easy 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.030
 But this scene is so offer 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.470
 really so bad and that will be yes 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.530
 also always described that too 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.170
 Pain causes and teeth 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.240
 respond to it sensitive to pain and 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.070
 even then ask the question slightly 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.210
 whether the good or bad matter is the main thing 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.070
 White teeth 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.870
 it may be that the cell afterwards 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.420
 but we know what helps we help 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.560
 Continue if you feel like it afterwards 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.800
 are sensitive to pain and attacked 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.690
 are and maybe even 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.090
 discolour faster and easier 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.100
 so if you look at the teeth 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.300
 then you want to let flash 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.830
 maybe go first to the dentist 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.330
 and then maybe you can do that there 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.210
 professional make I think now 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.910
 knows then rather water can do and 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.470
 how long that can take effect and 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.000
 So I think you should be right 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.610
 do not be so frivolous and handle this 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.450
 look at stripes for too long 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.000
 or so often used just because you 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.520
 White teeth are chasing after this dream 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.550
 In addition , you can also continue to cell 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.800
 look very funny again 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.020
 I do not think anyone is right by nature 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.440
 white teeth the tooth color is all right 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.690
 not so brilliant white but 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.450
 Person I have you say pebble knows 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.070
 approximately 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.450
 yes and I think you should too 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.250
 maybe before finally his stayed 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:37.370
 First of all , take care of your teeth differently 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.380
 clean brush floss use yes 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.850
 pay attention because some maybe 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.880
 The number does not really matter 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.320
 and then have discolored teeth and 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.540
 think if you love yourself then 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.960
 everything is fine again but you can go before that 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.420
 first of all make other things before 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.970
 you then right here to the beache attacks 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.180
 yes as I said I'm not synonymous profi 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.210
 but I think everyone should know that 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.540
 if that hurts or something like that then 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.370
 you should leave that anyway and there 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.110
 to order the teeth around 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.930
 I think that's really not a good thing 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.450
 So at Haren there you can get the hair 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.010
 Dye that grows out of the hair again 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.750
 but maybe they are just growing 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.060
 After the enamel is just a thing 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.360
 she will not come back when the 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.170
 Once it is worn off and I believe that 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.420
 was really a professional and left 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.030
 not any riding rings trips 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.580
 order and then start there yourself 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.580
 or maybe if you yourself 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.620
 really wants to try on that 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.360
 respect the description and that really 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.180
 after the instruction and then also 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.830
 not like the ladies now a video 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.040
 to fall asleep for six hours 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.480
 on the cells so I think so 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.330
 the teeth are something important and 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.980
 everyone wants to have nice teeth and then 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.070
 You should not exaggerate it 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.260
 and somehow create a hand, yes 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.880
 That was my short statement on the topic 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.200
 teeth flash you can feel free in the 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.730
 Comments write something about it 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.140
 thinks maybe the same would have 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.460
 opinion you think so too or 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.900
 Exaggerates totally there is nothing 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.160
 there 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.690
 Let's just discuss it maybe 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.250
 not always with my opinion yes too 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.350
 wrong i'm not a pro like either 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.890
 But I wanted to talk to you 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:21.440
 I can drop off the mothers again 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.440
 and a video that's good
