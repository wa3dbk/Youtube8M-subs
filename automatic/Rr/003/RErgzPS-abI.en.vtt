hello my name is John Dooley and I had

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.940 
hello my name is John Dooley and I had
my<00:00:06.270> laser<00:00:06.509> treatment<00:00:07.049> done<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.230> month<00:00:07.649> ago

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
my laser treatment done a month ago

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.470 
my laser treatment done a month ago
H<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.820> in<00:00:09.330> Holly<00:00:09.840> Street<00:00:10.469> well<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.219> wasn't<00:00:11.580> quite

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
H is in Holly Street well I wasn't quite

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.930 
H is in Holly Street well I wasn't quite
happy<00:00:13.110> with<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.710> linear<00:00:13.980> hairline<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.880> I

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
happy with the linear hairline that I

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.500 
happy with the linear hairline that I
had<00:00:15.120> before<00:00:16.369> it<00:00:17.369> was<00:00:17.580> much<00:00:17.940> better<00:00:18.240> than<00:00:18.420> the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
had before it was much better than the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.670 
had before it was much better than the
alternative<00:00:19.400> although<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.699> felt<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:23.000> the<00:00:24.000> new

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
alternative although I felt that the new

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.759 
alternative although I felt that the new
softer<00:00:25.680> hair<00:00:26.340> lines<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.880> H<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.769> provided

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
softer hair lines that H is provided

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.069 
softer hair lines that H is provided
would<00:00:29.099> be<00:00:29.310> much<00:00:30.000> more<00:00:30.300> suitable<00:00:30.900> for<00:00:31.170> me<00:00:31.320> and

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
would be much more suitable for me and

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.310 
would be much more suitable for me and
that's<00:00:34.079> why<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.350> had<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:35.450> old<00:00:36.450> hairline<00:00:36.870> taken

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
that's why I had the old hairline taken

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.060 
that's why I had the old hairline taken
off<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.800> had<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.969> new<00:00:39.410> new<00:00:40.410> feathered

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
off and had the new new feathered

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.950 
off and had the new new feathered
hairline<00:00:41.489> put<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.059> place<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.629> think<00:00:42.840> it

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
hairline put in place and I think it

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.990 
hairline put in place and I think it
looks<00:00:43.079> brilliant<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.739> think<00:00:43.770> he<00:00:44.070> looks<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.969> much

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.830 
looks brilliant I think he looks so much
more<00:00:45.210> natural<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.879> and<00:00:47.879> very<00:00:48.420> pleased<00:00:48.690> with

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
more natural and and very pleased with

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.990

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
it the laser treatment was a little bit

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.410 
it the laser treatment was a little bit
if<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.120> want<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.300> say<00:00:54.390> painful<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.829> was<00:00:56.420> as

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
if I want to say painful it was as

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.689 
if I want to say painful it was as
somebody<00:00:58.020> else<00:00:59.090> HS<00:01:00.090> has<00:01:00.420> said<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.020> me<00:01:01.219> it<00:01:02.219> feels

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
somebody else HS has said to me it feels

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.299 
somebody else HS has said to me it feels
like<00:01:03.199> it<00:01:04.199> feels<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.559> you're<00:01:04.769> being<00:01:04.799> pinged

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
like it feels like you're being pinged

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.580 
like it feels like you're being pinged
lightly<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.030> an<00:01:06.150> elastic<00:01:06.420> band<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:07.409> is

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
lightly with an elastic band it is

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.250 
lightly with an elastic band it is
bearable<00:01:07.890> but<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:08.810> not<00:01:09.810> completely

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
bearable but it's not completely

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.490 
bearable but it's not completely
painless<00:01:10.729> although<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.760> think<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.500> totally

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
painless although I think it is totally

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.190 
painless although I think it is totally
worth<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.220> think<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.869> think<00:01:15.930> it's

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
worth it I think it's I think it's

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.859 
worth it I think it's I think it's
reassuring<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:17.280> hoas<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:19.009> undo<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.280> work

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
in case you know you decide to want it

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.600 
in case you know you decide to want it
like<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.990> did<00:01:25.200> change<00:01:25.500> your<00:01:25.830> hairline<00:01:26.250> or<00:01:26.490> and

treatment done just to be sure that the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.210 
treatment done just to be sure that the

there the laser treatment is healed

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.440 
there the laser treatment is healed
fully<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:19.380> so<00:02:20.380> yes<00:02:21.340> oh<00:02:21.460> it<00:02:21.550> was<00:02:21.670> six<00:02:22.240> to<00:02:22.360> eight

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
fully and so yes oh it was six to eight

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.530 
fully and so yes oh it was six to eight
weeks<00:02:22.690> after<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:24.100> had<00:02:24.190> my<00:02:24.370> treatment<00:02:24.790> done<00:02:24.940> yeah

weeks after I had my treatment done yeah

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.390 
weeks after I had my treatment done yeah
I<00:02:25.570> think<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.840> February<00:02:26.260> effect<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:26.830> really

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
I think the February effect is really

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.990 
I think the February effect is really
good<00:02:27.700> he's<00:02:28.540> he's<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.200> world<00:02:29.620> apart<00:02:29.980> from<00:02:30.130> what<00:02:30.970> I

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
good he's he's a world apart from what I

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.240 
good he's he's a world apart from what I
