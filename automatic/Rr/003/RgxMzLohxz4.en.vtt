00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
this if you can't find this exact brand

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.600 
this if you can't find this exact brand
in<00:00:57.490> your<00:00:57.700> store<00:00:58.470> this<00:00:59.470> is<00:00:59.650> called<00:00:59.980> reduced

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
in your store this is called reduced

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.590 
in your store this is called reduced
carb<00:01:01.090> half<00:01:01.780> the<00:01:02.020> carbs<00:01:02.470> pasta<00:01:03.340> and<00:01:03.579> on<00:01:04.449> the

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
carb half the carbs pasta and on the

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.319 
carb half the carbs pasta and on the
label<00:01:05.019> it<00:01:05.140> says<00:01:05.470> that<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.460> serving<00:01:06.820> size<00:01:07.060> is<00:01:07.090> a

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.329 
label it says that the serving size is a

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:09.960 
label it says that the serving size is a
half<00:01:07.630> a<00:01:07.780> cup<00:01:07.810> dry<00:01:08.380> so<00:01:09.040> you<00:01:09.130> know<00:01:09.400> a<00:01:09.430> half<00:01:09.790> a<00:01:09.939> cup

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
half a cup dry so you know a half a cup

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.249 
half a cup dry so you know a half a cup
dry<00:01:10.479> is<00:01:10.540> going<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.020> be<00:01:11.200> a<00:01:11.409> whole<00:01:12.219> cup<00:01:12.990> cooked<00:01:13.990> or

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
dry is going to be a whole cup cooked or

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.499 
dry is going to be a whole cup cooked or
or<00:01:14.799> more<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.369> so<00:01:15.819> that's<00:01:15.969> a<00:01:16.119> pretty<00:01:16.270> good

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
or more and so that's a pretty good

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.349 
or more and so that's a pretty good
serving<00:01:17.049> and<00:01:17.609> the<00:01:18.609> fat<00:01:18.909> is<00:01:19.210> one<00:01:19.479> gram<00:01:19.840> and

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359 
serving and the fat is one gram and

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:25.080 
serving and the fat is one gram and
carbs<00:01:22.359> 31<00:01:23.139> so<00:01:23.799> you<00:01:23.859> do<00:01:24.100> still<00:01:24.159> have<00:01:24.429> some<00:01:24.759> parts

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
carbs 31 so you do still have some parts

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.069 
carbs 31 so you do still have some parts
in<00:01:25.270> there<00:01:25.509> but<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.350> fiber<00:01:26.710> is<00:01:26.979> 12<00:01:27.759> so<00:01:28.749> when<00:01:28.960> you

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
in there but the fiber is 12 so when you

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.889 
in there but the fiber is 12 so when you
have<00:01:29.259> higher<00:01:29.590> fiber<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:30.609> you<00:01:31.479> eat<00:01:31.719> it<00:01:31.869> with

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
have higher fiber and you eat it with

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.580 
have higher fiber and you eat it with
carbs<00:01:32.590> it<00:01:32.889> slows<00:01:33.729> down<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.420> absorption<00:01:34.590> of

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
carbs it slows down the absorption of

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.620 
carbs it slows down the absorption of
the<00:01:36.130> carbohydrates<00:01:36.880> into<00:01:37.119> your<00:01:37.359> bloodstream

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
the carbohydrates into your bloodstream

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.260 
the carbohydrates into your bloodstream
the<00:01:38.259> sugar<00:01:38.560> into<00:01:39.340> your<00:01:39.490> blood<00:01:39.729> stream<00:01:39.759> from

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
the sugar into your blood stream from

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.760 
the sugar into your blood stream from
the<00:01:40.329> carbs<00:01:40.899> and<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:42.569> effectively<00:01:43.590> reduces<00:01:44.590> the

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
the carbs and so effectively reduces the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.849 
the carbs and so effectively reduces the
effect<00:01:45.280> of<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:46.539> glucose<00:01:47.229> on<00:01:47.530> your

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859 
effect of the glucose on your

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:50.819 
effect of the glucose on your
bloodstream<00:01:48.249> in<00:01:48.719> addition<00:01:49.719> to<00:01:49.929> this<00:01:50.350> product

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
bloodstream in addition to this product

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.459 
bloodstream in addition to this product
also<00:01:50.979> has<00:01:51.310> 16<00:01:51.759> grams<00:01:51.969> of<00:01:52.179> protein<00:01:52.359> any<00:01:53.139> time

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
also has 16 grams of protein any time

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.580 
also has 16 grams of protein any time
you<00:01:53.649> eat<00:01:53.859> protein<00:01:54.520> with<00:01:55.029> carbs<00:01:55.539> it<00:01:55.749> also

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
you eat protein with carbs it also

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.569 
you eat protein with carbs it also
reduces<00:01:57.749> the<00:01:58.749> length<00:01:59.020> of<00:01:59.200> time<00:01:59.399> it<00:02:00.399> will

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
reduces the length of time it will

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.449 
reduces the length of time it will
lengthen<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:02.049> time<00:02:02.259> that<00:02:02.499> it<00:02:02.619> takes<00:02:02.829> for<00:02:03.100> the

00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:03.459 
lengthen the time that it takes for the

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:04.649 
lengthen the time that it takes for the
carps<00:02:03.759> to<00:02:03.909> get<00:02:04.060> into<00:02:04.270> your<00:02:04.389> bloodstream

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
carps to get into your bloodstream

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.160 
carps to get into your bloodstream
because<00:02:05.249> protein<00:02:06.249> digests<00:02:07.060> more<00:02:07.299> slowly<00:02:07.719> and

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
because protein digests more slowly and

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.520 
because protein digests more slowly and
so<00:02:09.009> you<00:02:09.580> may<00:02:09.759> see<00:02:09.819> on<00:02:10.060> here<00:02:10.420> Oh<00:02:10.630> 31

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
so you may see on here Oh 31

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.250 
so you may see on here Oh 31
I<00:02:11.770> should<00:02:11.980> need<00:02:12.190> it<00:02:12.370> but<00:02:12.970> when<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:13.510> also

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
I should need it but when you also

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.940 
I should need it but when you also
notice<00:02:14.709> that<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.580> has<00:02:16.080> high<00:02:17.080> fiber<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.800> high

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
notice that it has high fiber and high

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.520 
notice that it has high fiber and high
protein<00:02:18.459> then<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.360> makes<00:02:19.630> this<00:02:19.930> product

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
protein then that makes this product

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.940 
protein then that makes this product
okay<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.100> eat<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.670> I<00:02:22.120> just<00:02:22.420> love<00:02:22.870> this<00:02:23.560> pasta

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
okay to eat and I just love this pasta

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.059 
okay to eat and I just love this pasta
and<00:02:24.610> you<00:02:25.330> can<00:02:25.480> put<00:02:25.660> it<00:02:25.750> in<00:02:25.900> vegetable<00:02:26.470> soup<00:02:26.770> in

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
and you can put it in vegetable soup in

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.309 
and you can put it in vegetable soup in
