00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:22.140
 I came here to remind you not to dispute 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.240
 the headset goes 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.279
 And then welcome this video here from 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.619
 minecraft star wars in login brain 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.740
 br and good will start now starting 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.050
 I'm here with this emerald in my hand 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.149
 Dude, I gotta get my fast. 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.500
 Let's say I had a shovel to pay is 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.420
 good as hell that we can weigh 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.180
 pretty block g in the middle 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.460
 at first and I think I never had 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.160
 played on that map here then with this 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.480
 here a gameplay on the map deck link to 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.700
 Who does not know is how beautiful I think 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.590
 must be one based on the never on something of the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.809
 I think this business of what kind 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.579
 you get a london an item as well 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.460
 I think it was added recently, right? 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.420
 because I played only recently in the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.460
 login and password and show up 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.560
 It's me that bug was added today. 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.049

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.000
 business but it's cool, man's got enough 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.010
 credit I think almost 2 thousand 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.869
 almost two thousand 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.670
 credits but I have around 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.570
 so I think this law deal was 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.619
 Well, it was not cool. 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.360
 let me see here 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.080
 I think I've already got all the blocks. 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.150
 Dear God, you have a face that is closing me. 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.360
 I think I 'm going to kill that guy of mine. 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.150
 side there and then go for me, right? 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.860
 I already took it cute but look at the hand 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.200
 good since you can keep talking 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.880

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.979

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.250
 thing for you right time if you want 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.990
 I can share in the face of death 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.579
 mode is a very cool business that 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.280
 always wanted to bring the channel but this type 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.189
 I've never tried to know how to bring video type 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.860
 or a series of minecraft this will 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.439
 flying type I never tried to bring the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.750
 online channel teacher will then bring 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.340
 a series of harms will see with the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.350
 with guests or 100 guests but 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.470
 look only here the best option 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.440
 eight for nine years or sweat of hand 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.630
 Horrible coming back to the subject, huh? 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.880
 wanted to bring a series of survival or 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.210
 even presenting something of the type 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.880
 I realized that you do this to me, right? 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.820
 I never had a hope to try. 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.160
 so I ask for your support with feedback 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.200
 Morality is the girlfriend and propose the brothers 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.970

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.680
 It's just in video the hunger games and neither 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.230

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.430
 enough video because one type 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.910
 frequency 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.530
 whatever daily in a week I boot 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.360
 which has one or two videos to bet 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.880
 but I do not know what I'm recording is because 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.459

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.320
 It's totally difficult, man . 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.670

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.260

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.810

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.340

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.220

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.739

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:12.200
