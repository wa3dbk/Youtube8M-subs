00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.170
 Oh 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.050
 we 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.220
 hello welcome to the crossroads of 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.669
 artists we will learn by the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.859
 video 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.230
 how to make a glaze in painting and 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.070
 town so first of all I need 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.230
 of turpentine and that of m 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.430
 as you can see here this is 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.930
 my taste of houses so that is to say 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.900
 it is a taste of classic meanwhile 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.699
 I added that simply 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.290
 plastic plugs that prevents me from 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.670
 clean every time it's enough 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.850
 practical and it was the little trick of the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.850
 day 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.129
 that's a milk bottle cap 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.129
 to add red paint 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.109
 primary so today make it a 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.129
 glaze ie a layer 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.350
 transparent enough fluid to be able to 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.759
 change our colors on a painting to 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.210
 oil on oil that is already 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:15.090
 dry well sacha because the glaze is 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.140
 done on a painting that supported 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:24.890
 to dry then I pour in linseed oil 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.890
 in one of the buckets like this 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.420
 and then then glide from 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.420
 turpentine 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.470
 because the other side 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.870
 perfect 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.830
 spotless so here I took a brush 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.220
 a little damaged worn to be able to do 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:59.270
 the mixture of which you mix 2 him the 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.670
 field fluidify and there is the same kind of 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.750
 alter van tinh to get a 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:11.420
 transparent layer actually that's like 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.780
 the ones you mix well 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.780
 with a brush 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.280
 that's fine to learn it 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.670
 tested on a small piece of paper 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.319
 little see what that can it give 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.030
 see if you are in quebec with the 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:34.269
 color so go on we'll be able 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:36.500
 start on the web 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:41.180
 so it is an oil on canvas a 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.700
 so a dry paint and so I 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:49.579
 would like to do is unify a little 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:51.440
 little dress and make it a little bit 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:56.930
 darker since in you see 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:03:00.319
 it's a cons-day so here is ben 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.260
 listen I start to apply in my 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:06.400
 good mix 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.400
 I took a big 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.940
 with synthetic bristles on 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:25.349
 a flat brush 1 so here we are 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:25.349
 continue to spend on the dress 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.620
 so the glaze often allows background 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.910
 it's a painting applying a 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.410
 transparent layer which leaves 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.570
 to shine behind painting at 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.800
 oil that you have made ie 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:45.890
 the shades there that I have that I did 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.450
 so that allows them to unify a little 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.070
 little dress 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:53.410
 so I continue I'll try to 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:56.500
 do all the robin so we will proceed 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.500
 by order 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:09.200
 so that's it so I continue 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.459
 so a little advice is when you 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.480
 go dry at the glaze that the 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:17.470
 Glaze is quite liquid 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.470
 so if you dry in 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.850
 vertically this risk of flowing so 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.350
 you really have to lay the canvas flat 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.030
 to dry the glaze and then them 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.990
 or two days depending on the amount of 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.669
 glaze that you will have really put 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.080
 important it may leak to make 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:41.450
 burrs and after to catch up that goes 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:45.140
 not be very very pretty here 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.130
 I almost finished so we can 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.600
 do and glaze any 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.390
 color I would have liked to have a dress 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.060
 orange I will have I could add a 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.810
 little yellow glaze upstream it redone 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.180
 head a little poor so here I have you 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:03.710
 put the detail a little bit of duke the 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:08.750
 saw at the beginning of video you saw you 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:13.100
 had before and after sapiens unify 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:17.770
 the glaze so there we have a little bit of 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:20.210
 reflections of the day it flatters you a good 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.410
 Well here I hope we liked it well 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.080
 I give you an appointment on the workshop 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:29.720
 painting points like for a new 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.290
 course in video so see you soon on 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.070
 the site 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.070
 thank you
