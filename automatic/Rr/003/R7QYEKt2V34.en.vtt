00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:35.430
 Ma there I fun tool series carbonate complete recovery box 2 present for with a reverse switch of Tamiya 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:41.470
 This previous home also put 12 cm and connect the motor and rotate the star in reverse 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:46.600
 It is a plan to try to try motor break-in seriously 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:49.200
 Here become important is I'm such that know the number of revolutions of the motor 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:54.550
 The Ekon'na app 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.430

 I picked up the sound of the motor 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:18.030
 It is an application that calculates the number of revolutions from the frequency 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:22.710
 Yes First, using the cat app had been using until now 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.250
 Poverty the water that I mean had become to the number of revolutions of the outside Hokkaido 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.570
 I want to know 1 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.630

 So yeah I used the device 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.130
 I would like to find out the number of revolutions of the motor 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:59.160
 Yes i'm going 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.160
 [musics] 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.980
 Tsukiji

 This is the result of examining it 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:04.820
 It was higher than the number of revolutions written on the package 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:10.310
 It seems like high, but the number of rotations will increase as you move forward 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:11.450
 Video that I tried to make a motor break-in machine with this battery box for yes 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.689
