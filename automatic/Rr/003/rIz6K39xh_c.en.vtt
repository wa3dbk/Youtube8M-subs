coverage<00:03:51.199> area<00:03:51.530> had<00:03:51.739> to<00:03:51.829> drive<00:03:52.220> a<00:03:52.250> little<00:03:52.519> bit

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
coverage area had to drive a little bit

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.470 
coverage area had to drive a little bit
find<00:03:53.090> one<00:03:53.299> from<00:03:54.109> the<00:03:54.230> 18<00:03:54.440> c<00:03:54.620> store<00:03:54.799> anyway<00:03:55.129> and

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
find one from the 18 c store anyway and

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.550 
find one from the 18 c store anyway and
i'm<00:03:56.480> going<00:03:56.659> to<00:03:56.720> show<00:03:56.930> you<00:03:56.959> let's<00:03:57.230> see<00:03:57.319> if<00:03:57.379> i<00:03:57.409> can

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
i'm going to show you let's see if i can

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.580 
i'm going to show you let's see if i can
zoom<00:03:57.590> in<00:03:57.919> a<00:03:57.949> little<00:03:58.099> bit<00:03:58.220> here<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:59.530> show<00:04:00.530> you

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
zoom in a little bit here and show you

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.830 
zoom in a little bit here and show you
the<00:04:00.919> actual<00:04:01.069> speed<00:04:01.549> test<00:04:01.849> results<00:04:02.480> let<00:04:02.599> me<00:04:02.690> get

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
the actual speed test results let me get

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.680 
the actual speed test results let me get
rid<00:04:02.930> of<00:04:02.989> the<00:04:03.079> glare<00:04:05.230> we're<00:04:06.230> there<00:04:06.560> we<00:04:06.739> go<00:04:07.690> up

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
rid of the glare we're there we go up

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.319 
rid of the glare we're there we go up
and<00:04:09.139> they<00:04:09.500> were<00:04:09.530> okay<00:04:10.129> hopefully<00:04:10.970> you<00:04:11.060> can<00:04:11.180> see

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
and they were okay hopefully you can see

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:19.689 
and they were okay hopefully you can see
that<00:04:13.030> 1281<00:04:14.109> kbps<00:04:15.109> down<00:04:15.849> 351<00:04:16.849> kbps<00:04:17.810> up<00:04:18.489> now<00:04:19.489> that

that 1281 kbps down 351 kbps up now that
my<00:04:20.239> friends<00:04:20.659> is<00:04:20.750> actually<00:04:21.709> faster<00:04:21.919> than<00:04:22.159> i

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
my friends is actually faster than i

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.490 
my friends is actually faster than i
used<00:04:22.520> to<00:04:22.700> get<00:04:22.820> with<00:04:22.969> my

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
used to get with my

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.850 
used to get with my
yeah<00:04:23.620> evdo<00:04:24.460> I<00:04:24.970> would<00:04:25.210> be<00:04:25.420> in<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:25.860> probably

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
yeah evdo I would be in the probably

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.650 
yeah evdo I would be in the probably
average<00:04:27.070> around<00:04:27.220> 900<00:04:27.760> kilobits<00:04:28.120> per<00:04:28.180> second

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
average around 900 kilobits per second

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.020 
average around 900 kilobits per second
so<00:04:28.780> I'm<00:04:28.900> getting<00:04:29.230> a<00:04:29.290> falda<00:04:29.800> I'd<00:04:30.790> say<00:04:31.000> a

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
so I'm getting a falda I'd say a

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.360 
so I'm getting a falda I'd say a
33-percent<00:04:31.600> speed<00:04:32.080> boost<00:04:32.470> when<00:04:32.860> I'm<00:04:33.160> in<00:04:33.280> an

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
33-percent speed boost when I'm in an

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.450 
33-percent speed boost when I'm in an
hsdpa<00:04:33.970> coverage<00:04:34.570> area<00:04:35.070> that<00:04:36.070> may<00:04:36.280> be<00:04:36.340> the

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
hsdpa coverage area that may be the

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.440 
hsdpa coverage area that may be the
trick<00:04:37.390> for<00:04:37.420> me<00:04:37.690> is<00:04:38.010> finding<00:04:39.010> one<00:04:39.340> because<00:04:39.880> the

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
trick for me is finding one because the

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.140 
trick for me is finding one because the
coverage<00:04:40.750> area<00:04:40.900> is<00:04:41.110> by<00:04:41.410> me<00:04:41.560> or<00:04:41.590> not<00:04:41.920> all<00:04:42.790> that

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
coverage area is by me or not all that

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.710 
coverage area is by me or not all that
built<00:04:43.390> out<00:04:43.540> yet<00:04:43.780> so<00:04:44.290> in<00:04:44.590> any<00:04:45.250> case<00:04:45.370> I<00:04:45.850> haven't

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
built out yet so in any case I haven't

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.000 
built out yet so in any case I haven't
decided<00:04:47.080> if<00:04:47.200> I'm<00:04:47.260> going<00:04:47.380> to<00:04:47.470> keep<00:04:47.590> this<00:04:47.740> yet

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
decided if I'm going to keep this yet

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.610 
decided if I'm going to keep this yet
for<00:04:48.910> some<00:04:49.330> of<00:04:49.450> the<00:04:49.510> reasons<00:04:49.540> i'm<00:04:49.960> sharing<00:04:50.590> with

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
for some of the reasons i'm sharing with

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.800 
for some of the reasons i'm sharing with
you<00:04:50.800> now<00:04:50.950> one<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.640> bulk<00:04:52.060> of<00:04:52.210> it<00:04:52.330> the<00:04:52.420> size<00:04:52.660> of

you now one the bulk of it the size of

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.640 
you now one the bulk of it the size of
it<00:04:52.960> I<00:04:53.110> should<00:04:53.980> have<00:04:54.160> known<00:04:54.370> that<00:04:55.200> this<00:04:56.200> was

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
it I should have known that this was

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.810 
it I should have known that this was
going<00:04:56.830> to<00:04:56.890> be<00:04:56.950> a<00:04:57.010> big<00:04:57.160> device<00:04:57.430> when<00:04:57.640> they<00:04:57.700> gave

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
going to be a big device when they gave

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.000 
going to be a big device when they gave
me<00:04:57.940> this<00:04:58.060> box<00:04:58.330> which<00:04:59.020> I've<00:04:59.320> seen<00:04:59.620> smaller

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
me this box which I've seen smaller

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.810 
me this box which I've seen smaller
movies<00:05:00.850> VHS<00:05:01.750> movies<00:05:02.080> you<00:05:02.500> know<00:05:02.620> if<00:05:03.460> this<00:05:03.669> is<00:05:03.700> a

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
movies VHS movies you know if this is a

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.740 
movies VHS movies you know if this is a
nice<00:05:04.030> size<00:05:04.210> box<00:05:05.400> all<00:05:06.400> right<00:05:06.640> let's<00:05:07.540> take<00:05:07.690> a

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
nice size box all right let's take a

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.150 
nice size box all right let's take a
look<00:05:07.930> behind<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.320> cover<00:05:08.530> because<00:05:08.770> this<00:05:09.010> is

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
look behind the cover because this is

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.740 
look behind the cover because this is
actually<00:05:09.490> something<00:05:09.910> very<00:05:10.240> interesting<00:05:10.450> and

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
actually something very interesting and

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.140 
actually something very interesting and
I<00:05:10.840> was<00:05:11.140> not<00:05:11.260> aware<00:05:11.380> of<00:05:11.530> until<00:05:11.770> of<00:05:11.950> course<00:05:12.010> I<00:05:12.430> got

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
I was not aware of until of course I got

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.880 
I was not aware of until of course I got
the<00:05:13.270> device<00:05:14.370> some<00:05:15.370> cards<00:05:16.060> require<00:05:16.990> two<00:05:17.320> USB

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
the device some cards require two USB

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.659 
the device some cards require two USB
ports<00:05:18.030> for<00:05:19.030> power<00:05:19.210> flipped<00:05:19.810> up<00:05:19.930> this<00:05:20.110> way<00:05:20.669> this

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
ports for power flipped up this way this

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.240 
ports for power flipped up this way this
card<00:05:22.030> only<00:05:22.240> takes<00:05:22.690> the<00:05:22.930> one<00:05:23.110> USB<00:05:23.410> port<00:05:23.830> and<00:05:23.980> it

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
card only takes the one USB port and it

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.290 
card only takes the one USB port and it
looks<00:05:24.430> to<00:05:24.580> me<00:05:24.610> it's<00:05:24.880> because<00:05:25.150> they've

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
looks to me it's because they've

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.420 
looks to me it's because they've
included<00:05:25.900> this<00:05:26.110> lithium<00:05:26.410> polymer<00:05:26.770> battery

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
included this lithium polymer battery

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.610 
included this lithium polymer battery
which<00:05:28.240> hopefully<00:05:28.720> you<00:05:28.930> can<00:05:29.050> tell<00:05:29.290> the

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
which hopefully you can tell the

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.570 
which hopefully you can tell the
capacity<00:05:30.340> is<00:05:30.400> 380<00:05:31.060> milliamps<00:05:31.630> so<00:05:32.350> I'm<00:05:32.950> not<00:05:33.280> yet

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
capacity is 380 milliamps so I'm not yet

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.320 
capacity is 380 milliamps so I'm not yet
sure<00:05:33.870> if<00:05:35.610> how<00:05:36.610> this<00:05:36.760> is<00:05:36.850> going<00:05:36.970> to<00:05:37.060> affect<00:05:37.120> the

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
sure if how this is going to affect the

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.120 
sure if how this is going to affect the
battery<00:05:37.570> life<00:05:37.720> on<00:05:37.870> my<00:05:38.169> mobile<00:05:38.440> devices<00:05:38.979> I

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
battery life on my mobile devices I

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.530 
battery life on my mobile devices I
presume<00:05:39.550> it's<00:05:39.729> going<00:05:39.940> to<00:05:40.030> shorten<00:05:40.330> it

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
presume it's going to shorten it

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.390 
presume it's going to shorten it
drastically<00:05:40.930> and<00:05:41.620> that's<00:05:42.040> another<00:05:42.280> reason

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
drastically and that's another reason

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.240 
drastically and that's another reason
that<00:05:42.970> i'm<00:05:43.440> considering<00:05:44.440> do<00:05:44.680> I<00:05:44.770> keep<00:05:44.950> this<00:05:45.100> or

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
that i'm considering do I keep this or

that i'm considering do I keep this or
do<00:05:45.340> I<00:05:45.370> not<00:05:45.640> I<00:05:45.880> have<00:05:46.419> three<00:05:46.660> days<00:05:46.810> to<00:05:47.110> return

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
do I not I have three days to return

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.469 
do I not I have three days to return

the other nice thing I do like about

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.879 
the other nice thing I do like about
this<00:07:19.030> is<00:07:19.090> that<00:07:19.330> i<00:07:19.479> can<00:07:19.750> use<00:07:19.780> it<00:07:20.139> in<00:07:20.320> any<00:07:20.650> of<00:07:20.830> my

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:20.889 
this is that i can use it in any of my

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:23.430 
this is that i can use it in any of my
other<00:07:21.130> windows<00:07:21.580> devices<00:07:21.880> or<00:07:22.270> on<00:07:22.660> my<00:07:22.870> mac<00:07:23.110> and

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 
other windows devices or on my mac and

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.790 
other windows devices or on my mac and
that's<00:07:24.160> one<00:07:24.490> reason<00:07:24.669> I<00:07:24.940> went<00:07:25.120> USB<00:07:25.800> obviously

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 
that's one reason I went USB obviously

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.450 
that's one reason I went USB obviously
with<00:07:26.919> USB<00:07:27.250> you're<00:07:27.430> going<00:07:27.639> to<00:07:27.700> have<00:07:27.910> more<00:07:28.750> of<00:07:28.810> a

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460 
with USB you're going to have more of a

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.350 
with USB you're going to have more of a
bulky<00:07:30.460> device<00:07:30.729> because<00:07:31.060> there's<00:07:31.240> nothing

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 
bulky device because there's nothing

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.379 
bulky device because there's nothing
hidden<00:07:31.720> inside<00:07:31.990> the<00:07:32.470> device<00:07:32.590> so<00:07:33.100> I<00:07:33.340> guess<00:07:34.270> it's

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:34.389 
hidden inside the device so I guess it's

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:36.300 
hidden inside the device so I guess it's
a<00:07:34.600> compromise<00:07:34.870> I'm<00:07:35.320> not<00:07:35.500> sure<00:07:35.560> to<00:07:35.919> compromise

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:36.310 
a compromise I'm not sure to compromise

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.189 
a compromise I'm not sure to compromise
I'm<00:07:36.490> willing<00:07:36.940> to<00:07:36.970> make<00:07:37.060> just<00:07:37.210> yet<00:07:37.600> in<00:07:37.930> any<00:07:38.110> case

00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:38.199 
I'm willing to make just yet in any case
