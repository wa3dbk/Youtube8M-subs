 standing in the dragon hall there are enough specialists 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.990
 which can take the team 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.360
 now these are individuals with a cynical feeling 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.030

 chess where instead of figures called for 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.160
 scrolls monsters of varying degrees of epic 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.230
 the players have a traditional kill task 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.600
 enemy king from similar projects 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.400
 scrolls are unpredictable 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.290
 each batch starts with shuffling 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.049
 cards one of which is random 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.299
 issued every move use it not 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.060
 surely what the opponent will do 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.160
 not known the game looks nice but 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.709
 simple and creatures are not very 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.970
 the original scrolls is obviously big 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.970
 potential for development 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.580
 fighting champions can 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.590
 seem what came out earlier 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.450
 injustice gods among us 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.670
 however, the new game was more 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.260
 colorful it seems that 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.630
 you watch a full-fledged cartoon with 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.240
 banner 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.730
 besides in the battle of champions there is a plot 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.870
 yes he reveals a pair of dialogues but all 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.110
 better than nothing 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.090
 of management 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.550

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.200
 the wealth of techniques they do not differ but 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.060
 the main thing in 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.849
 and every player action consumes 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.400
 energy and and constantly lacking 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.200
 this developers are too intrusive 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:27.290
 hint what kind of pleasure you need 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:29.110

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.720

 press the buttons indicated on the screen 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.930
 everything is traditionally but how great 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.580
 the game is framed it begins with death 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.830
 the villain handsome jack face know and 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.320
 hyperion employees saw in 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.510
 his death a chance to rise much 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.270
 this will put people on their feet and cares little 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.760
 history of crazy price tags turned out 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.830
 even more exciting than the characters from 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.740
 games source black humor 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:09.810
 so good that even quotebook creek 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.810
 benefit is only the first episode 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.730
 appeared on mobile devices 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.980
 digital version of the board game 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.080

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.150
 score points for completing assignments 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.610
 magical political intrigue 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.930
 experiments monster hunt from four 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.820
 Heroes full of worries 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.130
 besides classes, they are different 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.560
 some missions geralt converges in 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.050
 duel with monsters and the sorceress was shaking 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.090
 solve riddles minus is that 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.040
 sometimes parties are delayed and to 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.700
 card games conventions 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.190
 get used to 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:47.770
 however in battles with friends over the network on 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.770
 these drawbacks do not pay attention 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.470
 I restarted tomb raider series 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.930
 won the hearts of the players to the exit 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.210

 claim to them on the stones of graphics so 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:13.220
 angular that a lara croft can 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.530
 cut oh this year 1997 in the game 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.050
 new scenery and system appeared 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.030
 management achievements have become more convenient but 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.710
 still requires skill all the same speech 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.919
 is about touch screen 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.290
 even 17 years later, frequent falls with 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.950
 cliffs remain almost the main 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.950

 this interactive mosaic to manage 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.540
 characters can not directly because you are 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.580
 Essentially director posting parts of levels 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.980
 like a movie frame or picture in 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.000
 comics you help the hero escape from 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.160
 pursuers 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.800
 if the staging was correct 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.320
 fugitive will not be at a standstill change 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.630

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.820
 plot details can only be revealed 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.130
 after several passes 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.220
 from the frame does not bother the author of the series 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:10.440
 metal gear hideo kojima even called it 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.310
 the best mobile game of the year is this 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.310
 weighty argument
