00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
flat kicks what this is you know it's

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.130 
flat kicks what this is you know it's
just<00:00:34.829> an<00:00:35.280> abrupt<00:00:35.640> transition<00:00:35.820> from<00:00:36.809> where<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
looking board has wax infused rotation

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.610 
looking board has wax infused rotation
sintered<00:00:54.239> base<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:54.870> really<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.469> high

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
sintered base so it's really really high

wax<00:00:55.920> absorption<00:00:56.579> super<00:00:57.300> fast<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.809> it's

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
wax absorption super fast and it's

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.819 
wax absorption super fast and it's
really<00:00:58.469> really<00:00:58.680> durable<00:00:58.949> as<00:00:59.190> well<00:01:00.559> as<00:01:01.559> their

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
DC select sustainable dual core so it's

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.630

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
pop and poplar in there as well this

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.070 
pop and poplar in there as well this
reduces<00:01:11.640> vibrate<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.390> vibration<00:01:12.960> and

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
reduces vibrate and vibration and

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.830 
reduces vibrate and vibration and
increases<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> strength<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> board<00:01:14.840> has

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
increases the strength of the board has

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.679 
increases the strength of the board has
tighten<00:01:16.409> all<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.680> spine<00:01:16.979> reinforcement<00:01:17.850> what

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
tighten all the spine reinforcement what

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.179 
tighten all the spine reinforcement what
this<00:01:18.840> does<00:01:19.020> just<00:01:19.259> increases<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.799> strength

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
this does just increases the strength

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.620 
this does just increases the strength
and<00:01:20.430> durability<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.090> board<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.509> can

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
and durability of the board so you can

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.999 
and durability of the board so you can
throw<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.049> about<00:01:22.290> as<00:01:22.500> much<00:01:22.619> as<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.890> like

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
throw this about as much as you like

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.820 
throw this about as much as you like
it's<00:01:23.280> going<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.460> last<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.820> ages<00:01:24.320> has<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> custom

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
it's going to last you ages has a custom

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.530 
it's going to last you ages has a custom
weave<00:01:26.009> fibreglass<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> combat<00:01:27.390> with

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
weave fibreglass so it's a combat with

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.580 
weave fibreglass so it's a combat with
bikes<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.080> try<00:01:28.259> act

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
bikes and try act

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.560 
bikes and try act
this<00:01:29.070> increases<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.820> response<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.329> board

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
this increases the response of the board

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.890 
this increases the response of the board
the<00:01:30.780> strength<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.229> again<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> durability

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
the strength and again the durability

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.300 
the strength and again the durability
we'd<00:01:33.900> say<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.200> an<00:01:34.320> intermediate<00:01:35.009> advanced

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
we'd say it's an intermediate advanced

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.969 
we'd say it's an intermediate advanced
board<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:36.060> if<00:01:36.180> you're<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.420> progressive

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
maybe go for something a little bit more

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.639 
maybe go for something a little bit more
friendlier<00:01:48.509> but<00:01:48.540> if<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.990> liked<00:01:49.170> reading<00:01:49.530> the
