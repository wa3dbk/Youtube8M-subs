00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
everything making sure we can hear

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.420 
everything making sure we can hear
everything<00:00:38.600> so<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:40.020> my<00:00:40.800> snare<00:00:41.040> roll<00:00:41.190> here

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
everything so I have my snare roll here

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.930 
everything so I have my snare roll here
so<00:00:45.710> so<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.160> per-pupil<00:00:47.370> I'm<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.879> to

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
so so that is in per-pupil I'm going to

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.200 
so so that is in per-pupil I'm going to
set<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:49.050> voices<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.500> 1<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.879> impossible

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
set the voices to 1 so it's impossible

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.540 
set the voices to 1 so it's impossible
to<00:00:51.570> play<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.469> them<00:00:52.590> overlap<00:00:52.890> which<00:00:53.399> is

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
to play to have them overlap which is

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.080 
to play to have them overlap which is
important<00:00:54.000> for<00:00:54.030> later<00:00:56.930> set<00:00:57.930> accent<00:00:58.910> so<00:00:59.910> my

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
important for later set accent so my

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.779 
important for later set accent so my
snare<00:01:00.329> roll<00:01:00.480> there<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.559> want<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.370> be

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
snare roll there so I want this to be

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.210 
snare roll there so I want this to be
over<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.329> course<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:04.220> one<00:01:06.020> kind<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.110> bar<00:01:07.619> I'm

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
over the course of one kind of bar I'm

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.030 
over the course of one kind of bar I'm
gonna<00:01:08.340> select<00:01:08.670> insert<00:01:09.150> MIDI<00:01:09.390> clip<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:13.040> find

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
gonna select insert MIDI clip and find

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.450 
gonna select insert MIDI clip and find
where<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:15.409> get<00:01:16.409> my<00:01:16.500> pencil<00:01:16.740> drawn<00:01:17.130> tool

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
where that is get my pencil drawn tool

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.740 
where that is get my pencil drawn tool
or<00:01:17.939> control<00:01:18.509> B<00:01:19.020> why<00:01:19.710> do<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.040> negate<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.850> turn

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
or control B why do you negate that turn

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.429 
or control B why do you negate that turn
that<00:01:21.869> off<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:23.030> then<00:01:24.030> duplicate<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.080> so

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
that off and then duplicate that so

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.480 
that off and then duplicate that so
there<00:01:25.680> we<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:28.280> my<00:01:29.280> MIDI<00:01:29.579> information<00:01:31.490> so

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
there we have my MIDI information so

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.380 
there we have my MIDI information so
right<00:01:32.610> now<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:32.909> only<00:01:34.400> playing<00:01:35.400> one<00:01:35.820> snare

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
so but you drop in an arpeggiator so now

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.380 
so but you drop in an arpeggiator so now
this<00:02:02.110> little<00:02:02.259> arpeggiate<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.759> sound<00:02:04.090> I'm

about this up to 99 why not right I have

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.479 
about this up to 99 why not right I have
my<00:02:11.410> rate<00:02:11.770> so<00:02:12.700> I<00:02:12.730> want<00:02:13.060> my<00:02:13.150> rate<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:14.050> increase<00:02:14.489> in

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
my rate so I want my rate to increase in

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.150 
my rate so I want my rate to increase in
increments<00:02:16.890> in<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:19.020> decent<00:02:20.020> amount<00:02:20.200> of<00:02:20.500> time<00:02:20.560> so

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
increments in a decent amount of time so

kind<00:03:07.630> of<00:03:07.750> what<00:03:07.960> I<00:03:07.990> want<00:03:08.320> I<00:03:09.540> also<00:03:10.540> want<00:03:10.960> it<00:03:11.050> to<00:03:11.110> be

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
kind of what I want I also want it to be

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.440 
kind of what I want I also want it to be
a<00:03:11.680> little<00:03:11.980> less<00:03:12.370> stagnant<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:14.850> I'll<00:03:15.850> do<00:03:16.150> that

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
a little less stagnant and I'll do that

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.820 
a little less stagnant and I'll do that
by<00:03:17.170> making<00:03:17.650> it<00:03:17.950> kind<00:03:18.310> of<00:03:19.320> foreshadow<00:03:20.320> and<00:03:20.680> I'll

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
by making it kind of foreshadow and I'll

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:35.930 
by making it kind of foreshadow and I'll
select<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:22.200> control<00:03:23.200> alt<00:03:23.470> D<00:03:24.100> to<00:03:25.060> do<00:03:25.210> that

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.120 

right<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.120> then<00:03:37.330> that<00:03:37.510> kind<00:03:37.900> of<00:03:37.959> happens<00:03:38.350> what

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
right and then that kind of happens what

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.990 
right and then that kind of happens what
I<00:03:39.160> can<00:03:39.310> also<00:03:39.520> do<00:03:40.110> so<00:03:41.110> I'll<00:03:41.170> duplicate<00:03:41.860> this<00:03:42.370> so

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
I can also do so I'll duplicate this so

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.500 
I can also do so I'll duplicate this so
I'm<00:03:43.150> adjusting<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.810> length<00:03:44.140> of<00:03:45.240> our<00:03:48.420> you<00:03:49.420> know

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
I'm adjusting the length of our you know

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.350 
I'm adjusting the length of our you know
snare<00:03:50.170> roll<00:03:50.380> via<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.580> ARP<00:03:51.790> now<00:03:52.709> do<00:03:53.709> this

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
snare roll via the ARP now do this

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.890 
snare roll via the ARP now do this
blam-blam-blam-<00:03:57.060> this<00:03:58.060> part<00:03:58.300> isn't<00:03:58.540> really

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
blam-blam-blam- this part isn't really

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.760 
blam-blam-blam- this part isn't really
important<00:03:59.320> because<00:03:59.410> it's<00:03:59.709> going<00:03:59.920> to<00:04:00.040> be

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
important because it's going to be

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.930 
important because it's going to be
filtered<00:04:04.920> right<00:04:05.920> it<00:04:06.100> does<00:04:06.250> that<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:06.820> next

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
filtered right it does that and the next

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.459 
filtered right it does that and the next
phrase<00:04:09.180> you<00:04:10.180> know<00:04:10.300> March

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:13.469 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:16.939 

right<00:04:14.469> so<00:04:14.980> we<00:04:15.069> have<00:04:15.219> that<00:04:15.430> so<00:04:15.700> for<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.120> sake<00:04:16.329> of

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
right so we have that so for the sake of

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:23.129 
right so we have that so for the sake of
being<00:04:17.949> simple<00:04:18.340> I<00:04:18.750> will<00:04:19.750> add<00:04:19.959> a<00:04:21.150> filter<00:04:22.150> here<00:04:22.389> so

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
being simple I will add a filter here so

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.129 
being simple I will add a filter here so
what<00:04:23.410> this<00:04:23.530> does<00:04:23.740> is<00:04:23.919> it<00:04:24.070> kind<00:04:24.280> of<00:04:24.370> opens<00:04:24.910> as<00:04:25.210> it

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
what this does is it kind of opens as it

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.120 
what this does is it kind of opens as it
kind<00:04:26.470> of<00:04:26.560> progresses<00:04:28.259> so<00:04:29.259> I'll<00:04:29.380> add<00:04:29.620> a<00:04:29.650> quick

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
kind of progresses so I'll add a quick

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:42.180 
kind of progresses so I'll add a quick
little<00:04:30.430> EQ<00:04:39.120> and<00:04:40.120> I'll<00:04:40.330> have<00:04:40.539> this<00:04:40.720> just<00:04:41.190> simply

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
little EQ and I'll have this just simply

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:51.589 
little EQ and I'll have this just simply
open<00:04:42.660> like<00:04:43.660> so<00:04:43.990> there<00:04:44.620> we<00:04:44.770> go<00:04:44.830> so<00:04:50.099> I'll<00:04:51.099> copy

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
open like so there we go so I'll copy

00:04:51.599 --> 00:05:00.270 
open like so there we go so I'll copy
the<00:04:52.599> sidechain<00:04:53.470> II<00:04:53.830> bits<00:04:56.820> and<00:04:58.800> add<00:04:59.800> a<00:04:59.860> bit<00:05:00.190> of

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
the sidechain II bits and add a bit of

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.939 
the sidechain II bits and add a bit of
reverb<00:05:00.460> so<00:05:01.210> it's<00:05:01.360> not<00:05:01.630> as<00:05:01.960> intense<00:05:02.530> I'll<00:05:02.830> have

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
reverb so it's not as intense I'll have

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:22.960 
reverb so it's not as intense I'll have
that<00:05:03.130> post<00:05:03.400> filter<00:05:04.919> open<00:05:05.919> all<00:05:06.039> these<00:05:06.190> guys<00:05:06.430> up

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.890 

the<00:05:23.970> fundamental<00:05:24.539> is<00:05:24.659> way<00:05:24.960> up<00:05:25.590> there<00:05:25.949> so<00:05:26.900> bump

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
the fundamental is way up there so bump

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:39.290 
the fundamental is way up there so bump
this<00:05:28.080> guy<00:05:28.349> up<00:05:28.560> and<00:05:28.590> see<00:05:29.129> when<00:05:29.370> it<00:05:29.490> starts<00:05:38.300> I'll

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
this guy up and see when it starts I'll

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:57.910 
this guy up and see when it starts I'll
add<00:05:39.569> a<00:05:39.599> bit<00:05:39.930> of<00:05:39.960> resonance

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.530 

right<00:05:58.920> and<00:05:59.180> that<00:06:00.180> should<00:06:00.900> be<00:06:01.080> okay<00:06:02.480> for<00:06:03.480> the

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
right and that should be okay for the

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.900 
right and that should be okay for the
most<00:06:03.690> part<00:06:04.070> we're<00:06:05.070> going<00:06:05.190> to<00:06:05.250> also<00:06:05.520> have<00:06:05.760> it

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
most part we're going to also have it

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:18.320 
most part we're going to also have it
filtered<00:06:06.360> down<00:06:16.400> right<00:06:17.400> and<00:06:17.610> there's<00:06:17.760> no<00:06:17.880> kind

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
filtered down right and there's no kind

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.940 
filtered down right and there's no kind
of<00:06:18.480> continuity<00:06:18.810> because<00:06:19.320> I<00:06:19.620> need<00:06:20.250> to<00:06:20.280> add<00:06:21.950> you

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
of continuity because I need to add you

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.010 
of continuity because I need to add you
know<00:06:22.980> be<00:06:23.280> white<00:06:23.550> noise<00:06:23.700> sweeps<00:06:24.060> and<00:06:24.330> such<00:06:24.630> and

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
know be white noise sweeps and such and

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.520 
know be white noise sweeps and such and
at<00:06:25.920> a<00:06:25.980> crash<00:06:26.370> but<00:06:26.790> in<00:06:27.150> general<00:06:27.840> we<00:06:27.990> have<00:06:28.200> some

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
at a crash but in general we have some

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.040 
at a crash but in general we have some
tension<00:06:29.070> building<00:06:29.640> snare<00:06:30.150> rolls<00:06:30.360> very<00:06:30.870> easily

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
tension building snare rolls very easily

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.920 
tension building snare rolls very easily
just<00:06:31.490> having<00:06:32.490> your<00:06:32.580> sample<00:06:33.000> and<00:06:33.090> you<00:06:33.810> know

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
just having your sample and you know

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.970 
just having your sample and you know
even<00:06:34.740> if<00:06:34.919> say<00:06:35.550> we're<00:06:35.820> not<00:06:35.910> happy<00:06:36.180> with<00:06:36.450> it<00:06:36.660> we

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
even if say we're not happy with it we

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.240 
even if say we're not happy with it we
can<00:06:37.980> change<00:06:38.220> it<00:06:38.370> up<00:06:38.570> easily<00:06:39.570> and<00:06:40.110> replace<00:06:41.070> the

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
can change it up easily and replace the

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.030 
can change it up easily and replace the
sound<00:06:41.550> and<00:06:41.850> the<00:06:42.090> arpeggiator<00:06:42.540> bits<00:06:42.990> stay<00:06:43.890> the

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.040 
sound and the arpeggiator bits stay the

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.830 
sound and the arpeggiator bits stay the
same<00:06:44.280> and<00:06:44.550> it's<00:06:44.790> just<00:06:44.970> a<00:06:45.060> matter<00:06:45.270> of<00:06:45.419> kind<00:06:45.750> of

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 
same and it's just a matter of kind of

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.830 
same and it's just a matter of kind of
drawing<00:06:46.230> them<00:06:46.440> in<00:06:46.730> so<00:06:47.730> that's<00:06:47.850> a<00:06:47.940> quarter<00:06:48.450> for

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
drawing them in so that's a quarter for

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.870 
drawing them in so that's a quarter for
those<00:06:49.020> keeping<00:06:49.260> track<00:06:49.650> and<00:06:49.890> this<00:06:50.669> is<00:06:50.760> an

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 
those keeping track and this is an

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.170 
those keeping track and this is an
eighth<00:06:51.180> and<00:06:51.540> then<00:06:52.110> it<00:06:52.230> jumps<00:06:52.770> to<00:06:53.180> sixteenths

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
eighth and then it jumps to sixteenths

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.730 
eighth and then it jumps to sixteenths
at<00:06:54.450> the<00:06:54.690> end<00:06:55.070> of<00:06:56.070> every<00:06:56.700> bar<00:06:57.360> for<00:06:57.900> a<00:06:58.140> quarter

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740 
at the end of every bar for a quarter

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.760 
at the end of every bar for a quarter
bar<00:06:58.919> and<00:06:59.220> then<00:06:59.820> it<00:06:59.940> kind<00:07:00.240> of<00:07:00.300> goes<00:07:01.140> up<00:07:01.200> and<00:07:01.530> down

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:03.770 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.140 

to<00:07:04.770> kind<00:07:05.010> of<00:07:05.070> you<00:07:05.430> know<00:07:05.460> keep<00:07:05.820> it<00:07:05.970> interesting

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.150 
to kind of you know keep it interesting

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.360 
to kind of you know keep it interesting
we<00:07:06.600> could<00:07:06.780> just<00:07:06.990> have<00:07:07.169> it<00:07:07.260> go<00:07:07.290> blue<00:07:07.620> like<00:07:08.160> all

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
we could just have it go blue like all
