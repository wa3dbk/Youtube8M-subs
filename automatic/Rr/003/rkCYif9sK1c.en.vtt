00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
 why traditions a magic card 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.990
 it's pretty simple just look 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.609
 to the right of the map 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.589
 in the center we will see if what is called 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.510
 an extension symbol then if you do not 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.610
 do not know which edition this comes from 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.320
 symbol you have on magic corporation 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.849
 for as you go on the map tab 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.260
 is there actually you are going to have the list 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.960
 of all editions including with 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.060
 left the the symbols so if you have 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.490
 a little palm tree is that it's 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.660
 mirage for example so this is there no 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.670
 that's when it's pretty simple when 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.199
 there is a little symbol on the right here but 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.650
 on some maps including its 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.570
 old 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.239
 there is not there for example we will have 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.030
 to take the same card except that here and 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.090
 scored 6 and tied to score a goal or there 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.610
 we will refer to level 2 beyond the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.320
 date there on 97.97 that means it's the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.879
 fifth edition so that's it's the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.320
 sixth edition it's easy to spot 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.719
 and this is the fifth edition because 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.860
 there is no logo here and there 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.500
 marked 1997 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.219
 likewise for the third and the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 fourth edition 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.989
 so here we are in 1995 that is to say that it is 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.460
 the fourth edition 1994 mean 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.620
 this is the third edition to know 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.650
 that in the third edition he also wants 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.170
 black butter and shore shoreline in 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.030
 prize is actually the third edition 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.260
 and it was English so English 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.799
 in fact see it's a little bit it's a bit 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.500
 more special 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.330
 the hellebore are a little different the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.680
 the black edges in France is there it is 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.049
 white butter but it's all that 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.580
 rest of the fourth edition 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.930
 and it is very easy to 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.140
 to confuse with what is called 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.400
 the limited unlimited here it's more the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.560
 third edition but that's part 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.990
 first editions 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.850
 we see that in fact the really the ideal 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.920
 to differentiate them both because 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.600
 most people who think they have to 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.979
 limoux same beta that are 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.200
 usually they have this kind of 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.130
 rival kercadiou is that's not it 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.470
 not a very very great value 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.180
 it's a bit more valuable and actually 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.180
 to differentiate them we actually see 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.149
 here that there is here there is a single line 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.520
 see the border syllable between the 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.930
 white beige and the edge of the card the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.310
 white borough there is only one 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.590
 there is only one trait while for 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.240
 the myriads see here we see a village 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.219
 white a big features suffered traits 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.030
 finer and after the normal beige beyond 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.940
 of the carte blanche 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.310
 so here you go 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.900
 that it tells you quite easily for 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.850
 whether that so this is this is the 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.350
 lim so from the first edition and that 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.150
 it's from the shore of the third edition 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.280
 it costs less because it 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.760
 are a lot more on the market and 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.020
 then to compare the leem with the 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.790
 older editions still this is at 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.560
 to say the alpha ould bettah we go there this is 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.170
 very simple you see it's butter 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.840
 black so the only one we conditions 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.200
 for it to be alfa or beta 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.890
 it is an edge so black no symbol 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.220
 of course editing here is no no 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.210
 text 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.100
 finally there's just the illustrator 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.630
 unlike for example one to one 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.760
 third edition butter map 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.350
 black hop a frame of the mission bernard 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.300
 already and laurent french she will not be 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.480
 in English and then here with him had 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.910
 the little 294th there is really nothing 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.980
 the caf was very very clean 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.050
 had a big texts written in bulk so 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.400
 it's beta it's alpha 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.960
 how do I see it actually it's going to be 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.840
 the easiest way to see it is at 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.280
 corner level here the corner in fact of 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.630
 alfa contrary to all others 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.300
 magic cards is a little more rounded 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.910
 see here the beta is actually the corner 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.500
 the normal corner while here is the alpha 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.880
 it's a little more rounded here you go 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.410
 how do we differentiate them 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.900
 and then the other little traps he 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.940
 can be in the old editions 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.430
 this is especially what kind of map the up 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.540
 here we feel so if ever 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.520
 I have a map like that so I go 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.810
 on the site is voila if we do it 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.250
 must look at what is the trap 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.260
 last four laso dark legend 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.450
 antiquities arabian nights so the 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.910
 cards very first edition so the 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.230
 last lift of the list is a little 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.120
 misleading be careful there when you 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.019
 have a symbol here with an anvil on 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.239
 could believe it's anti who 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.400
 tease but since she is on white board 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.730
 it's not nice to tease but the 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.080
 chronicles here are the old editions 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.190
 normally and tobacco actually all that 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.100
 was not basic edition 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.630
 normally it's black board so there 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.140
 it's weird we see an old map 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.940
 with an editing symbol is therefore 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.140
 not a basic edition it's 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.850
 chronicle this chronicler actually is it 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.310
 surrender edition is made 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.140
 be careful this is a real antiquities 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.420
 pascal black edge she in english well 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.650
 sure English guarantee that English 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.170
 Black edge guarantee that it is a 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.080
 antiquity here in its identical box 10 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.930
 but there with the symbol of arabian 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.759
 nights since it is in white edge 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.430
 in France and in English by the cdu 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:22.900
 similar chronicles here for the dark is 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.289
 the same here for young people here we do 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.030
 Warning 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.740
 these cards there if you think that that 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.780
 is very expensive actually it costs 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.110
 much less than editions 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.639
 original 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.530
 you are careful the edge the 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.430
 white edge usually every time 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.690
 when he's a white borough knows it's 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.930
 beautiful is that it's cheaper than the 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.400
 right edge and the other trap even though 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.400
 it was black butter it's at the level 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.770
 of hop here we see that these two 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.530
 cards in black board edge with the 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:51.370
 chic chic symbol we have a strict mind 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.419
 in cdu antiquities but in fact that's where 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.190
 it's not nice who say because 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.020
 that she is in French in French 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.220
 it was the same an edition where there was 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.009
 a lot of reissues and that's 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.300
 rebirth so here is if you have or 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.009
 in fact it's just these four there 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.710
 where it's a little trap you look good 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:07.270
 if you have white butter or 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.949
 French is that it's not this 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.180
 vision of this edition there is that this 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:11.770
 in renaissance and French 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.110
 often chronicle these languages 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.599
 there we will see the rest of the quarters time 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.430
 that was the chronicle the remains of 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:21.010
 cards for example in rebirth 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.229
 we have here an alibaba at the point body that he 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.900
 is in ghana gold and not in fact he is in 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.490
 leaving this the same here for legends is 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.060
 same here for sedan that's it these are 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.400
 all cards of that are all 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.389
 rebirth cards because they 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.169
 are in them are really 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.430
 actually but they are in 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.490
 French is not cards of 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.490
 the original edition which would have been worth more 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.750
 more sub here's so I hope that 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.550
 you have now understood correctly 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.960
 how do editions work and 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.370
 you do not go wrong when you if 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.300
 you make a redemption including a magic 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.960
 to monday body 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.960
 will soon lease
