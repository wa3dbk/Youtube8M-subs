00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
complaints with the bike this is

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.770 
complaints with the bike this is
definitely<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.099> right<00:00:32.250> way<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.520> go<00:00:32.690> for<00:00:33.690> our

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
definitely the right way to go for our

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.590 
definitely the right way to go for our
first<00:00:33.930> test<00:00:34.130> I<00:00:35.130> think<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.239> know<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.420> biggest

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
first test I think you know the biggest

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.000 
first test I think you know the biggest
disappointment<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.350> then<00:00:37.620> he's<00:00:37.739> not<00:00:37.860> going

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
disappointment that then he's not going

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.010 
disappointment that then he's not going
to<00:00:38.040> be<00:00:38.100> here<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:39.030> try<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.270> bike<00:00:39.600> i<00:00:39.780> think

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
to be here to to try this bike i think

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.840 
to be here to to try this bike i think
you<00:00:40.440> know<00:00:40.469> his<00:00:40.710> import<00:00:41.129> into<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.399> black<00:00:41.670> was

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
you know his import into this black was

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.700 
you know his import into this black was
going<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.030> be<00:00:42.120> very<00:00:42.270> important<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:42.930> hopefully

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
going to be very important and hopefully

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.220 
going to be very important and hopefully
later<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> year<00:00:44.550> we<00:00:44.760> can<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.780> know<00:00:45.930> they

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
later in the year we can you know they

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.020 
later in the year we can you know they
can<00:00:46.379> get<00:00:46.530> his<00:00:46.739> as<00:00:47.100> much<00:00:47.340> input<00:00:47.550> off<00:00:47.789> him<00:00:47.910> as

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
can get his as much input off him as

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.360 
can get his as much input off him as
possible<00:00:48.210> because<00:00:48.800> you<00:00:49.800> know<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.070> need<00:00:50.100> as

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
was the first day of testing on this

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.090 
was the first day of testing on this
bike<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.070> was<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> focus<00:00:59.760> for<00:00:59.910> today

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
bike what was the focus for today

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.889 
bike what was the focus for today
basically<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.550> general<00:01:03.120> shake<00:01:03.600> down<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
basically just a general shake down to

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.479 
basically just a general shake down to
the<00:01:03.989> bike<00:01:04.140> just<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.500> understand<00:01:05.100> what<00:01:05.369> it's

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the bike just to understand what it's

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.240 
the bike just to understand what it's
doing<00:01:06.260> you<00:01:07.260> know<00:01:07.350> how<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.710> sort<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.920> reacts

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
doing you know how it sort of reacts

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.770 
doing you know how it sort of reacts
under<00:01:08.490> under<00:01:08.970> breaks<00:01:09.210> things<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.659> that

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
under under breaks things like that

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.270 
under under breaks things like that
we're<00:01:10.350> trying<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.650> iron<00:01:10.770> out<00:01:10.979> some<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
we're trying to iron out some of the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.679 
we're trying to iron out some of the
weaknesses<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.729> we've<00:01:11.939> got<00:01:12.150> with<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.330> 800

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
weaknesses that we've got with the 800

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.219 
weaknesses that we've got with the 800
now<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.729> you<00:01:14.729> know<00:01:14.880> seems<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.540> be<00:01:15.600> working<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
now and you know seems to be working the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.330 
now and you know seems to be working the
breaking<00:01:16.590> point<00:01:16.740> seems<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.100> be<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> lot

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
breaking point seems to be a lot

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.760 
breaking point seems to be a lot
stronger<00:01:17.580> than<00:01:17.759> what<00:01:17.909> we've<00:01:18.030> had<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.330> past

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
stronger than what we've had in the past

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.660 
stronger than what we've had in the past
stability<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> front<00:01:20.130> going<00:01:20.400> into<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
stability in the front going into the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.960 
stability in the front going into the
turn<00:01:20.850> seems<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.299> be<00:01:21.360> very<00:01:21.420> good<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.850> you<00:01:23.850> know

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
turn seems to be very good and you know

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.700 
turn seems to be very good and you know
of<00:01:24.210> course<00:01:24.420> they<00:01:25.110> want<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.380> know<00:01:25.470> how<00:01:25.650> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
of course they want to know how the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.920 
of course they want to know how the
character<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.790> power<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.869> know

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
character of the power is and you know

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.230 
character of the power is and you know
being<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.380> 1000<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.340> little<00:01:30.030> bit<00:01:30.119> more

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
being a 1000 it's a little bit more

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.240 
being a 1000 it's a little bit more
leaning<00:01:30.479> than<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.780> am<00:01:30.990> an<00:01:31.320> 800<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.890> know<00:01:32.009> being

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
leaning than I am an 800 you know being

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.440 
leaning than I am an 800 you know being
a<00:01:32.340> bit<00:01:32.460> more<00:01:32.579> aggressive<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
a bit more aggressive on the on the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.469 
a bit more aggressive on the on the
power<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.040> you<00:01:35.040> know<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.250> 1000<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.150> smooth

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
power and you know the 1000 so smooth

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.569 
power and you know the 1000 so smooth
and<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.710> got<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.920> much<00:01:38.100> feeling<00:01:38.460> with

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
and and you got that much feeling with

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.090 
and and you got that much feeling with
it<00:01:38.700> yeah<00:01:38.850> there's<00:01:39.090> no<00:01:39.180> problem<00:01:39.590> how<00:01:40.590> similar

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
it yeah there's no problem how similar

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.980 
it yeah there's no problem how similar
or<00:01:41.310> different<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.450> bike<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.840> you

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
or different is it to the bike that you

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.450 
or different is it to the bike that you
or<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.170> 800<00:01:43.770> cc<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.220> you're<00:01:44.340> currently

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
or the 800 cc that you're currently

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.139 
or the 800 cc that you're currently
writing<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:46.649> general<00:01:46.979> feel<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.610> is

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
writing the general feel of it is is

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.200 
writing the general feel of it is is
very<00:01:48.210> similar<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:49.530> few<00:01:50.310> little<00:01:50.430> positions<00:01:50.970> here

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
very similar a few little positions here

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.310 
very similar a few little positions here
and<00:01:51.360> there

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
and there

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.020 
and there
footrest<00:01:53.320> and<00:01:53.620> seat<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.370> handlebars<00:01:54.700> are

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
footrest and seat and handlebars are

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.510 
footrest and seat and handlebars are
slightly<00:01:55.570> different<00:01:56.020> but<00:01:56.980> in<00:01:57.130> general<00:01:57.280> you

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
slightly different but in general you

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.070 
slightly different but in general you
know<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.880> transition<00:01:58.540> was<00:01:58.630> quite<00:01:58.840> quick

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
know the transition was quite quick

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.510 
know the transition was quite quick
because<00:01:59.290> you<00:01:59.770> know<00:01:59.860> there<00:01:59.980> wasn't<00:02:00.130> too<00:02:00.370> much

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
because you know there wasn't too much

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.120 
because you know there wasn't too much
difference<00:02:00.880> with<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.060> bike<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.830> it's<00:02:02.830> mainly

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
difference with the bike and it's mainly

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.500 
difference with the bike and it's mainly
just<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.520> power<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:03.940> like<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.090> said<00:02:04.210> under

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
just the power and like I said under

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.390 
just the power and like I said under
breaks<00:02:04.750> it<00:02:04.990> definitely<00:02:05.620> was<00:02:06.040> a<00:02:06.070> lot<00:02:06.280> better

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
breaks it definitely was a lot better

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.270 
breaks it definitely was a lot better
and<00:02:06.870> just<00:02:07.870> the<00:02:08.229> power<00:02:08.440> how<00:02:08.619> smooth<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.160> how

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
and just the power how smooth and how

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.830 
and just the power how smooth and how
much<00:02:09.429> talk<00:02:09.729> we've<00:02:09.910> got<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.149> play<00:02:10.330> with<00:02:10.539> you

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
much talk we've got the play with you

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.270 
much talk we've got the play with you
know<00:02:10.990> we<00:02:11.170> had<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.380> change<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.680> gear<00:02:11.890> box<00:02:12.040> for

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
know we had to change the gear box for

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.940 
know we had to change the gear box for
this<00:02:12.400> track<00:02:12.610> because<00:02:12.910> it's<00:02:13.290> it's<00:02:14.290> working<00:02:14.709> so

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
this track because it's it's working so

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.230 
this track because it's it's working so
much<00:02:15.100> of<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.280> different<00:02:15.580> range<00:02:15.730> than<00:02:16.060> what<00:02:16.180> the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
much of a different range than what the

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.570 
much of a different range than what the
800<00:02:16.630> did<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:16.990> there's<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.709> few<00:02:17.890> little<00:02:18.340> things

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
800 did so there's a few little things

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.340 
800 did so there's a few little things
and<00:02:19.000> you're<00:02:19.450> going<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.660> have<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.870> get<00:02:19.990> used<00:02:20.170> to

and you're going to have to get used to
riding<00:02:20.500> 1000<00:02:21.190> again<00:02:21.370> but<00:02:21.550> yet<00:02:21.790> today<00:02:22.060> was<00:02:22.420> a

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
basically you know what they what they

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.310 
basically you know what they what they
needed<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.100> hear<00:02:30.340> about<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:31.630> know<00:02:31.750> not<00:02:32.080> sort

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
of so much what direction to going

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.580 
of so much what direction to going
because<00:02:33.880> I<00:02:34.000> think<00:02:34.239> they're<00:02:34.480> they're<00:02:35.350> pretty

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
because I think they're they're pretty

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.650 
because I think they're they're pretty
well<00:02:35.770> set<00:02:35.950> on<00:02:36.070> their<00:02:36.190> direction<00:02:36.489> as<00:02:36.820> well<00:02:37.510> as

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
well set on their direction as well as

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.270 
well set on their direction as well as
the<00:02:37.750> fact<00:02:37.959> that<00:02:38.050> it's<00:02:38.260> it's<00:02:38.560> working<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.100> well

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
the fact that it's it's working so well

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.370 
the fact that it's it's working so well
you<00:02:39.459> know<00:02:39.550> we<00:02:39.700> haven't<00:02:39.959> changed<00:02:40.959> so<00:02:41.140> much<00:02:41.320> from

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
you know we haven't changed so much from

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.920 
you know we haven't changed so much from
the<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:42.670> 800<00:02:43.060> that<00:02:43.150> we've<00:02:43.270> got<00:02:43.450> now<00:02:43.600> they've

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
the the 800 that we've got now they've

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.270 
the the 800 that we've got now they've
basically<00:02:44.170> gone<00:02:44.560> in<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.770> direction<00:02:44.830> and

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
basically gone in that direction and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.650 
basically gone in that direction and
just<00:02:45.550> slightly<00:02:46.239> changed<00:02:46.690> shotty<00:02:47.440> stiffnesses

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
just slightly changed shotty stiffnesses

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:57.970 
just slightly changed shotty stiffnesses
things<00:02:49.660> like<00:02:49.840> that

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.040 

you
