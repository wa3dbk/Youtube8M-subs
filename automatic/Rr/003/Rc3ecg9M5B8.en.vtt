 a since they identify a millennium 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:09.680
 prehistoric beetle in miramar el 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.960
 municipal museum point hermengo argentina 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.940
 unveiled the discovery of a stranger 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.099
 fossil attributed to a beetle that 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.130
 he lived in the region about ten thousand 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.199
 years before the present 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.900
 the peculiar find happened in the form 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.630
 accidental when a team led by 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.570
 the museologist Daniel Boh in November 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.439
 2002 was extracting the remains 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.750
 fossils of a skull with its jaw 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.210
 attributed to a giant big sloth 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.250
 called is the y doctor yum in the 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.350
 geological outcrops that are 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.800
 south of the fishing pier of the 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.410
 city 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.420
 on that occasion a piece of 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.270
 sediment that was separated next to the 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.059
 skeletal remains of the mega mammal broke 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.100
 in two fragments and in both parts it 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.150
 they saw the imprints with very details 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.890
 intimates of the beetle morphology 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.989
 only one mold is preserved 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.059
 original structure since the 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.759
 fossil-bearing sediments of the 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.600
 Pampean region does not preserve the remains 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:14.899
 soft held daniel boh holder of the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.940
 Miramar museum and added the 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.880
 possibility of finding remains of this 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.670
 type are very scarce because of their 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.920
 unusual preservation and contributes 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.530
 information about the environment and climate 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.990
 of the last 10,000 years argued 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.540
 the strange imprint remained saved 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.909
 for a long time due to the lack 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.320
 of similar backgrounds for your 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.590
 proper identification 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.229
 just in 2012 -mariano magnussen 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.840
 shaffer agreed to conduct a study 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.550
 comparative with living organisms and 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.450
 it could be known that the beetle that 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.460
 he lived about 10,000 years ago he still has 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.979
 representatives at present the 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.360
 material studied was identified as 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.540
 belonging to the family of 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.170
 beetles tenebrio in new die del 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.970

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.140
 scott or sp virus 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.030
 the tenebrio nesidos tenebrio idae in the 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.300
 present are one of the great 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.110
 coleopterous families with about 220 thousand 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.110
 described species 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.959
 living especially in diverse 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:25.930
 steppe and desert environments are 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.390
 basically the tree ti borox is to say 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.549
 they generally eat solids 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.760
 permanents that come from the 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:36.099
 decomposition of organic sources 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.739
 plants and animals which indicate 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.439
 the presence of the scott fossil beetle 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.019
 obvious esp found in the city of 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:46.659
 look at centimeters from the remains 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.450
 Bones of the giant sloth is the and 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.100
 doctor yum 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.600
 possibly this little beetle will 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.290
 I was feeding from the remains 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.690
 organic 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.270
 after the decomposition of the skull 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.690
 Found as leather and tendons on the 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.820
 bone and for reasons we do not know died 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.860
 next to your food source and you 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.710
 preserved extraordinarily during the 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.350
 last 10,000 years keeping details 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:15.230
 very intimate of its morphology although it is 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.659
 only one speculation pointed to the source 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.930
 Quaternary insect fossils 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:23.840
 last two million years are in their 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.840
 most very few in the world but the 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.909
 few recognized are perfectly 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.129
 adjudicable to current species and 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:34.420
 practically no extinctions are known 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.560
 or specifications during that period 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.420
 but yes big changes in the 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.610
 geological distribution of many 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.970
 species in line with the changes 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.970
 climatic 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.390
 the fossil of the millennial scotch beetle 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.310
 views is exhibited for 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.459
 a few days in the paleontology room 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.200
 Regional Museum of Miramar next to 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.450
 the skeletal remains of great creatures 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.540
 who lived in the last three 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.659
 millions of years with mastodons tigers 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.140
