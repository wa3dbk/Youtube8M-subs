00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.930 
that whenever people hear my songs that
they're<00:02:00.710> able<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.950> connect<00:02:01.400> and<00:02:01.580> relate<00:02:01.640> with

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
they're able to connect and relate with

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.880 
they're able to connect and relate with
them<00:02:02.120> the<00:02:02.690> same<00:02:02.900> way<00:02:03.080> that<00:02:03.260> I<00:02:03.320> have<00:02:03.410> with<00:02:03.740> other

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
them the same way that I have with other

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.610 
them the same way that I have with other
songs<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:04.610> who<00:02:05.420> knows<00:02:05.600> maybe<00:02:05.840> help<00:02:06.290> them<00:02:06.470> get

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
songs and who knows maybe help them get

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.450 
songs and who knows maybe help them get
through<00:02:06.800> a<00:02:06.920> situation<00:02:07.160> in<00:02:07.610> their<00:02:07.760> life

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.070 

I<00:02:12.550> think<00:02:13.180> I<00:02:13.300> may<00:02:13.420> fall<00:02:13.690> in<00:02:13.810> love<00:02:13.930> with<00:02:14.020> music

I think I may fall in love with music

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.200 
I think I may fall in love with music
the<00:02:14.350> most<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.950> music<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:15.700> something<00:02:15.880> that<00:02:16.030> is

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
the most is music is something that is

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.270 
the most is music is something that is
so<00:02:16.330> selfless<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.140> it's<00:02:17.680> something<00:02:17.920> I<00:02:17.950> put<00:02:18.190> my

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
so selfless and it's something I put my

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.890 
so selfless and it's something I put my
hope<00:02:18.460> and<00:02:18.640> time<00:02:18.820> into<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.450> it<00:02:19.510> never<00:02:19.660> takes

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
hope and time into and it never takes

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.230 
hope and time into and it never takes
back<00:02:20.140> for<00:02:20.440> me<00:02:20.560> also<00:02:21.310> something<00:02:21.790> really<00:02:21.910> cool

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.390 
back for me also something really cool
about<00:02:22.420> music<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.140> universal<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.070> I<00:02:24.280> know

about music is it universal and I know

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.880 
about music is it universal and I know
it's<00:02:24.640> like<00:02:24.760> really<00:02:25.030> cliche<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.510> say<00:02:25.630> but<00:02:25.890> it's

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
it's like really cliche to say but it's

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.290 
it's like really cliche to say but it's
something<00:02:27.100> that<00:02:27.340> everyone<00:02:27.910> can<00:02:27.940> relate<00:02:28.090> to

so<00:03:04.600> I'm<00:03:05.140> excited<00:03:05.380> feet<00:03:05.650> here

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.210 

I<00:03:10.870> usually<00:03:11.870> describe<00:03:12.170> him<00:03:12.620> as<00:03:12.680> a<00:03:12.860> Katy<00:03:13.100> Perry

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
I usually describe him as a Katy Perry

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.010 
I usually describe him as a Katy Perry
in<00:03:13.520> his<00:03:13.670> chest<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.060> me<00:03:14.210> were<00:03:14.330> a<00:03:14.360> pop<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.630> little

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
in his chest and me were a pop a little

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.250 
in his chest and me were a pop a little
bit<00:03:15.230> like<00:03:15.380> a<00:03:15.410> bit<00:03:15.650> Dancy<00:03:15.830> behind<00:03:16.400> him

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.500 

I<00:03:20.349> guess<00:03:21.010> hopefully<00:03:21.250> one<00:03:21.760> day<00:03:21.790> but<00:03:22.150> currently
