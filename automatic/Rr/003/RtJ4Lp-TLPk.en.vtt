00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.750
 so I was lucky enough to dd a little 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.689
 little to the development of the rest lol 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.210
 from europe to ducks yesterday fun so 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.250
 it's a magnetic system with 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.349
 a magnet of a rest scan actually who 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.340
 can really suit most of 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.560
 all the canes that are currently 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.390
 on the market a very simple system 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.699
 very fast but there is still 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.160
 a few small precautions to 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.930
 take to really use it 100% 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.840
 of his abilities 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.760
 so here firstly there you have 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.350
 art and security war the system of 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.930
 security 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:53.089
 then the system where you lay 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.309
 your calm if an axis a magnet so that 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.059
 remains very simple but it's a system 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.299
 very effective 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.400
 then to position it you have to 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:07.610
 the thouars social security 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:12.229
 forward so reel side so 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:16.969
 to position the can with the mbr for 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:20.350
 our security system is implemented 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:24.380
 hold a little bit on the moving part 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.390
 we insert the can in we let 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.350
 rest 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.450
 I like putting them in position 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.460
 before like that after I block with my 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.270
 year at the detector or otherwise 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.829
 you can mother at the back 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.770
 there is probably no problem and 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.990
 then to remove the can during a 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.630
 debate there is no force 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.179
 no mark on the can they did 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.939
 so put inside you will see 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.549
 in the inside of the packaging 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.289
 there are you have two little stickers 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.109
 small foam stickers that are 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.270
 delivered with to put in the back is 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:01.670
 here in this gorge there in order to 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.979
 preserve your rods as much as possible 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.630
 that's enough the thickness will not interfere with the 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.740
 wound diameter of canes even the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.899
 big canes will be able to 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.460
 easily see there I have a cane to 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.310
 about standard size 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.490
 and I largely have room for 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.150
 m a larger diameter and then there 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.150
 it's really simple
