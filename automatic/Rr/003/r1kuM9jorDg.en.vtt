00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
me running to the other side so you can

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.370 
me running to the other side so you can
sort<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.390> see<00:01:03.629> how<00:01:04.589> long<00:01:05.240> it<00:01:06.240> takes<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.659> run<00:01:07.020> or
