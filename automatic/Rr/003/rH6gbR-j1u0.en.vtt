00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.309
 the mobile world congress 2014 is at 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.769
 follow here on 01net tv 25 dollars 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.870
 it's the cheapest smartphone price 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.759
 dear to the world and we saw this smartphone 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.490
 Jerome is a smartphone that 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.830
 will work that will exist soon thanks 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.199
 to firefox os and yes we are from here 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.480
 on the bad firefox stand for 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.769
 discover the latest advances in this 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.449
 operating system not like the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.830
 others if you want a little bit a little 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.570
 shot of firefox potions I believe that 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.430
 that was the smartphone no it was 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.130
 that's not it at all to push 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.620
 hair and we met tristan nitot 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.340
 who is the evangelist of firefox france 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.340
 and who answers our questions 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.410
 near rome who has a chinese society 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.789
 who manufactures silicon announced they 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.710
 were able to wish in 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.690
 do everything for a phone 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.820
 all the chips of a phone in one 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.730
 single point chip so it reduces the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.890
 costs and it goes down to the public price of 25 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.780
 $ which is just amazing for a 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.000
 smartphone and at the same time but we 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.049
 maximizes firefox bones which 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.909
 allows him to run in 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.430
 very small configurations by 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.790
 example a phone like these here and 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.960
 well it's his 128 megas of memory to 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.240
 compare an ex us 5 for example the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.620
 last google and two gigas of 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.880
 memory what so 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.410
 we evoke this step at all in the same 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.760
 category in terms of resources 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.250
 necessary to turn the 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.030
 system we evolved there we are in version 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.560
 1.3 version 1.1 bring the mms and 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.420
 then we will soon see the arrival 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.920
 dual sim the possibility of having two 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.760
 sim cards in the same phone 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.130
 as the NFC in the phone and then 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.080
 improvements or to perfect the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.230
 keyboard there 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.090
 the responsiveness of the application and it's 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.390
 still to do because we were launched 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.370
 in 15 different countries with three 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.690
 different phones 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.970
 now you have to touch even more 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.310
 of country so 2014 we want to add 12 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.480
 new markets there are already four 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.760
 new phones that have been 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.540
 presented and who are soon ready to 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.160
 to be marketed 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.110
 this one of yet a prototype so 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.510
 it's not it's not I do not count it 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.440
 in there then there is alcatel one touch which 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.960
 is well known French there is zpe 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:23.030
 weiwei has just proposed a new 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.010
 new phone there is vlg 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.630
 already and so they are growing 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.860
 many and then after there are those who 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.180
 come join us for example 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.800
 panasonic announced that they were doing 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.860
 that they were going to make televisions 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.050
 under firefox os then we already have some 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.230
 apps like that in the cloud we already have 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.370
 games like cut the rope disney has 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.750
 signed agreements with us to carry 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.150
 world which is a very popular game 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.560
 so it works because the 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.569
 developers are fed up with developing 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.400
 several versions one for android one 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.050
 for ios and then another for windows 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.450
 he what they want is to write a 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.890
 alone and sting it works everywhere we are 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.700
 a non-profit organization it 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.040
 must be remembered 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.690
 so we do not have market objectives 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.220
 or income or whatever that matters 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.209
 for us it is that the web becomes the 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.209
 mobile platform par excellence
