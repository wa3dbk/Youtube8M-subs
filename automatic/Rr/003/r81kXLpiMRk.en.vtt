idea but I have concerns about the
implementation<00:01:30.469> of<00:01:31.009> this<00:01:31.130> device<00:01:32.350> it's<00:01:33.350> a

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
implementation of this device it's a

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.300 
implementation of this device it's a
shame<00:01:33.619> it<00:01:33.770> could<00:01:33.890> have<00:01:33.979> been<00:01:34.040> a<00:01:34.100> lot<00:01:34.159> better

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310

than<00:01:34.640> it<00:01:34.670> is<00:01:34.939> I<00:01:35.180> don't<00:01:35.600> know<00:01:35.659> what<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:35.840> prices

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259

assume<00:01:40.039> it's<00:01:40.159> on<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.340> website<00:01:40.490> i'll<00:01:40.759> have<00:01:40.880> a

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
assume it's on the website i'll have a

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.719 
assume it's on the website i'll have a
hunt<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:41.210> find<00:01:41.360> it<00:01:41.539> but<00:01:42.320> yeah<00:01:42.979> it's<00:01:43.130> okay<00:01:43.490> if

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
hunt and find it but yeah it's okay if

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.850 
hunt and find it but yeah it's okay if
it's<00:01:44.060> cheap<00:01:44.149> I'd<00:01:44.750> buy<00:01:45.020> it<00:01:45.049> if<00:01:45.320> it's<00:01:45.469> not<00:01:45.619> cheap

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
it's cheap I'd buy it if it's not cheap

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.620 
it's cheap I'd buy it if it's not cheap
if<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:46.310> charging<00:01:46.670> too<00:01:46.820> much<00:01:46.850> then<00:01:47.240> i'd<00:01:47.420> say

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
if the charging too much then i'd say

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.779 
if the charging too much then i'd say
maybe<00:01:48.229> there<00:01:48.439> are<00:01:48.500> other<00:01:48.530> options<00:01:48.799> but<00:01:49.100> yes

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
maybe there are other options but yes

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.440 
maybe there are other options but yes
certainly<00:01:50.859> it's<00:01:51.859> a<00:01:52.100> piece<00:01:52.880> of<00:01:52.909> kit<00:01:53.149> you<00:01:53.270> might

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
certainly it's a piece of kit you might

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.609 
certainly it's a piece of kit you might
want<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.689> look<00:01:53.840> at<00:01:53.990> night<00:01:54.170> as<00:01:54.289> i<00:01:54.409> will<00:01:54.590> be

great it covers all the bases which

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.050 
great it covers all the bases which
means<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.370> can<00:02:38.370> actually<00:02:38.610> mix<00:02:38.849> and

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
means that you can actually mix and

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.280 
means that you can actually mix and
match<00:02:39.209> because<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.599> know<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.750> lot<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:39.930> people<00:02:40.019> you

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
transmitters brilliant why didn't they

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.220 
transmitters brilliant why didn't they
do<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:05.459> earlier<00:03:06.120> so<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:06.750> means<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:07.019> lot<00:03:07.139> of

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
do this earlier so it means a lot of

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.710 
do this earlier so it means a lot of
that<00:03:07.319> stuff<00:03:07.560> can<00:03:08.159> really<00:03:08.190> be<00:03:08.519> useful<00:03:09.299> now<00:03:09.450> I

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
that stuff can really be useful now I

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.300 
that stuff can really be useful now I
don't<00:03:10.200> know<00:03:10.319> if<00:03:10.409> I<00:03:10.470> mentioned<00:03:10.620> this<00:03:10.859> before

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
don't know if I mentioned this before

simple it's because there's so many bind
and<00:03:41.190> fly<00:03:41.220> models<00:03:41.699> out<00:03:41.849> there<00:03:41.879> you<00:03:42.120> know<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.269> go

was a hobby with you they gave you all
these<00:05:06.000> little<00:05:06.210> bits<00:05:06.360> of<00:05:06.450> ply<00:05:06.810> and<00:05:07.080> you<00:05:07.200> cut

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
these little bits of ply and you cut

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.140 
these little bits of ply and you cut
them<00:05:07.530> out<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.710> fritz<00:05:07.890> or<00:05:08.070> and<00:05:08.250> build<00:05:08.730> houses

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
them out the fritz or and build houses

and<00:05:09.300> cars<00:05:09.480> and<00:05:09.630> things<00:05:09.750> but<00:05:09.960> this<00:05:10.830> makes<00:05:11.070> some

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
and cars and things but this makes some

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.190 
and cars and things but this makes some
really<00:05:11.340> useful<00:05:11.550> stuff<00:05:11.790> a<00:05:12.000> board<00:05:12.570> camera<00:05:12.810> mount

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
really useful stuff a board camera mount

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.840 
really useful stuff a board camera mount
now<00:05:13.590> that's<00:05:13.800> got<00:05:13.980> to<00:05:14.070> be<00:05:14.160> useful<00:05:14.520> because<00:05:14.640> at

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
now that's got to be useful because at

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.180 
now that's got to be useful because at
the<00:05:14.910> moment<00:05:14.940> i<00:05:15.150> use<00:05:15.300> hot<00:05:15.420> glue<00:05:15.560> so<00:05:16.560> a<00:05:16.800> board

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
the moment i use hot glue so a board

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.440 
the moment i use hot glue so a board
camera<00:05:17.340> mount<00:05:17.640> that<00:05:17.940> you<00:05:18.060> can<00:05:18.180> just<00:05:18.270> glue

camera mount that you can just glue

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.940 
camera mount that you can just glue
together<00:05:18.630> stick<00:05:19.350> your<00:05:19.380> board<00:05:19.620> bolt<00:05:19.830> your

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
together stick your board bolt your

together stick your board bolt your
board<00:05:20.100> camera<00:05:20.280> to<00:05:20.460> it<00:05:20.550> if<00:05:20.760> that's<00:05:20.910> how<00:05:21.090> it

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
board camera to it if that's how it

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.850 
board camera to it if that's how it
works<00:05:21.360> it's<00:05:21.870> great<00:05:22.050> so<00:05:22.320> I've<00:05:22.410> got<00:05:22.560> a<00:05:22.590> selection

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
works it's great so I've got a selection

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.410 
works it's great so I've got a selection

fit up on this dry fit up for those who

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.630 
fit up on this dry fit up for those who
don't<00:05:43.650> know<00:05:43.770> just<00:05:44.070> means<00:05:44.250> put<00:05:44.430> it<00:05:44.520> together

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
don't know just means put it together

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.880 
don't know just means put it together
without<00:05:45.000> glue<00:05:45.510> and<00:05:46.020> it's<00:05:46.320> really<00:05:46.470> easy<00:05:46.560> in

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
without glue and it's really easy in

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.080 
without glue and it's really easy in
this<00:05:46.950> case<00:05:47.160> because<00:05:47.310> Ali's<00:05:47.580> that<00:05:47.760> seem<00:05:47.940> to<00:05:48.030> be

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
this case because Ali's that seem to be

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.060 
this case because Ali's that seem to be
quite<00:05:48.240> nicely<00:05:48.510> engineered<00:05:48.750> if<00:05:49.530> i<00:05:49.710> push<00:05:49.950> this

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
quite nicely engineered if i push this

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.230 
quite nicely engineered if i push this
together<00:05:50.280> you'll<00:05:50.700> see<00:05:50.970> what<00:05:51.150> I'm<00:05:51.210> talking

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
together you'll see what I'm talking

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.750 
together you'll see what I'm talking
about<00:05:51.570> there<00:05:52.050> you<00:05:52.200> go<00:05:52.380> look<00:05:52.620> at<00:05:52.710> that<00:05:52.890> now<00:05:53.520> I

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
about there you go look at that now I

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.010 
about there you go look at that now I
know<00:05:53.790> so<00:05:54.030> there<00:05:54.180> is<00:05:54.240> a<00:05:54.270> little<00:05:54.510> bit<00:05:54.600> of<00:05:54.630> a<00:05:54.720> gap

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
know so there is a little bit of a gap

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.830 
know so there is a little bit of a gap
here<00:05:55.050> but<00:05:55.650> it<00:05:56.400> doesn't<00:05:56.700> matter<00:05:56.820> because<00:05:56.970> the

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
here but it doesn't matter because the

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.080 
here but it doesn't matter because the
strength<00:05:58.140> is<00:05:58.260> coming<00:05:58.530> from<00:05:58.650> these<00:05:59.090> carbon

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
strength is coming from these carbon

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.840 
strength is coming from these carbon
rods<00:06:00.500> so<00:06:01.500> be<00:06:01.740> watching<00:06:02.100> for<00:06:02.250> that<00:06:02.310> very<00:06:02.610> soon

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
rods so be watching for that very soon

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:03.890 
rods so be watching for that very soon
because<00:06:02.970> I<00:06:03.090> want<00:06:03.240> to<00:06:03.300> do<00:06:03.390> a<00:06:03.420> lot<00:06:03.540> of<00:06:03.600> work<00:06:03.780> of

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
because I want to do a lot of work of

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.690 
because I want to do a lot of work of
that<00:06:03.990> little<00:06:04.200> capita<00:06:04.620> inna<00:06:04.890> and<00:06:05.070> because<00:06:05.670> of

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
that little capita inna and because of

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.400 
that little capita inna and because of
they've<00:06:05.880> got<00:06:06.030> bits<00:06:06.480> of<00:06:06.600> flying<00:06:06.810> wing<00:06:07.110> it's<00:06:07.320> a

they've got bits of flying wing it's a

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.900 
they've got bits of flying wing it's a
black<00:06:07.650> flying<00:06:07.950> wing<00:06:08.130> I've<00:06:08.340> also<00:06:08.550> got<00:06:08.700> the<00:06:08.790> RV
