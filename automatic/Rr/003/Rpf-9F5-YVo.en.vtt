00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
three balls for just each in the alt so

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.490 
three balls for just each in the alt so
you'll<00:00:16.440> notice<00:00:16.710> right<00:00:16.770> now<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:18.350> I've<00:00:19.350> got

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
you'll notice right now that I've got

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.660 
you'll notice right now that I've got
this<00:00:19.590> number<00:00:19.830> count<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.130> how<00:00:20.220> many<00:00:20.250> balls<00:00:20.490> on

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
this number count of how many balls on

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.580 
this number count of how many balls on
the<00:00:20.760> field<00:00:21.000> since<00:00:21.210> there's<00:00:21.420> zero<00:00:21.720> my<00:00:22.380> base<00:00:22.560> is

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
the field since there's zero my base is

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.300 
the field since there's zero my base is
3<00:00:23.000> so<00:00:24.000> if<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.449> found<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:25.050> now<00:00:25.769> my<00:00:25.920> alts

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
3 so if I found one now my alts

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.800 
3 so if I found one now my alts
immediately<00:00:26.849> increased<00:00:27.240> by<00:00:27.359> thirty<00:00:27.630> three

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
immediately increased by thirty three

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.210 
immediately increased by thirty three
percent<00:00:27.869> damage<00:00:28.230> just<00:00:28.590> might<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.800> doing<00:00:29.070> that

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
percent damage just might be doing that

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.139 
percent damage just might be doing that
I<00:00:29.490> spawn<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> second<00:00:30.570> one<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:31.730> get<00:00:32.730> up<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.910> five

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
I spawn the second one I get up to five

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.270 
I spawn the second one I get up to five
really<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.380> by<00:00:34.500> having<00:00:34.649> two<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> field

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
really just by having two on the field

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.700 
really just by having two on the field
again<00:00:35.850> now<00:00:36.180> instead<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.230> having<00:00:37.290> three<00:00:37.559> ball

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
again now instead of having three ball

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.410 
again now instead of having three ball
05<00:00:38.190> you've<00:00:38.579> increased<00:00:38.820> your<00:00:38.969> damaged<00:00:39.270> by

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
05 you've increased your damaged by

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.850 
05 you've increased your damaged by
sixty-six<00:00:39.930> percent<00:00:42.020> this<00:00:43.020> one<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.500> reasons<00:00:43.649> I

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
sixty-six percent this one the reasons I

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.760 
sixty-six percent this one the reasons I
really<00:00:43.980> like<00:00:44.219> CDR<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:45.120> sentra<00:00:45.690> because<00:00:45.930> you

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
really like CDR on sentra because you

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.430 
really like CDR on sentra because you
can<00:00:48.200> get<00:00:49.200> more<00:00:49.410> balls<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.039> play<00:00:50.190> easier

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
can get more balls and play easier

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.779 
can get more balls and play easier
because<00:00:52.440> these<00:00:52.710> do<00:00:52.890> disappear<00:00:53.340> after<00:00:53.610> six

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
because these do disappear after six

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.110 
because these do disappear after six
seconds<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.360> with<00:00:55.199> Mexico<00:00:55.739> your<00:00:56.280> cooldowns

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
seconds and with Mexico your cooldowns

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.770 
seconds and with Mexico your cooldowns
like<00:00:57.300> 3.4<00:00:57.989> or<00:00:58.020> something<00:00:58.879> so<00:00:59.879> all<00:01:00.600> rights

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
like 3.4 or something so all rights

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.349 
like 3.4 or something so all rights
probably<00:01:01.050> four<00:01:01.199> seconds<00:01:02.090> right<00:01:03.090> now<00:01:03.180> I've<00:01:03.329> got

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
probably four seconds right now I've got

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.810 
probably four seconds right now I've got
a<00:01:03.539> 35-percent<00:01:04.260> CDR<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.610> actually

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
a 35-percent CDR and you can actually

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.179 
a 35-percent CDR and you can actually
get<00:01:06.090> up<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.330> seven<00:01:06.720> bowls<00:01:06.960> on<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.380> field<00:01:07.619> and

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
get up to seven bowls on the field and

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.780 
get up to seven bowls on the field and
how<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.979> eq<00:01:11.570> then<00:01:13.280> you

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
how you do it is eq then you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.970 
how you do it is eq then you
now<00:01:15.480> you're<00:01:15.570> going<00:01:15.690> to<00:01:15.750> cue<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.260> grab<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
now you're going to cue and grab the

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.210 
now you're going to cue and grab the
previous<00:01:17.340> key<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:17.610> you're<00:01:17.700> joking<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:20.070> we

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
previous key with you're joking so we

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.060 
previous key with you're joking so we
try<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.580> one<00:01:20.730> more<00:01:20.760> time<00:01:21.440> for<00:01:22.440> my<00:01:22.530> W<00:01:22.860> group

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
try that one more time for my W group

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.680 
try that one more time for my W group
this<00:01:23.190> month<00:01:23.400> kinda<00:01:24.090> had<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.240> do<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.510> while<00:01:24.660> I'm

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
this month kinda had to do it while I'm

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.020 
this month kinda had to do it while I'm
saying<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.110> basically<00:01:25.650> when<00:01:26.190> you<00:01:26.280> grab<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> ball

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
saying it basically when you grab a ball

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.920 
saying it basically when you grab a ball
with<00:01:27.180> W<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.780> respawn<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:29.520> resets<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.270> timer<00:01:30.780> on

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
with W it respawn it resets the timer on

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.160 
with W it respawn it resets the timer on
how<00:01:31.290> long<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.710> going<00:01:31.830> to<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.250> play<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.630> by

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
how long it's going to be in play so by

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.280 
how long it's going to be in play so by
doing<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.010> actually<00:01:35.190> get<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:36.570> third

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
doing that you can actually get a third

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.170 
doing that you can actually get a third
ball<00:01:37.500> into<00:01:37.830> play<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.310> with<00:01:38.490> low<00:01:38.640> enough<00:01:38.760> CDR

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
ball into play and with low enough CDR

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.160 
ball into play and with low enough CDR
you<00:01:39.300> can<00:01:39.420> get<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> fourth<00:01:41.660> all<00:01:42.660> right<00:01:42.780> my<00:01:42.930> cues

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
you can get a fourth all right my cues

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:52.780 
you can get a fourth all right my cues
up<00:01:43.410> so<00:01:44.240> I'll<00:01:45.240> hecho<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.780> universe<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:48.020> 12

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.550 

micrograph<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.660> can<00:01:54.810> see<00:01:54.960> I've<00:01:55.110> got<00:01:55.140> seven

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
micrograph you can see I've got seven

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.960 
micrograph you can see I've got seven
right<00:01:55.710> there<00:01:55.860> for<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.040> very<00:01:56.130> brief<00:01:56.430> amount<00:01:56.850> of

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
right there for a very brief amount of

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:06.680 
right there for a very brief amount of
time

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.410 

you<00:02:07.260> may<00:02:07.410> not<00:02:07.590> get<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.920> seventh<00:02:08.250> 1<00:02:08.400> in<00:02:08.460> but<00:02:09.330> you

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
you may not get the seventh 1 in but you

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.609 
you may not get the seventh 1 in but you
should<00:02:09.600> be<00:02:09.630> able<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.900> the<00:02:09.990> 61<00:02:10.320> in<00:02:10.440> pretty

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
should be able to the 61 in pretty

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.060 
should be able to the 61 in pretty
easily<00:02:11.420> if<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:13.170> have<00:02:13.320> like<00:02:13.500> at<00:02:13.620> least<00:02:13.680> twenty

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
easily if you have like at least twenty

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.960 
easily if you have like at least twenty
percent<00:02:14.280> CDR<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.830> I<00:02:16.830> mean<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.460> think<00:02:17.640> it's<00:02:17.820> kind

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
percent CDR and I mean I think it's kind

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.910 
percent CDR and I mean I think it's kind

fires<00:02:22.860> grass<00:02:23.130> well<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.460> joke<00:02:29.450> so<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.810> guess

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
fires grass well a joke so I guess

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.650 
fires grass well a joke so I guess
basically<00:02:32.550> I'm<00:02:32.640> saying<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.090> your<00:02:33.270> goal<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.630> to

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
basically I'm saying is your goal is to

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.280 
basically I'm saying is your goal is to
aim<00:02:34.020> for<00:02:34.050> at<00:02:34.740> least<00:02:34.860> six<00:02:35.430> balls<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:35.970> field

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
aim for at least six balls on the field

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.040 
aim for at least six balls on the field
rather<00:02:37.290> than<00:02:37.470> just<00:02:37.740> alternate<00:02:38.460> for<00:02:38.820> five<00:02:39.630> or

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
rather than just alternate for five or

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.740 
rather than just alternate for five or
even<00:02:40.670> three<00:02:41.670> because<00:02:42.120> if<00:02:42.240> you<00:02:42.330> think<00:02:42.360> about<00:02:42.570> it

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
even three because if you think about it

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.020 
even three because if you think about it
if<00:02:43.080> yelled<00:02:43.290> at<00:02:43.410> three<00:02:43.710> instead<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.250> six<00:02:44.490> you

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
if yelled at three instead of six you

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.920 
if yelled at three instead of six you
just<00:02:45.210> have<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.510> roll<00:02:45.570> its<00:02:45.810> damage<00:02:47.630> I<00:02:50.930> dodged

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
just have to roll its damage I dodged

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.610 
just have to roll its damage I dodged
show<00:02:52.410> CC<00:02:52.920> enough<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.340> be<00:02:53.460> able<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:53.670> do<00:02:53.850> this<00:02:54.620> all

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
show CC enough to be able to do this all

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:03.229 
show CC enough to be able to do this all
right

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:09.890 

surely

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.660 

and<00:03:10.900> that's<00:03:11.620> how<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:11.769> do<00:03:11.890> it<00:03:11.920> so<00:03:12.220> one<00:03:12.489> two

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
and that's how you do it so one two

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.589 
and that's how you do it so one two
three<00:03:12.879> four<00:03:13.060> five<00:03:13.239> six<00:03:13.299> seven<00:03:15.360> balls<00:03:16.360> on<00:03:16.510> the

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
three four five six seven balls on the

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.610 
three four five six seven balls on the
field

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
field

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:30.400 
field
yay<00:03:27.340> all<00:03:28.340> right
