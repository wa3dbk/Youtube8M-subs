what the bill focuses around and that's

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.029 
what the bill focuses around and that's
mainly<00:01:21.610> because<00:01:21.759> as<00:01:22.539> soon<00:01:22.899> as<00:01:23.110> another<00:01:23.800> mob

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039

skills<00:01:28.990> and<00:01:30.209> they'll<00:01:31.209> take<00:01:31.479> up<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:31.810> 60<00:01:32.170> or<00:01:32.200> 70

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
skills and they'll take up to 60 or 70

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.010

every time they hit you

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.190 
every time they hit you
so<00:01:36.759> you're<00:01:36.940> just<00:01:36.970> degrading<00:01:37.569> the<00:01:37.690> whole<00:01:37.869> group

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
so you're just degrading the whole group

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.320 
so you're just degrading the whole group
and<00:01:38.440> it's<00:01:38.950> not<00:01:39.130> really<00:01:39.399> focusing<00:01:39.789> around<00:01:39.970> the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
and it's not really focusing around the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.880 
and it's not really focusing around the
damage<00:01:40.660> that<00:01:40.840> you<00:01:40.929> do<00:01:41.110> melee<00:01:41.800> wise<00:01:43.530> now<00:01:44.530> for

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
damage that you do melee wise now for

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.199 
damage that you do melee wise now for
