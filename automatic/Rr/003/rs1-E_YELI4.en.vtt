doing holiday tutorials now I was trying

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.279 
doing holiday tutorials now I was trying
to<00:00:20.640> think<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.449> something<00:00:21.660> from<00:00:21.990> Thanksgiving

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
to think of something from Thanksgiving

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.290 
to think of something from Thanksgiving
to<00:00:22.769> inspire<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.609> look<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.090> was<00:00:24.180> like

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
to inspire this look so I was like

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.839 
to inspire this look so I was like
envisioning<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.260> Thanksgiving<00:00:26.220> table<00:00:26.430> set

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
envisioning a Thanksgiving table set

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.060 
envisioning a Thanksgiving table set
with<00:00:27.000> food<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.720> thought<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.380> cranberries

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
with food and I thought of cranberries

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.070 
with food and I thought of cranberries
so<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.519> looks<00:00:29.730> how<00:00:29.849> they<00:00:30.029> cranberry<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.689> and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
so this looks how they cranberry I and

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.600

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
then I just kept the rest of the face

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.780 
then I just kept the rest of the face
really<00:00:33.450> nice<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.020> neutral<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.760> overall<00:00:35.760> I
