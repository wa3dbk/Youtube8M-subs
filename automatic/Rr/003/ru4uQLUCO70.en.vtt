00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:13.449
 Soderling of Shiites to think 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:15.829
 the probes 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:19.509
 pigment some emollient shadows as you see 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:21.380
 all tent 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.749
 in this sense 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:25.640
 for this meeting of the fifth 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.119
 we must do 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.669
 so that's about three months 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.750
 the one who was the spokesperson 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.700
 we are already seeing with all the companies 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.700
 believe that the sample 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.190
 thank you very much to all 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.670
 also for fighting 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.670
 the first time you play anything 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.770
 two 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.780
 I just love it for 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.950
 in all maple who to the thriller the cinema 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.059
 they will remain very accurate, they do not miss the goal 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.780
 percent the works too 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.830
 take the shadow 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.810
 makes it finally mind 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.090
 very well the shadow 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.159
 larsson bradl what you do jaime m 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.159
 here very 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 pack and africa 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.400
 the pigments also 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.509
 you can work very well with young loose shadows 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.030
 because I like 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.320
 I like to always have 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.320
 what is cooked 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.139
 that if the picaresque hands 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:27.689
 also serves for today 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.689
 and especially here 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.349
 the eye socket 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.319
 can continue to achieve the effect of increases 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.779
 those shadows 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:41.779
 climb little by little 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:47.689
 the previous night 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.689
 iu explains 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.299
 with the two preseas 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:08.849
 it has the peculiarity 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.919
 blurring at once 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.469
 is that stay 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:15.769
 They are cards 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.769
 much softer 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:26.929
 in the difference in height 

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:31.039
 for me I do not like them depending on the luxury that I want to achieve for another of 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:34.889
 the gap to five those that only applied one hundred the area 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.710
 and especially percent in the corners of nolan 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.649
 before 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:44.979
 a little more precise yes I want in the first part of the eye 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.939
 between tears and a third treading 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.489
 the 106 of the barcelÃ³ brand 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:56.619
 good is taken advantage of 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:59.929
 ares also runs very well the shadow in powder 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:03.710
 I would apply it is very very precise too 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:09.210
 do the same as the 2 39 marquez that pack and in the shade another that do the 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.210
 same function as the 2 13 the theme 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.169
 percent techint and 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:18.900
 2 28 others 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.209
 if you realize in comparison 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.229
 13 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.449
 in the same only that holland chiquitica that the other 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.550
 and this one I love also used it very little, not what it is but 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.919
 just today in salamanca 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.490
 I love it because it's also blurred 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.539
 and especially certain parts 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.129
 especially in the most chiquitita parts 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.129
 the most chiquititas part is usually determined 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.099
 not even blur only certain junctions 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:54.039
 I would give a brush 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.069
 already for makeup is a little bit more 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:58.819
 without further elaboration 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:01.469
 another one that I also like to apply 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:06.340
 shadows the f150 unhappy mochero of the squares the appointment 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.199
 It also has a 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.449
 good view 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.779
 to apply the very precise shadow and from the other side 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:15.620
 he has a very, very little 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.809
 immobilism 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:21.069
 very nice porcel applications hence the inherent amazes also 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:23.580
 very well done and after what I am 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.969
 it's a little fatter 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:28.289
 and especially for the primaries also to blur 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:31.289
 more precise lines 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.099
 1 2 3 6 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:38.100
 and the art 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.469
 chiquititas 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:41.819
 here we have them 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:45.370
 the SUV i go to those I erase 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.270
 2 17 others 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:58.379
 photo to the girls he shares 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:01.559
 percent and videos on youtube use it a lot 

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:03.029
 most not all 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:04.339
 the escrow 

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:09.979
 so much or emollient products ie painters beijing 6 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:13.330
 shadows interpreted shadows in dust 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.020
 and 500 also blurs even 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.020
 up smiling here too 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:23.339
 of which one of the spoelstra's Christmas collection proved difficult 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:25.639
 I do not have it 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:28.009
 as they see the ucr did a lot 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:32.139
 and a year ago they discovered that they used one that I love is that the 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:33.900
 what can you support 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.900
 I'm going to buy another one like 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:40.749
 222 to blur 

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:43.749
 if we compare it with the 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:48.840
 that the 2 22 is much longer and thinner than 2007 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:51.439
 but also 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:54.779
 it doesn'' T work 

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:57.430
 master the subject of unions 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.430
 you make blurring in a circle 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.210
 kikin and environmental 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.719
