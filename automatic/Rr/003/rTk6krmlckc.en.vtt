00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.830
 hello to all of you guys this video 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.290
 second not only van persie 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.480
 com is about to serve me credits 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.220
 guys start by giving you news or 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.279
 I decided to increase a little i 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.400
 credits from every goal we bring them praises 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.470
 1500 I would say to leave them at 1500 mah in 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.400
 case van persie I do direct masses o 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.610
 indirect 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.140
 500 more credits will be given 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.309
 because why manchester is one 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.170
 team that has players that often 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.030
 and gladly they cost so much then 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.590
 not being able to make every game a hat-trick 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.350
 with the good advantage because it is not a 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.519
 player I'm using 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.519
 very much and since I don't want to 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.530
 getting bored of basically playing ho 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.479
 decided this so let's try 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.330
 speeding up a bit will cost 30 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:57.479
 episodes on this series the boca cable and 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:00.210
 gives us a great goal in my opinion is one 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.670
 good win with the first team that 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.799
 it was a ligated weapon, stuff from that movie 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.729
 we see the second game where there 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.860
 we find 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.040
 against this beautiful team a beautiful one 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.810
 annoying premier league a lot 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.590
 annoying they worried me a lot 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.170
 that saints cazorla ii and redick players 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.960
 obviously those who score are not strong 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.820
 they mark and the good ramires a great one 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.200
 unfortunately I regret a player 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.780
 little because having to stay in the middle 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.480
 senator luigi who in chelsea capite 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.910
 well that is a hut do not ask for 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.500
 do series on chelsea or manchester city 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.360
 for a purpose on the players 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.880
 the way we do it would make us one 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.180
 life but lost however 45 does not admit 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.490
 on the same level and cheerfully gives us 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.340
 one to one with a great grand goal 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.660
 left now it turns out he scored of 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.260
 right I don't remember who scored of 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.720
 left in great goal with and let's go to 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.670
 presents to the 55th a stuff of that 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.560
 type I was supposed to welbeck I'm appearing is 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.870
 fantastic but by accident that luck 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.020
 intervention and marks the 2 to 1 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.710
 weighs the wait closes at 75th vi 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.929
 it seems because my opponent in practice 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.300
 here from in a few words here of 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:17.010
 consequently I did n't get the chance 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.930
 to continue the game but in things 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.320
 I'll show you how I evaluated the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.810
 good fellaini 1900 credits if not 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.820
 I remember badly 1900 as that 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.670
 which is the value would be only 2000 but for 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.590
 my luck there was a fellini I would have 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.690
 could buy at 1900 and come on 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.820
 cheerfully then why later 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.890
 where I tell you here it was taken in blows 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.880
 because I had players 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.150
 very fast 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.890
 the defense of the match 6 night and it is 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.950
 the first is truly scandalous 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.280
 which is why it bores me to play this 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.959
 team after I don't find it and I'm there 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.890
 playing strength because the series is 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:59.190
 started but got rooney we finish it 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.959
 because it is depressing why you 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.820
 play play play make goals like 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:08.100
 this and then ok the defense takes goals 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.170
 terry of the terrible stuff that is not there 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.489
 was a game to date perhaps 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.209
 only the first you saw that it is 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.989
 over without taking a goal e 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.750
 shocking the problem you know what it is 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.549
 that there is smalling and evans it seems to me that 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.739
 on players who no more than 70 of 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.530
 speed here should be fast 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.810
 Quick pussy are as slow as a goat 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.020
 hallucinating stuff this very good me 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.480
 however to mark the yes 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.330
 11 this should be one to one 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.310
 then oh well later here I had taken the 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.290
 home put us get up an hour that 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:46.080
 bastard is obviously done on 2 1 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.120
 billion that this match that is 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.890
 devastating I don't know why they play 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.810
 so good when i use our bread 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.520
 olives are unlucky and the match 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.560
 next this day I propose to you 4 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.000
 because not a few were said then 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.240
 petty are few I show myself 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 a few goals I will show you more games 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.670
 here we go against this beautiful team 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.430
 that I didn't understand why he had made gods 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.520
 I understood silver in the match because 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.140
 not very quick players very much 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.760
 annoying but luckily for me they were 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.680
 always silver game therefore they had 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.930
 relatively low values of the 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.670
 their scales the goal van persie which one 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.530
 slips into the opponent's field and throws it 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.180
 half and makes a nice web assist that 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.430
 so these are the first 500 grams of 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.030
 direct assist weight of the good 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:38.410
 bancaires and we forgive everyone of course 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.390
 how many in cash but let's go further and here 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.370
 always with van persie puts in the middle a 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.500
 great ball for valence that also marks 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.260
 here another head angle other 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.970
 assists of van persie other 500 credit 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.430
 as usual for video purposes find the 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.860
 short bomber you see in short 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.920
 where I explain to you purchases everything 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.480
 as I refer you to the next video 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:03.750
 doing here however present that 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.750
 I will not buy as many players said 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.670
 there is now I think it remained rooney young 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.270
 if I did n't already like it I didn't buy it 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:16.050
 I buy very short, however, young 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.720
 money I think will be the player with whom you are 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.030
 he knows that with 60 70 thousand credits you buy 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.670
 I will make a proposal to you 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.400
 proposal if you like it I will proceed to 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:29.160
 buy players as they are when 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.470
 only rooney will remain since I already have it 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.140
 in team he shoves the team e 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.120
 we conclude the series because why 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.620
 otherwise you make 50,000 credits 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.700
 with this team 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.810
 I go to the asylum is called just 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.990
 stood out where the element armani like 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:49.050
 because it is really tough to play with 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.460
 this team is really difficult 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.620
 I invite you to play with the defense of 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.230
 mentioned found that they placed a 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.530
 fuck find it and there is wines you will give me 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:01.890
 reason is first really unworthy stuff 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.240
 unworthy to try in her in the cast i 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.850
 guys thank you I can refer you 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.110
 video I refer you to totti maybe someone 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.250
 of you did not see all the links found 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.910
 in description of the various series that 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.970
 let's make 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.680
 there is something that probably escapes me 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.730
 will come to mind in the next episode 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.710
 I'm kidding 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:20.960
 there is nothing that escapes me 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.960
 I thank the videos and the cia
