00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.870
 from there there and here and less a video 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.090
 and this time we're getting episode 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.580
 of the series how to play to sell and now 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.980
 we are with time or chemist as 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.430
 Prefer to call let's start here by 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.830
 skills so pleasing the team is called 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.109
 camouflage so if he stands still for 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.020
 a given a short time 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.700
 it will stay invisible and after you leave 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.800
 this time camouflage will gain a 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.410
 element that will increase your 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.480
 speed and attack and 40% for three 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.280
 seconds 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.170
 the first time Sunday is called 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.340
 from the kant office where he states a 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.469
 in the enemy that will cause damage to 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.690
 drive and will also get to it 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.300
 for a certain period of time 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.480
 so the fifth and last one is called moving 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.420
 quickly it is activated from it a bonus 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.400
 movement speed and those that 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.560
 also possessed passive that even when 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.600
 activated will also give the chemist the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.659
 moving city passively 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.990
 as he had said, until he was hit by 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.119
 a champion or enemy then in addition to being 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.380
 only when activated can 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.869
 It will also only increase like 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.960
 movement until it is reached or by a 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.700
 enemy champion or the enemy tower to 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.250
 third left that is not called a shot 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.130
 toxic and it works passively 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.369
 ie it does not need to be activated and is 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.170
 makes all the children of the quilombo 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.840
 go with a poison that will poison the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.009
 your target is that it will do damage to the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.390
 impact and every four seconds thereafter 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.670
 ultimate of the helm is called a trap 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.649
 venomous where it puts a trap 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.350
 poison using one of the mushrooms 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.450
 stored in your bag and when being 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.640
 activated it will jump poisonous human 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.670
 causing slowness and continuous 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.950
 fierce enemies she is now the best 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.219
 for the styles mentioned above 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.899
 so who wants to just pause and 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.940
 selecting according to what you 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.060
 evolves during the match and 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.710
 remembering that it only takes us 6 11 and 16 that 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.080
 can be related 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.460
 huth or selected the ticket for the 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.410
 same 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.510
 in my opinion this is the best dem 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.790
 to form the Bible and for the team 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.590
 starting with a wizard's boot that 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.960
 goes from the magic presentation 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.570
 soon after in hurricane of rum that 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.940
 will give 70% attack speed 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.490
 soon after we closed a disease 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.850
 that will give power of ability and also 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.220
 more attack speed and then 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.650
 Rabon was famous that gives me 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.190
 will give us a lot of 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.350
 power of ability and soon thereafter 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.720
 we formed a torment of leandrinho 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.990
 that validate 300's of life and also 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.000
 magic penetration and some more a little 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.770
 of power and last ability 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.840
 we closed a crystal of philae that goes 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.720
 give you 500 life that will help 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.300
 and will also give you more power. 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.200
 to the skill in my opinion the streets 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.110
 for the team 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.450
 are red with nine types 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.260
 sit attack speed of 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.170
 yellow 9 armor in blue and nine 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.400
 skill racing and the big 3d 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.110
 power of ability 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.750
 now part of the talents in my 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.210
 It would be best to distribute 21 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.280
 points for attack nine for defense and 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.200
 nor a point for utility remembering 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.690
 who wants to follow the same is just passing the 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.670
 Video do it the way that it is then 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.000
 That's it, we ended up here with the 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.950
 episode of how to play well and sig 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.590
 helped if you liked click and liked 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.900
 to help register the channel disclose 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.820
 Favorite extra is this, guys, I'm going 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.820
 staying here was worth
