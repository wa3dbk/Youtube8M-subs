 for your mobile that cost less than 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.230
 6 dollars a little more than five euros to 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.030
 change these lenses allow us for a 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.220
 side modify the field of view of the 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.529
 camera and on the other hand be able to perform 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.030
 macro photographs if after seeing the 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.410
 you are interested in buying them in the 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.270
 description I leave the link to the 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.040
 best gear store that is from where I 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.330
 have come to me this accessory is ideal 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.100
 to give a little more to the game 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.469
 camera on your smartphone for five euros 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.079
 what it costs gives us a wide range of 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.670
 possibilities of course the lenses do not 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.920
 they will have a quality like those of a 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.989
 lens of an SLR camera but for 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.909
 photos that we want to share through networks 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.859
 social problems if we see what we 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.230
 comes with this accessory we observe that 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:50.510
 we have in the first place the lenses a 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.850
 clamp some caps to protect the 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.399
 objectives and a sachet to keep it 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.679
 all basically what we have is a 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.479
 clip that hooks over the camera 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.579
 our mobile as you are seeing 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.350
 now on the screen when done the 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.390
 unpacking the product you have seen 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.460
 that there were only two lenses but really 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.640
 there are three we have the field of vision 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.800
 wide the fish eye and the macro what 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.909
 what happens is that the macro and the lens of 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.520
 field of view 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.079
 they are coiled one above the other and 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.880
 than to use the wide lens 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.950
 we need to place under it the 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.929
 macro when we want to use one or the other 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.240
 we just have to screw them in 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.189
 the clip so that it can then be put 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.630
 on the camera of our mobile what 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.819
 only you have to take into account 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.890
 As I have already told you, the lens with 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:35.329
 Wide field of view should be coiled 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.649
 over the mcal lens 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.479
 I have tested this lens in different 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.030
 mobile phones and are compatible with 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.280
 practically all of the market by 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.709
 example on an iPhone 6 plus can be 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.289
 place perfectly so that you see in 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:50.959
 what each lens consists of and what photos 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.789
 they start with the macro lens this 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.739
 type of lens is what they let us do 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.780
 is to take pictures of objects that are 

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:58.849
 they find very close to the target without 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.500
 she could not focus so close and 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:02.780
 take out the small details of the 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.789
 objects for example I am now going to take 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.069
 photos of a piece of string from a 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.200
 small shell and the sand on the beach 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.090
 the images that you are seeing now are 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.700
 the ones that I have taken with this lens and my 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.220
 samsung galaxy 14 as you can see the result 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.870
 it's pretty cool and curious the next 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.880
 lens that I want you to see is the eye 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.840
 of fish for it to be fixed first in this 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.910
 picture taken 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.980
 no type of lens with my mobile in 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.410
 special you are attentive to the buildings 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.269
 now if we take the same picture with the 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.660
 fisheye lens field of view 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.160
 goes up to 170 180 degrees and it 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.650
 they collect more part of the buildings 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.810
 we also see black edges in the 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.700
 corners of the photo if someone does not 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.290
 like this what could be done is 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.330
 crop the image a bit to 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.310
 remove them this other image is also 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.950
 taken with the fish eye lens put 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.540
 in my samsung galaxy know 4 and finally 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.849
 I want you to see the field lens of 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.069
 broad vision as before I teach you 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.340
 first this image taken without any 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.739
 type of lens we now see the image with 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.840
 the lens set we almost have the same 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.610
 effect that with the fisheye but only 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.310
 that here we have a little less effect 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.079
 barrel and less field of vision this has 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.329
 been everything for today if you liked the 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.420
