00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
I don't do more than one layer unless I

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.319 
I don't do more than one layer unless I
need<00:03:10.379> to<00:03:10.620> spot<00:03:10.950> conceal<00:03:11.370> what<00:03:11.669> you<00:03:11.819> can<00:03:12.060> do

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
need to spot conceal what you can do

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.190 
need to spot conceal what you can do
with<00:03:12.569> this<00:03:12.750> foundation<00:03:13.470> according<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.250> Mac

with this foundation according to Mac

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.530 
with this foundation according to Mac
but<00:03:16.220> one<00:03:17.220> layer<00:03:17.430> is<00:03:17.700> more<00:03:17.879> than<00:03:18.060> enough<00:03:18.299> for<00:03:18.480> me

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
but one layer is more than enough for me

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.199 
but one layer is more than enough for me
and<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:18.840> think<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:19.200> looks<00:03:19.290> perfect<00:03:20.180> secondly<00:03:21.180> I

in general
and<00:04:24.270> I<00:04:24.600> ordered<00:04:24.810> it<00:04:25.110> before<00:04:25.260> she<00:04:25.740> even<00:04:25.919> did

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070

because I just really liked the idea

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.960 
because I just really liked the idea
that<00:04:27.900> we<00:04:28.050> foundation<00:04:28.560> now<00:04:29.160> this<00:04:29.370> claims<00:04:29.669> to<00:04:29.850> be

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
that we foundation now this claims to be

that we foundation now this claims to be
waterproof<00:04:30.389> I<00:04:31.020> don't<00:04:31.919> know<00:04:32.250> that<00:04:32.730> I<00:04:32.760> would

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970

ever go swimming with a full face of
makeup<00:04:34.740> I<00:04:35.490> mean<00:04:36.150> that<00:04:36.389> would<00:04:36.510> be<00:04:36.540> like<00:04:36.810> a

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
makeup I mean that would be like a

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.930 
makeup I mean that would be like a
really<00:04:37.050> good<00:04:37.139> experiment<00:04:37.919> but<00:04:38.220> it's<00:04:38.430> just<00:04:38.639> not

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
really good experiment but it's just not

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.000 
really good experiment but it's just not
something<00:04:39.210> that<00:04:39.450> I<00:04:39.600> attest<00:04:40.200> to<00:04:40.410> it<00:04:40.620> so<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:40.889> don't

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
something that I attest to it so I don't

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.900 
something that I attest to it so I don't
know<00:04:41.370> if<00:04:41.940> it's<00:04:42.840> waterproof<00:04:43.470> what<00:04:44.340> I<00:04:44.370> do<00:04:44.490> know

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
know if it's waterproof what I do know

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.970 
know if it's waterproof what I do know
is<00:04:45.240> that<00:04:45.570> if<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:45.930> apply<00:04:46.200> this<00:04:46.320> with<00:04:46.770> a<00:04:46.950> brush

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
is that if you apply this with a brush

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.640 
is that if you apply this with a brush
and<00:04:47.490> you<00:04:47.760> let<00:04:48.000> your<00:04:48.180> brush<00:04:48.480> stay<00:04:48.870> with<00:04:49.020> fix+

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
and you let your brush stay with fix+

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.690 
and you let your brush stay with fix+
or<00:04:50.010> some<00:04:50.700> kind<00:04:51.000> of<00:04:51.090> spray<00:04:51.540> or<00:04:52.400> sponge<00:04:53.400> it

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
or some kind of spray or sponge it

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.790 
or some kind of spray or sponge it
really<00:04:54.030> thins<00:04:54.300> out<00:04:54.480> the<00:04:54.540> foundation<00:04:55.350> so<00:04:55.620> if

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
really thins out the foundation so if

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.930 
really thins out the foundation so if

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
you apply it with something like that

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.719 
you apply it with something like that
you're<00:04:57.090> gonna<00:04:57.210> get<00:04:57.330> a<00:04:57.389> sheer<00:04:57.780> coverage<00:04:58.229> and<00:04:58.740> a

Blender<00:05:22.560> I<00:05:22.770> do<00:05:22.979> set<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.580> foundation

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
Blender I do set the foundation

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.760 
Blender I do set the foundation
especially<00:05:24.389> now<00:05:24.840> it<00:05:25.020> just<00:05:25.050> is<00:05:25.350> because<00:05:25.590> it's

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
especially now it just is because it's

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.250 
especially now it just is because it's
just<00:05:25.919> too<00:05:26.100> hot<00:05:26.310> so<00:05:26.940> I<00:05:26.970> definitely<00:05:27.419> said<00:05:27.900> it<00:05:27.930> but

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
just too hot so I definitely said it but

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.140 
just too hot so I definitely said it but
I<00:05:28.289> mean<00:05:28.530> if<00:05:28.710> it<00:05:28.890> wasn't<00:05:29.250> as<00:05:29.370> hot<00:05:29.669> I<00:05:29.850> probably

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
I mean if it wasn't as hot I probably

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.659 
I mean if it wasn't as hot I probably
wouldn't<00:05:30.570> need<00:05:30.720> to<00:05:30.990> just<00:05:31.620> like<00:05:31.830> where<00:05:32.370> I<00:05:32.400> would

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
wouldn't need to just like where I would

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.420 
wouldn't need to just like where I would
apply<00:05:33.000> concealer<00:05:33.360> I<00:05:33.510> would<00:05:33.750> set<00:05:33.960> but<00:05:34.650> I<00:05:34.979> find

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
apply concealer I would set but I find

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.070 
apply concealer I would set but I find
that<00:05:35.490> this<00:05:35.700> foundation<00:05:35.850> lasts<00:05:36.660> for<00:05:36.840> a<00:05:36.870> good

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
that this foundation lasts for a good

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.690 
that this foundation lasts for a good
eight<00:05:37.260> hours<00:05:37.320> because<00:05:37.950> I<00:05:38.039> applied<00:05:38.370> this

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
eight hours because I applied this

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.060 
eight hours because I applied this
literally<00:05:39.630> like<00:05:39.960> around<00:05:40.140> 7<00:05:40.590> o'clock<00:05:40.650> in<00:05:40.919> the

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
literally like around 7 o'clock in the

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.800 
literally like around 7 o'clock in the
morning<00:05:41.490> and<00:05:41.729> it<00:05:41.970> won't<00:05:42.120> take<00:05:42.240> it<00:05:42.300> off<00:05:42.450> till<00:05:42.750> I

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
morning and it won't take it off till I

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.390 
morning and it won't take it off till I
get<00:05:42.960> home<00:05:43.080> from<00:05:43.140> work<00:05:43.320> which<00:05:43.710> is<00:05:43.830> around<00:05:44.010> 5:00

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
get home from work which is around 5:00

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.409 
get home from work which is around 5:00
and<00:05:44.850> it<00:05:45.539> still<00:05:45.810> looks<00:05:45.840> immaculate<00:05:46.500> so<00:05:47.070> I<00:05:47.419> love

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
and it still looks immaculate so I love

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.680 
and it still looks immaculate so I love
love<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:49.440> wear<00:05:49.560> of<00:05:49.680> this<00:05:49.800> foundation<00:05:50.010> I<00:05:50.690> think

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
love the wear of this foundation I think

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.330 
love the wear of this foundation I think
it<00:05:51.810> makes<00:05:51.930> my<00:05:52.140> skin<00:05:52.200> look<00:05:52.410> really<00:05:52.889> really<00:05:53.130> nice

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
it makes my skin look really really nice

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.469 
it makes my skin look really really nice
and<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:55.740> coverage<00:05:56.070> is<00:05:56.160> awesome<00:05:56.639> so<00:05:56.850> I<00:05:56.880> would

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
and the coverage is awesome so I would

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.159 
and the coverage is awesome so I would
definitely<00:05:57.990> suggest<00:05:58.710> it<00:05:59.400> for<00:05:59.750> drier<00:06:00.750> skin

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
definitely suggest it for drier skin

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.340 
definitely suggest it for drier skin
tone<00:06:01.440> those<00:06:01.979> tired<00:06:02.220> skin<00:06:02.460> types<00:06:02.820> and<00:06:03.350> oilier

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
tone those tired skin types and oilier

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.560 
tone those tired skin types and oilier
skin<00:06:04.440> types<00:06:05.039> I<00:06:05.160> think<00:06:05.190> that<00:06:05.610> both<00:06:05.850> skin<00:06:06.360> types

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
skin types I think that both skin types

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.000 
skin types I think that both skin types
can<00:06:06.750> definitely<00:06:07.110> get<00:06:07.200> away<00:06:07.440> with<00:06:07.620> it

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
can definitely get away with it

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.159 
can definitely get away with it
I<00:06:08.039> always<00:06:08.760> use<00:06:09.120> a<00:06:09.150> primer<00:06:09.539> with<00:06:09.780> it<00:06:09.960> and<00:06:10.110> you

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
I always use a primer with it and you

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.200 
I always use a primer with it and you
guys<00:06:10.320> know<00:06:10.800> I<00:06:10.830> don't<00:06:10.979> like<00:06:11.340> primers<00:06:11.789> but<00:06:12.000> I've

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
guys know I don't like primers but I've

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.240 
guys know I don't like primers but I've
been<00:06:12.360> using<00:06:12.570> the<00:06:12.870> hourglass<00:06:13.410> primer<00:06:13.830> with<00:06:14.070> it

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
been using the hourglass primer with it

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.370 
been using the hourglass primer with it
and<00:06:14.460> it<00:06:15.120> just<00:06:15.300> makes<00:06:15.570> your<00:06:15.780> skin<00:06:15.840> look<00:06:16.260> a

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
and it just makes your skin look a

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.690 
and it just makes your skin look a
little<00:06:16.680> bit<00:06:16.800> better<00:06:16.950> because<00:06:17.160> it<00:06:17.460> is<00:06:17.669> a

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
little bit better because it is a

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.570 
little bit better because it is a
foundation<00:06:18.360> that<00:06:18.389> will<00:06:18.870> sink<00:06:19.650> into<00:06:19.919> the<00:06:20.310> lines

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
foundation that will sink into the lines

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.580 
foundation that will sink into the lines
to<00:06:21.180> the<00:06:21.210> pores<00:06:21.750> so<00:06:21.979> definitely<00:06:22.979> you

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
to the pores so definitely you

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.770 
to the pores so definitely you
a<00:06:24.180> primer<00:06:25.180> but<00:06:25.900> other<00:06:26.410> than<00:06:26.680> that<00:06:26.920> I<00:06:27.540> love<00:06:28.540> this

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
a primer but other than that I love this

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.150 
a primer but other than that I love this
I<00:06:28.990> think<00:06:29.320> it's<00:06:29.440> a<00:06:29.500> really<00:06:29.740> great<00:06:29.920> foundation

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 
I think it's a really great foundation

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.730 
I think it's a really great foundation
if<00:06:30.820> you<00:06:31.300> can<00:06:31.450> find<00:06:31.600> your<00:06:31.750> color<00:06:31.990> there's<00:06:32.290> 16
