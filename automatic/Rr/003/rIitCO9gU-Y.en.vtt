hello my name is not Smokey the Bear but
I<00:00:03.270> will<00:00:03.750> be<00:00:03.929> reviewing<00:00:04.670> duvall<00:00:05.670> kilowatts<00:00:06.359> it

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
I will be reviewing duvall kilowatts it

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.160 
I will be reviewing duvall kilowatts it
is<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.379> 70<00:00:08.189> millimeter<00:00:08.580> wheel<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.170> the

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
is a 70 millimeter wheel and the

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.709 
is a 70 millimeter wheel and the
durometer<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.830> 80<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.580> this<00:00:12.330> wheel<00:00:12.540> was

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
durometer is 80 a this wheel was

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.020 
durometer is 80 a this wheel was
designed<00:00:12.990> for<00:00:13.110> free<00:00:13.320> ride<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:13.620> mind<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.880> is

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
designed for free ride in mind and it is

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.910 
designed for free ride in mind and it is
good<00:00:15.240> for<00:00:15.480> just<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:15.929> if<00:00:16.410> you're<00:00:16.560> looking<00:00:16.830> to

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
good for just that if you're looking to

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.310 
good for just that if you're looking to
do<00:00:17.010> fast<00:00:17.369> free<00:00:17.699> ride<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.630> great<00:00:19.050> wheel

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
do fast free ride this is a great wheel

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.920 
do fast free ride this is a great wheel
for<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.830> basically<00:00:20.730> when<00:00:21.180> you're<00:00:21.300> going<00:00:21.570> fast

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
for you basically when you're going fast

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.509 
for you basically when you're going fast
and<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.650> kick<00:00:22.859> out<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.039> big<00:00:23.550> standee<00:00:24.150> like<00:00:24.539> this

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
and you kick out a big standee like this

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.250 
and you kick out a big standee like this
the<00:00:26.519> slide<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.939> really<00:00:27.300> buttery<00:00:27.570> but<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
the slide is really buttery but the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.050 
the slide is really buttery but the
second<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.619> start<00:00:28.740> slowing<00:00:29.220> down<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.849> trying

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
second you start slowing down and trying

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.910 
second you start slowing down and trying
slower<00:00:30.390> for<00:00:30.720> your<00:00:30.840> ride<00:00:30.990> like<00:00:31.289> no<00:00:31.500> complies

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
slower for your ride like no complies

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.740 
slower for your ride like no complies
the<00:00:32.640> wheel<00:00:32.790> starts<00:00:33.090> getting<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.420> bit<00:00:33.570> more

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
the wheel starts getting a bit more

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.590 
the wheel starts getting a bit more
grippy<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.410> not<00:00:34.950> nearly<00:00:35.280> as<00:00:35.460> buttery<00:00:35.940> as<00:00:36.270> it

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
grippy and not nearly as buttery as it

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.500 
grippy and not nearly as buttery as it
is<00:00:36.750> at<00:00:37.079> high<00:00:37.320> speed<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:38.250> being<00:00:38.489> said<00:00:38.730> when

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
is at high speed that being said when

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.450 
is at high speed that being said when
you're<00:00:39.629> going<00:00:39.960> fast<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:41.160> wheel<00:00:41.430> is

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
you're going fast this wheel is

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.139 
you're going fast this wheel is
absolutely<00:00:42.300> perfect<00:00:42.690> for<00:00:43.260> spins<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.820> this

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
absolutely perfect for spins like this

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.639 
absolutely perfect for spins like this
because<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.420> slides<00:00:48.840> across<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.440> surface

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
because it slides across the surface

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.250 
because it slides across the surface
very<00:00:50.190> nicely<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.000> smoothly<00:00:51.390> that's<00:00:52.050> also

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
very nicely and smoothly that's also

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.069 
very nicely and smoothly that's also
really<00:00:52.680> easy<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.280> hold<00:00:53.489> out<00:00:53.640> back<00:00:53.879> sides<00:00:54.180> like

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
really easy to hold out back sides like

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.240 
really easy to hold out back sides like
this<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:57.899> really<00:00:58.379> fun<00:00:58.530> thing<00:00:58.680> about<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.010> as

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
this the really fun thing about this as

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.340 
this the really fun thing about this as
well<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.789> leaves<00:01:00.180> quite<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.840> lot<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.170> Fame

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
well is it leaves quite a lot of Fame

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.070 
well is it leaves quite a lot of Fame
and<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.680> fame<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.730> purple<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.539> roll<00:01:03.719> speed<00:01:03.930> of

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
and the fame is purple the roll speed of

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.710 
and the fame is purple the roll speed of
this<00:01:04.140> wheel<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.619> pretty<00:01:05.400> fantastic<00:01:05.640> do<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
this wheel is pretty fantastic do the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.200 
this wheel is pretty fantastic do the
fact<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.260> has<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.770> pretty<00:01:08.520> thick<00:01:08.850> core

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
fact that it has a pretty thick core

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.740 
fact that it has a pretty thick core
which<00:01:09.600> makes<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.020> more<00:01:10.320> resilient<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.750> both

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
which makes it more resilient to both

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.350 
which makes it more resilient to both
laying<00:01:13.020> flat<00:01:13.140> spotting<00:01:13.860> than<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.700> would<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:14.970> if

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
laying flat spotting than it would be if

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.840 
laying flat spotting than it would be if
it<00:01:15.630> had<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> smaller<00:01:16.380> core<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:16.979> unfortunately

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
it had a smaller core but unfortunately

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.320 
it had a smaller core but unfortunately
it<00:01:18.810> still<00:01:19.170> ovals<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.130> flat<00:01:20.549> spots<00:01:20.850> pretty

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
it still ovals and flat spots pretty

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.539 
it still ovals and flat spots pretty
dang<00:01:21.659> easily<00:01:22.200> even<00:01:22.770> when<00:01:22.979> you're<00:01:23.100> doing<00:01:23.310> less

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
dang easily even when you're doing less

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.090 
dang easily even when you're doing less
than<00:01:23.729> 90<00:01:24.000> degree<00:01:24.270> slides<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.990> not<00:01:25.650> doing<00:01:25.860> any

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
than 90 degree slides and not doing any

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.910 
than 90 degree slides and not doing any
180s<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.970> still<00:01:27.600> has<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> tendency<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.350> oval<00:01:28.710> I'm

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
180s it still has a tendency to oval I'm

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.450 
180s it still has a tendency to oval I'm
not<00:01:29.310> sure<00:01:29.369> why<00:01:29.790> but<00:01:30.270> that's<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:30.930> how<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.259> is

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
not sure why but that's just how it is

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.850 
not sure why but that's just how it is
so<00:01:32.460> they<00:01:33.000> aren't<00:01:33.210> terribly<00:01:33.750> durable<00:01:34.229> again

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
so they aren't terribly durable again

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.410 
so they aren't terribly durable again
because<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.430> wheel<00:01:35.640> was<00:01:35.850> made<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.240> free

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
because this wheel was made for free

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.450 
because this wheel was made for free
ride<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.110> not<00:01:37.439> very<00:01:37.470> great<00:01:38.070> for<00:01:38.250> downhill

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
ride it is not very great for downhill

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.359 
ride it is not very great for downhill
Raylan<00:01:39.060> corners<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.720> near<00:01:40.049> impossible

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
Raylan corners is near impossible

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.819 
Raylan corners is near impossible
overall<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.640> wheel<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.409> fantastic<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.439> fast

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
overall this wheel is fantastic for fast

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.679 
overall this wheel is fantastic for fast
free<00:01:44.070> ride<00:01:44.280> but<00:01:44.970> when<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.299> start<00:01:45.540> getting

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
free ride but when you start getting

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.630 
free ride but when you start getting
into<00:01:45.899> slower<00:01:46.290> stuff<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.950> starts<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.490> get<00:01:47.579> a

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
into slower stuff it starts to get a

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.980 
into slower stuff it starts to get a
little<00:01:47.700> more<00:01:47.909> grippy<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.540> less<00:01:48.689> enjoyable

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
little more grippy and less enjoyable

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.469 
little more grippy and less enjoyable
but<00:01:49.649> slow<00:01:50.130> free<00:01:50.340> ride<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.670> still<00:01:50.909> doable<00:01:51.210> on

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
but slow free ride is still doable on

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.960 
but slow free ride is still doable on
these<00:01:51.689> don't<00:01:52.470> get<00:01:52.619> me<00:01:52.740> wrong<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:53.369> just<00:01:53.520> a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
these don't get me wrong it's just a

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.690 
these don't get me wrong it's just a
little<00:01:54.780> less<00:01:55.049> buttery<00:01:55.409> than<00:01:55.890> fast<00:01:56.159> rewriting

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
little less buttery than fast rewriting

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.819 
little less buttery than fast rewriting
the<00:01:57.119> roll<00:01:57.479> speed<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.810> great<00:01:58.079> due<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> big
