00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.700
 on rainy days like this one in which 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.550
 Sometimes he says he is a peasant 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.000
 or be a worker 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:18.140
 then one says I would like to resign 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.529
 but where I'm going to do what 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.220
 better then I resolve to stay all the 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.220
 time here 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.970
 and hide behind my sorrows after 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.970
 early mornings behind work 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:39.130
 but the big inspirations have 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.370
 born there in the groove on the road 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.370
 about the mare 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.550
 so the earth is like the reason for 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.550
 be 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.060
 then what did it play to get a 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.630
 woman who likes theater to get 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.630
 in the city 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.490
 make it reach the mountain and have 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.490
 two daughters who likes art 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.380
 our home is constituted as the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.380
 fundamental basis of work 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.720
 never believed that a peasant with a hundred 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.340
 of primary school could write works that 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.429
 like in other countries 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.429
 ah 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.820
 when I hear the applause I know that 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.820
 it is female 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.940
 when I hear laughter I know that there 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.940
 planted 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.000
 but I am a peasant teatrero I am a 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.000
 farmer teatrero 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.470
 artist and if an artist for life and 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.110
 for the life that use benefit 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.990
 freedom I did not go to war I did not 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.730
 I went to the army and every time I 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.840
 escape not merit and no group 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.840
 that's why I'm here 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.890
 after 50 years telling you the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.890
 history
