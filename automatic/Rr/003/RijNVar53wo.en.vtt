00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.890
 Rice paper 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.400
 The next uses the thickest line possible due to failure 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.469
 Yeah it might not be 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.059
 At least thinking 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.539
 In fact, it is the setting that was attached to the cover start itself 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.650
 The full line is better than non-broadcast 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.560
 There is 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.699
 It is good to contact the hippo first when clearing the village 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:25.539
 is not it 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.820
 The distance from the contact point to today is shorter and shorter 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.859
 Have more repulsive force on the line by becoming 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.420
 Cigarette Rankin contributes less to the line's resilience 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.030
 Or 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.450
 That's very important 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.100
 However f has gained relatively little growth in nine prefectures, such as repulsive force 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.670
 I'm going to do professional bowling 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.160
 In the case of repetitively jumping sideways 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.180
 I'll attach a rope to my neck 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.160
 If the rope is not as hard as a wire 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.380
 It was a thing but I think it is very painful 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.960
 Like a rubber band 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.840
 I think that it will reach the red and white because it is altar stretching 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.030
 Yeah 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.560
 In other words, with a thick line to get rid of the hippo 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.690
 Soaring fiberglass with repulsive absorption characteristics 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.470
 By 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.360
 I am well balanced 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.520
 In fact, it marks the fact that it is up to Rs. 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.570
 How long do you go to MES protocol balance 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.340
 It also changes 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.910
 9 of low vibration to high rebound dot 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.500
 Such setting-ruling party 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.850
 It is shaped to be pulled by Muraoka Gong 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.060
 As for the way, the original performance can not be fully extracted 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.830
 is not it 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.860
 It has been a long time ago that flexible and more flexible 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.970
 Because it is very good to grasp basic needs 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.990
 I will pour water firmly and say exactly 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.950
 Even if it is a song that you want to keep some depth 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.920
 I'm listening hard 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.640
 I can do a balance grant machine that I've been in contact afterward 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.730
 Not 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.150
 There is a thing that lower class Kunio is cut off 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.040
 If the tackle balance is good, the rhythm is good 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.160
 I'm getting tired 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.130
 To do 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.820
 Recover the number of banners 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.570
 Like decalon licking 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.570
 You can then play 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.700
 The degree above the super class 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.789
 Hmmm I guess it's about the place 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.799
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.999
 The story when compared with the other pv series to the last 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:20.700
 is 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.599
 I'll kill you 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.629
 If you need it, let's go for a glass 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.629
 There was an unprecedented incident in the past of Sojiro 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.159
 Foreign Ministers also benefit from old people living outside 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.159
 There is gs.n 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:41.129
 I'm worried because I won't be upset 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.379
 Masaru Takeda 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.399
 I knew 

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:47.699
 Edited as a seven-year-old snake 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:53.679
 There was a dirt 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.629
 56 years old 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:03.319
 56.5 Great public-half-people and over-allot impression preference 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.369
 There is a point where recovery of vibration is difficult 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:08.390
 Clarify everything 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.409
 Gold and the country's friendship Chang and regulations 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.790
 I think that I just touched the true 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.169
 It 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.169
 Anyway, I sound an alarm the moment I feel resistance 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.759
 It is also a feature of having a face 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:25.209
 The sensitivity of the twin lot boosts all of that 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.399
 Only the information needed for the middle 27 years of the treble to the sound effects of 

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:30.669
 Tell 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.089
 It is such a feeling 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:35.579
 It turns out that it is the first half of what it had last month 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:36.999
 Will be 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:40.349
 It depends on the film this time and it is approaching the age 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:42.219
 1 cm more 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:44.229
 One word measurement 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.529
 Let's get over the Eiffel Tower 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:48.809
 Well I live twice 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:52.259
 I saw in the blank when and how many things that I 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:53.859
 Decision 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:54.969
 1. 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.569
 And pasmo seems to be done 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.009
 Don't go through me a combination 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:03.649
 I'm sucked but it's amazing 

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:09.920
 6. I need kowxcode for the gp series though 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.219
 The glass is also flexible 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:15.999
 Material right forensics assisted by carbon bonnet muscle 

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:17.799
 It becomes 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.659
 Then I did not cut it all right 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:24.779
 If you make a graph alone, it's just cool memory foam pillows 

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:25.439
 That's 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:26.550
 So-called 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.319
 Easy to be 4.7 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:33.310
 There are a lot of things I feel as a blade, I belong to capital and others 

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:36.270
 If you do, it's also the case that you have sold a thick watch 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.219
 Those 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:39.469
 If so, the configuration is still going on 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:43.080
 When heavy load is applied, the cross section becomes large 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.569
 More load was applied 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.409
 Let's let violence concentrate 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:51.199
 There is also the possibility of collecting and judging from there 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:52.150
 There is 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.389
 for example 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.270
 The purpose is to increase the number of turns 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.080
 There is a frank loss integrated effect of the company with less resistance 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.610
 It was supposed to 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.379
 The face of this time scorer coach 45 is also a two-way configuration by that craftsman 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:06.729
 It has become 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.129
 I can remove the meat on my desk with my body 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.339
 Crankshaft from apologize as a result 

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:16.430
 You can not specify to wait outside the industry 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.129
 listener 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:20.499
 I went to Turkey very much in a mountain stream 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:23.499
 There is also a bat 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.979
 Without a course 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.689
 However
