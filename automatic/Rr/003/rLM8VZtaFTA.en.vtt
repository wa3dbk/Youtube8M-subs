ombre to make it blonder and then a few

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.930 
ombre to make it blonder and then a few
months<00:00:30.869> later<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.470> was<00:00:31.710> like<00:00:31.920> I'm<00:00:32.189> just<00:00:32.550> over

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
months later I was like I'm just over

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.660 
months later I was like I'm just over
the<00:00:32.969> ombre<00:00:33.390> try<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.079> die<00:00:34.290> over<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.070> that

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
the ombre try to die over it and that

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.950 
the ombre try to die over it and that
worked<00:00:36.030> for<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.270> little<00:00:36.420> bit<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.780> actually

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
worked for a little bit and I actually

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.619 
worked for a little bit and I actually
liked<00:00:37.380> when<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.829> faded<00:00:38.219> because<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:39.270> ends<00:00:39.540> of

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
liked when it faded because the ends of

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.119 
liked when it faded because the ends of
my<00:00:39.660> hair<00:00:39.750> were<00:00:40.020> kind<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.350> purplish<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.100> I

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
my hair were kind of purplish so I

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.240 
my hair were kind of purplish so I
really<00:00:41.460> did<00:00:41.610> like<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:43.070> it<00:00:44.070> was

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
really did like that and it was

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.680 
really did like that and it was
different<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.850> I've<00:00:45.120> never<00:00:45.360> done<00:00:45.539> that

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
different and I've never done that

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.069 
different and I've never done that
before<00:00:45.840> but<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.829> made<00:00:47.070> my<00:00:47.309> ends<00:00:47.789> not<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.750> blonde

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079
