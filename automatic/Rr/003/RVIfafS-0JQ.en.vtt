00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
the first time I tried to glue that I

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
didn't want to go all around and have to

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.070 
didn't want to go all around and have to
rescue<00:04:17.590> all<00:04:17.890> that<00:04:18.160> and<00:04:18.400> also<00:04:19.269> I<00:04:19.420> haven't<00:04:19.900> and<00:04:20.170> I

rescue all that and also I haven't and I

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.560 
rescue all that and also I haven't and I
didn't<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:23.820> do<00:04:24.820> my<00:04:24.970> hair<00:04:25.210> probably

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
didn't and do my hair probably

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.730 
didn't and do my hair probably
underneath<00:04:26.050> and<00:04:26.970> so<00:04:27.970> I've<00:04:28.150> got<00:04:28.330> it<00:04:28.420> in<00:04:28.570> a<00:04:28.900> bun

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
underneath and so I've got it in a bun

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.700 
underneath and so I've got it in a bun
underneath<00:04:30.730> so<00:04:31.030> it's<00:04:31.150> a<00:04:31.180> bit<00:04:31.210> it's<00:04:32.170> not<00:04:32.320> pouchy

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
underneath so it's a bit it's not pouchy

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.950 
underneath so it's a bit it's not pouchy
but<00:04:33.130> it's<00:04:33.220> quite<00:04:33.400> flat<00:04:33.640> you<00:04:34.060> know<00:04:34.420> from<00:04:34.870> the

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
but it's quite flat you know from the

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.380 
but it's quite flat you know from the
bar<00:04:36.180> probably<00:04:37.180> bit<00:04:37.300> physics<00:04:37.810> I've<00:04:38.020> had<00:04:38.260> it<00:04:38.410> I

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
bar probably bit physics I've had it I

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.200 
bar probably bit physics I've had it I
don't<00:04:40.390> they<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:41.110> yeah<00:04:41.770> it's<00:04:42.040> quite<00:04:42.250> nice
