00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.300
 ah 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.210
 good guys today I'm going to bring you a 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.980
 makeup that a few weeks ago did 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.050
 specific makeup for brown eyes 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.519
 I asked what kind of makeup and many 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.380
 of you said to me for eyes 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.939
 blue so you get simpler plants 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.509
 with blue eyes is that if you want to see 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.509
 How we do 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.070
 as always we are going to start the 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.780
 makeup preparing the eyelids with 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.030
 a prebase then we will find them a 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.680
 matte beige shade and then we'll start to 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.300
 create a bit of definition in the 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.300
 banana with a brown shadow clarita 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.309
 let's start to create more intensity 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.770
 I will apply especially concentrating 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.960
 in the outer part of the eye a way in 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:58.460
 triangle to lengthen the eye and give it 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.620
 depth in this case I'm using 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.420
 a darker brown shadow too 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.250
 mate and I'm going to apply a little to 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.670
 little and blurring it to control the 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.670
 product 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.409
 as a point of light we are going to use a 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.210
 iridescent shadow in the inner zone of 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.670
 animal and remember that for these 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.840
 more intense makeup is important 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.840
 blur and in color 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.400
 in this case I'm going to use a shadow 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.290
 integration between the color of 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.740
 luminosity and security and also goes 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.740
 to be mate 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.680
 is worth the eyeliner this you already know is 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.750
 a very particular case and we can 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.550
 adapt it to our style me in this 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.300
 I'm going to do it quite long but 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.300
 very finite 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.300
 and apply the brown shadow or even 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.920
 we apply black shadow lightly on the 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.750
 external triangle to integrate let's 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.450
 there now we go for the real color that 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.280
 will intensify and contrast our 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.220
 blue color of eyes in this case I'm going to 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.620
 use a coral reddish color but you could 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.180
 use colors pink lands should 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.740
 apply it on the lower lash and 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.310
 then I will integrate it with a shadow 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.310
 matte brown 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.250
 we go to our intensity points 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.140
 that we apply mask and we make our 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.210
 eyebrows and then I'm going to define a little the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.750
 eyebrow arch applying a bit of 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.750
 illuminator 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.659
 before going to the face make sure 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.340
 that you do not have product fall so 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.439
 clean it well and then we will apply a 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.060
 try and we will start using our 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.590
 corrector as always to correct and 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.590
 to polish eye makeup 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.400
 this time I have decided to use a 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.319
 sponge because it gives a much more effect 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.830
 juicy and I think it's perfect for the 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.830
 summer 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.990
 after lightly sealing the face 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.850
 with some illuminating pearls I'm not going to 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:03.520
 use blusher but I 'm going directly 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:05.410
 to outline let's go to the lips first 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.270
 let's outline and fill in lips 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.430
 with a pencil then we will take your lip 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.320
 raspberry rose and let's outline the 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.150
 outer area of the lips and blurring 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.830
 towards the center leaving the most 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.900
 internal of the lips free of product 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.490
 then we will outline with a concealer 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.400
 the outer zone to make it more 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.140
 fluid and as a final touch we will apply a 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.970
 pink lipstick in the central area 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.360
 blurring it to create an effect of 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.360
 volume 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.620
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.480
 the next of this series will be for eyes 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.370
 green and that you already know in lines 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.920
 general with leg colors and 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.840
 reddish pink colors are perfect 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.940
 for this blue eye color so if 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.140
 you want makeup do not forget 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.140
 they shared some of my networks 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.819
 socially and be very very happy once 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.900
 more thanks for watching me and we'll see the 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.260
 next 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.260
 bye
