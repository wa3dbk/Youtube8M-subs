00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
can see how fast it really does go

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.479 
can see how fast it really does go
excuse<00:02:41.319> me<00:02:41.440> therefore<00:02:41.650> moving<00:02:42.040> into<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.310> car

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489

but look at the celebration the

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.509 
but look at the celebration the
acceleration<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.260> insane<00:02:44.680> for<00:02:45.129> this<00:02:45.190> being<00:02:45.489> a

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
acceleration is insane for this being a

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.100 
acceleration is insane for this being a
sports<00:02:45.790> car<00:02:46.030> it's<00:02:46.180> pretty<00:02:46.390> fast<00:02:46.569> i<00:02:46.780> will<00:02:46.930> say

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
sports car it's pretty fast i will say

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.410 
sports car it's pretty fast i will say
the<00:02:47.230> handling<00:02:47.680> isn't<00:02:47.829> that<00:02:48.160> great<00:02:48.549> the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
the handling isn't that great the

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.150 
the handling isn't that great the
quartet<00:02:49.959> is<00:02:50.140> definitely<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.650> lot<00:02:50.769> better<00:02:50.950> at

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
quartet is definitely a lot better at
