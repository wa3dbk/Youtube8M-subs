set<00:00:02.490> them<00:00:02.610> kind<00:00:02.939> of<00:00:02.970> perpendicular<00:00:03.389> setting

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
set them kind of perpendicular setting

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.410 
set them kind of perpendicular setting
the<00:00:04.380> guide<00:00:04.589> yeah<00:00:05.250> perpendicular<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:06.060> where

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
the guide yeah perpendicular to where

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.390 
the guide yeah perpendicular to where
you<00:00:06.569> end<00:00:06.750> up<00:00:06.870> wanting<00:00:07.140> it<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.560> push<00:00:08.040> it<00:00:08.069> home

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
you end up wanting it and push it home

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.660 
you end up wanting it and push it home
and<00:00:08.760> then<00:00:09.719> twist<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.380> yeah<00:00:10.830> go<00:00:11.099> half<00:00:11.280> into

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
and then twist it yeah go half into

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.039 
and then twist it yeah go half into
place<00:00:12.410> push<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:14.089> twist<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.240> into<00:00:15.420> place<00:00:15.509> and

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
place push it in twist it into place and

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.890 
place push it in twist it into place and
then<00:00:16.199> we<00:00:16.710> will<00:00:16.890> still<00:00:17.190> end<00:00:17.400> up<00:00:17.550> putting<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.660> bead

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
then we will still end up putting a bead

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.769 
then we will still end up putting a bead
of<00:00:19.590> tape<00:00:20.930> around<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.320> ferals

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
of tape around the ferals

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.109 
of tape around the ferals
so<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.350> part<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.800> rod<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.970> will

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
so that is the part of the rod that will

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.420 
so that is the part of the rod that will
take<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.630> most<00:00:27.840> torquing<00:00:29.060> during<00:00:30.060> casting

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
take the most torquing during casting

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.680 
take the most torquing during casting
tape<00:00:32.430> will<00:00:32.759> not<00:00:34.280> keep<00:00:35.280> them<00:00:35.550> from<00:00:35.880> coming

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
tape will not keep them from coming

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.780 
tape will not keep them from coming
loose<00:00:37.100> but<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.190> will<00:00:38.309> keep<00:00:38.579> them<00:00:38.760> from

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
loose but it will keep them from

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.670 
loose but it will keep them from
separating<00:00:39.649> just<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:41.660> good<00:00:42.660> solid<00:00:42.899> turn<00:00:43.379> down

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
separating just a good solid turn down

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.569 
separating just a good solid turn down
the<00:00:43.860> mail<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:45.950> will<00:00:46.950> keep<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.460> from

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the mail and will keep it from

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.299 
the mail and will keep it from
separating<00:00:48.140> so<00:00:49.140> they<00:00:49.260> don't<00:00:49.829> want<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.010> coming

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
separating so they don't want to coming

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.760 
separating so they don't want to coming
apart<00:00:50.670> they'll<00:00:50.910> still<00:00:51.120> loosen<00:00:51.510> up<00:00:51.690> but<00:00:52.620> they

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
apart they'll still loosen up but they

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.229 
apart they'll still loosen up but they
won't<00:00:52.949> separate<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> point<00:00:53.969> where<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
won't separate to the point where the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.160 
won't separate to the point where the
female<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.960> male<00:00:55.140> don't<00:00:55.949> have<00:00:56.129> enough

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
female and male don't have enough

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.979 
female and male don't have enough
connection<00:00:58.170> where<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.460> then<00:00:59.870> either<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
connection where you get then either a

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.789 
connection where you get then either a
fish<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.770> or<00:01:02.039> just<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.570> cast<00:01:03.570> hood<00:01:04.430> snapped<00:01:06.799> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
fish on or just a cast hood snapped the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.010 
fish on or just a cast hood snapped the
rod<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.310> it'll<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:08.880> right<00:01:09.060> at<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> ferrule

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020

difference<00:01:30.030> from<00:01:30.960> rod<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.560> rod<00:01:32.540> what<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.570> can

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
difference from rod to rod what I can

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.749 
difference from rod to rod what I can
almost<00:01:34.409> guarantee<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.930> that<00:01:36.930> your<00:01:37.439> skill<00:01:37.979> will

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.650 
casting stuff as well but in order for a
rod<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:31.060> move<00:02:31.420> line<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:33.280> rod<00:02:33.519> needs<00:02:33.849> to<00:02:34.209> store

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
rod to move line the rod needs to store

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.160 
rod to move line the rod needs to store
energy<00:02:35.099> and<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:37.209> needs<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.599> release<00:02:37.930> that

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
energy and it needs to release that

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.360 
energy and it needs to release that
energy<00:02:39.660> that's<00:02:40.660> it

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
energy that's it

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.920 
energy that's it
which<00:02:42.370> ever<00:02:42.670> hand<00:02:43.269> is<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:45.489> top<00:02:45.730> hand<00:02:46.090> on<00:02:46.360> the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
which ever hand is the top hand on the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.880 
which ever hand is the top hand on the
rod<00:02:47.400> really<00:02:48.400> it's<00:02:48.670> job<00:02:49.120> is<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.930> stabilize<00:02:50.260> the

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
rod really it's job is to stabilize the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.550 
rod really it's job is to stabilize the
rod<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.840> not<00:02:53.109> move<00:02:55.049> it<00:02:56.049> can<00:02:56.200> all<00:02:56.530> be

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
rod and to not move it can all be

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.650 
rod and to not move it can all be
operated<00:02:58.349> with<00:02:59.349> the<00:02:59.500> lower<00:02:59.709> hand<00:03:00.480> if<00:03:01.480> you

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
operated with the lower hand if you

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.199 
operated with the lower hand if you
think<00:03:01.989> back<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.709> rod<00:03:02.890> storing<00:03:03.579> energy<00:03:03.760> and

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
think back to the rod storing energy and

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.229 
think back to the rod storing energy and
releasing<00:03:04.840> energy<00:03:05.019> I<00:03:05.530> think<00:03:06.459> you'd<00:03:06.579> all<00:03:06.700> agree

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
releasing energy I think you'd all agree

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.630 
releasing energy I think you'd all agree
that<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.980> is<00:03:09.400> much<00:03:10.359> more<00:03:10.690> efficient<00:03:11.410> and

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
that this is much more efficient and

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.030 
that this is much more efficient and
more<00:03:12.640> direct<00:03:13.739> then<00:03:14.739> is<00:03:16.049> this<00:03:17.049> where<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:17.739> start

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
more direct then is this where you start

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.190 
more direct then is this where you start
getting<00:03:18.099> a<00:03:18.430> push<00:03:18.730> thing<00:03:19.569> going

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
getting a push thing going

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.240 
getting a push thing going
most<00:03:20.950> everybody<00:03:21.639> most<00:03:22.510> everybody<00:03:23.349> as<00:03:23.650> much<00:03:23.709> as

most everybody most everybody as much as

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.159 
most everybody most everybody as much as
I<00:03:24.370> say<00:03:24.639> don't<00:03:24.940> move<00:03:25.180> your<00:03:25.389> upper<00:03:25.690> arm<00:03:25.870> at<00:03:26.049> all

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
I say don't move your upper arm at all

I'm gonna go into all of this when I

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.159 
I'm gonna go into all of this when I
start<00:04:49.520> casting<00:04:49.760> giving<00:04:50.240> some<00:04:50.390> demonstration

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
start casting giving some demonstration

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.340 
start casting giving some demonstration
here<00:04:51.470> but<00:04:51.980> if<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.610> rod<00:04:52.850> is<00:04:52.880> held<00:04:53.419> is<00:04:53.750> stopped

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
here but if the rod is held is stopped

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.540 
here but if the rod is held is stopped
high<00:04:55.270> when<00:04:56.270> that<00:04:56.510> D<00:04:56.810> shape<00:04:57.169> is<00:04:57.410> formed<00:04:57.710> you

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
high when that D shape is formed you

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.490 
high when that D shape is formed you
will<00:04:58.700> actually<00:04:58.910> feel<00:04:59.510> the<00:04:59.870> tip<00:05:00.110> of<00:05:00.260> the<00:05:00.320> rod

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
will actually feel the tip of the rod

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.880 
will actually feel the tip of the rod
load<00:05:01.510> just<00:05:02.510> like<00:05:02.660> with<00:05:02.840> a<00:05:02.870> single<00:05:03.290> handed<00:05:03.680> rod

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
load just like with a single handed rod

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.730 
load just like with a single handed rod
right<00:05:04.310> I'm<00:05:05.000> gonna<00:05:05.180> use<00:05:05.360> that<00:05:05.600> rod<00:05:05.930> Bob<00:05:06.530> I'm
