00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
be worked out and there are so many of

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.569 
be worked out and there are so many of
them<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:36.989> mean<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.530> me<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.129> number<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.460> us

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
them I mean to me it's to a number of us

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.650 
them I mean to me it's to a number of us
it's<00:00:38.760> still<00:00:38.940> daunting<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.540> they're

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
it's still daunting that they're

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
it's still daunting that they're
actually<00:00:39.899> gonna<00:00:39.989> be<00:00:40.110> able<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.379> get<00:00:40.500> all<00:00:40.649> of

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
actually gonna be able to get all of

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.740 
actually gonna be able to get all of
this<00:00:40.920> done<00:00:41.129> before<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.719> know

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
this done before that but you know

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.139 
this done before that but you know
certainly<00:00:43.200> Los<00:00:43.950> Angeles<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.700> part<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.059> it

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
certainly Los Angeles is part of it

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.299 
certainly Los Angeles is part of it
because<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.570> deals<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.050> revenue<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.920> deals

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
because it deals with revenue and deals

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.279 
because it deals with revenue and deals
with<00:00:47.399> future<00:00:47.760> revenue<00:00:48.120> because<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.079> move

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
with future revenue because if you move

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.049 
with future revenue because if you move
a<00:00:49.410> team<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.770> Los<00:00:49.890> Angeles<00:00:50.430> they're<00:00:50.820> going<00:00:50.969> to

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
a team to Los Angeles they're going to

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.819 
a team to Los Angeles they're going to
be<00:00:51.180> it's<00:00:51.390> going<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.600> be<00:00:51.690> more<00:00:51.960> valuable<00:00:52.170> than

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
be it's going to be more valuable than

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.040 
be it's going to be more valuable than
some<00:00:53.610> places<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.090> may<00:00:54.210> be<00:00:54.270> moving<00:00:54.510> from<00:00:54.870> if

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
some places that I may be moving from if

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.240 
some places that I may be moving from if
you<00:00:55.170> get<00:00:55.320> my<00:00:55.500> drift<00:00:55.530> here<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.730> think<00:00:57.030> that

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
you get my drift here so I think that

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.920 
you get my drift here so I think that
you<00:00:59.250> know<00:00:59.370> clearly<00:00:59.699> it<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.270> an<00:01:00.480> element<00:01:00.780> that

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
you know clearly it is an element that

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.349 
you know clearly it is an element that
has<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.320> be<00:01:01.350> dealt<00:01:01.559> with<00:01:01.710> by<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.520> owners<00:01:02.969> what

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
has to be dealt with by the owners what

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.350 
has to be dealt with by the owners what
about<00:01:03.449> two<00:01:03.690> teams<00:01:03.960> I've<00:01:04.140> heard<00:01:04.260> two<00:01:04.439> team<00:01:05.360> if

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
about two teams I've heard two team if

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.510 
about two teams I've heard two team if
you<00:01:06.540> build<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.930> they<00:01:06.990> will<00:01:07.140> come<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:08.010> mean

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
you build it they will come I mean

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.060 
you build it they will come I mean
that'sthat's<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.869> truly<00:01:10.229> at<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.590> point<00:01:10.860> don't

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
that'sthat's I truly at this point don't

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.250 
that'sthat's I truly at this point don't
think<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.430> anybody<00:01:11.939> really<00:01:12.360> knows<00:01:12.600> because

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
think that anybody really knows because

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.560 
think that anybody really knows because
I<00:01:13.439> don't<00:01:13.619> think<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.950> there's<00:01:14.189> any<00:01:14.570> expansion

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
I don't think that there's any expansion

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.090 
I don't think that there's any expansion
on<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.750> horizon<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.500> you're<00:01:16.650> really<00:01:16.890> talking

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
on the horizon so you're really talking

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.490 
on the horizon so you're really talking
about<00:01:17.310> relocation<00:01:18.030> sure<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.780> mean<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.020> think<00:01:19.049> 32

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
about relocation sure I mean I think 32

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.710 
about relocation sure I mean I think 32
teams<00:01:19.830> at<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.159> point<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.549> pretty<00:01:20.790> much<00:01:20.970> what

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
teams at this point is pretty much what

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.399 
teams at this point is pretty much what
what<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.290> max<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.869> you<00:01:24.869> know<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.229> always

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
what the max is but you know it's always

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.870 
what the max is but you know it's always
there's<00:01:25.680> always<00:01:25.770> been<00:01:26.040> taught<00:01:26.159> me<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.580> left

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.770 
there's always been taught me to left
going<00:01:27.509> too<00:01:27.869> bad<00:01:28.049> sure<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:29.479> you<00:01:30.479> obviously
