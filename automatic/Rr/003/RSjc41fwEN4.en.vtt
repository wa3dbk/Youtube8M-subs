depending on how you order you might
just<00:02:08.099> measure<00:02:08.520> your<00:02:08.789> ROPS<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.330> say<00:02:09.420> hey<00:02:09.660> by

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
just measure your ROPS and say hey by

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.990 
just measure your ROPS and say hey by
the<00:02:09.929> way<00:02:10.080> my<00:02:10.500> ROPS<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:11.039> this<00:02:11.250> diameter<00:02:11.580> so

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
the way my ROPS is this diameter so

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.250 
the way my ROPS is this diameter so
you'll<00:02:12.180> get<00:02:12.390> there<00:02:12.569> first

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
you'll get there first

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
right piece the first time you'll see

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.750 
right piece the first time you'll see
the<00:02:15.989> standard<00:02:16.290> like<00:02:16.470> PTO<00:02:16.860> style<00:02:17.220> pins<00:02:17.519> here

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
the standard like PTO style pins here

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.149 
the standard like PTO style pins here
well<00:02:18.629> talk<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.019> little<00:02:19.260> bit<00:02:19.379> about<00:02:19.409> those<00:02:19.920> about

come on forward you can see it goes

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.660 
come on forward you can see it goes
around<00:02:27.439> the<00:02:28.439> well<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:28.890> way<00:02:28.980> they<00:02:29.159> intend<00:02:29.549> it

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
around the well the way they intend it

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.979 
around the well the way they intend it
to<00:02:29.700> go<00:02:29.940> on<00:02:30.090> some<00:02:30.390> folks<00:02:30.569> have<00:02:30.750> put<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:30.959> on

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
to go on some folks have put it on

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.809 
to go on some folks have put it on
differently<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.620> goes<00:02:31.799> around<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.280> front<00:02:32.310> of

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
differently it goes around the front of

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.479 
differently it goes around the front of
the<00:02:33.480> grill<00:02:33.750> guard<00:02:33.989> which<00:02:34.709> means<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.099> have<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.400> be

the grill guard which means I have to be

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.240 
the grill guard which means I have to be
kind<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.730> gentle<00:02:35.940> ramming<00:02:36.659> trees<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.409> again

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
kind of gentle ramming trees and again

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.240 
kind of gentle ramming trees and again
it's<00:02:38.549> just<00:02:38.790> using<00:02:39.379> u-bolts<00:02:40.379> and<00:02:40.440> alike<00:02:40.739> you're

width is concerned

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.949 
width is concerned
oh<00:03:07.049> yeah<00:03:08.000> you<00:03:09.000> got<00:03:09.150> different<00:03:09.510> bolt<00:03:09.720> holes

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
oh yeah you got different bolt holes

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.000 
oh yeah you got different bolt holes
here<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.560> if<00:03:11.370> your<00:03:11.670> wraps<00:03:12.269> or<00:03:12.780> your<00:03:13.200> geometry

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
here so if your wraps or your geometry

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.030 
here so if your wraps or your geometry
on<00:03:14.220> your<00:03:15.000> utility<00:03:15.780> vehicle<00:03:16.409> is<00:03:16.590> different

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
on your utility vehicle is different

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.759 
on your utility vehicle is different
than<00:03:17.159> my<00:03:17.340> utility<00:03:17.819> vehicle<00:03:18.269> this<00:03:19.079> width<00:03:19.440> goes

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
than my utility vehicle this width goes

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.220 
than my utility vehicle this width goes
out<00:03:19.980> from<00:03:20.489> left<00:03:20.699> to<00:03:20.849> right<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.419> you<00:03:21.540> can<00:03:21.750> adjust

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
out from left to right so you can adjust

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.220 
out from left to right so you can adjust
it<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:23.190> arms<00:03:23.730> give<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.359> that<00:03:24.540> front<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.019> back

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
it the arms give you that front to back

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.619 
it the arms give you that front to back
adjustment<00:03:25.849> these<00:03:26.849> give<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.359> that

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
adjustment these give you that

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.020 
adjustment these give you that
left-to-right<00:03:28.440> adjustment<00:03:29.280> yep<00:03:29.459> same<00:03:29.760> thing

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
left-to-right adjustment yep same thing

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.670 
left-to-right adjustment yep same thing
on<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.239> back<00:03:30.389> bolt<00:03:30.690> I<00:03:30.900> don't<00:03:31.319> know<00:03:31.410> how<00:03:31.500> well

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
on the back bolt I don't know how well

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.670 
on the back bolt I don't know how well
you<00:03:31.739> can<00:03:31.829> see<00:03:31.889> that<00:03:32.099> what<00:03:32.489> we<00:03:32.579> try<00:03:33.049> anyway<00:03:34.049> so

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
you can see that what we try anyway so

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.460 
you can see that what we try anyway so
it<00:03:34.889> really<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:36.000> universal<00:03:36.900> solution

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
it really is a universal solution

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.369 
it really is a universal solution
it<00:03:37.709> works<00:03:37.889> sweetly<00:03:38.430> these<00:03:39.299> bolts<00:03:39.750> up<00:03:39.900> on<00:03:40.079> top

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
it works sweetly these bolts up on top

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.390 
it works sweetly these bolts up on top
are<00:03:41.090> staggered<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.750> got<00:03:42.900> another<00:03:43.049> hole<00:03:43.319> here

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
are staggered you got another hole here

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.460 
are staggered you got another hole here
that<00:03:44.400> gave<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:44.730> some<00:03:44.760> nice<00:03:45.120> fine<00:03:45.540> increments

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
that gave you some nice fine increments

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.890 
that gave you some nice fine increments
on<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:47.160> left<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.549> right<00:03:47.609> I<00:03:47.940> think<00:03:48.060> roughly<00:03:48.720> a

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
on the left and right I think roughly a

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.229 
on the left and right I think roughly a
half<00:03:49.109> inch<00:03:49.410> or<00:03:49.590> a<00:03:49.650> quarter<00:03:49.889> inch<00:03:50.250> because<00:03:50.970> of

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
half inch or a quarter inch because of

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.039 
half inch or a quarter inch because of
the<00:03:51.329> way<00:03:51.480> they<00:03:51.629> staggered<00:03:52.169> I'm<00:03:52.290> pretty<00:03:52.859> sweet

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
the way they staggered I'm pretty sweet

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.009 
the way they staggered I'm pretty sweet
the<00:03:55.049> welds<00:03:55.470> are<00:03:56.040> really<00:03:56.400> nice<00:03:56.780> this<00:03:57.780> is
