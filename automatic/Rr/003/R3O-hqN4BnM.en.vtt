00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.130
 due to the outstanding feedback of the 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.470
 community have us again 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.790
 giulietta viewed and applies 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.860
 actually benchmarks with the game 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.720
 make and you hardly believe it you can 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.350
 So even high end hardware like them 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.699
 just in the computer have to strike down 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.010
 how to do that when you get it more accurate 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.210
 Watching the benchmark scenes 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.630
 which one has chosen 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.630
 April 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:35.320
 then the game was based on the beta 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.430
 on an adapted anvil engine 3 the 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.370
 not three cities but you can see it too 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.200
 that also happens on physics so all 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.320
 physics effects to see and become there 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:48.610
 internally from the cpu with the help of philips 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.480
 library is charged and jorge switched 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.480
 Let's have a look at all the details 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.410
 2560 1600 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.130
 As you can see we have too 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.750
 eightfold multi sampling at a few 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.629
 beautiful stories as for six camera 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.320
 on the sites or on logic graphics 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.790
 in itself and now look how it works 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.080
 you can see that we are there very nice 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.080
 are a 60 fps range 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:20.899
 Only then do we run opel technology 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.000
 always our benchmark scene mens that 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.850
 is not limited ladders is called 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.640
 because if it's from this waterslide 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:33.600
 jump to the level of one must go 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.170
 to let 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.180
 fantastic little way starts here 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.350
 the graphics cards benchmark the values 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.549
 there is then on our website 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.330
 but I finished benchmark all finished 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.850
 get started here 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:53.920
 I just do it before you can 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:58.899
 up flying her physically 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.130
 totally correct area and runs over the 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.820
 road and being run over 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.500
 then it goes here in the exhaus over in 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.959
 the field where he verden under the circle 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.759
 probably pretty much too 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:11.290
 Brechrech has always taken it easy 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.750
 would if you were on health 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:19.120
 that now 61 ps average with 68 yes hello 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.959
 you can already see the 92 ticks has it 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.299
 no problem 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.930
 that is curious or noticed 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:29.170
 that performance in full-hd almost 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.730
 which is why we are currently in 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.200
 Owners really advise as much as possible 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.900
 represent many pixels hold 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.659
 downsampling or just bring to water 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.909
 the cpu test are completely different caliber 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.920
 because he is really so demanding that there 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.599
 Most cdu saw it overdoing it 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.760
 with the effects really total in the 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.829
 kneel go together now simulate 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.090
 in the game who the marler wise so then 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.709
 Do you go to a vision buyer receives 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.200
 a certain ability and then can 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.720
 goody do the same thing goes out 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.060
 custom game goes, and here such a 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:06.189
 called utah to world namely the green 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.189
 screen at the same time we press on play 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.909
 and we are now able to 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.170
 Queen of the Goats the way here 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.019
 beautiful animals tongue and theirs 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:19.639
 horns to see there is by pressing 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:21.129
 the key servants pore and 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:24.500
 we can show that 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:27.650
 he does not fall from the sky and 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.989
 We are also the director who sleep where 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.370
 you do not and the cool in the 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.250
 History is just that 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.720
 ragdoll are therefore physics objects and ever 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.299
 more of these may be shared in the 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.160
 falling sky makes the fall stronger 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.160
 the first time on it made common times 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.900
 continue with the lines 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.290
 and remember this is a 46 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.030
 year old as a hero processor four cores 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.230
 afp red 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.700
 actually pretty much the stupidest thing 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.740
 you just by reasonable price 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.530
 can install and always sees where now 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.170
 already here with 30 the nada win 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.160
 he's going straight in the direction 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:06.050
 single-digit greens still the 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.640
 skill hedgehog good there you can then 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.710
 all these subjects to a lump 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.740
 form and through the area fling and 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.130
 the area having a fast 5 fps 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.130
 completely insane 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.190
 that looks really ne trade evil that sees 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:23.169
 like a battlefield here and we 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.360
 are range of 7 fps with felt 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.440
 funny enough, they do not go for a hundred goats 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.060
 go away if there is the possibility 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.289
 here now in the authors accept 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.690
 and cause an explosion and the 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.669
 then everyone would fly away 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.710
 So that's a great thing 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.710
 completely meaningless fun one sees 611 ps 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:44.220
 and that is no longer a little bit better 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:49.020
 score here simply by restart 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.020
 reset to zero 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.830
 The god simulator has not only 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.870
 as a big fun for a big little one especially 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.919
 Animal lovers proved but with yours 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.599
 real worth more because it can be a 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:05.910
 really nice with torment so dax 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:05.910
 show conclusion in any case let's see
