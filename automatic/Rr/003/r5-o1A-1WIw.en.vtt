yeah it looks pretty awesome there's
three<00:00:56.730> different<00:00:56.820> animations<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.600> can

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
three different animations you can

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:05.500 
three different animations you can
choose<00:00:59.960> light<00:01:00.960> as<00:01:01.170> your<00:01:01.440> flip<00:01:01.739> out<00:01:04.250> thing

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
choose light as your flip out thing

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.510 
choose light as your flip out thing
layers<00:01:06.510> off<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.780> power<00:01:06.960> thing<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.530> if<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.799> do

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
layers off the power thing so if you do

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.630 
layers off the power thing so if you do
that<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.570> that's<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.900> stock<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:10.470> he's<00:01:11.340> got

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
that and that's the stock one he's got

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.330 
that and that's the stock one he's got
an<00:01:11.850> overhand<00:01:12.390> one<00:01:12.689> which<00:01:13.049> I'm<00:01:13.770> probably<00:01:14.100> going

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
an overhand one which I'm probably going

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.520 
an overhand one which I'm probably going
to<00:01:14.400> show<00:01:14.549> as<00:01:14.670> well<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.840> then<00:01:16.140> he's<00:01:16.290> got

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
to show as well and then he's got

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.390

whatever relevant lean so yeah this

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.940 
whatever relevant lean so yeah this
probably<00:01:21.720> won't<00:01:21.840> be<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> long<00:01:22.170> video<00:01:22.320> cuz<00:01:22.830> all<00:01:22.920> I

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
different flip out animations as you can

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.950 
different flip out animations as you can
tell<00:01:34.079> from<00:01:34.520> all<00:01:35.520> these<00:01:35.700> times<00:01:36.210> I've<00:01:36.630> spent

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
no better it's test us what slopes down

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.000 
no better it's test us what slopes down
to<00:01:45.000> fir<00:01:45.119> matter

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010

as you can tell see it to the other

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.170 
as you can tell see it to the other
backstab<00:01:53.010> animations<00:01:53.840> yeah

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
backstab animations yeah

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.070 
backstab animations yeah
okay<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.450> we're<00:01:57.690> back<00:01:58.460> so<00:01:59.570> here's<00:02:00.570> what<00:02:00.900> the

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
okay and we're back so here's what the

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.200 
okay and we're back so here's what the
new<00:02:01.110> animate<00:02:01.710> or<00:02:02.100> here's<00:02:02.430> what<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.700> overhand

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
new animate or here's what the overhand

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.080 
new animate or here's what the overhand
animation<00:02:03.720> looks<00:02:03.870> like<00:02:04.580> so<00:02:05.580> it's<00:02:05.730> pretty<00:02:05.850> cool

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
animation looks like so it's pretty cool

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.430 
animation looks like so it's pretty cool
but<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.390> still<00:02:06.630> takes<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.900> same<00:02:07.080> amount<00:02:07.350> of

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
but it still takes the same amount of

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.310 
but it still takes the same amount of
time<00:02:07.650> to<00:02:07.680> flip<00:02:08.070> it<00:02:08.190> out<00:02:08.280> as<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:09.750> normal<00:02:10.110> knife

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
time to flip it out as the normal knife

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.180 
time to flip it out as the normal knife
does<00:02:10.910> or<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.270> stock<00:02:12.630> animation<00:02:13.380> it's<00:02:13.740> just<00:02:14.040> it

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
does or the stock animation it's just it

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.590 
does or the stock animation it's just it
looks<00:02:14.370> quite<00:02:14.760> cool<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:16.700> so<00:02:17.700> as<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:17.970> see

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
looks quite cool and so as you can see

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.530 
looks quite cool and so as you can see
I'm<00:02:18.690> still<00:02:18.960> failing<00:02:19.230> through<00:02:19.500> these<00:02:19.620> steps<00:02:20.540> so

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
I'm still failing through these steps so

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.780 
I'm still failing through these steps so
that<00:02:21.570> was<00:02:21.930> all<00:02:22.020> right<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.470> one<00:02:23.340> just<00:02:23.490> served

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
that was all right that one just served

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.090 
that was all right that one just served
I<00:02:26.750> like<00:02:27.750> watching<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.230> knife<00:02:28.410> just<00:02:28.440> slip<00:02:28.920> out

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
I like watching the knife just slip out

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.040 
I like watching the knife just slip out
because<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:30.000> had<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.210> butterfly<00:02:30.630> knife<00:02:30.780> on<00:02:30.930> my

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
because I had a butterfly knife on my

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.020 
because I had a butterfly knife on my
own<00:02:31.200> but<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.070> didn't<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.430> like<00:02:32.460> a<00:02:32.610> real<00:02:32.820> blade

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
own but it didn't have like a real blade

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.220 
own but it didn't have like a real blade
on<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.300> because<00:02:33.510> those<00:02:33.690> are<00:02:33.840> illegal<00:02:34.020> in

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230

I<00:02:56.730> might<00:02:56.940> save<00:02:57.239> up<00:02:57.390> for<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.600> better<00:02:57.780> training

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
I might save up for a better training

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.840 
I might save up for a better training
knife<00:02:58.739> one<00:02:59.480> just<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.600> can<00:03:01.280> practice<00:03:02.280> more

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
then maybe one day possibly get a real

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.150 
then maybe one day possibly get a real
one<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.690> don't<00:03:06.900> know<00:03:07.019> it's<00:03:07.800> not<00:03:07.860> like<00:03:07.950> I'm<00:03:08.070> gonna

one I don't know it's not like I'm gonna
stab<00:03:08.700> anybody<00:03:09.000> though<00:03:09.300> is<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:11.540> but<00:03:12.540> it's<00:03:12.690> just

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
stab anybody though is it but it's just

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.080 
stab anybody though is it but it's just
a<00:03:12.959> joke<00:03:13.170> I<00:03:13.440> wouldn't<00:03:13.890> ever<00:03:14.100> stab<00:03:14.550> anybody<00:03:17.090> yeah

a joke I wouldn't ever stab anybody yeah
anyway<00:03:18.660> there's<00:03:19.350> one<00:03:19.709> more<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:19.980> it's<00:03:20.250> called

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
anyway there's one more and it's called

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.960 
anyway there's one more and it's called
the<00:03:20.550> vertical<00:03:24.380> flip<00:03:25.380> out<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.830> think<00:03:25.980> yeah<00:03:26.790> it's

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
the vertical flip out I think yeah it's

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.540 
the vertical flip out I think yeah it's
definitely<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.600> vertical<00:03:28.019> one<00:03:28.760> so<00:03:29.760> yeah

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
definitely the vertical one so yeah

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.380 
definitely the vertical one so yeah
until<00:03:32.270> then<00:03:32.450> see<00:03:33.320> you<00:03:33.380> in<00:03:33.470> a<00:03:33.560> minute<00:03:33.680> okay<00:03:34.390> and

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
until then see you in a minute okay and

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.840 
until then see you in a minute okay and
for<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.600> final<00:03:36.020> flip<00:03:36.560> out<00:03:36.740> animation<00:03:37.310> of<00:03:37.520> the

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
for the final flip out animation of the

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.410 
for the final flip out animation of the
video<00:03:38.090> we<00:03:38.660> have<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:38.990> vertical<00:03:39.350> ones<00:03:39.680> so

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
video we have the vertical ones so

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.620 
video we have the vertical ones so
that's<00:03:41.420> what<00:03:41.660> it<00:03:41.750> looks<00:03:41.780> like<00:03:42.080> and<00:03:43.540> it's<00:03:44.540> like

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
that's what it looks like and it's like

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.980 
that's what it looks like and it's like
a<00:03:44.720> different<00:03:45.020> sort<00:03:45.620> of<00:03:45.710> flip<00:03:46.010> but<00:03:46.550> it's<00:03:46.990> still

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
a different sort of flip but it's still

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.600 
a different sort of flip but it's still
quite<00:03:48.290> cool<00:03:48.620> it's<00:03:48.950> just<00:03:49.130> basically<00:03:49.520> the

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
quite cool it's just basically the

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.020 
quite cool it's just basically the
overhand<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.270> think<00:03:50.540> no<00:03:51.290> maybe<00:03:51.530> not<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.770> over

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
overhand I think no maybe not the over

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.060 
overhand I think no maybe not the over
this<00:03:53.030> is<00:03:55.090> one<00:03:56.090> of<00:03:56.210> the<00:03:56.300> other<00:03:56.510> ones<00:03:56.890> laters

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
this is one of the other ones laters

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.010 
this is one of the other ones laters
it's<00:03:58.250> a<00:03:58.340> cool<00:03:58.520> one<00:03:58.670> I<00:03:58.880> like<00:03:59.330> this<00:03:59.420> one<00:03:59.600> I<00:03:59.810> think

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
it's a cool one I like this one I think

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.140 
it's a cool one I like this one I think
it's<00:04:00.310> probably<00:04:01.310> my<00:04:01.580> favorite<00:04:01.910> out<00:04:01.970> of<00:04:02.030> the

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
it's probably my favorite out of the

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.680 
it's probably my favorite out of the
three<00:04:02.950> possibly<00:04:04.150> so<00:04:05.150> if<00:04:05.420> you<00:04:05.510> want<00:04:05.630> to
