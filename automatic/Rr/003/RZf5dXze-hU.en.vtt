house I've tried the regular one already
my<00:00:12.670> films<00:00:12.940> on<00:00:13.030> the<00:00:13.120> regular<00:00:13.540> on<00:00:13.780> the<00:00:14.080> hamburger

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
my films on the regular on the hamburger

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.859 
my films on the regular on the hamburger
one<00:00:14.679> was<00:00:15.309> just<00:00:15.549> basically<00:00:15.730> it<00:00:16.449> just<00:00:16.509> felt<00:00:16.810> like

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
one was just basically it just felt like

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.929 
one was just basically it just felt like
it<00:00:16.929> was<00:00:17.140> kind<00:00:17.319> of<00:00:17.349> small<00:00:17.529> it<00:00:18.339> tasted<00:00:18.640> very<00:00:18.789> good

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
it was kind of small it tasted very good

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.880

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
I think it was a little more on the

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.309 
I think it was a little more on the
pricey<00:00:21.130> side<00:00:21.279> but<00:00:21.819> um<00:00:21.999> so<00:00:22.599> I<00:00:22.630> wanted<00:00:22.989> even<00:00:23.079> got

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
start buying into it it appears that's a

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.719 
start buying into it it appears that's a
pretty<00:01:40.420> good<00:01:40.570> size<00:01:41.250> actually<00:01:42.250> this<00:01:42.340> looks<00:01:42.610> a

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
pretty good size actually this looks a

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.849 
pretty good size actually this looks a
lot<00:01:43.770> bigger<00:01:44.770> than<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.460> hamburger<00:01:45.909> one

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
lot bigger than the hamburger one

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:48.870 
lot bigger than the hamburger one
obviously<00:01:47.859> cook<00:01:48.100> because<00:01:48.340> they're<00:01:48.520> crispy

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
obviously cook because they're crispy

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.389 
obviously cook because they're crispy
chickens<00:01:49.240> a<00:01:49.329> lot<00:01:49.799> bigger<00:01:50.799> so<00:01:51.100> this<00:01:51.250> actually

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
chickens a lot bigger so this actually

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.849 
chickens a lot bigger so this actually
looks<00:01:51.640> more<00:01:51.939> appealing<00:01:52.030> so<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:53.500> I<00:01:53.560> think<00:01:53.770> it's

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
looks more appealing so and I think it's

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:55.859 
looks more appealing so and I think it's
the<00:01:53.920> same<00:01:54.130> price<00:01:54.359> so<00:01:55.359> I'm<00:01:55.420> gonna<00:01:55.539> get<00:01:55.689> us<00:01:55.780> a

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869
