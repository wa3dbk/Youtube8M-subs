00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
I can really use one of those it's a

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.870 
I can really use one of those it's a
fallacy<00:01:06.470> unrealistic<00:01:07.580> expectation<00:01:08.580> just

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
fallacy unrealistic expectation just

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.490
