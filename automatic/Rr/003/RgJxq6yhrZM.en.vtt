00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.570
 I was 39 years old when I drowned 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.230
 on Friday afternoon on the river without 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.490
 steps 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.680
 he was in the company of two 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.260
 companions and as they passed the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.390
 river slipped and fell into the water 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.969
 Desperate Fate saw his friend ask 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.110
 help jumped into the water to save 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.390
 almost died there is that tire a 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.020
 talking to him he did not ask for help and 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.620
 asked for a plenary session in the water 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.600
 his nephew said that he raised the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.070
 hand to understand I started to found 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.780
 the weather the ravine 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.129
 I just managed to stop until another one 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.559
 bottom pit 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.260
 if you insist he could have died 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.969
 also your pass from that past is 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.140
 that he can list do not get them 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.640
 rose I think it is also very deep is 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.640
 enough 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.460
 you have a habit of researching that you 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.700
 that he did not even see in him a tax 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.290
 that we live that fish in the place where 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.720
 The firefighters were blind. 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.270
 started the searches and the garrison was 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.729
 divided into two teams one of its river 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.640
 below to check possible locations 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.680
 where the body could hold nothing 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.900
 found the firefighters with the support 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.180
 of some residents and accompanied by 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.790
 company traveled three kilometers 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.290
 within the forest bordering the river and not 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.290
 found the boy's body 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.659
 another team concentrated the dives on the 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.939
 where the fisherman would have fallen and 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.250
 due to the strength of the river water that 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.539
 full was unable to verify all 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.119
 corners of the site 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.520
 at that point there was one near the antler 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.189
 fall site where lifeguards gave 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.409
 priority but nothing was found 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.240
 the searches continued throughout the 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.200

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.719
