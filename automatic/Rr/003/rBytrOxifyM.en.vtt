warm and also the other reason for doing
it<00:01:36.359> on<00:01:36.539> here<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:38.130> these<00:01:38.280> panels

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
it on here is that on these panels

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.249 
it on here is that on these panels
rather<00:01:38.789> is<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.600> won't<00:01:39.749> get<00:01:39.869> tired<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
rather is that you won't get tired the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.379 
rather is that you won't get tired the
water<00:01:40.439> either<00:01:40.649> so<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.460> last<00:01:41.759> longer<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:42.389 
water either so you last longer in the

really<00:02:17.000> simple<00:02:17.180> idea<00:02:17.630> but<00:02:17.660> really<00:02:18.140> effective

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
really simple idea but really effective

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.290 
really simple idea but really effective
as<00:02:18.680> well<00:02:18.890> really<00:02:19.310> really<00:02:19.580> comfortable<00:02:19.790> and

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
as well really really comfortable and

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.240 
as well really really comfortable and
again<00:02:20.900> this<00:02:21.170> material<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.860> church<00:02:22.070> is

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
again this material to the church is

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.700 
again this material to the church is
extremely<00:02:22.730> soft<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.960> reason<00:02:24.410> they<00:02:24.470> put<00:02:24.620> this

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
extremely soft the reason they put this

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.430 
extremely soft the reason they put this
velcro<00:02:24.980> here<00:02:25.520> is<00:02:26.240> because<00:02:26.810> depending<00:02:27.140> on<00:02:27.350> the

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
velcro here is because depending on the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.840 
velcro here is because depending on the
size<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.800> your<00:02:27.860> neck<00:02:28.070> you<00:02:28.190> can<00:02:28.250> actually<00:02:28.580> just

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
that to be tighter or less tight however

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.430 
that to be tighter or less tight however
you<00:02:32.060> need<00:02:32.210> it<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.570> have<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.750> maximum<00:02:33.290> or<00:02:33.410> the

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
you need it to have the maximum or the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.580 
you need it to have the maximum or the
best<00:02:33.680> fit<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.070> can<00:02:35.260> quit<00:02:36.260> look<00:02:36.410> at<00:02:36.530> the

this neoprene panel that just goes over

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.170 
this neoprene panel that just goes over
the<00:02:48.650> zip<00:02:48.830> when<00:02:48.980> you're<00:02:49.130> in<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.250> stops<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.060> your

is<00:02:52.970> an<00:02:53.210> interlocking<00:02:53.600> zip<00:02:53.960> so<00:02:54.530> basically<00:02:54.950> it's

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
is an interlocking zip so basically it's

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.100

of the holes or any of the the zip parts
just<00:03:00.320> here<00:03:03.670> another<00:03:04.670> thing<00:03:04.820> I<00:03:04.880> should<00:03:04.940> mention

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
just here another thing I should mention

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.930 
just here another thing I should mention
it's<00:03:05.660> what's<00:03:05.870> called<00:03:06.110> a<00:03:06.290> flat<00:03:06.830> lock<00:03:07.160> in

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
it's what's called a flat lock in

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.820 
it's what's called a flat lock in
construction<00:03:08.630> and<00:03:08.810> when<00:03:09.140> we<00:03:09.230> talk<00:03:09.380> about<00:03:09.410> flat

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
construction and when we talk about flat

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.510 
construction and when we talk about flat
lock<00:03:10.010> or<00:03:10.640> we<00:03:10.820> actually<00:03:11.240> mean<00:03:11.450> is<00:03:12.220> how<00:03:13.220> they<00:03:13.370> put

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
lock or we actually mean is how they put

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.880 
lock or we actually mean is how they put
the<00:03:13.580> wetsuit<00:03:13.940> together<00:03:14.380> so<00:03:15.380> where<00:03:15.560> we<00:03:15.650> see<00:03:15.680> the

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
the wetsuit together so where we see the

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.960 
the wetsuit together so where we see the
stitching<00:03:16.280> on<00:03:16.370> here<00:03:18.310> as<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:19.430> can<00:03:19.550> see<00:03:19.730> they're

stitching on here as you can see they're

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.370 
stitching on here as you can see they're
well<00:03:20.180> they've<00:03:20.300> actually<00:03:20.540> done<00:03:20.750> is<00:03:21.110> put<00:03:21.260> these

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
well they've actually done is put these

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.470 
well they've actually done is put these
two<00:03:21.530> pieces<00:03:21.830> of<00:03:21.860> material<00:03:21.980> together<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:23.360> then

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
two pieces of material together and then

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.150 
two pieces of material together and then
they've<00:03:23.660> stitched<00:03:23.990> across<00:03:24.170> each<00:03:24.530> panel<00:03:24.920> here

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
they've stitched across each panel here

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.390 
they've stitched across each panel here
as<00:03:25.910> you<00:03:26.060> can<00:03:26.120> see<00:03:26.350> now<00:03:27.350> again<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:28.160> don't<00:03:28.220> whether

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
as you can see now again I don't whether

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
you can see this or not but it's

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.930 
you can see this or not but it's
extremely<00:03:30.140> flat<00:03:30.740> in<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.070> way<00:03:31.190> they<00:03:31.310> construct

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
extremely flat in the way they construct

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.880 
extremely flat in the way they construct
it<00:03:32.030> on<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.330> inside<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.780> wetsuit<00:03:33.200> and<00:03:33.800> the

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
it on the inside the wetsuit and the

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.949 
it on the inside the wetsuit and the
reason<00:03:34.010> for<00:03:34.190> that<00:03:34.430> is<00:03:34.670> minimizing<00:03:35.120> any<00:03:35.510> rashes

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
reason for that is minimizing any rashes

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.660 
reason for that is minimizing any rashes
that<00:03:35.990> you<00:03:36.140> get<00:03:36.320> from<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.560> wetsuit<00:03:36.890> on<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.520> real

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
that you get from a wetsuit on the real

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.120 
that you get from a wetsuit on the real
cheap<00:03:37.970> supermarket<00:03:38.709> wetsuits<00:03:39.709> that<00:03:39.890> aren't

come out like this and bowl over and

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.580 
come out like this and bowl over and
this<00:03:44.660> generally<00:03:45.050> where<00:03:45.200> they've<00:03:45.320> grabbed

this generally where they've grabbed

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.680 
this generally where they've grabbed
just<00:03:45.860> two<00:03:46.040> piece<00:03:46.220> of<00:03:46.340> material<00:03:46.430> together<00:03:46.820> bold

it<00:03:47.840> like<00:03:47.959> that<00:03:48.110> I<00:03:48.170> just<00:03:48.260> stitched<00:03:48.650> it<00:03:48.860> that's

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
it like that I just stitched it that's

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.710 
it like that I just stitched it that's
when<00:03:49.459> you<00:03:49.489> get<00:03:49.700> rashes<00:03:50.090> that's<00:03:50.420> really

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
keep it together minimize the amount of
