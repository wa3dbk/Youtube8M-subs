00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
it's so squirrely as soon as I get a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.520 
it's so squirrely as soon as I get a
little<00:01:06.299> bit<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.570> throttle<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:06.930> goes<00:01:07.110> up<00:01:07.320> and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
little bit the throttle that goes up and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.280 
little bit the throttle that goes up and
smacks<00:01:07.890> right<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> ground<00:01:08.960> so<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:09.990> only

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
smacks right on the ground so the only

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.960 
smacks right on the ground so the only
way<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.530> ever<00:01:10.770> get<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.010> fly<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.909> get

Tom

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.680 

and<00:01:16.290> even<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:17.700> crazy<00:01:18.090> all<00:01:18.479> over

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
and even then it's just crazy all over

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.800 
and even then it's just crazy all over
the<00:01:18.750> place<00:01:18.990> super<00:01:19.470> squirrely<00:01:19.920> yeah<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:21.390> is

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the place super squirrely yeah it is

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.260 
the place super squirrely yeah it is
so<00:01:22.080> my<00:01:22.350> thought<00:01:22.590> what<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.460> may<00:01:23.700> end<00:01:23.820> up<00:01:23.880> doing<00:01:23.940> is

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
so my thought what I may end up doing is

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:34.969 
so my thought what I may end up doing is
go<00:01:24.420> ahead<00:01:24.510> and<00:01:24.659> pull<00:01:24.810> all<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:33.500> we<00:01:34.500> stepped<00:01:34.800> up
