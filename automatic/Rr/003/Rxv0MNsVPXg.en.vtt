it all the way up my my foreheads and

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.830 
it all the way up my my foreheads and
down<00:05:35.509> my<00:05:35.690> face<00:05:35.960> down<00:05:36.710> my<00:05:36.889> neck<00:05:37.129> and<00:05:37.340> I<00:05:38.060> even<00:05:38.509> put

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
down my face down my neck and I even put

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.649 
down my face down my neck and I even put
a<00:05:38.870> bit<00:05:39.139> down<00:05:39.409> below<00:05:39.770> there<00:05:40.009> I<00:05:40.069> think<00:05:40.449> so<00:05:41.449> just

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:41.659 
a bit down below there I think so just

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:44.140 
a bit down below there I think so just
have<00:05:41.810> fun<00:05:41.840> with<00:05:42.050> it<00:05:42.199> and<00:05:42.530> then<00:05:43.400> after<00:05:43.849> that<00:05:43.969> I

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
have fun with it and then after that I

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.240 
have fun with it and then after that I
blend<00:05:44.719> it<00:05:44.870> out<00:05:44.990> a<00:05:45.020> little<00:05:45.319> bit<00:05:45.440> so<00:05:45.919> it<00:05:46.039> doesn't

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
blend it out a little bit so it doesn't

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.269 
blend it out a little bit so it doesn't
look<00:05:46.370> too<00:05:46.789> Dottie<00:05:47.449> like<00:05:47.900> an<00:05:48.050> alien<00:05:48.219> so<00:05:49.219> I

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:49.279 
look too Dottie like an alien so I

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
just a bit artistic and another little

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.260 
just a bit artistic and another little
detail<00:06:19.190> if<00:06:19.310> you<00:06:19.370> wanted<00:06:19.550> to<00:06:19.639> add<00:06:19.759> it<00:06:19.879> in<00:06:20.029> and

then<00:06:20.419> just<00:06:20.569> check<00:06:20.690> my<00:06:20.839> hair<00:06:20.990> down<00:06:21.169> and<00:06:21.409> that's

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
then just check my hair down and that's

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:35.410 
then just check my hair down and that's
it
