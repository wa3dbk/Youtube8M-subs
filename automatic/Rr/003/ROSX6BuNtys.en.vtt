it does in fact work I'm not a scammer I

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.660 
it does in fact work I'm not a scammer I
just<00:03:17.389> need<00:03:17.630> a<00:03:17.660> little<00:03:17.750> bit<00:03:18.019> of<00:03:18.079> cash<00:03:18.319> so<00:03:19.250> it's

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
just need a little bit of cash so it's

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.860 
just need a little bit of cash so it's
loading<00:03:21.609> and<00:03:22.609> this<00:03:23.150> is<00:03:23.329> actually<00:03:23.630> a<00:03:23.660> really

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
loading and this is actually a really

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.379 
loading and this is actually a really
great<00:03:24.109> game<00:03:24.350> if<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:24.709> you're<00:03:25.040> into<00:03:25.280> UFC<00:03:25.760> it's<00:03:26.060> a

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
great game if you you're into UFC it's a

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.630 
great game if you you're into UFC it's a
it's<00:03:27.170> not<00:03:27.470> a<00:03:27.799> button<00:03:28.549> masher<00:03:28.970> by<00:03:29.090> any<00:03:29.299> means

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
it's not a button masher by any means

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.950 
it's not a button masher by any means
that's<00:03:31.640> great<00:03:31.910> because<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:33.650> UFC<00:03:34.100> MMA<00:03:34.400> is<00:03:35.120> very

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
that's great because the UFC MMA is very

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.870 
that's great because the UFC MMA is very
technical<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:36.860> isn't<00:03:37.250> just<00:03:37.310> swinging<00:03:37.730> it

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
technical it isn't just swinging it

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.410 
technical it isn't just swinging it
isn't<00:03:38.360> just<00:03:38.480> brawling<00:03:39.820> it's<00:03:40.820> a<00:03:40.940> chess<00:03:41.180> match

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
isn't just brawling it's a chess match

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.150 
isn't just brawling it's a chess match
and<00:03:41.840> so<00:03:43.840> there<00:03:44.840> is<00:03:44.960> a<00:03:44.990> pretty<00:03:45.530> steep<00:03:45.950> learning

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
and so there is a pretty steep learning

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.490 
and so there is a pretty steep learning
curve<00:03:46.730> on<00:03:46.940> this<00:03:48.970> and<00:03:49.970> so<00:03:50.930> everything<00:03:51.440> is

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
curve on this and so everything is

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.440 
curve on this and so everything is
loaded<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:54.730> only<00:03:55.730> thing<00:03:55.880> I<00:03:56.000> really<00:03:56.210> don't

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
loaded and only thing I really don't

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.540 
loaded and only thing I really don't
care<00:03:56.720> about<00:03:56.780> this<00:03:57.170> game<00:03:58.000> is<00:03:59.440> actually<00:04:00.440> the<00:04:01.040> the

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
care about this game is actually the the

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.430 
care about this game is actually the the
UI<00:04:01.790> once<00:04:02.390> you<00:04:02.510> actually<00:04:02.660> get<00:04:02.960> into<00:04:03.200> the

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
UI once you actually get into the

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.470 
UI once you actually get into the
gameplay<00:04:03.980> though<00:04:04.220> it's<00:04:04.520> awesome<00:04:05.000> but<00:04:05.330> the

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
gameplay though it's awesome but the

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.040 
gameplay though it's awesome but the
interface<00:04:06.520> sometimes<00:04:07.520> kills<00:04:07.880> me<00:04:08.150> so<00:04:08.540> I'm<00:04:08.870> just

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
interface sometimes kills me so I'm just

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.650 
interface sometimes kills me so I'm just
