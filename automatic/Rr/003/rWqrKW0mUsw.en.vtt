00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.650
 which is very easy and gets very hot 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.960
 Let's learn so lets start the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.279
 our recipe all these ingredients and 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.019
 the quantities 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.510
 they are here in the description of the video on 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.760
 youtube down here is good video 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.129
 here is the flour that I have already stopped with 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.879
 our pasta looks really sweet now I'm going 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.350
 put the sugar and also the yeast 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.510
 the question about the first 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.730
 Dry ingredients are good and one 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.510
 salt pin which is to give a 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.440
 relaxed in the right taste so let's 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.059
 mix the dry ingredients ready 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.410
 done, just add the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.780
 liquid ingredients 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.510
 here's the butter, how can you 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.810
 see she's melted right to pull it in 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.970
 microwave for about 20 seconds of the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.490
 mixture and already adds eggs and 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.350
 also blends 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.810
 now we add the secret of this 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.240
 recipe that is the cream that goes 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.900
 leave our very delicious pasta 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.420
 Let's put it here and add the milk. 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.049
 and we will mix until it forms a mass 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.909
 well homogeneous and well done, it's okay but 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.310
 already he was ready and looks just she does not 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.869
 neither too liquid nor too thick 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.490
 If you like I finish putting 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.619
 all the ingredients indicated is still 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.020
 very liquid puts a little more 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.909
 flour until this consistency is 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.009
 good and now you add the last 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.570
 ingredient that vanilla essence is 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.259
 that she's going to give all that touch 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.119
 special and that zina flavor our mass 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.009
 now I'm going to get my machine and show 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.659
 For you, how do you do? 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.460
 here I have my machine and it was 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.799
 Look, you do not notice my machine is 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.049
 thin to do but that 's the way it is and use 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.400
 She is almost every day then a warrior. 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.260
 on here 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.630
 the house is this machine you find in 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.970
 various places on the market in shops and 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.770
 It's cheap, it's good, and here I am. 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.320
 I already did two axes and said that she is 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.560
 so, but whenever you're going to do a 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:21.110
 the other you enter with your 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.780
 machine with a little oil and now 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.390
 just put your dough and I'll get soaked 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.820
 which is not to leak the sides without 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.920
 Leaked side has no problem to places 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:36.950
 anyway 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:40.670
 on both sides and then closes and now I 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.530
 I hope it's okay, I'll wait 15 minutes and one 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.510
 oil much here than when it turns green 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.790
 which is ready but when it 's green 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.890
 I'm still kind of white so leave more 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.880
 I'll leave here 15 minutes to see 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.130
 How do you stay? 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.880
 Good, I think it's already good here. Come on. 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.500
 see a look just look how beautiful right now 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.380
 You pick up with the help of a little 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.420
 so the thing that is very hot was 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.920
 here 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.290
 so now I'll decorate them with 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.290
 chocolate and then just taste it 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.420
