00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.509
 as promised, here comes the second 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.030
 part of our specials to games the one 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.660
 treating aggression 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.179
 harm as good 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.830
 good games with frustrating moments 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.330
 We have some of your suggestions 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.350
 We do not consider and do not hold ourselves 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.340
 long with skirmish, let's go 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.920
 gta vice city 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.930
 You would like a mainstream title like that 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.000
 really about any major frustration 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.830
 hurdles expect vice city had the then 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.689
 but above all, it becomes a mission 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.340
 again and again as patience straining 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.960
 described with a small one 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.059
 remote controlled helicopter we need 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.380
 placing a bomb sounds cool 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.030
 but by the spongy control too 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.890
 an annoying affair we 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.370
 repeat over and over again 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.230
 have to 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.820
 this secures white space into a place 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.320
 our list though not as one 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.110
 the top frustration title ftl faster his 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.460
 sorry that we had this feature 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.469
 ever and already mentioned it 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.730
 binding of isaac is far from being 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.559
 the only game with this 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.899
 controversial measure also the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.000
 space simulation fdl faster than light 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.260
 draws its special charm from that 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.540
 the player over and over again 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.250
 failed and every time his career as 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.820
 spaceship captain completely from the front 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.979
 must begin 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.659
 but the title is not very short 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.400
 complex and every lot of factors like 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.240
 Armament team and upgrades 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.770
 play a role 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.140
 hardcore call of cthulhu dark corners of 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.759
 the earth is the action-adventure based 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.439
 as the name says on the love 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.270
 by virtue of myth and so it takes us 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.579
 here also in the famous city ​​of miss 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.439
 which we explore in the ego-perspective 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.270
 the complete first third of the game 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.799
 comes without weapon violence it only works 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.420
 around the oppressive atmosphere through 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.280
 the ever stranger behavior of the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.079
 city ​​dwellers arise and then it works 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.640
 The entire city suddenly loses its grip 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.680
 decides to get rid of the protagonist 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.570
 and fake him at night in one 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.220
 legendary scene we have to unarmed 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.840
 from our hotel room through the whole 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.759
 City fell for it doors have to 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.020
 Barricaded window opened and 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.880
 abysses are skipped 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.680
 a wrong or too slow movement 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.299
 and everything starts again 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.500
 here there is not only the river but 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.040
 even the heart attack 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.040
 on top 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.540
 ninja gaiden black let's take one 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.310
 look at the consoles the ninja gaiden 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.560
 row is basically not exactly 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.150
 without and part 1 on the nds also applies 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.000
 because of his unfair pretty passages 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.130
 as annoying the 2004 for xbox published 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.270
 version of the original nds series was 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.070
 there is no exception 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.810
 is really violent but with the 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.000
 update ninja gaiden black that the 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.950
 adventurer of our lonely ninjas bob 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.020
 difficult made simple among other things 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.580
 came through many more opponents in the fans 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.230
 not necessarily good 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.240
 in order to make the thing possible 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.459
 a free camera mode integrated with 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.530
 But not everyone knows that 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.900
 original 3 has already been mentioned once 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.940
 in one of our specials at that time it went 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.860
 the slanders are the allegations 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.020
 Developers had a tutorial tinkered 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.459
 that almost blurred bawa without clue 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.840
 from the game mechanics we should 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.700
 various stunts in a basement garage 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.560
 Do not be surprised 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.330
 if a majority of the then three 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.160
 sellers the actual game either 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.700
 never got to face or worry about that 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.730
 tutorial have killed around prince of 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.560
 Persia parts of the Prince of Persia rows 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.360
 the modern times also have such 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.130
 design carver on straight warrior 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.440
 in the beginning and also sands 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.630
 of time involves some frustration passages 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.030
 By contrast, the newer two parts work 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.739
 the series really like casual title all 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.030
 but that is the prince of the original 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.010
 relaxed in the shade 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.030
 not only were the jump sections partly 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.980
 hard to frustrate 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.660
 In addition there was the time limit of one 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.170
 hour in which to save the princess 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.459
 was 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.590
 our editor viktor eippert 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.459
 By the way, every time despaired 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.310
 sheer invincible mirror princes 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.200
 dead space 2 dead space 1 was horror pure 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.670
 but compared to part 2 it was a 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.950
 comfortable walk on one 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.260
 cozy room station in dead space 2 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.970
 was isec with opponents to be thrown 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.860
 like from the back and apparently from 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.510
 nothing strikes that very hard on the 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.670
 limit to unfairness leaves one but 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.320
 still not going to come yet 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.940
 joke like the super necromorphs 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.780
 immortal opponents us everywhere 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.580
 follow 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.290
 overall, dead space 2 is one of the 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.010
 Hardest survival horror games of the 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.010
 last years 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.130
 far cry once appeared as far cry 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.110
 you wanted to crytek in one 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.060
 Realistic direction that is to say 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.680
 jack cover does not mind anything 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.480
 decision still falls on the 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.250
 Protect aim also already at the beginning 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.540
 pretty good really hard 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.910
 But it will not be until later 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.530
 mutant popping up in far cry is one 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.090
 quickly away from the window and often knows 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.410
 not even where the shot came from 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.360
 it will not be less 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.610
 frustrating that crytek on a free 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.200
 memory function had also waived 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.700
 that many computers back then with the graphics 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.260
 were overwhelmed and the game simple 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.970
 not fast enough ran it with gamble 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.010
 could react in time 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.740
 Call Circle as one of the hardest game 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.960
 contributed 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.190
 quest of mmo classic is about his 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.440
 meanwhile numerous extensions 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.000
 quite comfortable and lighter 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.550
 but still is going to be tough 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.120
 and before he has a certain 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.860
 beginner-friendly developed 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.600
 got pretty handy at everyone 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.340
 corner in the face cozy 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.110
 revive after a death run 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.240
 Instead, prefer to go back home without any money 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.460
 your corpse and annoy you over the 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.560
 as tightly pulled off xp even you 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.390
 can level down for days 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.160
 By virtue of that torture itself through endlessly long 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.900
 racing not instanced zones before 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.340
 someone else puts the boss and 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.210
 reckons with you soon 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.860
 hitchhike 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.630
 if you have any chance at all 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.850
 added anyway or just 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.650
 that's why the old everquest had one 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.600
 enormous addiction factor but in between 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.300
 you could ever in screaming cramps 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.400
 breaking out 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.950
 Tauss would be representative here 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.230
 for all box heavy games of the nsr 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.270
 Here you could perform a lot 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.340
 turtles big goblins or plain 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.660
 Megaman but we are for battle 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.000
 despite decided because it just 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.770
 it was common to lure the player along 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.540
 fancy graphics and varied 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.490
 gameplay again and then shows him 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.720
 at the hofer in races as inferior 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.730
 a human brain but that 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.530
 was malicious 8 bit computing power 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.330
 who does not memorize the racetracks 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.030
 learned or superhuman reflexes 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.070
 he could not exist here 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.540
 that was it with part 2 we are sure 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.980
 you have more suggestions 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.510
 let us know in the comments 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.810
 maybe there at some point part 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.810
 3
