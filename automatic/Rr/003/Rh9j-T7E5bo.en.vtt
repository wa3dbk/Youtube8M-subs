a typical film to describe to be honest
with<00:00:32.750> you<00:00:32.870> it's<00:00:33.080> it's<00:00:33.560> I<00:00:33.890> guess<00:00:34.790> you<00:00:34.940> would

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
with you it's it's I guess you would

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.350 
with you it's it's I guess you would
call<00:00:35.120> it<00:00:35.360> a<00:00:36.220> psychological<00:00:37.220> horror<00:00:37.400> film<00:00:37.760> but

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
call it a psychological horror film but

call it a psychological horror film but
with<00:00:38.480> supernatural<00:00:39.230> elements<00:00:39.950> it<00:00:40.040> is<00:00:40.190> very

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
with supernatural elements it is very

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.290 
with supernatural elements it is very
difficult<00:00:43.130> foam<00:00:43.309> foam<00:00:43.730> to<00:00:43.880> really<00:00:44.059> describe

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
difficult foam foam to really describe

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.660 
difficult foam foam to really describe
now<00:00:44.900> it's<00:00:45.080> not<00:00:45.260> all<00:00:45.410> that<00:00:45.440> horrific<00:00:45.739> and<00:00:46.580> this

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
now it's not all that horrific and this

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.750 
now it's not all that horrific and this
it's<00:00:46.970> not<00:00:47.210> all<00:00:47.330> that<00:00:47.360> scary<00:00:47.900> but<00:00:48.260> it<00:00:49.220> does<00:00:49.460> I

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
it's not all that scary but it does I

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.970 
it's not all that scary but it does I
would<00:00:49.910> say<00:00:50.270> fit<00:00:50.570> into<00:00:50.780> those<00:00:50.930> categories<00:00:50.989> more

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
would say fit into those categories more

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.180 
would say fit into those categories more
than<00:00:52.190> anything<00:00:52.370> else

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
than anything else

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.439 
than anything else
essentially<00:00:55.190> it<00:00:55.879> follows<00:00:57.280> since<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:58.460> a<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.940> war

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
essentially it follows since the a a war

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.960 
essentially it follows since the a a war
between<00:00:59.690> or<00:00:59.989> a<00:01:00.019> second<00:01:00.470> war<00:01:00.620> between<00:01:00.970> the

angels of heaven and essentially they

angels of heaven and essentially they
they<00:01:03.800> kind<00:01:04.010> of<00:01:04.070> split<00:01:04.280> into<00:01:04.519> factions<00:01:04.850> and

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
they kind of split into factions and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.080 
they kind of split into factions and
they<00:01:06.380> end<00:01:06.530> up<00:01:06.710> well<00:01:07.190> some<00:01:07.640> of<00:01:07.670> them<00:01:07.790> end<00:01:07.970> up

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
they end up well some of them end up

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.050 
they end up well some of them end up
coming<00:01:08.360> to<00:01:08.390> earth<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:10.400> aim<00:01:10.550> is<00:01:10.760> that<00:01:10.940> they

body of a young girl the the school of
the<00:02:23.510> moment<00:02:23.870> teaches<00:02:24.430> so<00:02:25.430> it's<00:02:25.580> basically

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
the moment teaches so it's basically

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.339 
the moment teaches so it's basically
it's<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.840> story<00:02:27.110> of<00:02:27.170> Gabriel<00:02:27.890> trying<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.250> find

it's a chase film you know in a weird
way<00:02:37.460> now<00:02:38.460> I<00:02:38.490> really<00:02:38.850> like<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.180> but<00:02:39.240> it

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
way now I really like it but it

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.300 
way now I really like it but it
certainly<00:02:39.600> isn't<00:02:39.900> for<00:02:40.080> everyone<00:02:40.410> it's<00:02:40.650> it's

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
certainly isn't for everyone it's it's

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.020 
certainly isn't for everyone it's it's
quite<00:02:41.550> heavy<00:02:41.760> going<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:43.220> it's<00:02:44.220> it's<00:02:44.640> there's

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
quite heavy going and it's it's there's

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.400 
quite heavy going and it's it's there's
obviously<00:02:45.570> quite<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.840> lot<00:02:45.990> of<00:02:46.020> religious

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
obviously quite a lot of religious

obviously quite a lot of religious
things<00:02:46.650> in<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:47.010> now<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:47.970> find<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.690> quite

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
things in it now I find it quite

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.210

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
myself but I do find it interesting and

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.160

research and you know it's it's it's

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.530 
research and you know it's it's it's
fascinating<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.550> sort<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.240> way<00:03:00.360> the

and he actually starting to see calls
which<00:03:26.910> were<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.480> would<00:03:28.410> argue<00:03:28.650> less<00:03:29.010> good<00:03:30.590> now

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590

it there are a few things but they're
very<00:04:00.270> very<00:04:00.660> quick<00:04:01.340> and<00:04:02.340> it's<00:04:02.520> that<00:04:02.670> there's

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
very very quick and it's that there's

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.850 
very very quick and it's that there's
not<00:04:03.540> much<00:04:03.720> action<00:04:04.080> in<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.320> always<00:04:04.440> various

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
not much action in it always various

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.100 
not much action in it always various
much<00:04:05.160> more<00:04:05.400> psychological<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:06.330> kind<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.660> the

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
much more psychological and kind of the

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.050 
much more psychological and kind of the
threat<00:04:07.830> and<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.010> Menace<00:04:08.370> behind<00:04:08.760> it<00:04:08.880> in

graceful<00:04:09.540> birds<00:04:09.750> performance<00:04:10.140> really<00:04:10.320> is<00:04:10.560> is

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
graceful birds performance really is is

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.979 
graceful birds performance really is is
fantastic<00:04:12.709> so<00:04:13.709> it's<00:04:14.700> kind<00:04:15.450> of<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:15.540> slow-moving

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
fantastic so it's kind of a slow-moving

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.310 
fantastic so it's kind of a slow-moving
film<00:04:17.209> but<00:04:18.209> it's<00:04:18.330> certainly<00:04:18.600> one<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:18.810> think<00:04:19.080> that

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
film but it's certainly one I think that

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.430 
film but it's certainly one I think that
you<00:04:19.940> you<00:04:20.940> enjoy<00:04:21.239> in<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.630> sort<00:04:21.810> of<00:04:21.840> intellectual

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
you you enjoy in a sort of intellectual

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.409 
you you enjoy in a sort of intellectual
level<00:04:22.770> even<00:04:23.280> though<00:04:23.580> it's<00:04:23.730> a<00:04:23.850> sort<00:04:24.030> of<00:04:24.090> you

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
level even though it's a sort of you

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.390 
level even though it's a sort of you
know<00:04:24.480> fantasy<00:04:25.110> film<00:04:25.320> essentially<00:04:25.919> I<00:04:28.400> guess

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
know fantasy film essentially I guess

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.100 
know fantasy film essentially I guess
the<00:04:29.550> budget<00:04:29.910> does<00:04:30.090> show<00:04:30.300> a<00:04:30.330> little<00:04:30.540> bit<00:04:30.810> in

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
the budget does show a little bit in

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.400 
the budget does show a little bit in
some<00:04:31.350> in<00:04:31.710> some<00:04:32.520> places<00:04:32.820> because<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:34.020> there

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
some in some places because the there

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.440 
some in some places because the there
are<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.530> few<00:04:34.800> effects<00:04:35.160> where<00:04:35.460> you<00:04:36.030> kind<00:04:36.270> of<00:04:36.360> see

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
are a few effects where you kind of see

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.150 
are a few effects where you kind of see
the<00:04:36.570> angels<00:04:37.110> of<00:04:38.450> makeup<00:04:39.450> and<00:04:39.660> I<00:04:39.870> don't<00:04:40.770> think

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
the angels of makeup and I don't think

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.180 
the angels of makeup and I don't think
they've<00:04:41.520> aged<00:04:42.180> all<00:04:42.630> that<00:04:42.900> well<00:04:43.110> they<00:04:43.860> kind<00:04:44.130> of

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
they've aged all that well they kind of

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.770 
they've aged all that well they kind of
look<00:04:44.370> a<00:04:44.490> bit

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
look a bit

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.100 
look a bit
prosthetic<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.800> prosthetic<00:04:47.370> I<00:04:47.520> think<00:04:47.790> and<00:04:48.110> but

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
prosthetic to prosthetic I think and but

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.780 
prosthetic to prosthetic I think and but
it's<00:04:49.230> it's<00:04:49.650> effective<00:04:50.070> at<00:04:50.160> the<00:04:50.250> time<00:04:50.430> I<00:04:50.640> would

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
it's it's effective at the time I would

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.420 
it's it's effective at the time I would
say<00:04:50.870> so<00:04:51.870> you<00:04:51.960> can<00:04:52.080> kind<00:04:52.290> of<00:04:52.350> figure<00:04:52.500> if<00:04:52.650> I<00:04:52.770> mean

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
say so you can kind of figure if I mean

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.530 
say so you can kind of figure if I mean
I<00:04:53.490> would<00:04:53.640> say<00:04:53.790> that<00:04:53.940> you<00:04:54.090> have<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.330> kind<00:04:54.480> of

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
I would say that you have to kind of

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.780 
I would say that you have to kind of
look<00:04:54.720> at<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:54.990> that<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.920> film<00:04:56.160> is<00:04:56.280> not<00:04:56.670> the

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
look at the that the film is not the

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.460 
look at the that the film is not the
same<00:04:57.000> way<00:04:57.150> as<00:04:57.210> you<00:04:57.390> would<00:04:57.480> look<00:04:57.600> at<00:04:57.750> you<00:04:58.110> know<00:04:58.230> a

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
same way as you would look at you know a

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.800 
same way as you would look at you know a
hundred<00:04:58.740> million<00:04:59.280> blockbuster<00:05:00.030> because<00:05:00.270> this

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
hundred million blockbuster because this

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.510 
hundred million blockbuster because this
it's<00:05:00.990> not<00:05:01.140> you<00:05:01.560> can't<00:05:01.800> really<00:05:01.950> compare<00:05:02.310> them

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
it's not you can't really compare them

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.070 
it's not you can't really compare them
but<00:05:03.300> it's<00:05:03.720> a<00:05:03.810> fun<00:05:04.020> film<00:05:05.180> if<00:05:06.180> you're<00:05:06.660> into<00:05:06.960> that

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
but it's a fun film if you're into that

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.990 
but it's a fun film if you're into that
sort<00:05:07.140> of<00:05:07.440> that<00:05:07.800> sub-genre<00:05:08.070> of<00:05:08.550> more<00:05:08.820> of<00:05:08.910> a

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
sort of that sub-genre of more of a

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.290 
sort of that sub-genre of more of a
thoughtful<00:05:09.900> heavy<00:05:10.200> going<00:05:10.560> kind<00:05:10.800> of<00:05:10.830> stuff<00:05:11.300> but

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
thoughtful heavy going kind of stuff but

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.600 
thoughtful heavy going kind of stuff but
to<00:05:12.480> me<00:05:12.630> it's<00:05:13.170> the<00:05:13.290> performance<00:05:13.770> is<00:05:14.010> especially

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610

so<00:05:51.350> certainly<00:05:52.350> not<00:05:52.470> for<00:05:52.650> everyone<00:05:52.890> if<00:05:53.190> you

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
so certainly not for everyone if you

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.670 
so certainly not for everyone if you
like<00:05:53.490> the<00:05:53.730> kind<00:05:53.880> of<00:05:53.970> slow<00:05:54.210> moving<00:05:54.530> films<00:05:55.530> I

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
like the kind of slow moving films I

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.620 
like the kind of slow moving films I
would<00:05:56.310> definitely<00:05:56.790> recommend<00:05:56.910> it<00:05:59.150> it<00:06:00.150> may<00:06:00.600> be

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
would definitely recommend it it may be

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.140 
would definitely recommend it it may be
a<00:06:00.810> little<00:06:00.930> bit<00:06:01.110> boring<00:06:01.320> I<00:06:01.770> think<00:06:01.919> for<00:06:02.430> the<00:06:02.940> more

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
a little bit boring I think for the more

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.040 
a little bit boring I think for the more
casual<00:06:03.660> movie<00:06:04.530> goer<00:06:04.760> so<00:06:05.760> it's<00:06:06.720> going<00:06:06.810> to<00:06:06.930> one

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
casual movie goer so it's going to one

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.310 
casual movie goer so it's going to one
I've<00:06:07.530> watched<00:06:08.040> it<00:06:08.130> a<00:06:08.280> couple<00:06:08.580> of<00:06:08.669> people<00:06:08.820> who

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
I've watched it a couple of people who

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.390 
I've watched it a couple of people who
who<00:06:10.320> are<00:06:10.350> like<00:06:10.620> that<00:06:10.800> and<00:06:10.860> then<00:06:10.979> they<00:06:11.250> weren't

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
who are like that and then they weren't

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.260 
who are like that and then they weren't
them<00:06:11.580> that<00:06:11.760> fast<00:06:12.080> so<00:06:13.080> in<00:06:14.010> that<00:06:14.669> respect<00:06:14.880> I'd

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
them that fast so in that respect I'd

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.840 
them that fast so in that respect I'd
probably<00:06:15.450> give<00:06:15.720> it<00:06:15.750> I<00:06:16.530> would<00:06:17.190> say<00:06:17.340> a<00:06:17.370> seven<00:06:17.729> out

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
probably give it I would say a seven out

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:26.210 
probably give it I would say a seven out
of<00:06:17.880> ten

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.280
