00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.360 
the half moon manicure so today I'm
going<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.440> show<00:00:07.529> you<00:00:07.589> how<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.830> get<00:00:07.980> it<00:00:08.069> at<00:00:08.160> home

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.980 

the<00:00:11.370> first<00:00:11.400> step<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.269> file<00:00:12.509> your<00:00:12.780> nails

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
the first step is to file your nails

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.110 
the first step is to file your nails
into<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.469> round<00:00:13.980> shape<00:00:14.190> because<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:14.969> going

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
into a round shape because this is going

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.609 
into a round shape because this is going
to<00:00:15.210> make<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.480> Halfmoon<00:00:15.690> look<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.289> lot<00:00:16.470> more

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
to make the Halfmoon look a lot more

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.680 
to make the Halfmoon look a lot more
exaggerated<00:00:17.310> but<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.150> don't<00:00:18.300> have<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.510> focus

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
exaggerated but you don't have to focus

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.080 
exaggerated but you don't have to focus
too<00:00:19.140> much<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.529> making<00:00:19.710> them<00:00:20.070> too<00:00:20.430> oval<00:00:20.850> just

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
too much on making them too oval just

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.580 
too much on making them too oval just
make<00:00:21.300> sure<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.660> edges<00:00:22.020> are<00:00:22.140> rounded<00:00:22.260> out

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
make sure that the edges are rounded out

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.170
