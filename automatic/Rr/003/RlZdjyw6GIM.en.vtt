to<00:02:48.720> new<00:02:48.959> heights<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.799> know<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.250> was<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.400> bit

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
to new heights you know and I was a bit

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.729 
to new heights you know and I was a bit
as<00:02:50.879> a<00:02:50.940> filmmaker<00:02:51.450> was<00:02:51.690> very<00:02:51.959> inspired<00:02:52.379> by<00:02:52.470> that

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
as a filmmaker was very inspired by that

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.179 
as a filmmaker was very inspired by that
so<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:52.980> thought<00:02:53.189> okay<00:02:53.549> as<00:02:53.730> cars<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.889> spy

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
so I thought okay as cars this a spy

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:57.530 
so I thought okay as cars this a spy
movie<00:02:56.370> could<00:02:56.670> be<00:02:56.790> really<00:02:57.209> fresh<00:02:57.510> and

automotive world that we love so much
and<00:05:56.349> start<00:05:56.949> digging<00:05:57.220> around<00:05:57.490> and<00:05:57.910> finding<00:05:58.330> the

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
and start digging around and finding the

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.080 
and start digging around and finding the
truisms<00:05:59.110> that<00:05:59.620> are<00:05:59.800> out<00:05:59.949> there<00:05:59.979> and<00:06:00.430> what<00:06:00.880> was

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
truisms that are out there and what was

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.270 
truisms that are out there and what was
interesting<00:06:01.449> and<00:06:01.780> seeing<00:06:02.139> sort<00:06:02.919> of<00:06:03.070> what's

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
interesting and seeing sort of what's

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.790 
interesting and seeing sort of what's
going<00:06:03.610> on<00:06:03.760> with<00:06:03.970> big<00:06:04.210> oil<00:06:04.449> alternative<00:06:05.440> fuels

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
going on with big oil alternative fuels

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.279 
going on with big oil alternative fuels
and<00:06:06.160> all<00:06:06.340> that<00:06:06.550> kind<00:06:06.880> of<00:06:07.000> I<00:06:07.300> don't<00:06:08.169> know<00:06:08.229> if

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.289 
and all that kind of I don't know if

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:10.050 
and all that kind of I don't know if
it's<00:06:08.410> a<00:06:08.530> battle<00:06:08.830> but<00:06:09.220> it<00:06:09.340> just<00:06:09.520> seems<00:06:09.849> like

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
it's a battle but it just seems like

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.689 
it's a battle but it just seems like
there's<00:06:10.389> there's<00:06:10.840> a<00:06:10.930> tension<00:06:11.380> there<00:06:11.650> and<00:06:12.639> I

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
there's there's a tension there and I

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:14.460 
there's there's a tension there and I
thought<00:06:12.880> this<00:06:13.180> could<00:06:13.449> be<00:06:13.510> cool<00:06:13.840> this<00:06:14.080> could<00:06:14.349> be

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
thought this could be cool this could be

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.529 
thought this could be cool this could be
right<00:06:14.800> so<00:06:15.190> it's<00:06:15.340> not<00:06:15.430> really<00:06:15.699> a<00:06:15.729> message<00:06:16.150> movie

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
right so it's not really a message movie

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:18.659 
right so it's not really a message movie
but<00:06:16.930> it's<00:06:17.080> just<00:06:17.199> pulling<00:06:17.740> from<00:06:17.979> what's<00:06:18.250> really

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
but it's just pulling from what's really

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.360 
but it's just pulling from what's really
out<00:06:18.699> there<00:06:19.060> and<00:06:19.240> then<00:06:20.039> coming<00:06:21.039> up<00:06:21.099> with<00:06:21.190> the

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
out there and then coming up with the

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.980 
out there and then coming up with the
idea<00:06:21.760> to<00:06:21.940> have<00:06:21.970> the<00:06:22.300> bad<00:06:22.539> guy<00:06:22.690> in<00:06:22.870> the<00:06:22.990> men

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
idea to have the bad guy in the men

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.670 
idea to have the bad guy in the men
be<00:06:24.990> the<00:06:25.530> lemon<00:06:26.099> cars<00:06:26.490> of<00:06:26.849> the<00:06:26.970> world<00:06:27.560> you<00:06:28.560> know

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
be the lemon cars of the world you know

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.619 
be the lemon cars of the world you know

the cars that everybody has turned their

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:33.469 
the cars that everybody has turned their
back<00:06:30.840> on<00:06:30.870> and<00:06:31.590> they<00:06:32.129> would<00:06:32.280> have<00:06:32.460> a<00:06:32.490> total<00:06:33.180> chip

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 
back on and they would have a total chip

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.930 
back on and they would have a total chip
on<00:06:33.659> their<00:06:33.810> shoulder<00:06:34.289> and<00:06:34.590> that's<00:06:35.340> what<00:06:35.610> was<00:06:35.699> so

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
had so much fun with that and it was a

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.740 
had so much fun with that and it was a
real<00:06:41.520> challenge<00:06:41.550> you<00:06:42.360> know<00:06:42.479> from<00:06:42.690> a

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
real challenge you know from a

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.469 
real challenge you know from a
storytelling<00:06:43.080> standpoint<00:06:43.819> -<00:06:44.819> we<00:06:45.120> kind<00:06:45.419> of

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 
storytelling standpoint - we kind of

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:46.850 
storytelling standpoint - we kind of
came<00:06:45.750> up<00:06:45.960> with<00:06:45.990> the<00:06:46.229> ending<00:06:46.530> and<00:06:46.620> I'm<00:06:46.710> not

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
came up with the ending and I'm not

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.680 
came up with the ending and I'm not
gonna<00:06:46.979> say<00:06:47.159> what<00:06:47.310> the<00:06:47.430> ending<00:06:47.699> is<00:06:47.849> you<00:06:48.569> know

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
gonna say what the ending is you know

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:49.969 
gonna say what the ending is you know
because<00:06:48.900> you<00:06:48.990> have<00:06:49.080> to<00:06:49.169> go<00:06:49.289> see<00:06:49.440> the<00:06:49.530> movie<00:06:49.560> but

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.530 
the ending became something we came up

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.189 
the ending became something we came up
with<00:06:52.680> fairly<00:06:53.159> early<00:06:53.340> on<00:06:53.520> and<00:06:53.879> go<00:06:54.030> okay<00:06:54.509> and<00:06:54.900> we

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:09.830 
you know when you get this the turn at
the<00:07:08.190> end<00:07:08.220> it's<00:07:08.639> like<00:07:08.759> oh<00:07:09.090> I<00:07:09.240> didn't<00:07:09.690> see<00:07:09.810> that
