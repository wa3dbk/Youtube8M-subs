00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
narrow I'm going to go ahead and Stitch

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.310 
narrow I'm going to go ahead and Stitch
the<00:00:55.710> first<00:00:56.010> side<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.280> my<00:00:56.519> napkin<00:00:57.050> I'm<00:00:58.050> using

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the first side of my napkin I'm using

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.279 
the first side of my napkin I'm using
linen<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.160> use<00:00:59.280> whatever<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.730> like<00:00:59.760> and

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
linen you can use whatever you like and

linen you can use whatever you like and
I<00:01:01.289> want<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.559> make<00:01:01.679> sure<00:01:01.710> especially<00:01:02.640> with

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
I want to make sure especially with

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.430 
I want to make sure especially with
linen<00:01:03.179> because<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.719> gets<00:01:03.899> lots<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.230> little

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
linen because it gets lots of little

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.350 
linen because it gets lots of little
fibers<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.010> hang<00:01:05.160> off<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.550> edge<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:06.000> I

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
fibers that hang off of the edge that I

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.850 
fibers that hang off of the edge that I
just<00:01:06.600> barely<00:01:07.170> trim<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.860> edge<00:01:08.070> as<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.400> sew<00:01:08.790> it

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
just barely trim that edge as I sew it

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.730 
just barely trim that edge as I sew it
put<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.950> under<00:01:11.160> my<00:01:11.190> foot

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.289 

you'll<00:01:17.740> see<00:01:17.950> that<00:01:18.040> it<00:01:18.159> stitches<00:01:18.369> very<00:01:18.790> slowly

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
you'll see that it stitches very slowly

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:28.460 
you'll see that it stitches very slowly
because<00:01:19.630> we're<00:01:19.960> making<00:01:20.200> a<00:01:20.259> very<00:01:20.470> tight<00:01:20.799> stitch

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.630 

now<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.530> great<00:01:29.800> thing<00:01:29.830> about<00:01:30.130> using<00:01:30.400> a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
now the great thing about using a

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.490 
now the great thing about using a
swollen<00:01:30.910> nylon<00:01:31.360> is<00:01:31.540> you<00:01:31.990> can<00:01:32.140> see<00:01:32.260> that<00:01:32.380> the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
swollen nylon is you can see that the

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.010 
swollen nylon is you can see that the
stitch<00:01:32.740> is<00:01:32.920> really<00:01:33.460> fulfilled<00:01:34.180> in<00:01:34.540> so<00:01:34.840> it's

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
stitch is really fulfilled in so it's

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:48.980 
stitch is really fulfilled in so it's
very<00:01:35.380> beautiful

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.030 

when<00:01:49.990> you<00:01:50.080> get<00:01:50.200> towards<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.560> end<00:01:50.650> of<00:01:50.920> your

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
when you get towards the end of your

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.770 
when you get towards the end of your
napkin<00:01:51.490> go<00:01:51.729> ahead<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:51.970> leave<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.119> long<00:01:52.390> thread

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
napkin go ahead and leave a long thread

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.330 
napkin go ahead and leave a long thread
tail<00:01:53.020> so<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.290> have<00:01:53.380> something<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.740> hold<00:01:53.890> on<00:01:54.100> to

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
tail so you have something to hold on to

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:02.070 
tail so you have something to hold on to
why<00:01:54.430> we<00:01:54.580> start<00:01:54.820> on<00:01:54.909> the<00:01:55.000> next<00:01:55.150> side<00:02:00.810> now<00:02:01.810> here's

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
why we start on the next side now here's

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.990 
why we start on the next side now here's
a<00:02:02.140> little<00:02:02.290> secret<00:02:02.649> it's<00:02:02.890> called<00:02:03.220> thread<00:02:03.640> chain

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
a little secret it's called thread chain

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.930 
a little secret it's called thread chain
so<00:02:04.899> I<00:02:05.259> have<00:02:05.500> this<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:06.190> I'm<00:02:06.549> going<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:06.729> do<00:02:06.909> a

so I have this and I'm going to do a

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.460 
so I have this and I'm going to do a
little<00:02:07.270> bit<00:02:07.360> of<00:02:07.450> chain<00:02:07.750> stitching<00:02:08.289> where<00:02:08.440> I

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
little bit of chain stitching where I

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.590 
little bit of chain stitching where I
don't<00:02:08.649> even<00:02:08.830> have<00:02:09.069> to<00:02:09.190> cut<00:02:09.399> this<00:02:09.610> because<00:02:10.300> I'm

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
don't even have to cut this because I'm

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.880 
don't even have to cut this because I'm
just<00:02:10.750> going<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:10.929> go<00:02:11.050> right<00:02:11.080> down<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.650> next

just going to go right down the next

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.040 
just going to go right down the next
side<00:02:12.100> I<00:02:12.400> can<00:02:12.910> just<00:02:13.060> bring<00:02:13.330> this<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.870> front

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
side I can just bring this to the front

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.580

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
something to look for right here before

something to look for right here before
my<00:02:29.560> linen<00:02:30.130> hits<00:02:30.430> my<00:02:30.670> needle<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.239> whether<00:02:31.810> or

my linen hits my needle is whether or

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.680 
my linen hits my needle is whether or

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
not the fabric is sort of stuck near me

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.809 
not the fabric is sort of stuck near me
and<00:02:34.930> it's<00:02:35.140> not<00:02:35.350> you<00:02:36.010> know<00:02:36.100> feeding<00:02:36.430> under

and it's not you know feeding under

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.009 
and it's not you know feeding under
correctly<00:02:37.180> so<00:02:37.360> I'm<00:02:37.450> going<00:02:37.569> to<00:02:37.600> get<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.780> little

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
correctly so I'm going to get a little

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.780 
correctly so I'm going to get a little
bit<00:02:38.230> closer<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.769> the<00:02:38.890> needle<00:02:41.549> and<00:02:42.549> then<00:02:42.670> I'm

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
bit closer to the needle and then I'm

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.400 
bit closer to the needle and then I'm
going<00:02:42.910> to<00:02:42.970> stop<00:02:43.239> I'm<00:02:43.480> going<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.660> lift<00:02:43.840> my<00:02:44.140> foot

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
going to stop I'm going to lift my foot

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.830 
going to stop I'm going to lift my foot
just<00:02:44.680> ever<00:02:45.069> so<00:02:45.340> slightly<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.940> kind<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.510> let<00:02:46.690> the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
just ever so slightly to kind of let the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:56.130 
just ever so slightly to kind of let the
fabric<00:02:47.080> just<00:02:47.530> sort<00:02:47.709> of<00:02:47.769> reshift

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.260 

so<00:02:57.140> that<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.319> can<00:02:57.500> get<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.680> much<00:02:57.950> nicer<00:02:58.430> corner<00:02:59.090> if

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
so that I can get a much nicer corner if

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.600 
so that I can get a much nicer corner if
i<00:02:59.780> hadn´t<00:03:00.200> reshift<00:03:00.770> AddThis

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
i hadn´t reshift AddThis

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.430 
i hadn´t reshift AddThis
underneath<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.209> foot<00:03:02.450> we<00:03:02.959> have<00:03:02.990> a<00:03:03.170> very

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
underneath the foot we have a very

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.160 
underneath the foot we have a very
pointed<00:03:03.830> corner<00:03:04.370> or<00:03:04.550> you'll<00:03:05.300> see<00:03:05.569> that<00:03:05.810> the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
pointed corner or you'll see that the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.110 
pointed corner or you'll see that the
stitch<00:03:06.470> won't<00:03:06.770> actually<00:03:06.980> catch<00:03:07.490> on<00:03:07.819> the<00:03:07.970> edge

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
stitch won't actually catch on the edge

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.000 
stitch won't actually catch on the edge
of<00:03:08.270> the<00:03:08.390> fabric<00:03:08.600> so<00:03:09.230> it's<00:03:09.350> really<00:03:09.650> good<00:03:09.830> to

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
of the fabric so it's really good to

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.559 
of the fabric so it's really good to
readjust<00:03:10.220> that

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.000 

so<00:03:17.569> once<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.870> finish<00:03:18.080> going<00:03:18.530> down<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.800> side

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
so once you finish going down the side

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.589 
so once you finish going down the side
of<00:03:19.040> your<00:03:19.160> napkin<00:03:19.610> you<00:03:19.790> need<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.120> finish<00:03:20.300> that

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
of your napkin you need to finish that

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.990 
of your napkin you need to finish that
little<00:03:20.810> edge<00:03:21.160> so<00:03:22.160> I<00:03:22.190> have<00:03:22.430> something<00:03:22.670> here

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
little edge so I have something here

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.690 
little edge so I have something here
called<00:03:23.030> fray<00:03:23.569> check<00:03:23.599> I<00:03:24.110> love<00:03:24.980> this<00:03:25.220> stuff<00:03:25.489> it's

called fray check I love this stuff it's

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.420

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
is enough it'll really soak into that

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.000 
is enough it'll really soak into that
wooly<00:03:34.550> nylon<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.930> then<00:03:36.319> I<00:03:36.380> can<00:03:36.560> just<00:03:36.680> clip

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
wooly nylon and then I can just clip

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
that you know you'll get kind of a hard

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.820 
that you know you'll get kind of a hard
corner<00:03:41.840> if<00:03:41.989> you<00:03:42.019> want<00:03:42.170> it<00:03:42.319> to<00:03:42.410> stay<00:03:42.620> nice<00:03:42.769> and

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
corner if you want it to stay nice and

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
soft why the fray check is still wet you

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.890 
soft why the fray check is still wet you
can<00:03:46.340> take<00:03:46.519> it<00:03:46.610> over<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.880> iron<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.390> steam<00:03:47.720> it

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
can take it over the iron and steam it

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.690 
can take it over the iron and steam it
and<00:03:48.050> that'll<00:03:48.260> keep<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:48.680> from<00:03:49.190> being<00:03:49.370> just<00:03:49.459> a

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
and that'll keep it from being just a

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:57.580 
and that'll keep it from being just a
little<00:03:49.910> too<00:03:50.060> hard<00:03:50.269> on<00:03:50.390> the<00:03:50.510> corner<00:03:56.380> so<00:03:57.380> here's

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590
