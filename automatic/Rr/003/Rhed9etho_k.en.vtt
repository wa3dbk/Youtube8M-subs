00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.220

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.699
 So I arrived after the times 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.039
 on the full block on the highway 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.740
 got out and then a car 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.050
 He caught me somewhere 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.610
 a lot has happened and yes 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.290

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.360
 and my performance today is me 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.040
 of course not very happy dimitrij 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.260
 Ovtcharov had to be in the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.840
 beaten in the first round give the strains 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.579
 on the day and after the team wm where he 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.190
 together with Timo boll won silver 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.899
 were obviously too big but the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.910
 almost 1,500 spectators nevertheless saw big ones 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.219
 table tennis for example from baxi 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.530
 Chinese has been playing in the country for years 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.400
 Bundesliga and he has in his Dresden 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.780
 her personal fan is Siegfried oms 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.810
 passionate table tennis player 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.960
 with 75 years unnoticed at the champions 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:18.650
 Cup was a referee 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:22.030
 I'm very glad that I invited 76 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.759
 if you and your career 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.610
 highlight for me a world full of 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.369
 but that was the racket 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.290
 can check times street consumerist world what 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.110
 we proved that we were victorious like tom 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.330
 plays still active with the third 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.890
 team of motor wilsdruff he is 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.060
 recently in the district class 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.009
 ascended 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.350
 there comes the top tournament in dresden 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.300
 just right because even in the mature 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.280
 table tennis age you can get that 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.080
 or others still look 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.670
 I can my eyes proposals held 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.310
 See what we make eyeballs 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.660
 to hold advice 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.840
 what one does not have with us, so 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.310
 but is still on complaint 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.979
 but who made me very much off 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.320
 interested that is what is so well 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.320
 jÃ¼rgen also has a good impact 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.900
 Although he is 48 years old 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.819
 table tennis oldie but class has 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.040
 Swede hardly lost anything 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.980
 he was in the final in dresden 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.799
 Opponents there was maxi the tip of the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.570
 Experts of large banks win and 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.670
 Siegfried rom was right 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.670
 in five sets won banks it the game 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.770
 and thus also the dresdner tournament 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.750
 recognition and respect 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.270
 ups for it also from the German number 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.860
 1 that was really fantastic games 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.230
 I own the first tournament in five 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.930
 years have become unbelievable and even 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.750
 not of course the darling wins and 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.120
 world stars to touch for you prix 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.400
 teams, the champion tour was a big one 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.800
 experience like most others in the 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.750

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.260

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.300
 level
