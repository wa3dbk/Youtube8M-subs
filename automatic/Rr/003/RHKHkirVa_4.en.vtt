 it was hoping to jump more sooner 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.309
 and then they are always there when you are 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.989

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.449
 Why did I wear a hat? 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.610

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:14.970
 it was then only bahnsport squarepants 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:18.200
 because it makes sense so much 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.200
 I do in my life 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.920
 Do you like brunettes or blond women 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.900
 Well, actually, my hair color is 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.700
 pretty much no matter if the girl is cute 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.020
 then everything is okay but if you are 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.840
 I would say so already 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.579
 he is so brunette as I said I notice 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.439
 pretty much no matter if I am myself 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.850
 then you have to decide 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.630
 three things on a lonely island 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.000

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.479
 a straw hat and this epic mario 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.780

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.079

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.259

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.970

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.569

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.470

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.880

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.520

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.380
 wake up so to speak but one still dreams 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.239
 a bit and because I have so much black 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.040
 Ops 2 at the time showed thought 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.940

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.160
 throwing back in my dream of course 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.420
 and the whole thing changed then 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.850
 that I have my baker against the wall 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.620
 Throwing what's on the repulsive 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.390
 with women now just introduce yourself 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.489
 you are in the street and look at the 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.800
 Bus stop a beautiful woman 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.150
 she is small she is petite she sweet 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.069
 is exactly my type 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.780
 she is quite innocent and waits 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.610
 on the bus and you think okay I go 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.780
 times back and talk, and on the way to 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.760
 She suddenly turns her attention to hers 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.380
 pocket move cream and rummage one 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.110

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.940
 on 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.709
 without fun people I generally think 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.570
 Smoking is shit and looks 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.660
 shit out of course, even in men 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.900
 but somehow it gets so unattractive 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.820
 so nasty if women do not smoke 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.260
 always really cute girl on the 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.120
 street then the right time 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.980
 Rescuer out and then on the make 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.060

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.060

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.390

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.230

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.250
