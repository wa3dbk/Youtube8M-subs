 pin years in Togo and worst in Benin 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.900

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.400
 how I already started my sauce 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.199
 tomato but not actually doing 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.350
 regularize the tomato sauce 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.510
 so that's it's a I split the 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.429
 tomato sauce from my fish and if you 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.379
