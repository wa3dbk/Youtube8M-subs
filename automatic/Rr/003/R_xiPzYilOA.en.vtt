00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
surprised that these plates are a little

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.330 
surprised that these plates are a little
bit<00:01:08.930> bigger<00:01:09.670> than<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.729> konad<00:01:11.660> plates<00:01:12.190> this<00:01:13.190> so

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
bit bigger than the konad plates this so

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.279 
bit bigger than the konad plates this so
this<00:01:13.490> is<00:01:13.670> kind<00:01:13.910> of<00:01:13.940> standard<00:01:14.450> size<00:01:14.780> stamping

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
this is kind of standard size stamping

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.199 
this is kind of standard size stamping
plate<00:01:15.500> that<00:01:15.649> you've<00:01:15.770> seen<00:01:15.979> before<00:01:16.160> these<00:01:17.000> are

00:01:17.199 --> 00:01:17.209 
plate that you've seen before these are

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:19.180 
plate that you've seen before these are
a<00:01:17.240> little<00:01:17.390> bit<00:01:17.630> bigger<00:01:17.840> I'm<00:01:18.500> assuming<00:01:19.069> that

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
a little bit bigger I'm assuming that

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.680 
a little bit bigger I'm assuming that
they<00:01:19.310> did<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:19.520> so<00:01:20.119> that<00:01:20.149> they<00:01:20.360> can<00:01:20.479> make<00:01:20.600> the

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
they did that so that they can make the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.749 
they did that so that they can make the
images<00:01:21.020> a<00:01:21.080> little<00:01:21.350> bit<00:01:21.470> bigger<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:21.920> I<00:01:22.310> think

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
images a little bit bigger and I think

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.100 
images a little bit bigger and I think
that's<00:01:22.910> great<00:01:23.060> news<00:01:23.360> because<00:01:23.660> a<00:01:23.840> lot<00:01:24.080> of
