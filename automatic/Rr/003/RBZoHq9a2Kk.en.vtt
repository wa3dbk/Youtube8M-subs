liquid and sometimes there's too little

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.350 
liquid and sometimes there's too little
and<00:01:11.189> there's<00:01:11.340> different<00:01:11.520> types<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:12.060> liquid

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
floating around in as well so that

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.050 
floating around in as well so that
complicates<00:01:13.979> things<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.640> only<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:14.939> two

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
complicates things but I only have two

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.520 
complicates things but I only have two
colors<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.750> I'm<00:01:15.810> not<00:01:15.960> gonna<00:01:16.110> when<00:01:16.409> these

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
colors so I'm not gonna when these

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.200 
colors so I'm not gonna when these
little<00:01:16.680> bits<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.189> parts<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> brain<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:18.150> a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
little bits of parts of the brain for a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.609 
little bits of parts of the brain for a
lot<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.630> different<00:01:18.840> reasons<00:01:19.170> don't

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
lot of different reasons don't

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.740 
lot of different reasons don't
communicate<00:01:19.979> well<00:01:20.369> with<00:01:20.430> each<00:01:20.700> other<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.479> get

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
communicate well with each other you get

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.600 
communicate well with each other you get
crazy<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:23.570> know<00:01:25.159> some<00:01:26.159> people<00:01:26.460> are<00:01:26.549> actually

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
crazy you know some people are actually

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.060 
crazy you know some people are actually
crazy<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.780> know<00:01:27.900> more<00:01:28.200> often<00:01:28.500> than<00:01:28.650> not<00:01:28.680> it's

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
crazy you know more often than not it's

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.100 
crazy you know more often than not it's
their<00:01:29.280> brain<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.270> wrong<00:01:30.479> chemical

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
their brain is the wrong chemical

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.920 
their brain is the wrong chemical
balance<00:01:31.880> situation<00:01:32.880> but<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.150> even<00:01:33.299> actually

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
balance situation but it's even actually

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.210 
balance situation but it's even actually
more<00:01:34.229> complicated<00:01:34.920> than<00:01:35.009> that

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
more complicated than that

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.010 
more complicated than that
because<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.700> not<00:01:35.880> even<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.360> about<00:01:36.869> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
because it's not even just about the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.630 
because it's not even just about the
chemicals<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.530> are<00:01:37.710> balanced<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.340> your

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
chemicals that are balanced in your

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.700 
chemicals that are balanced in your
brain<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.360> how<00:01:39.570> these<00:01:39.810> circuit<00:01:40.229> boards<00:01:40.409> are

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
brain it's how these circuit boards are

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.039 
brain it's how these circuit boards are
interacting<00:01:41.310> with<00:01:41.430> each<00:01:41.549> other<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.390> why<00:01:42.899> don't

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
interacting with each other so why don't

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.190 
interacting with each other so why don't
we<00:01:43.079> learned<00:01:43.290> ah

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200

university school medicines website i've
decided<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.479> doctors<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:53.329> psychologists

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
decided that doctors and psychologists

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.330 
decided that doctors and psychologists
and<00:01:54.570> people<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.079> study<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> brain<00:01:55.680> don't

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
and people that study the brain don't

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.249 
and people that study the brain don't
really<00:01:56.759> know<00:01:56.969> what's<00:01:57.240> going<00:01:57.479> on<00:01:57.719> because

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
really know what's going on because

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.800 
really know what's going on because
there's<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:58.950> much<00:01:59.280> going<00:01:59.610> on<00:01:59.820> it's<00:02:00.450> really

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
there's so much going on it's really

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.580 
there's so much going on it's really
hard<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.200> tell<00:02:01.619> what's<00:02:02.009> going<00:02:02.969> on<00:02:03.119> at<00:02:03.810> all<00:02:03.990> it's

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
hard to tell what's going on at all it's

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.719 
hard to tell what's going on at all it's
really<00:02:04.770> just<00:02:05.009> kind<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.399> guessing<00:02:05.700> game

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
really just kind of a guessing game

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.089 
really just kind of a guessing game
where<00:02:06.210> they<00:02:06.390> put<00:02:06.930> their<00:02:07.079> fingers<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.799> probes

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
where they put their fingers and probes

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.430 
where they put their fingers and probes
into<00:02:08.550> different<00:02:09.090> mices<00:02:09.539> heads<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.110> go<00:02:10.229> oh

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
into different mices heads and go oh

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.170 
into different mices heads and go oh
look<00:02:10.890> he's<00:02:11.069> looking<00:02:11.370> he<00:02:11.430> likes<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.849> piece<00:02:12.030> of

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
look he's looking he likes that piece of

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.530 
look he's looking he likes that piece of
cheese<00:02:12.390> look<00:02:12.780> at<00:02:12.900> him<00:02:13.020> he's<00:02:13.260> going<00:02:13.770> after<00:02:14.010> that

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
cheese look at him he's going after that

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.780 
cheese look at him he's going after that
cheese<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:15.379> know<00:02:15.500> then<00:02:15.709> again<00:02:16.000> maybe<00:02:17.000> he<00:02:17.599> just

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
cheese you know then again maybe he just

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.039 
cheese you know then again maybe he just
thinks<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.909> cheese<00:02:20.120> is<00:02:20.269> a<00:02:20.299> butterfly<00:02:20.780> and

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
thinks the cheese is a butterfly and

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.599 
thinks the cheese is a butterfly and
he's<00:02:21.170> ruling<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.590> butterflies<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.250> mean<00:02:22.489> it's

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:22.609 
he's ruling the butterflies I mean it's

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.819 
he's ruling the butterflies I mean it's
really<00:02:23.000> hard<00:02:23.329> to<00:02:23.510> tell<00:02:23.959> what's<00:02:24.379> going<00:02:24.590> on<00:02:24.769> in

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
really hard to tell what's going on in

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.270 
really hard to tell what's going on in
their<00:02:25.099> final<00:02:25.969> summation<00:02:26.540> two<00:02:26.989> parts<00:02:27.650> reality

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
their final summation two parts reality

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.780 
their final summation two parts reality
equals<00:02:29.030> one<00:02:29.390> part<00:02:29.959> crazy<00:02:30.439> but<00:02:30.980> basically<00:02:31.430> the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
equals one part crazy but basically the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.119 
equals one part crazy but basically the
