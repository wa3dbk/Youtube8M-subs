00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:13.990
 here I will compare two microphones the 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.990
 3 beringer condenser 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.010
 the microphone 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.670
 it was a dynamic microphone that took him out 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.070
 the 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.370
 the capsule and I put a condenser and 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:33.320
 it can also be fed with phantom 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:36.570
 first let's try the microphone of 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.400
 p 3c 3 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.400
 hello 1 2 3 4 5 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.829
 this is the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.829
 3 ago 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.910
 that's how this microphone is playing 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.000
 listening 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.710
 I find that you listen super good 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 I'm doing the recording for later 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.510
 compare the sound 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.510
 Y 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.080
 now I will use 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.490
 this is the other microphone also of 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.340
 capacitor that is from a capsule taken out 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.950
 of a 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.310
 a capacitor taken from a telephone 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.310
 mobile 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:31.500
 it shows the difference 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:33.840
 this is more more serious 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.650
 but updating a bit can get to 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.650
 have good sound 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.350
 I think it would be good for a radio 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.350
 I'm going to put some music 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.729
 buy it 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.870
 audio levels 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.159
 where they come together 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.030
 the sounds 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:11.530
 this is the microphone 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.530
 armed and this is the other 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.880
 the c3 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.880
 from berlinger 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.459
 I imagine that much more should be heard 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.459
 Clear 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.920
 that's all 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.020
 are described 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.540
 why
