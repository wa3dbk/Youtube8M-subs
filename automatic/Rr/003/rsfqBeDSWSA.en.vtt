00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:06.670
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:10.240
 video for des android point 2 today os 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.580
 we want to present something a little visual 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.129
 from inside the blog and it's because it's the 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.039
 second that we are going to present is a book 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.869
 of the energy system brand but in this 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.509
 case has a special place inside 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.769
 from within our YouTube channel and 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.779
 is that we succeed in explaining it more than 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:28.689
 great for the reason you are today with 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.749
 us strive together to naked eye 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.300
 is the packaging is that there is always 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.390
 he presents his products to us at least 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.110
 lately both in smartphones and in 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.310
 tablets and others 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:46.510
 well let's see what the box has 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.510
 it's the important thing 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:59.120
 and well, we have what is the 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.120
 device the ereader is this from here 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.980
 perfect a river with ink screen 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.280
 electronics with a diagonal of 6 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.500
 inches 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.409
 we have physical area button until both 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.000
 lateral suspicions that point towards the 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.310
 left and two to the right that we 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.430
 They are good for lowering the volume or 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.810
 to get between the different pages 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.050
 be and here we have a button 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.780
 Reload the browser or for good 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.140
 when we meditate and a button to 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.080
 return to the main screen of the 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.730
 empty we found ourselves below a 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.060
 extension for sd lock 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.360
 because he is looking for a capacity of 8 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.610
 gigas remain free after the system 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.440
 about 5 gigas and a half that I find more 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.230
 that enough for an e-book but good 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.290
 if you are going to put music or photos what 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.870
 be good so you can always expand it 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.710
 up to 64 gigs through the 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:04.950
 expansion by micro sd for the connector 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.320
 microUSB for charging transmission 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.850
 data to the device thing that does not 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.320
 it's fine because it's a cable like 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.620
 our smartphone we do not have why 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.990
 travel with another shipper and with decision 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.520
 for mini jack for headphones button 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.910
 on and this what you see here is a 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.280
 led indicator that tells us if green 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.530
 if it is charging if it is not charging 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.700
 things that we like about this first 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.940
 which is designed so that it does not have 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.780
 reflex is completely matte both in 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.100
 the frame some plastics with six 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.130
 plastic but is coated with a 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.160
 kind of rubber that makes it matte and 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.560
 before this is very nice very soft and 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.569
 it does not slide 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:52.980
 and then a big screen 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:52.980
 electronic ink that is anti-glare 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.000
 well we turned on the device and what 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.230
 we are good 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.840
 it comes with 1500 titles inside with 1500 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.000
 books so you can prefectures 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.590
 for a long time but good yes it is 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.080
 true that are the classic titles well 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.680
 things on the screen well then 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.900
 As I told you, it's 6 inches with 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.470
 high electronic ink technology 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.910
 definition is valid and also has 16 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.610
 Grays levels 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.680
 if it comes well any cover that with 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.780
 this one that is a picture looks pretty good 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.260
 vale has 16 warning levels with what 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.550
 which is pretty pretty good guys 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.980
 of files that they support with those that 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.180
 almost all the ebooks as txt pdf 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.090
 is ebooks html mobile and good then well 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.070
 like the vast majority of 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.550
 devices supports mp3 supports one 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:55.480
 It supports egg for audio themes and then 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:59.349
 logically jpg is 9 p is guix and png 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.379
 the theme of the battery images 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.690
 Well, according to the manufacturer 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.670
 well they are 2800 milliamps and according to us 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.769
 says manufacturer as I said yes 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.129
 we disable the wifi we can have up to 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.230
 two months of unedited battery 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.790
 load the ebook because we do not 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.609
 commented but has wifi connectivity 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.290
 that you have the indicator where I am 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.240
 recording comes a little bit so I have 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.950
 at home but not enough to 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.740
 show you 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.990
 and has support for adobe spill by 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.200
 the issue of licenses and pdfs 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.900
 others and then we go to the aspects that 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.520
 What we liked most is worth of this 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.830
 ebook and for the reason that is today with 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.420
 we dual-core processor to a 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.920
 gigahertz with which makes it 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.550
 pretty fast when it comes to transit 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.830
 between screens and others in a 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.330
 Need to display 212 points per 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.390
 inch so it also gives us 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:56.100
 pretty definition 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:05:00.070
 another important task and it is that it is a 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.610
 that the second thing that has most 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.830
 liked is that the screen is 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.860
 backlit does not come to appreciate 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.750
 but now it lights up 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.789
 with which we will be able to read in 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.110
 low light conditions without disturbing 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.539
 nobody and without having to have 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.449
 lamp on the table lit without anything 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.280
 that's because the screen itself lights up 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.050
 remember is electronic ink is not gt 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.810
 for which it is a backlight not 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.719
 is going to cancer our list is worth and the 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.270
 second and most important point of this and 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:32.189
 is that the system by the operative that 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.259
 runs beneath it is a system 

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:38.069
 operative android concretely its 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:40.229
 version 4.2 is the one that allows us good 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:43.979
 Well, I already described here, I have some 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:46.259
 icons that are gmail and chrome vale 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:49.169
 with which I have applications for 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.400
 browsing and my gmail that's not just that 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.870
 is that you can have any application 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:58.470
 of android is still installed on me 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:06:00.960
 in my fear I have a walk drive I have 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.510
 I do not know what I meditate but the good 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.070
 logically I have the play store for 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.350
 keep being able to install myself in the 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:10.740
 application that I want to have inside 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.270
 my ego at the end is almost almost how it is used 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.180
 a tablet but with van places has a 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:18.120
 ips screen we are used to a 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:21.020
 tea gt1 access whatever we have a 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.820
 tablet with electronic ink screen 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:27.180
 ok and that today I loved it because 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.280
 because it is no longer a new one as such 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.900
 It's still an e-book because I can read 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.730
 my books tires me I have all the 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.740
 Advantages of having an ebook 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:37.710
 but also I can have spotify I can 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:40.770
 have world drive I can have gmail 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:43.560
 I can have my facebook twitter what 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.960
 is it ok you can have any of those 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.740
 applications installed and via wifi is 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.850
 always informed with my ebook 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.250
 with respect to the weight that had 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:56.580
 commented nothing less than light with 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:59.100
 so few that it is very heavy is this 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.170
 well well and another something else aspect 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.810
 important that I had passed by 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.730
 complete the multitouch screen is worth not 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.290
 to notice that I have not told you before 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.270
 you are watching the whole screen we 

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:12.480
 I had said is very direct and allow me 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.280
 make clamp gestures worth and others spend 

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.440
 the pages touching the screen without 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.480
 he has to touch a button it's good that 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.830
 that 's right they are a little bit a 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.390
 important aspect for example that I 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:24.150
 I really like that I can have my account 

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:26.970
 of drive I do not have my books or my 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.680
 pdf that what you need to have from here 

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.330
 download them well I have to start 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.860
 read it about how is the case then this one 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.860
 stay non- stop 

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:38.960
 that is to say it is the book I have 

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:42.169
 downloaded from 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.300
 from the drive from google drive so 

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:48.759
 which is a pretty cool solution for 

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.759
 have to download them 

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.150
 without having to have the physics 

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:58.960
 well said this 

00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:01.960
 this is all about the energy system 

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.850
 and I hope you liked the video if 

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.919
 it is like this to share it in your networks 

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:08.199
 social and with your friends and give 

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:11.460
 I like it on youtube see you in the 

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:11.460
 next video until always
