00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
away get that little step in there I

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.560 
away get that little step in there I
mean<00:01:17.220> there'll<00:01:17.340> be<00:01:17.369> gravel<00:01:17.880> around<00:01:17.970> covering

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
mean there'll be gravel around covering

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
the fact that it was sanded to fit the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.890 
the fact that it was sanded to fit the
waterfall<00:01:26.700> but<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.030> kind<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.390> wanted<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.689> get

gravel and debris so I just want to get

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.160 
gravel and debris so I just want to get
this<00:02:25.080> tough<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.270> bit<00:02:27.480> better<00:02:27.720> than<00:02:28.020> this

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
this tough it in a bit better than this

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.370 
this tough it in a bit better than this
one<00:02:28.410> we'll<00:02:28.590> just<00:02:28.620> tuck<00:02:29.810> nicely<00:02:30.810> underneath

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
one we'll just tuck nicely underneath

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.630 
one we'll just tuck nicely underneath
there<00:02:31.650> like<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:34.010> yeah<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.040> think<00:02:35.400> that'll

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
there like that yeah I think that'll

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:51.740 
there like that yeah I think that'll
work<00:02:36.410> they'll<00:02:37.410> work<00:02:37.590> really<00:02:37.830> good

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.030 

stop<00:02:52.750> playing<00:02:53.170> around<00:02:53.319> with<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.650> couple<00:02:53.920> more

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
stop playing around with a couple more

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.190 
stop playing around with a couple more
rocks<00:02:54.629> and<00:02:55.629> I<00:02:55.900> like<00:02:56.109> to<00:02:57.659> stick<00:02:58.659> that<00:02:58.840> one<00:02:59.079> in

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
rocks and I like to stick that one in

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.550 
rocks and I like to stick that one in
there<00:02:59.349> I<00:03:00.810> think<00:03:01.810> that<00:03:02.019> would<00:03:02.140> work<00:03:02.170> pretty

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
there I think that would work pretty

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:10.430 
there I think that would work pretty
well

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.880 

Shh<00:03:11.150> this<00:03:12.150> one<00:03:12.360> here<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:12.690> would<00:03:12.900> fit<00:03:13.170> nice<00:03:13.530> no

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
Shh this one here that would fit nice no

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.570 
Shh this one here that would fit nice no
get<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.100> little<00:03:14.370> bit<00:03:14.490> of<00:03:14.550> a<00:03:14.640> gap<00:03:14.940> in<00:03:15.210> here<00:03:16.580> to

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
get a little bit of a gap in here to

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.520 
get a little bit of a gap in here to
fill<00:03:17.790> up<00:03:19.160> so<00:03:20.160> maybe<00:03:21.710> you<00:03:22.710> can<00:03:22.890> just<00:03:22.920> take<00:03:23.340> a

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
fill up so maybe you can just take a

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.330 
fill up so maybe you can just take a
little<00:03:25.530> piece<00:03:25.890> break<00:03:26.550> off<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.790> small<00:03:27.210> piece<00:03:28.340> and

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
little piece break off a small piece and

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.280 
little piece break off a small piece and
fit<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:29.850> in<00:03:29.970> there<00:03:34.070> so<00:03:35.070> I<00:03:35.100> can<00:03:35.130> find<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:35.700> right

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
fit it in there so I can find the right

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.660 
fit it in there so I can find the right
see<00:03:37.290> if<00:03:37.350> your<00:03:37.470> castings<00:03:37.980> break<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.550> can

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670
