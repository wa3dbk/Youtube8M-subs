00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.179
 talking about our gaming laptops 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.800
 the ruler is represented by the following 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.369
 jeep jeeps crash segments with jd ndp and 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.410
 we have 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.990
 entry level gaming laptops here 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.420
 actually just one of them here 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.279
 presented here is used in 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.179
 mainly 840 graphics 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.780
 This is for those who have just decided for themselves. 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.239
 try that kind of gaming laptop and 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.700
 even on 840 graphics he can play already 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.219
 more or less decent games if he is for 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.450
 if the buyer wants he can 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.110
 deliver here ssd disk besides already soon 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.890
 disk to speed up the system 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.860
 accordingly there is all that 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.420
 necessary for the gamer matte screen 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.489
 comfortable steelseries keyboard 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.149
 that's good enough 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.489
 performance and cooling systems 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.619
 move on to the next series of series j &amp; j this 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.710
 series where mostly we have going on 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.650
 most of our sales she is the most 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.720
 popular here we can see the most 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.940
 little 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.840
 the smallest sized notebook 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.240
 virginia series 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.680
 the same e40 respectively here already 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:25.070
 There is 850 graphics as well as I remember 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.670
 You can put 860 graphics processors and 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.370
 5 7 cooling system 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.530
 here is enough for this this 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.450
 the laptop also did not overheat while its 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.480
 dimensions will not only play on it 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.830
 but also take it set foot on the road 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:45.740
 football and 70 we sell a lot of this 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.520
 models and she is really very good 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.119
 for player 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.970
 because firstly it is very compact and 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.240
 light despite the size of 17 inches 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.040
 there is also a matte screen here 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.780
 can be backlit keyboard in 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.390
 depending on the configuration or its 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.320
 absence here can also be put 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.630
 ssd here or buy the cheapest 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.000
 configuration is just a hard drive 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:17.780
 graphics can be either 850 or 860 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.630
 and in general, to play all the games 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.310
 this car is quite enough and probably 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:29.810
 it is the best combination of price and quality 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:32.420
 our new model gs jess it with us 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.750
 thin series thin laptops but despite 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.209
 on the fact that they are quite thin 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.340
 compact and light we love very much 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.230
 say that this is the first ultra thin 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.150
 gaming laptop well and basically it 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.330
 really so so that's despite 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.980
 its thickness and lightness 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:56.780
 rather powerful graphics 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:03:00.680
 from 850 to 870 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:04.210
 part of the series we have not missing 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.190
 drive in children drive but in general 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.230
 life shows that he is getting everything 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.520
 less and less necessary for players 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.190
 because most games are now 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.760
 bought through all kinds of services 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.540
 string type, and in general, there are few who 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.670
 buys 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.480
 usually very ordinary drives to 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.520
 install player here 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.410
 use the usual matrix but all 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.780
 it is equally possible because it is good enough 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.530
 the screen is matte and do not shine blue 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.610
 exultant 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.220
 good viewing angles 20 series they 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.270
 can take a try the product on video 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.120
 graphics and andy 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.220
 currently used 290 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.260
 graphite 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.510
 actually very very fast and to 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.070
 play win even at very high 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:54.230
 resolution is no problem 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:57.050
 respectively, the laptop is also a processor 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.260
 here on the new platform sure this is ours 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:03.230
 star of the exhibition computer this year 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.420
 this is a completely new model are you still 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.530
 nowhere could read or see 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.850
 information this resident 72 here he 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.360
 completely new design 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.790
 this model comes let's say not 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.030
 replaces but at least 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:23.720
 complements the range of live and 60-70 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.220
 year more aggressive design is even better 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.290
 cooling systems even more 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:32.330
 opportunities is used accordingly 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:35.280
 the most powerful video graphics you can 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.530
 put on now 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.930
 we don't have much information yet 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.729
 about this model but of course it will 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.759
 support super eight and already 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:50.800
 supports essence ray 20 patented 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:53.319
 technology atoms site respectively then 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.360
 there is this model it is designed for 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:57.759
