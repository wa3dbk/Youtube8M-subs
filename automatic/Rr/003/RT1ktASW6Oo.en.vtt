at<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.280> design<00:00:11.610> while<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:11.849> explain<00:00:12.210> how<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.540> was

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
at the design while I explain how it was

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.100 
at the design while I explain how it was
built

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
built

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.589 
built
the<00:00:13.950> gun<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.250> made<00:00:14.400> mostly<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.849> medium<00:00:15.269> density

plastic most really three main supplies

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.060 
plastic most really three main supplies
you<00:00:22.590> need<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.800> build<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.070> gun<00:00:23.250> like<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:25.070> so

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
you need to build a gun like this and so

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.490 
you need to build a gun like this and so
let's<00:00:26.279> see<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:27.240> stock<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.900> foregrip<00:00:28.289> are

the barrel is plastic and the reason I

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.939 
the barrel is plastic and the reason I
made<00:00:51.750> them<00:00:51.840> plastic<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.379> because<00:00:52.680> it's<00:00:52.800> really

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
made them plastic is because it's really

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.630 
made them plastic is because it's really
easy<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.340> work<00:00:53.550> with<00:00:53.610> PVC<00:00:54.239> pipe<00:00:55.489> and<00:00:56.489> now<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
easy to work with PVC pipe and now the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.330 
easy to work with PVC pipe and now the
trigger<00:00:56.940> guard<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.809> bottom<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.340> this

trigger guard on the bottom and this

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.979 
trigger guard on the bottom and this
brass<00:00:59.640> piece<00:00:59.879> up<00:01:00.059> front<00:01:00.270> are<00:01:00.480> both<00:01:00.750> made

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
brass piece up front are both made

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.380

entirely<00:01:01.289> out<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.590> steel<00:01:02.059> that<00:01:03.059> was<00:01:03.180> mainly

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
entirely out of steel that was mainly

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.149 
entirely out of steel that was mainly
just<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.870> keep<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.229> sturdy<00:01:04.500> because<00:01:04.710> those

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
just to keep it sturdy because those

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.740 
just to keep it sturdy because those
parts<00:01:05.460> are<00:01:05.549> likely<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.000> get<00:01:06.150> bumped<00:01:06.510> at<00:01:06.600> one

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
parts are likely to get bumped at one

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.700 
parts are likely to get bumped at one
point<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.140> wanted<00:01:07.439> them<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.680> be<00:01:07.770> strong

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
point and I wanted them to be strong

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.410

it<00:01:21.540> was<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> pretty<00:01:22.049> difficult<00:01:22.290> gun<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.890> build

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
it was a pretty difficult gun to build

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.800 
it was a pretty difficult gun to build
mainly<00:01:23.490> because<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.119> such<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> complex

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
mainly because it's just such a complex

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.969 
mainly because it's just such a complex
design<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:26.060> it's<00:01:27.060> just<00:01:27.840> really<00:01:28.259> in-depth<00:01:28.770> I

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
design and it's just really in-depth I

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.679 
design and it's just really in-depth I
mean<00:01:29.130> there's<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.369> lot<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.700> planning<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.479> stuff

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
mean there's a lot of planning and stuff

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.039 
mean there's a lot of planning and stuff
that<00:01:30.750> goes<00:01:31.049> into<00:01:31.259> making<00:01:31.439> gun<00:01:31.799> like<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:33.049> as

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
that goes into making gun like this as

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.810 
that goes into making gun like this as
far<00:01:34.290> as<00:01:34.350> features<00:01:34.799> go<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.159> doesn't<00:01:35.430> have<00:01:35.549> many

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
far as features go it doesn't have many

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.030 
far as features go it doesn't have many
it's<00:01:36.150> just<00:01:36.540> mainly<00:01:36.720> made<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> movie<00:01:37.799> prop

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
it's just mainly made to be a movie prop

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.510 
it's just mainly made to be a movie prop
with<00:01:38.310> all<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> effects<00:01:38.970> added<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.450> afterwards

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
with all the effects added in afterwards

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.130 
with all the effects added in afterwards
the<00:01:41.520> one<00:01:41.700> thing<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.030> does<00:01:42.210> do<00:01:42.450> though<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.869> has<00:01:43.110> a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
the one thing it does do though is has a

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.370 
the one thing it does do though is has a
little<00:01:43.619> red<00:01:43.770> switch<00:01:44.100> right<00:01:44.970> here<00:01:45.229> that<00:01:46.229> just

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
little red switch right here that just

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.609 
little red switch right here that just
flips<00:01:46.619> open<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.189> closed<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:48.420> that's<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.409> both

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
flips open and closed and that's on both

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.539 
flips open and closed and that's on both
sides<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.460> gun<00:01:51.710> for<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.799> ammunition<00:01:53.070> I

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.969 
sides of the gun for the ammunition I
chose<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.939> use<00:01:54.060> vacuum<00:01:54.390> tubes<00:01:54.840> they're<00:01:55.799> just

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
chose to use vacuum tubes they're just

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.819 
chose to use vacuum tubes they're just
glue<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.310> into<00:01:56.460> place<00:01:56.759> they<00:01:57.000> don't<00:01:57.270> reload<00:01:57.829> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
glue it into place they don't reload the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.230 
glue it into place they don't reload the
reason<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.219> chose<00:01:59.399> those<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.850> because<00:02:00.149> they

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
reason I chose those is because they

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.350 
reason I chose those is because they
look<00:02:00.420> most<00:02:00.719> like<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.110> ammo<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> game<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.360> do

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
look most like the ammo in the game I do

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.280 
look most like the ammo in the game I do
look<00:02:03.570> pretty<00:02:03.630> cool<00:02:04.020> anyways<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.710> why<00:02:05.040> not<00:02:06.290> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
look pretty cool anyways so why not the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.080 
look pretty cool anyways so why not the
other<00:02:07.439> side<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.890> gun<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.280> very<00:02:08.520> much<00:02:08.910> of

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
other side of the gun is very much of

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.210 
other side of the gun is very much of
the<00:02:09.179> same<00:02:09.209> there's

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
the same there's

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.820 
the same there's
nothing<00:02:10.610> special<00:02:10.880> here<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:12.260> only<00:02:12.380> difference

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
nothing special here the only difference

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.030 
nothing special here the only difference
is<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.130> it's<00:02:13.310> missing<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.850> ammo<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.920> it's

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
is that it's missing the ammo so it's

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.440 
is that it's missing the ammo so it's
really<00:02:16.190> just<00:02:16.430> about<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.820> same<00:02:17.030> as<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.300> other

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
really just about the same as the other

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:27.760 
really just about the same as the other
side<00:02:25.420> they<00:02:26.420> give<00:02:26.570> you<00:02:26.660> a<00:02:26.720> size<00:02:26.990> comparison<00:02:27.020> I

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
side they give you a size comparison I

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.040 
side they give you a size comparison I
pulled<00:02:28.310> out<00:02:28.430> my<00:02:28.490> replica<00:02:29.030> in<00:02:29.480> one<00:02:29.660> carving

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
pulled out my replica in one carving

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.800 
pulled out my replica in one carving
does<00:02:31.010> not<00:02:31.190> shoot<00:02:31.430> it's<00:02:31.640> just<00:02:31.820> a<00:02:31.910> dump<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.450> as

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
does not shoot it's just a dump and as

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.010 
does not shoot it's just a dump and as
you<00:02:32.990> see<00:02:33.260> it's<00:02:33.380> unloaded<00:02:37.660> but<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:38.720> can<00:02:38.840> tell

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
you see it's unloaded but you can tell

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.200 
you see it's unloaded but you can tell
just<00:02:39.050> by<00:02:39.260> looking<00:02:39.350> at<00:02:39.740> it<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.250> Wunderwaffe<00:02:40.910> is

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
just by looking at it the Wunderwaffe is

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.990 
just by looking at it the Wunderwaffe is
really<00:02:41.570> big<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:42.650> weighs<00:02:42.890> about<00:02:43.040> 8<00:02:43.340> pounds<00:02:43.580> and

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
really big it weighs about 8 pounds and

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.570 
really big it weighs about 8 pounds and
it's<00:02:44.510> kind<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.320> uncomfortable<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:46.220> hold<00:02:46.430> all

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
it's kind of uncomfortable to hold all

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:54.220 
it's kind of uncomfortable to hold all
admit<00:02:51.850> so<00:02:52.850> really<00:02:53.390> there's<00:02:53.600> nothing<00:02:53.930> left<00:02:54.110> to

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
admit so really there's nothing left to

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.900 
admit so really there's nothing left to
say<00:02:54.440> about<00:02:54.650> this<00:02:54.830> gun<00:02:55.070> other<00:02:55.400> than<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.790> was

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
say about this gun other than it was

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.030 
say about this gun other than it was
really<00:02:56.120> hard<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:56.390> build<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.990> in<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.770> end<00:02:57.890> it

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
really hard to build and in the end it

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.980 
really hard to build and in the end it
was<00:02:58.220> worth<00:02:58.459> it<00:02:58.730> because<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.540> doesn't<00:02:59.840> look

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
was worth it because it doesn't look

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.360 
was worth it because it doesn't look
really<00:03:00.290> cool<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:00.740> it's<00:03:00.890> going<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:01.100> be<00:03:01.220> in<00:03:01.310> a

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
really cool and it's going to be in a

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.210 
really cool and it's going to be in a
movie

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
movie

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.710 
movie
