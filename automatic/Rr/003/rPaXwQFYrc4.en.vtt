00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hall youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.759
 new technology vt video today is the last 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.470
 schultag in nrw the holidays are in 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.750
 full swing i hang with mine 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.250
 vacation videos totally behind but that 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.349
 Let's catch up today 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.509
 We had the sim already lately 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.529
 map for abroad and today 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.960
 we deal with the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.180
 Communication abroad every year 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.269
 Again today we find out how 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.340
 a lot of data volume so swallow 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.349
 Facetime conversation when you leave the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.170
 call home and then vacation 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.809
 At the same time, of course, your beach hotel 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.890
 or whatever wanted to show it 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.350
 There are no bad surprises then 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.450
 gives 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.460
 we are completely with our iphone 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.989
 normal in the 3g network synonymous with not before 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.210
 all beams we simulate here the times 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.050
 vacation situation our ipad what then too 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.550
 home stays with grandma grandpa or who else 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.680
 that does not interest us now 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.539
 can be quiet in the wlan we are in 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.399
 Set gone mobile data usage 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.280
 again our data counter and back 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.510
 Nothing else works on the ipad 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.670
 no data will be synonymous in the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.610
 background synced or not 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.229
 that it means then that could otherwise 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.210
 anything else we have been trying here 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.369
 really the data again 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.619
 simulate that and I have mine here 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.450
 most loyal nexus smartphone already running 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.240
 and if that now shows two minutes 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.080
 then so we set up our conversation and 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.810
 there we are already 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.700
 and from now on not even if 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.759
 already be asked for data 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:34.170
 We really want a minute 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:35.579
 13 that 's it now you see ours here 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.259
 five years who has always been 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.110
 wanted to know how that behind the camera 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.180
 it looks like if I make videos here 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.640
 there you can see one more here 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.500
 spotlights here my faithful canon 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.180
 camera and otherwise that's behind the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.920
 Camera not so if you times 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.049
 Of course, you are always considering 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.090
 really cool technical devices in the 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.939
 videos but the devices to the then for 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.549
 you are the tanja that is then 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.490
 the look they have a lot 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.330
 less exciting than 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.550
 so if you sometimes come too 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.310
 boring unboxing video looks 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.950
 always think about the box or the 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.360
 content of the box is the video a lot 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.860
 and even more interesting than for you 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.420
 speakers are not complete 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.530
 and I wanted the devices 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.800
 not minutes 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.460
 now we have to look and the 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.830
 minute right around and end 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:37.420
 that's about it now we are 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:41.740
 through and now we look in the 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:47.260
 setting and see cellphone sent 829 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:49.960
 kab receive 951 kb round and whats up 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.790
 let's just say now time has counted 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.730
 times per minute facetime with two 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.590
 megabyte consumption then you are on the 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.710
 safe side I find now 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.700
 Personally I have relatively little 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.320
 somehow more in last year 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.360
 Reminder I would have my old video 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.340
 looking up means even if you are ten 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.230
 talk about it and because of it 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.970
 possible to return home or send 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.860
 to see from home and ten 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.290
 minutes is actually already 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.550
 a lot of time for such a conversation 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.500
 just from the holiday if you are something 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:22.150
 want to do at all and then we are 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:24.400
 at 10 minutes at 20 mb okay that fits 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.830
 and then he calls every two days at times 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.080
 or whatever you have before, good 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.959
 we know it now I am 20 mb 14 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.340
 minutes relatively little comes naturally 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.230
 always on holiday contingent if 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.850
 has only 50 mb and I not 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.650
 one or two weeks to get along with it 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.600
 you have to think about it 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.220
 talk sometimes but then calls 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.170
 you only stop for two minutes and 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.500
 sometimes spend two to four megabytes 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.239
 so that was it with our facetime test 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.739
 Thanks for watching it makes it good 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.739
 and until the next video
