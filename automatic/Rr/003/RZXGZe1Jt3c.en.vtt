00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 hall youtube and welcome to the long 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.680
 i longed for galaxy s 4 unboxing my dhl 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.570
 human beings have it in my paws 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.469
 pressed and said already what is in there 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.990
 somewhere mobile phone 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.660
 I was surprised that he still has the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.400
 ball from the outside is nothing on it but that 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.800
 they'll have to do it again, apparently 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.960
 sign separately and private too 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.510
 I'll just throw it out and hammer it 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.630
 already who is that a wooden box 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.280
 no it is plastic plastic that is 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.050
 not normal cardboard box but in the wood 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.620
 look not bad so what have 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:46.610
 we here, of course, as a processor 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:49.860
 quad core with 1 gigahertz full hd 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.340
 amoled display 3 10 megapixel backs 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.949
 Camera 2 megapixel front side camera 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.910
 again an infrared remote control 2600 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.629
 milliamp battery and was so 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.739
 which ever looks so huhu a lot 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.930
 interesting packaging itself there times 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.930
 say then we look in again 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:20.130
 that should be enough and and and ta ta 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.170
 ta ta ta ta kung fu woman you see it 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.159
 i also have the white version why 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.460
 Not 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.939
 the nexus 4 is in black you want 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.619
 what have to take turns and yes it feels 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.670
 easy on but of course that is 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.700
 Battery not in it yet 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.140
 So not as excited as he is 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:45.180
 then go under or here 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:48.149
 somehow so aha aha again one 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.649
 funny type designation with short instructions 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.840
 Everything here in color in tones 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.360
 you can also see samsung here 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.329
 sets here more and more value to the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.299
 packaging and accessories headphones with 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:04.350
 Remote control and microphone on the too 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.659
 Samsung still shows white cables 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.550
 respect respect respect of course micro 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.460
 it micro-usb 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.650
 a charger very nice that 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.730
 now also in the same tone in color 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.320
 then held other sizes 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.040
 different sizes for those in her 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:29.280
 Not at all from vienna in her but 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:32.440
 and our battery with the already said 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.460
 2600 millahole mah and that 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.230
 So it was natural for the tree 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.280
 directly marien on the par on the thing 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.920
 then we already have to get in very much 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.510
 very very cool 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.920
 first impression of the phone how 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:54.160
 war to you out of here shelled the 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:58.300
 once the back is ok and then 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.360
 once again the front ha ha ha ha 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.800
 ha so i still have to 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.380
 correct I really thought 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.750
 the thing is a lot bigger than 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.760
 13 even if it's on the datasheet 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.070
 different but remembers the size 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.420
 really really love it 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.530
 be even narrower at the tick though 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.270
 this screen here 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.500
 if you ever look 5 inches what 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.250
 otherwise we have more physical 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.430
 home-button leds from camera sensors and 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.739
 and and left side the often button 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.780
 wonderful that the ones on the side but 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.850
 I tried it up here now 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.850
 to be tinkered and microphone and 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.840
 our micro usb port is left side then 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.810
 the louder seesaw above headphones 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.610
 an output microphone and probably 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.070
 this is never the case here 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.350
 infrared port yes that must be synonymous yes 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:54.400
 come back somewhere our 3 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.300
 10 megapixel 9 10 megapixel 19 me 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.030
 thought 13 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.630
 but already confused 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.030
 our led flash and our speakers 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.530
 but the flat on the back 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.959
 but here is one does not know if 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.880
 you can tell it looks like an elevation 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.670
 means what I criticize in such 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.959
 things on the back you hear nothing 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.790
 more but that deep is now out 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.530
 of course the downside if down there 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.079
 right then the speakers apple 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.150
 that's the thing 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.129
 Then on the table but maybe sometimes quite 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.539
 honest who is typing with it so while im 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:28.379
 display is of course not typed 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:30.099
 but that's not exactly the case 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:32.259
 very very nice 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:33.909
 and yes I complain again and again 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:36.460
 that it is a plastic bomber and also 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:38.849
 when it's again polycarbonate and carbonate 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.949
 otherwise what is 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:44.199
 well, ok, this silver thick aluminum frame 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:48.099
 or precious metal frame of the rescues now 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:49.930
 again but only a sim card in and out 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:53.490
 then let's see what's on it 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.490
 So it's up to the next one
