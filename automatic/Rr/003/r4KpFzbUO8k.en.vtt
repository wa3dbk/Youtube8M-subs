00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.900 

here's<00:00:00.930> my<00:00:01.370> 2005<00:00:02.370> dodge<00:00:02.730> and<00:00:03.830> I<00:00:04.830> installed<00:00:05.549> an

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
here's my 2005 dodge and I installed an

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.520 
here's my 2005 dodge and I installed an
hho<00:00:06.480> generator<00:00:07.049> in<00:00:07.259> it<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:08.480> I<00:00:09.480> put<00:00:10.139> it<00:00:10.200> between

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
hho generator in it and I put it between

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.529 
hho generator in it and I put it between
the<00:00:12.080> grill<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:14.630> the<00:00:17.000> radiator<00:00:18.000> there's

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
the grill and the radiator there's

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.910 
the grill and the radiator there's
plenty<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:18.930> room<00:00:19.400> I'll<00:00:20.400> take<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:20.820> cover<00:00:21.119> off

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
plenty of room I'll take this cover off

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.000 
plenty of room I'll take this cover off
and<00:00:23.570> there's<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.720> generator<00:00:25.199> big<00:00:25.769> enough<00:00:25.949> for

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
and there's the generator big enough for

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.960 
and there's the generator big enough for
a<00:00:26.189> 3-inch<00:00:26.550> pipe<00:00:27.560> and<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.980> got<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.369> long<00:00:29.670> enough

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
a 3-inch pipe and I got it long enough

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.930 
a 3-inch pipe and I got it long enough
where<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.330> holds<00:00:30.449> plenty<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.960> water<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.940> then

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
where it holds plenty of water and then

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.450 
where it holds plenty of water and then
I've<00:00:33.090> got<00:00:33.300> my<00:00:33.600> fuse<00:00:34.020> right<00:00:34.260> here<00:00:34.530> 20<00:00:34.950> amp<00:00:35.130> fuse

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
I've got my fuse right here 20 amp fuse

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:43.580 
I've got my fuse right here 20 amp fuse
and<00:00:36.170> then<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:39.440> down<00:00:40.440> here<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:42.230> air<00:00:43.230> coming

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
and then the down here is the air coming

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.520 
and then the down here is the air coming
from<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.890> top<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.969> generator<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.780> down

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
from the top of the generator and down

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.090 
from the top of the generator and down
here<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.250> have<00:00:47.610> another<00:00:47.969> hose<00:00:48.559> that's<00:00:49.559> putting

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
here I have another hose that's putting

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.750 
here I have another hose that's putting
water<00:00:50.940> back<00:00:51.239> into<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.719> generator<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.489> my<00:00:53.489> gas

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
water back into the generator and my gas

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.600 
water back into the generator and my gas
is<00:00:54.030> flowing<00:00:54.449> out<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.579> going

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
is flowing out here and I have it going

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.549 
is flowing out here and I have it going
right<00:00:57.149> here<00:00:57.360> into<00:00:57.840> my<00:00:57.989> intake<00:01:00.230> that's<00:01:01.230> my<00:01:01.410> air

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
right here into my intake that's my air

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.369 
right here into my intake that's my air
cleaner<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.239> in<00:01:03.239> here<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> tea<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.049> had

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
cleaner and in here I have a tea I had

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.020 
cleaner and in here I have a tea I had
this<00:01:04.500> unblocked<00:01:04.949> top<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.549> another

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
this unblocked top and I have another

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.780 
this unblocked top and I have another
hose<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:07.049> goes<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.710> way<00:01:07.830> up<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.340> here

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
hose that goes all the way up to here

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.060 
hose that goes all the way up to here
and<00:01:09.780> there's<00:01:09.960> another<00:01:10.170> sensor<00:01:10.650> right<00:01:10.860> there

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
and there's another sensor right there

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.530 
and there's another sensor right there
I'm<00:01:11.189> not<00:01:11.340> sure<00:01:11.520> what<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:12.180> anyway<00:01:12.510> I

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
I'm not sure what that is but anyway I

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.000 
I'm not sure what that is but anyway I
have<00:01:12.780> my<00:01:12.810> go<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.409> going<00:01:13.590> all<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.740> way<00:01:13.799> up<00:01:13.860> here

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
have my go is going all the way up here

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.210 
have my go is going all the way up here
and<00:01:14.810> today<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.840> took<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.140> drive<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.740> went<00:01:16.890> 100

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
and today I took a drive and went 100

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.649 
and today I took a drive and went 100
miles<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:18.630> when<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.780> filled<00:01:19.110> up<00:01:19.200> my<00:01:19.259> gas<00:01:19.380> tank<00:01:19.619> I

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
miles and when I filled up my gas tank I

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.940 
miles and when I filled up my gas tank I
filled<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.780> up<00:01:21.840> all<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.049> way<00:01:22.200> as<00:01:22.470> far<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:22.799> it'll

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
filled it up all the way as far as it'll

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.880 
filled it up all the way as far as it'll
go<00:01:23.180> not<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.360> let<00:01:24.540> click<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:25.170> until<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.619> was

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
go not to let click but until the was

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.070 
go not to let click but until the was
coming<00:01:26.220> out<00:01:26.430> that's<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> same<00:01:27.570> way<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.720> filled

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
coming out that's the same way I filled

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.260 
coming out that's the same way I filled
it<00:01:28.229> up<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.340> way<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.490> get<00:01:29.729> an<00:01:29.820> accurate

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
it up so this way I get an accurate

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.039 
it up so this way I get an accurate
reading<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.850> it<00:01:32.850> took<00:01:33.150> three<00:01:33.450> point<00:01:33.750> two

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
reading and it took three point two

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.520 
reading and it took three point two
gallons<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.799> go<00:01:34.890> 100<00:01:35.220> miles<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:36.380> I<00:01:37.380> was

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
gallons to go 100 miles and I was

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.660 
gallons to go 100 miles and I was
getting<00:01:37.740> 16<00:01:38.369> miles<00:01:38.700> per<00:01:38.850> gallon<00:01:40.250> before<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.280> put

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
getting 16 miles per gallon before I put

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.719 
getting 16 miles per gallon before I put
this<00:01:41.759> generator<00:01:42.299> up<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.979> I<00:01:43.979> actually<00:01:44.280> did

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
this generator up and I actually did

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.719 
this generator up and I actually did
that<00:01:44.939> test<00:01:45.299> three<00:01:45.630> times<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:46.200> make<00:01:46.229> sure<00:01:46.619> and

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.380 

it<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:51.090> generator<00:01:51.600> definitely<00:01:52.049> works<00:01:52.229> and

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
it this generator definitely works and

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.490 
it this generator definitely works and
I'm<00:01:54.390> going<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.570> make<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> couple<00:01:55.079> more<00:01:55.229> I'm

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
I'm going to make a couple more I'm

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.030 
I'm going to make a couple more I'm
going<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.740> put<00:01:55.950> one<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.570> this<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.780> Suzu<00:01:58.229> I've

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
going to put one and this is Suzu I've

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.280 
going to put one and this is Suzu I've
got<00:01:59.280> one<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.460> my<00:01:59.579> 1950<00:02:00.509> Dodge<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:03.140> I'm<00:02:04.140> gonna

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
got one in my 1950 Dodge and I'm gonna

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.799 
got one in my 1950 Dodge and I'm gonna
save<00:02:04.500> some<00:02:04.680> money
