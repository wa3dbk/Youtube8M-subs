like<00:01:36.960> injected<00:01:37.740> into<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.130> game<00:01:38.340> from<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
like injected into the game from the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.520 
like injected into the game from the
live<00:01:39.180> commentary<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.930> makes<00:01:40.110> any<00:01:40.229> sense

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
live commentary that makes any sense

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.740 
live commentary that makes any sense
because<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.460> find<00:01:41.700> them<00:01:41.909> really<00:01:42.119> fun<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.659> do<00:01:42.720> I

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
because I find them really fun to do I

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.389 
because I find them really fun to do I
feel<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.229> kind<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.470> didn't<00:01:43.740> think<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.009> would<00:01:44.070> like

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
feel I kind of didn't think I would like

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.270 
feel I kind of didn't think I would like
the<00:01:45.000> pressure<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.600> losing<00:01:46.280> technically

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the pressure of losing technically

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.580 
the pressure of losing technically
virtual<00:01:47.729> money<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:48.060> guess<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.600> thought<00:01:49.350> it'd<00:01:49.500> be

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
virtual money I guess I thought it'd be

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.810 
virtual money I guess I thought it'd be
a<00:01:49.619> bit<00:01:49.770> stressful<00:01:50.100> red<00:01:50.430> thought<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.670> would

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
a bit stressful red thought I would

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.719 
a bit stressful red thought I would
enjoy<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.299> but<00:01:51.509> yesterday's<00:01:52.380> game<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.950> really

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
found that quite fun maybe it was just

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.740 
found that quite fun maybe it was just
that<00:01:56.130> one<00:01:56.399> off<00:01:56.549> game<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.149> might<00:01:57.390> not<00:01:57.600> enjoy

that one off game and I might not enjoy

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
battlefield 4 because those games are

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.170 
battlefield 4 because those games are
absolutely<00:03:56.769> incredible<00:03:57.580> now<00:03:57.760> if<00:03:57.910> you<00:03:57.970> notice

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
absolutely incredible now if you notice

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.390 
absolutely incredible now if you notice
in<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.480> top<00:03:58.510> left<00:03:58.810> my<00:03:59.380> coins<00:03:59.650> jump<00:04:00.070> up<00:04:00.220> by

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
in the top left my coins jump up by

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.729 
in the top left my coins jump up by
about<00:04:00.519> 300<00:04:00.880> k<00:04:01.269> as<00:04:01.480> quite<00:04:02.049> simply<00:04:02.380> because<00:04:02.709> I

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
about 300 k as quite simply because I

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.550 
about 300 k as quite simply because I
sold<00:04:03.160> everything<00:04:03.840> that<00:04:04.840> I've<00:04:04.959> got<00:04:05.200> in<00:04:05.410> the

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
sold everything that I've got in the

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.410 
sold everything that I've got in the
past<00:04:05.830> two<00:04:06.010> videos<00:04:06.310> I've<00:04:06.519> done<00:04:06.549> the<00:04:06.790> 50k<00:04:07.150> packs

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
past two videos I've done the 50k packs

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.960 
past two videos I've done the 50k packs
and<00:04:07.660> I<00:04:08.260> managed<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.620> get<00:04:08.860> two<00:04:09.070> more<00:04:09.220> they<00:04:09.910> are

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
and I managed to get two more they are

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.729 
and I managed to get two more they are
allowing<00:04:10.480> me<00:04:10.570> to<00:04:10.690> open<00:04:10.780> to<00:04:11.049> more<00:04:11.200> fit<00:04:11.350> to<00:04:11.380> k-pax

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
allowing me to open to more fit to k-pax

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.220 
allowing me to open to more fit to k-pax
so<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.370> thought<00:04:12.549> I<00:04:12.610> might<00:04:12.700> as<00:04:12.940> well<00:04:12.970> see<00:04:13.810> if<00:04:14.049> we

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
so I thought I might as well see if we

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.289 
so I thought I might as well see if we
get<00:04:14.530> something<00:04:14.830> pretty<00:04:15.370> awesome<00:04:16.030> but<00:04:16.180> I

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
get something pretty awesome but I

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.820 
get something pretty awesome but I
really<00:04:16.660> want<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.810> get<00:04:16.900> back<00:04:16.959> into<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.500> second

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
really want to get back into the second

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.009 
really want to get back into the second
channel<00:04:18.070> and<00:04:18.160> every<00:04:18.340> time<00:04:18.489> i<00:04:18.549> do<00:04:18.880> i<00:04:19.090> always<00:04:19.600> let

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
channel and every time i do i always let

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.659 
channel and every time i do i always let
it<00:04:20.169> slip<00:04:20.380> because<00:04:20.620> i<00:04:20.890> want<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.099> focus<00:04:21.280> on<00:04:21.580> my

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
it slip because i want to focus on my

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.550 
it slip because i want to focus on my
main<00:04:21.880> channel<00:04:21.910> as<00:04:22.360> well<00:04:22.419> and<00:04:23.140> it<00:04:23.200> is<00:04:23.380> tough<00:04:23.770> to

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
main channel as well and it is tough to

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.710 
main channel as well and it is tough to
do<00:04:24.680> two<00:04:25.310> things<00:04:25.580> at<00:04:25.790> once<00:04:26.000> I<00:04:26.180> want<00:04:26.389> to<00:04:26.480> try

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
do two things at once I want to try

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.720 
do two things at once I want to try
because<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.260> next-gen<00:04:27.650> stuff<00:04:27.889> is<00:04:28.280> really

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
because the next-gen stuff is really

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.700 
because the next-gen stuff is really
really<00:04:29.180> interesting<00:04:29.389> and<00:04:30.110> if<00:04:30.230> you<00:04:30.320> guys<00:04:30.470> have
