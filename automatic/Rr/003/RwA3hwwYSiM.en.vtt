 It is an oil catch tank 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.320
 Cleaned up cleanly 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.600
 The type of 5 to help now has a properly 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.040
 Originally it should have been used 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.040
 Put the jubilee clip on 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.950

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.910
 I can not say the way ahead 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.910
 Let's pray for success 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.250
 There is no smoke 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.829
 The engine seems to be turning well 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.770
 Let's force it 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.120
 But the problem seems to be solved 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.629
 Shadow

 700 lbs new wheel in good condition sets 3000 lbs new 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:57.350
 What is normal is that old car parts are also traded out, but rarely 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:00.390
 Jaguar classic car owners often ask specialists to replace their seats 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:06.360
 But when's it you 1000 pounds 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:10.050

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.510

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:47.740
 It will go in all 300 suites and 440 wood trims 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.850
 I'm really out of power 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.350
 Up sheet talk to it in high'll take 1,500 pounds When you have a new one 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.530
 It is more if I change it 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.240
 It seems that it is 8 minutes of 190 minutes of thorough alignment 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.240
 Except masu Aigatou rom 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.890
 I want to 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.880
 I do not want 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.590
 Stop card ride from Kiritsu Well then 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:31.010
 But it is that of the clutch became one care 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:37.810
 The gear did not get in smoothly and the clutch amount was said to be 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.810
 Nehodo which was found without the Nan forest to this land requires a total inspection 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.620
 When I step into Gucci 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:50.410
 Webber is working and lots are standing 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.610
 Although ahead of the piston is cherry, which is will result in a positive cylinder pressed the flexible pipe 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:58.140
 Transmission 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:04:02.400
 It is a mechanism that the release cylinder receives hydraulic pressure and the storage area is activated and the date and time are switched. 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:06.800
 Sealer has fallen a bit , even after a little bit of corrosion 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.990
 I can not see places where I or air is mixed 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.319
 It's a bit hard to see 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:16.250
 I'm just discolored a little of his hot water 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:19.250
 Because it might tend to be a mixed some of the moisture in the old 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.570
 What is likely to cause Kurauchi to be uneasy 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.570
 I can not find this 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:39.110
 e It says to open the selection runt 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:41.800
 The maintenance Reeds cylinder next to the water ring bell housing looks good 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.190
 You can see that it is corroded well 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.590
 Because there is water and dance on the road surface in Moro 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.880
 Of course 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:54.810
 Oh it than worrisome also is 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:57.100
 It means that Eiki is leaking from the rubber point of the release cylinder 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.090
 If it's brake oil 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:05.840
 The air will get into the land mine so 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:07.900
 Unlike many, the air will be sealed, so it may be a visualization 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:13.060
 But there was a monkey but he 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:15.270
 The fact that the clutch has become so caught is so fired up not twist in the fan is not transmitted 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.270
 Will
