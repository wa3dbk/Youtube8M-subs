what they can't do I've got here a

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.330 
what they can't do I've got here a

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
tip section which is what a lot of

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.760 
tip section which is what a lot of
people<00:00:33.149> like<00:00:33.450> about<00:00:33.750> them<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.020> very<00:00:34.530> very

hard<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.130> break<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.750> you'll<00:00:36.750> see<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.710> can

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
hard to break and you'll see that I can

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.010 
hard to break and you'll see that I can
put<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.670> significant<00:00:39.329> Bend<00:00:39.510> into<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.840> tip

put really significant Bend into the tip
section<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.559> rod<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.120> it<00:00:42.120> does<00:00:42.329> no

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
section of that rod and it does no

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.880 
section of that rod and it does no
damage<00:00:42.950> whatsoever<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:46.140> downside<00:00:46.710> to

damage whatsoever to it the downside to
this<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.340> when<00:00:47.579> people<00:00:47.610> graduate<00:00:48.420> to

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
this is that when people graduate to

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.900 
this is that when people graduate to

their first graphite rod they tend to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.490 
their first graphite rod they tend to
treat<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> same<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.989> not<00:00:52.199> quite

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
treat it the same and not quite

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.720 
treat it the same and not quite
understand<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> differences<00:00:53.670> between

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
better than fiberglass does but the one

better than fiberglass does but the one
thing<00:01:09.780> graphite<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.290> not<00:01:10.530> great<00:01:10.830> at<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.159> doing

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
thing graphite is not great at is doing

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.539 
thing graphite is not great at is doing
a<00:01:11.490> tight<00:01:11.760> turn<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.450> tight<00:01:12.720> corner<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:14.189> lot

a tight turn in a tight corner and a lot

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.100 
a tight turn in a tight corner and a lot
of<00:01:14.640> people<00:01:14.909> will<00:01:15.030> grab<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> graphite<00:01:15.689> rod<00:01:15.930> like

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
of people will grab a graphite rod like

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.800 
of people will grab a graphite rod like
this<00:01:16.170> even<00:01:17.040> heaven<00:01:17.670> help<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.060> tackle<00:01:18.540> stores

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
this even heaven help in tackle stores

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.260 
this even heaven help in tackle stores
and<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.310> first<00:01:20.549> thing<00:01:20.700> they<00:01:20.790> want<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.150> is

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
and the first thing they want to do is

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.450 
and the first thing they want to do is
test<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.720> tip<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.530> when<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> do<00:01:22.830> try<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
test the tip but when I do try to do a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.980 
test the tip but when I do try to do a
tight<00:01:23.729> turn<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.360> did<00:01:24.509> with<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.659> glass

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
tight turn like I did with that glass

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.600 
tight turn like I did with that glass
rod<00:01:25.259> before<00:01:26.180> bang<00:01:27.180> we've<00:01:27.630> got<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> snap<00:01:28.460> why<00:01:29.460> did

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
rod before bang we've got a snap why did

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.249 
rod before bang we've got a snap why did
it<00:01:29.729> snap<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.210> graphite<00:01:30.689> weaker<00:01:31.140> than

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
it snap is graphite weaker than

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.020 
it snap is graphite weaker than
fiberglass<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.520> not<00:01:32.670> as<00:01:32.790> good<00:01:32.820> as

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
fiberglass is it not as good as

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.510 
fiberglass is it not as good as
fiberglass<00:01:33.360> no<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.590> not<00:01:34.890> as<00:01:35.040> good<00:01:35.220> at

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
fiberglass no it's just not as good at

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.460 
fiberglass no it's just not as good at
doing<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.060> really<00:01:36.479> tight<00:01:36.720> turn<00:01:36.990> like<00:01:37.290> that

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
doing a really tight turn like that

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.710 
doing a really tight turn like that
fiberglass<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.759> up<00:01:38.909> side<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.329> course<00:01:39.540> is

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
fiberglass is the up side of course is

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.840 
fiberglass is the up side of course is
the<00:01:39.930> benefits<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.500> graphite<00:01:40.829> far<00:01:41.310> outweigh

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
the benefits of graphite far outweigh

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.080 
the benefits of graphite far outweigh
what<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> fiberglass<00:01:43.229> rod<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.770> do<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.640> when

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
what the fiberglass rod can do so when

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.210 
what the fiberglass rod can do so when
it<00:01:45.180> comes<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.479> our<00:01:45.630> casting<00:01:46.220> responsiveness

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
it comes to our casting responsiveness

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.090 
it comes to our casting responsiveness
through<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> blank<00:01:47.909> our<00:01:48.600> sensitivity<00:01:49.350> etc

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
through the blank our sensitivity etc

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.580 
through the blank our sensitivity etc
etc<00:01:50.189> we<00:01:50.820> have<00:01:51.030> huge<00:01:51.509> benefits<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:52.170> really

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
etc we have huge benefits it's really

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.289 
etc we have huge benefits it's really
really<00:01:52.829> light<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.430> graphite<00:01:53.759> rod<00:01:54.030> weighs<00:01:54.270> a

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
really light the graphite rod weighs a

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.030 
really light the graphite rod weighs a
lot<00:01:54.630> less<00:01:54.869> than<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.110> fiberglass<00:01:55.409> rod<00:01:55.799> does
