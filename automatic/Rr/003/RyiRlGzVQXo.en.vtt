00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.540
 produced the features 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.829
 if I liked it because I was sorry 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.870
 if I didn't like it because it didn't 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.750
 liked it and so on 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.000
 this month made with this emotion 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.079
 body I 've been feeling since I got it 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.180
 received and we talk about you been 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.979
 practically and from that day I have 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.440
 started using this indeed 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.990
 practically almost over and then there 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:15.030
 I say it is a motion body of the buoy but yes 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.220
 calls persian bio and the consistency of 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:23.790
 this cream is like that of a milk 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:26.310
 body now I want to show you see the 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.110
 consistency looks just like milk for 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:34.979
 the body is very delicate is not heavy 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.040
 as a cream and a very fragrance 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.170
 very feminine delicate in my opinion but 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.750
 I really like it because it leaves the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.409
 slightly perfumed skin but of a 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.479
 perfume I can't say is a bibbiano 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.850
 I'm not the one describing it 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.100
 perfumes however leave a very scent 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.220
 very very delicate it is very moisturizing 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.229
 on the skin because it contains larganÃ  le 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.090
 co-ownership we know them all and flowers 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.369
 orange are and are those that 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.049
 give this provocation so 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.820
 good is not as aggressive as perfume and 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.890
 delicate you make all its certificates 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.730
 of the case a deadline from the opening to 6 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.500
 so here's what we have found very 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.940
 well they managed to put it 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.650
 quietly in the summer just because 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.270
 as he said it is not a fat cream 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.920
 so I think it fits all 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.900
 skin types because point is a lot 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.490
 delicate and that I liked 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.670
 I really use it too 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.130
 after I happen to pass by the goal 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.720
 it never made me so itchy 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.400
 after the razor blade 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.010
 so this means still hydrate 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.410
 well then his job of treating it 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.360
 do and after that apply hear it 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.120
 skin goes from here just that perfumed the 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.350
 you really do n't know how it feels 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.970
 velvety 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.630
 I don't know how much I liked it then 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.730
 here you are with me liked it because it is not 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.570
 one of those fat creams succeeds 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:59.660
 be nutritious and moisturizing without 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.430
 being fat for this is absorbed 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.239
 easily leaves a good feeling 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.430
 sudo is not rare on the skin and therefore here 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.380
 I say for my skin type 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.540
