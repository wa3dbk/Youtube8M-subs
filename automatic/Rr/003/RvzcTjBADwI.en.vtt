matchup<00:00:32.870> I<00:00:32.930> think<00:00:32.960> it's<00:00:33.289> much<00:00:33.469> better<00:00:33.710> than

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
matchup I think it's much better than

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.099 
matchup I think it's much better than
Manny<00:00:34.370> Pacquiao<00:00:34.850> for<00:00:35.090> joshua<00:00:35.510> clottey<00:00:35.690> I

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109 
Manny Pacquiao for joshua clottey I

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:37.930 
Manny Pacquiao for joshua clottey I
think<00:00:36.680> it's<00:00:36.800> a<00:00:36.829> bit<00:00:37.010> more<00:00:37.219> convincing<00:00:37.820> because

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
think it's a bit more convincing because

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.569 
think it's a bit more convincing because
you<00:00:38.629> know<00:00:38.750> this<00:00:38.960> is<00:00:39.019> a<00:00:39.140> matchup<00:00:39.379> I'm<00:00:40.250> not<00:00:40.429> going

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
Pacquiao's number one now you know it

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.880 
Pacquiao's number one now you know it
puts<00:00:56.839> together<00:00:56.989> number<00:00:57.499> two<00:00:57.679> and<00:00:57.859> number

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
puts together number two and number

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.329 
puts together number two and number
three<00:00:58.719> Mosley<00:00:59.719> and<00:00:59.870> on<00:01:00.079> may<00:01:00.260> work<00:01:00.499> so<00:01:00.890> it<00:01:01.159> is<00:01:01.309> a

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
three Mosley and on may work so it is a
