top of this roof then from this roof you

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.060 
top of this roof then from this roof you
want<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.890> follow<00:02:19.040> where<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.670> go<00:02:20.570> just<00:02:21.230> jump<00:02:22.010> on

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
on top of this correct and then yeah

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.410 
on top of this correct and then yeah

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
should be outside the map from here you

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.150 
should be outside the map from here you
currently<00:02:29.780> do<00:02:29.930> much<00:02:30.200> it's<00:02:30.380> not<00:02:30.470> read<00:02:30.860> that

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
currently do much it's not read that

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.940 
currently do much it's not read that
good<00:02:32.030> but<00:02:32.239> it's<00:02:32.360> still<00:02:32.390> an<00:02:32.900> ugly<00:02:33.440> man<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:33.830> can

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
good but it's still an ugly man you can

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.440 
good but it's still an ugly man you can
do<00:02:34.040> quite<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.370> bit<00:02:34.459> you<00:02:34.610> can<00:02:34.700> walk<00:02:34.850> on<00:02:35.000> this<00:02:35.180> road

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
do quite a bit you can walk on this road

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.900 
do quite a bit you can walk on this road
you<00:02:35.660> can<00:02:35.780> hide<00:02:35.959> in<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.170> bushes<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:37.880> can

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
you can hide in the bushes you can

you can hide in the bushes you can
that's<00:02:40.910> all<00:02:41.150> right<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:42.220> then<00:02:43.220> from<00:02:43.430> here

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
that's all right and then from here

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.970 
that's all right and then from here
right<00:02:44.540> here<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:44.900> like<00:02:45.079> from<00:02:45.380> outside<00:02:45.739> about<00:02:45.920> to

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
right here is like from outside about to

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.440 
right here is like from outside about to
inside<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.459> month<00:02:46.610> is<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.760> one-way<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.090> barrier

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
inside the month is a one-way a barrier

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.880 
inside the month is a one-way a barrier
and<00:02:47.750> for<00:02:48.140> some<00:02:48.290> reason<00:02:48.320> you<00:02:48.680> can<00:02:48.769> actually

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
and for some reason you can actually

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.000 
and for some reason you can actually
just<00:02:49.130> walk<00:02:49.370> straight<00:02:49.579> through<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.950> from<00:02:51.950> here

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
just walk straight through and from here

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.170 
just walk straight through and from here

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
video my friend was like spinning on the

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:24.940 
video my friend was like spinning on the
helicopter<00:03:23.959> you<00:03:24.139> want<00:03:24.409> to<00:03:24.469> win<00:03:24.560> till<00:03:24.769> it<00:03:24.829> gets

helicopter you want to win till it gets

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.940 
helicopter you want to win till it gets
low<00:03:25.099> enough<00:03:25.250> jump<00:03:25.879> like<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.120> see<00:03:26.569> there<00:03:26.950> we

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
low enough jump like a see there we

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.089 
low enough jump like a see there we
should<00:03:28.129> land<00:03:28.280> on<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.519> barrier<00:03:30.760> so<00:03:31.900> now<00:03:33.010> if<00:03:34.010> you

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
should land on the barrier so now if you

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.129 
should land on the barrier so now if you
don't<00:03:34.250> have<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.549> strength<00:03:34.819> this<00:03:35.540> where<00:03:35.870> we'll

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
don't have the strength this where we'll

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.170 
don't have the strength this where we'll
be<00:03:36.169> hopefully<00:03:36.859> a<00:03:37.069> lot<00:03:37.220> easier<00:03:37.579> for<00:03:37.849> you<00:03:38.030> guys

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
be hopefully a lot easier for you guys

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.140 
be hopefully a lot easier for you guys
cause<00:03:38.859> it<00:03:39.859> all<00:03:39.950> just<00:03:40.129> depends<00:03:40.430> on<00:03:40.549> how<00:03:40.760> could

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
cause it all just depends on how could

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.339

like so just move on here
from<00:04:20.209> here<00:04:20.420> you<00:04:20.660> want<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:20.840> eduware<00:04:21.110> course

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
from here you want to eduware course

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.000 
from here you want to eduware course
across<00:04:23.030> them<00:04:23.300> up<00:04:23.390> to<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.600> edge<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:24.230> then<00:04:24.830> for

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
across them up to the edge and then for

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.800 
across them up to the edge and then for
me<00:04:25.160> you<00:04:25.310> want<00:04:25.430> to<00:04:25.460> be<00:04:25.550> careful<00:04:25.760> because<00:04:26.150> thing

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
me you want to be careful because thing

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.060 
me you want to be careful because thing
on<00:04:26.900> that<00:04:27.020> side<00:04:27.290> I<00:04:27.320> think<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.620> bar<00:04:27.800> is<00:04:27.890> a<00:04:27.950> lot

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
on that side I think the bar is a lot

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.620 
on that side I think the bar is a lot
more<00:04:28.100> higher<00:04:28.430> so<00:04:28.730> you<00:04:28.760> have<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.150> be<00:04:29.360> really

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
more higher so you have to be really

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.790 
more higher so you have to be really
really<00:04:29.660> careful<00:04:29.990> so<00:04:30.410> you<00:04:30.440> don't<00:04:30.530> kill

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
really careful so you don't kill

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.330 
really careful so you don't kill
yourself<00:04:31.030> since<00:04:32.030> no<00:04:32.270> one<00:04:32.360> can<00:04:32.480> revive<00:04:32.750> you<00:04:33.340> so

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
yourself since no one can revive you so

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.740 
yourself since no one can revive you so
now<00:04:34.580> you're<00:04:34.700> like<00:04:35.030> on<00:04:35.180> top<00:04:35.330> of<00:04:35.450> this<00:04:35.510> roof

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
now you're like on top of this roof

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.630 
now you're like on top of this roof
without<00:04:36.080> stretch<00:04:36.620> jump<00:04:36.860> maybe<00:04:37.250> that<00:04:37.460> way<00:04:37.550> it

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
without stretch jump maybe that way it

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.980 
without stretch jump maybe that way it
could<00:04:37.790> be<00:04:37.880> easier<00:04:38.120> for<00:04:38.180> you<00:04:38.390> or<00:04:38.720> maybe<00:04:38.840> the
