00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360
 now to 211 bavarians I want to get off the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.710
 200 I want to go down from 200 onwards very 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.889
 good morning, I am all glare and 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.450
 welcome to reaction time good today 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.880
 I bring a pretty random game and that 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.170
 seen by internet and said look high 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.140
 to make a video of this because it's 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.150
 something that I'm not exactly good at 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.710
 you are going to see that pretty simple eye 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.660
 the game is very simple is to do 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.449
 clicks basically and see the reaction 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.859
 that you have your ability to react 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.540
 you can try it with me is down here 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.770
 in the description I will play a couple of better 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.510
 of this is that there is a lot of 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.100
 internet and I've seen for the most 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.680
 fun are the most colorful 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.719
 so to say it so let's start with 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.329
 reaction time let's get together 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.969
 microphone over here and you're going to see the bad 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.129
 or the good or the bad that I am basically 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.570
 wait I have a time we have here already 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.050
 our our keyboard what we have 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.440
 what to do basically is to give the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.899
 bodies to the pentagons to the to the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.969
 wings geometrical bodies to that I do not 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.640
 the word comes out I know in short let's go for 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.659
 there to see I have to hit the play and 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.119
 1321 go 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.119
 ok let's go let's go let's go 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.910
 and it is already 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.810
 the game is already really not going to be able to 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.600
 no no no subtract this I do not have 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.680
 let's comment let's go, host, host 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.220
 It is done 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.010
 faster reaction time 028 to brett rachel 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.260
 048 I do not have to improve that I shit on 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.560
 the tail seems that if you fail many 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.420
 times are if you do not do it fast the game 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.040
 it ends soon but if it is continuously 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.630
 doing it the game can last then 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.010
 up to minutes and minutes of light or not what 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.570
 I know we will be again largar 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.440
 because I do not think the game is 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:53.050
 only this not or if we do not follow it 3 2 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:56.660
 1 there is let's go let's go let's go let's go 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.369
 by God is very complicated is complicated 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.820
 complicated complicated all of the 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:06.950
 areas 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:09.920
 come on 123456789 ubs 78 I want to do 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.030
 minimum 10 minimum 10 you have to do 10 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.050
 least 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.250
 aa a aa rafa jover is that it is very 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.250
 difficult I shit in the area 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.150
 my reaction capacity is damn 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.770
 fuck damn fuck is there is moto2 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.450
 just click to see how many clicks 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.030
 to do in a minute and those games are 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.920
 they look like the colo pointer there is 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.080
 companions who do it divinely well 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.090
 they make records and record but to me this is 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.160
 they will see super bad reaction 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.020
 and you know why I was wrong 10 color 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.770
 I already know why I was wrong with the counter 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.980
 strike to see why music is 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.600
 fantastic ah ah ah ah ah ah no I can not 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.390
 could not do more than ten

 see who makes the record of 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.520
 mica ball subscribers with clicking 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.580
 click click click mouse click go 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.350

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.920
 [Music] 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.920
 Y 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.910

 i 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.760
 7 is not complicated is super 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.620
 complicated 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.430
 sure that xp that makes 29 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.430

 I want to see yours I want to dance 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.720
 we are in another game that is pretty 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.220
 simpler and there is also a ranking what 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.599
 which is much better on the other 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.500
 I think he did not have any ranking but 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.090
 well the other game a lot more 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.540
 fun this just waiting for the 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.940
 bounce the green color and click 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.430
 see what record I make and average as is 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.829
 average 0 ms traysesa we have five 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.019
 attempts and then we measure the average of 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.870
 the microseconds or milliseconds better 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.030
 said that we endure doing this the 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.370
 music is still super epic we know 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.650
 arrives more epic not impossible click to 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.180
 start let's get there come with fort 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.520
 greene 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.910
 [Music] 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.280
 now 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.739
 221 what is the average I do not know what is the 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.020
 average of the people but 2 121 is 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:28.000
 pretty pretty well they did not tell me 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.000
 shit in the cradle we continue worth 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:39.320
 now at 211 we go I want to get off the 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.320
 200 I want to go down from 200 onwards 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.710
 1 209 my mother 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.379
 pointed out let's go ball you have to go down 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:55.180
 of the 200 I have to do it I have to 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:55.180
 do it forward 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.430
 we go 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.690
 206 my god, please, I'm not going to go down 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:11.010
 the 200 in theory this is the last 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:13.590
 attempt or the penultimate 211 200 is not the 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.120
 last try wow give me to me that I'm going to 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.640
 work and plow so I think that 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.350
 I deduce that I will go down I do not know but I want 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.350
 go down 200 I want to do let's go
