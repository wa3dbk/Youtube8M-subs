 Hi everyone, how are you? 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.940
 in this video here I wanted to explain to 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.280
 You because I have not done it anymore. 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.740
 videos in Portuguese it is my parents are 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.389
 Japanese but I was born in Brazil so I 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.179
 My native language is my mother tongue. 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.680
 It really is Portuguese and it's much more 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.350
 comfortable for me to speak in Portuguese 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.390
 in English-speaking videos but when 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.600
 I started my channel five or six ago. 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.769
 years ago it had already stopped doing 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.240
 videos in english 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.880
 so I started making the video on 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.640
 Portuguese for the Brazilian public 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.570
 but even making the videos in Portuguese 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.649
 about 30% of the views were 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.809
 americans 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.579
 and I saw a lot of complaints not talking 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.160
 Why are you speaking a language that 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.350
 no one understands is if most of your 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.010
 public or speak Portuguese and really 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.570
 this is true is 30% American 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.520
 Brazilian think it was around 15% 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.770
 to 20% Japanese and even Mexicans 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.930
 I was in front of the Brazilians because 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.149
 I think at that time youtube 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.299
 It was still very weak here in Brazil. 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.090
 so I started to make videos in 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.090
 English to meet this demand since 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.869
 about 15% of my audience was speaking 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.890
 Portuguese 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.259
 and the other remaining 85% spoke some 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.600
 another language then had no more because 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.340
 to have children in Portuguese 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.530
 with the passage of time began to count 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.170
 an interesting thing that the following I 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.880
 I started doing the videos in English and 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.009
 amount of Brazilians in my channel 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.470
 started to increase and this made me feel 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.680
 in the beginning but nowadays I understand that 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.240
 What happened was the following is the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.979
 number of Brazilians in the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.689
 youtube started to increase and 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.909
 consequently the amount of 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.570
 Brazilians on my channel also started 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.780
 to increase 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.090
 good but even so it used to be 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.759
 around 15 percent and nowadays it is 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.140
 about 20% of my views 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.320
 so anyway the Brazilians 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.450
 represent a low percentage of 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.219
 views on the channel and Americans 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.799
 increased by around 50% 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.200
 of my views 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.239
 that is today no longer as 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.849
 change and go back to Portuguese 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.680
 well said that I'll still try 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.409
 put the law 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.390
 still in new videos and with time and 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:20.030
 putting the old videos too 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.000
 Do not even work much time then. 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.290
 It may take a little while, I hope. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.719
 You have understood that it was an issue 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.000
 circumstantial that led me to make the 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.739
 videos because I've heard a lot 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.569
 a lot of people introduce me and you are 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.370
 Brazilian but does not like the 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.170
 Brazilians do not want to make video 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.840
 Do you want to represent Brazilians? 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.819
 prefers the Americans and not quite like this 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.769
 And another thing for me was a lot 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.510
 I learned English because I 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.750
 I knew a little English 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.650
 is basic to pass the 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.569
 entrance exam 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.370
 but I do not speak English, I was not 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.379
 accustomed to conversing in English 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.659
 so that process was painful for me 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.959
 I had to take a lot of class and I 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:02.299
 learn to speak understand English and everything 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.700
 but then to me was also much more 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.469
 comfortable making videos and portuguese 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.150
 so I did not want to change my 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:10.069
 language for English but the demand 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.379
 forced to change the language of the 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.669
 my videos but that's it guys I hope 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.239
 that you have understood 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:16.239
 to the next
