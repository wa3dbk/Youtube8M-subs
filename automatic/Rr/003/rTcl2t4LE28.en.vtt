understanding<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.259> how<00:01:16.320> they<00:01:16.560> work<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:17.689> from

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
understanding of how they work is from

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.440 
understanding of how they work is from
where<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.229> place<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.070> mortar<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.180> have

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
where you place the mortar you have

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.399 
where you place the mortar you have
basically<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.259> bit<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.890> donut<00:01:23.580> like<00:01:24.409> frontal

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
basically a bit of a donut like frontal

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.050 
basically a bit of a donut like frontal
arc<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.799> front<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.250> where<00:01:26.549> there<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.030> a

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
arc in front of you where there is a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.999 
arc in front of you where there is a
minimum<00:01:27.330> range<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.080> mortar<00:01:28.680> has<00:01:28.860> to

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
minimum range that the mortar has to

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.310 
minimum range that the mortar has to
travel<00:01:29.250> before<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.880> detonate<00:01:30.229> so<00:01:31.229> you

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
travel before it can detonate so you

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.230 
travel before it can detonate so you
can't<00:01:31.650> call<00:01:31.920> like<00:01:32.100> Danger<00:01:32.520> Close<00:01:32.549> right<00:01:33.090> on

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
distance away from you for them to fire

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.190

and<00:01:40.799> then<00:01:41.490> again<00:01:41.759> there<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> limit<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.170> how

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
far away they can go so you can't just

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
situation this tank right here that I am

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.130 
situation this tank right here that I am
dialing<00:05:00.190> in<00:05:00.370> on<00:05:00.490> was<00:05:00.820> a<00:05:00.850> very<00:05:01.420> high<00:05:01.660> level<00:05:01.840> tank

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
dialing in on was a very high level tank

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.220 
dialing in on was a very high level tank
I<00:05:02.230> think<00:05:02.410> he<00:05:02.470> was<00:05:02.590> level<00:05:02.860> 27<00:05:03.250> or<00:05:03.460> 28<00:05:03.960> he<00:05:04.960> seemed

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
I think he was level 27 or 28 he seemed

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.870 
I think he was level 27 or 28 he seemed
to<00:05:05.290> have<00:05:05.380> the<00:05:05.620> majority<00:05:05.770> of<00:05:06.190> the<00:05:06.550> tank

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
to have the majority of the tank

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.760 
to have the majority of the tank
unlocked<00:05:07.360> and<00:05:07.570> so<00:05:07.690> he<00:05:07.840> was<00:05:07.960> just<00:05:08.080> decimating

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
unlocked and so he was just decimating

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.010 
unlocked and so he was just decimating
our<00:05:08.890> own<00:05:09.160> aircraft<00:05:09.520> and<00:05:10.180> he<00:05:10.570> had<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:10.900> AAA

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
our own aircraft and he had the AAA

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.800 
our own aircraft and he had the AAA
stuff<00:05:11.470> set<00:05:11.680> up<00:05:11.710> on<00:05:11.890> his<00:05:12.040> tank<00:05:12.310> and<00:05:12.810> getting

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
stuff set up on his tank and getting

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.830 
stuff set up on his tank and getting
ready<00:05:13.960> to<00:05:14.020> him<00:05:14.200> became<00:05:14.590> very<00:05:14.860> vital<00:05:15.690> vital<00:05:16.690> to

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.600 
ready to him became very vital vital to
the<00:05:16.990> our<00:05:17.140> team<00:05:17.380> success<00:05:17.860> because<00:05:18.250> we<00:05:18.400> just<00:05:18.520> had

to get rid of him there you saw a couple

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.580 
to get rid of him there you saw a couple
mortars<00:05:21.520> for<00:05:21.730> me<00:05:21.880> and<00:05:22.120> I<00:05:22.180> presume<00:05:22.660> a<00:05:22.900> couple<00:05:23.290> in

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
mortars for me and I presume a couple in

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.950 
mortars for me and I presume a couple in
RPG<00:05:24.130> or<00:05:24.190> two<00:05:24.430> from<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.760> infantry<00:05:25.480> further<00:05:25.720> up

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
RPG or two from the infantry further up

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.770 
RPG or two from the infantry further up
and<00:05:26.580> we<00:05:27.580> were<00:05:27.670> able<00:05:27.820> to<00:05:28.030> take<00:05:28.210> out<00:05:28.360> that<00:05:28.540> very

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
and we were able to take out that very

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.360 
and we were able to take out that very
powerful<00:05:29.230> tank<00:05:29.500> and<00:05:29.770> get<00:05:29.950> him<00:05:30.100> off<00:05:30.220> the

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
powerful tank and get him off the

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.880 
powerful tank and get him off the
battlefield<00:05:30.670> for<00:05:30.940> a<00:05:30.970> few<00:05:31.150> minutes<00:05:31.680> this<00:05:32.680> right

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
battlefield for a few minutes this right

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.620 
battlefield for a few minutes this right
here<00:05:33.160> what<00:05:33.490> you<00:05:33.520> see<00:05:33.610> me<00:05:33.850> trying<00:05:34.180> to<00:05:34.240> do<00:05:34.420> I'm

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
here what you see me trying to do I'm

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.390 
here what you see me trying to do I'm
trying<00:05:34.870> to<00:05:34.960> provide<00:05:35.230> cover<00:05:35.560> for<00:05:35.800> my<00:05:35.920> squad<00:05:36.220> has

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
trying to provide cover for my squad has

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.750 
trying to provide cover for my squad has
moved<00:05:36.610> up<00:05:37.440> but<00:05:38.440> with<00:05:38.650> the<00:05:38.950> general<00:05:39.610> in

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
moved up but with the general in

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.330 
moved up but with the general in
accuracy<00:05:40.210> of<00:05:40.390> the<00:05:40.750> mortar<00:05:41.050> this<00:05:41.410> can<00:05:41.590> prove<00:05:42.220> to

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
accuracy of the mortar this can prove to

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.800 
accuracy of the mortar this can prove to
be<00:05:42.370> a<00:05:42.490> little<00:05:42.820> bit<00:05:42.970> tricky<00:05:43.300> than<00:05:43.540> what<00:05:43.690> you

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
be a little bit tricky than what you

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.410 
be a little bit tricky than what you
might<00:05:44.020> expect<00:05:44.290> when<00:05:45.220> you<00:05:45.370> see<00:05:46.150> it<00:05:46.240> in<00:05:46.330> action

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
might expect when you see it in action

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.610 
might expect when you see it in action
with<00:05:46.690> somebody<00:05:46.930> else<00:05:47.110> there<00:05:47.290> i<00:05:47.380> got<00:05:47.500> an

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
with somebody else there i got an

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.430 
with somebody else there i got an
infantry<00:05:48.100> but<00:05:48.510> again<00:05:49.510> it<00:05:49.660> can<00:05:49.780> be<00:05:49.930> a<00:05:49.960> pretty

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
infantry but again it can be a pretty

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.990 
infantry but again it can be a pretty
tricky<00:05:50.800> as<00:05:50.950> you<00:05:51.130> can<00:05:51.220> see<00:05:51.430> on<00:05:51.520> the<00:05:51.610> map<00:05:51.760> there

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
tricky as you can see on the map there

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.730 
tricky as you can see on the map there
my<00:05:52.210> teammate<00:05:52.570> did<00:05:52.750> move<00:05:52.960> in<00:05:53.110> to<00:05:53.260> arm<00:05:53.470> the<00:05:53.620> am

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
my teammate did move in to arm the am

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.010 
my teammate did move in to arm the am
calm<00:05:53.980> and<00:05:54.010> i'm<00:05:54.250> going<00:05:54.550> to<00:05:54.700> try<00:05:55.060> to<00:05:55.180> defend<00:05:55.840> it

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
calm and i'm going to try to defend it

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.290 
calm and i'm going to try to defend it
as<00:05:56.170> best<00:05:56.950> I<00:05:57.190> can<00:05:57.250> but<00:05:57.580> it's<00:05:57.730> like<00:05:57.850> it's<00:05:58.000> sort<00:05:58.240> of

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
as best I can but it's like it's sort of

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.150 
as best I can but it's like it's sort of
like<00:05:58.360> threading<00:05:58.690> a<00:05:58.810> needle<00:05:58.840> you<00:05:59.800> might<00:05:59.980> get

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
like threading a needle you might get

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.180 
like threading a needle you might get
lucky<00:06:00.190> you<00:06:00.700> might<00:06:00.940> not<00:06:01.590> every<00:06:02.590> time<00:06:02.800> an<00:06:02.920> enemy

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
lucky you might not every time an enemy

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.070 
lucky you might not every time an enemy
fire<00:06:03.490> you<00:06:03.820> get<00:06:04.180> a<00:06:04.210> glimpse<00:06:04.570> of<00:06:04.720> them<00:06:04.900> if

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
fire you get a glimpse of them if

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.900 
fire you get a glimpse of them if
somebody<00:06:05.470> spots<00:06:05.860> them<00:06:06.100> they'll<00:06:06.310> show<00:06:06.550> up<00:06:06.730> but

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
somebody spots them they'll show up but

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.750 
somebody spots them they'll show up but
it's<00:06:07.090> very<00:06:07.240> hard<00:06:07.630> to<00:06:08.130> sort<00:06:09.130> of<00:06:09.220> guesstimate

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
it's very hard to sort of guesstimate

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.790 
it's very hard to sort of guesstimate
where<00:06:10.090> you<00:06:10.210> need<00:06:10.360> to<00:06:10.450> put<00:06:10.630> your<00:06:10.720> shots<00:06:11.020> to<00:06:11.440> fire

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
where you need to put your shots to fire

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.450 
where you need to put your shots to fire
for<00:06:12.070> effect<00:06:12.630> here<00:06:13.630> you'll<00:06:13.810> see<00:06:14.160> they<00:06:15.160> just

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
for effect here you'll see they just

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.430 
for effect here you'll see they just
disarmed<00:06:15.940> it<00:06:16.030> just<00:06:16.300> as<00:06:16.420> I<00:06:16.540> was<00:06:16.720> dialing<00:06:16.990> in<00:06:17.260> for

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
disarmed it just as I was dialing in for

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.810 
disarmed it just as I was dialing in for
another<00:06:17.590> shot<00:06:17.950> if<00:06:18.220> I<00:06:18.400> could<00:06:18.610> have<00:06:18.700> been<00:06:18.760> a

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
another shot if I could have been a

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.100 
another shot if I could have been a
little<00:06:19.000> bit<00:06:19.180> closer<00:06:19.390> I<00:06:19.570> probably<00:06:19.810> could<00:06:20.080> have

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
little bit closer I probably could have

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.610 
little bit closer I probably could have
saved<00:06:20.350> that<00:06:20.530> but<00:06:21.450> there<00:06:22.450> I<00:06:22.480> go<00:06:22.690> I<00:06:22.720> died<00:06:23.230> in<00:06:23.260> that

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
saved that but there I go I died in that

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.340 
saved that but there I go I died in that
was<00:06:24.130> that<00:06:24.760> was<00:06:24.850> the<00:06:24.910> end<00:06:25.150> of<00:06:25.210> me<00:06:25.360> one<00:06:26.080> thing

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
was that was the end of me one thing

was that was the end of me one thing
that<00:06:26.590> does<00:06:27.660> seem<00:06:28.660> to<00:06:28.720> balance<00:06:29.140> the<00:06:29.290> motors<00:06:29.620> is

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
that does seem to balance the motors is

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.030 
that does seem to balance the motors is
that

defending yourself you are basically
standing<00:06:38.300> upright<00:06:38.570> well<00:06:38.780> I<00:06:38.810> guess<00:06:38.960> maybe

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:39.140 
standing upright well I guess maybe

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.340 
standing upright well I guess maybe

you are dead so if you don't come out of

the mortar hopefully you guys too or I

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.190 
the mortar hopefully you guys too or I
mean<00:06:54.440> do<00:06:54.590> as<00:06:54.740> well<00:06:55.010> I<00:06:55.280> mean<00:06:55.610> I<00:06:55.940> have<00:06:56.720> fun<00:06:56.930> using

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:57.200 
mean do as well I mean I have fun using

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.930 
mean do as well I mean I have fun using
it<00:06:57.440> I<00:06:57.590> know<00:06:57.860> it<00:06:58.070> probably<00:06:58.280> doesn't<00:06:58.460> make<00:06:58.790> for

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940 
it I know it probably doesn't make for

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.510 
it I know it probably doesn't make for
the<00:06:59.030> most<00:06:59.060> entertaining<00:06:59.510> of<00:07:00.020> videos<00:07:00.320> but<00:07:00.620> it

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 
the most entertaining of videos but it
