00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:37.989
 and when I was a kid and it was all 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.620
 the day doing graffiti and each one 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.940
 I was looking for his skate and I put on that and what 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.370
 I have maintained because to put you 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.960
 a nickname other because for that you would 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.120
 You put it and put it to your liking in 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.579
 overall everything attracts my attention 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.950
 since I discovered it I knew that I 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.860
 had something to say but until 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.290
 that I discovered hip hop I did not know how 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.770
 express it and when we discover it to 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.930
 from there and 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.320
 I fell in love and even today it clear that he has 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.240
 changed but always in our circle 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.640
 We have been very progressive and they have 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.680
 liked groups with open minds 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.190
 from the beginning as attracted to which 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.840
 those groups like that although we liked to 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.690
 we all felt really 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.540
 identified with groups that were 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.700
 with a broader vision and already from a 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.369
 first moment doing him 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.860
 and hip hop as bigger than what 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.689
 at first it looked like I could 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.520
 be a drum machine and a sea as 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.320
 rapping not so now let's take a 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.600
 sampler de maitei viso now we are going to 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.630
 to be taking it always to another level and 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.869
 giving it a twist always and 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.509
 I think that's why that is why today 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.340
 because hip hop is still maintained 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.609
 a music 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.770
 new because it constantly regenerates 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:58.960
 have that progressive vision and not 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:02.700
 shut yourself up to a sound of an era or 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.030
 some cliches of 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.750
 of the moment of music or of the genre in 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.520
 question yes no 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.410
 hip hop is fine but if I 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.340
 I have to jump less I will jump and that is 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.220
 the attitude 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.740
 Well, I would tell him to study 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.480
 will think of something else and make a 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.120
 man of profit and who studies something 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.959
 positive and look for life for another 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.570
 side is that as I took it as more 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.130
 I'm not too much to give 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.810
 advice but everyone has to 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.920
 explore yourself and vespa where 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.590
 you have to throw and there's no more 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.590
 everything is there in wikipedias and I'm 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.400
 working in the third and I'm very 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.650
 happy with the 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.319
 with the first thing I'm seeing from the 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.720
 disc and is showing the face and I'm cool 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.750
 I'm in that now 100 not for now 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.970
 it says some raid there like the disk 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.000
 of instrumentals and such but in Spain 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.250
 there's not much disc tracking 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.650
 instrumental and others I feel comfortable 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.659
 with 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.540
 with the brocha project because 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.220
 It is made to me and allows me 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.340
 do everything I want and more because 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.290
 I have people who like to do something 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.200
 alone has the roll that you 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.849
 you cook it you eat it and such but 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.200
 we see the collaborate with bob marley penis 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:22.239
 james brown lady the farra thousand are going to be 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.620
 now arriving I do not have any 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.599
 collaboration what 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.069
 that has not made me sleep 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:32.530
 the truth because that's what I tell you 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.650
 I work with 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.360
 with people that I feel fulfilled 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.069
 normally and I'm lucky also to 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.720
 to be able to work with another club that is not 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.459
 as for example now in the 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.620
 disc of chota that we have made a disc 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.290
 whole there simple because the seal of the 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.900
 stick has never covered anything more than a 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.940
 brand and a style and way of doing 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.569
 things like we do not cover a business and 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.470
 they did not cover anything else that comes out of there 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.870
 then he stays fucking 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.940
 because we do not have money but style we 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.640
 It is left on all four sides very well 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.519
 there are always things that bore you and there are 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.530
 things that surprise you is alive and 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.330
 is moving as well as in the rest of 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.290
 Spain 'you know things are coming out 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.730
 that surprise you 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.820
 some are stuck in their 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.070
 other style of champ alante but it's 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.320
 well it's alive there are people working with 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.540
 a lot of love in this and 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.340
 it's good going palante is good I think that 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.640
 each one has to mount his film 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.590
 and if in the end you reach the conclusion of 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.210
 that here is no place for you you think that 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.210
 outside there may be 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.620
 and follow your path and do what you do 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.040
 lack 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.070
 I do not know, it's not a path that is 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:50.430
 marked each producer 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:53.400
 they seek their way their collaborations 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.760
 it just defines its roll and that's what it 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.760
 ends up finding 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.520
 and nothing 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.819
 but no 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:41.119
 again 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.960
 yes 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.890
 yes no 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:32.240
 if not 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.600
 yes 

00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:11.769
 in my life 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:25.360
 in these centers
