00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.660
 Called this for the first time today 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.820
 to be in the puffed dinner in the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.950
 dressing gown or honey vanilla breakdown 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.780
 you need three to four lanes each 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.149
 after how many eater you are one 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.910
 packet of puff pastry preferred again 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.910
 my von henglein sugar white wine 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.640
 two cinnamon sticks three cloves one 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.820
 vanilleschote that likes a bio 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.059
 lemon a cup of honey 1 yolk and 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.370
 as a garnish or just what you are 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.020
 to eat volt vanilla sauce melted 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.500
 But I'll say chocolate later 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.940
 then something please please please 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.129
 take the time this dessert 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.720
 to prepare that is really great 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.510
 Yummy I have it for the first time 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.360
 tried and it is hammer hammer moderately 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.010
 delicious flavored as the stage is 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.250
 not only wrapped but also in 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.200
 I have a tasty spiced cooked 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.970
 today Franconian railway found in edeka 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.830
 and I'm really happy about that 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.930
 they have a very strong impression 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.600
 That's why I had hoped that 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.220
 the recipe also has to go first 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.060
 Of course you wash the pears off 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.549
 and peel 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.110
 I peeled it at the beginning who but 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.770
 by the rounding is rather something 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.600
 heavy 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.400
 then I just go from the top down 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.470
 it was definitely down below 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.810
 much easier so a little tip 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.310
 At the edge if you the stage sign then 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.710
 just peel it from top to bottom 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.799
 or from bottom to top, depending on 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.420
 yes, I have prepared two stages today 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.090
 because I did not know how much we are 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.560
 if there is anyone at all and if it is something 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.530
 and in the end I would have everything else 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.990
 Throw away but you just take it like that 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.090
 many tracks like you are bio 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.890
 lemon you feel hot and then 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.560
 cut it into rough pieces 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.630
 it need not be accurately just 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.790
 that can cook nicely 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.160
 and we cook the bernes in one 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.650
 sud from delicious white wine with spices 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.450
 and that lemon with it something 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.700
 becomes soft and then it is in the oven 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.170
 cooked to the end with puff pastry so 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.460
 the plan will be the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.320
 vanilla bean I have with one 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.200
 sharp knife cut long ago 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.060
 and that may sound like it scratched out 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.190
 there were two jocks in there the second 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.020
 come in my sugar box with me 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.120
 a little vanilla sugar then 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.860
 I cut off the lower ends with it 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.270
 the tracks can be quite whole 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.850
 important do not forget 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.640
 and now you put a pot on 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.010
 the hearth and in the meantime too 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.870
 ever the oven now at 180 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.910
 Preheat degrees in ten minutes 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.290
 we need it then and that must be nice 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.990
 be hot because only then is yours 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.640
 puff pastry also really nice and 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.830
 That's what we want, I'll give it that way now 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.270
 about 400 milliliters of white wine in there 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.110
 I have a dry franc 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.630
 occupied 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.500
 Then you give it then still quiet 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.080
 a little bit more pure 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.170
 cinnamon sticks cloves honey honey 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.510
 sugar with everything in the pot and 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.160
 cook the whole on it you can stage 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.230
 of course, be now already clean 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.570
 I just waited until it boiled up 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.640
 So it's covered on full heat 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.330
 five minutes wait then cooks the whole 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.730
 honey also with purely natural and the 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.530
 stir sugar once then I have 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.590
 put a lid on it and the whole thing 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.810
 waited for five minutes until it was even 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.480
 foams up to boil then I reduce 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.070
 the heat a bit and the stage 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.480
 So I hope you understand 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.520
 What I mean is it again 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.440
 chaotic yes there you see the way 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.630
 containers I ikea have been there 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.330
 i mean parents my cinnamon stars or 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.370
 my anis things in it and they can 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.380
 one attaches to the extractor hood 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.970
 because they are magnetic so maybe 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.000
 it is still a tip for the one or 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.130
 other exactly lid on it until the sud 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.410
 cook until it starts to simmer and 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.660
 then you give your pear pieces 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.420
 into it and leave it for 10 minutes 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.120
 simmer that makes it easy for that 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.010
 all these aromas flavors your kitchen 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.350
 after that I was allowed to promise that 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.870
 you wonderful Christmas or 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.400
 pre-Christmas as you take it and yes 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.690
 of course that she gets soft in the 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.220
 In the meantime, you can do a bit of the 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.579
 Cleaning up the kitchen is not possible 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.770
 clean up today 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.030
 I've got the puff pastry before 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.460
 rolled out and my egg yolks a bit 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.039
 whisked with a fork now you see 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.319
 already am I then taken out 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.629
 and here is this shoe you let 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:37.060
 just continue simmering until you finish 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:39.340
 In the end, all the water is overcooked 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.650
 and it gets a really tasty syrup myself 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.389
 've Eat the fans so and have me 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.289
 tongue burned because it was so hot 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.879
 Please take care 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.650
 to the syrup you just leave without 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:50.169
 lid will continue to simmer that will 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.150
 taste great in the end and now 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.669
 you may wrap your pears for them 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.860
 cooled to five minutes 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.110
 on a plate and start at the top 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.490
 with your puff pastry strip is now 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.699
 here as I have cut the longitudinal 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.280
 the puff pastry strip and wrap 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.789
 the pears just so from the top down 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.860
 below 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.360
 By the way, they keep very well 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.699
 flesh I felt worse 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.409
 presented slipperier somehow had 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.150
 fear that it will slide down but that 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.460
 It is not the case at all and it is 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.500
 right here at the end when I'm done 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.210
 with a location and it is not quite enough 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.460
 then it just sticks a bit 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.129
 It really does not work that way 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.379
 great and I think this recipe makes 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:30.669
 It's crazy and it tastes totally 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:32.529
 heavenly my father in law has 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.520
 namely just tried and was totally 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:36.069
 freaking out 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.479
 yes, if just one situation is not enough for you 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:40.449
 then you just wrap with one 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:42.879
 another location further until such time as the 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:45.669
 whole pear is wrapped and everything 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:47.409
 nicely wrapped around it and if you are 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.629
 I'll show you the same again 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:52.360
 At the second stage , give her that 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:55.839
 whole immediately on a small baking tray 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.969
 laid out with baking paper and baked it 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:00.580
 for 20 minutes all at the most 20 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:02.529
 minutes you see it at 200 degrees in 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.690
 oven puff pastry always needs big 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:06.270
 heat and little time for him 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.219
 the stove has to open up nicely 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.440
 makes really really hot 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:13.029
 Huge fun is not a done power 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.099
 not much work and you need too 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:17.379
 not much crockery as I said only 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:18.969
 this pot under oven everything else 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:21.009
 it is still clean and it really does 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:23.169
 very much 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:25.180
 in the meantime, I am tidying up again 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.789
 the 20 minutes where the two stages then 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.660
 in the oven are and take care of it 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:31.370
 where I want to put it then 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.990
 Of course you can do everything here again 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.570
 possible take what you want to 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.610
 Decorate at the end before the whole in 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.650
 The oven is brush please with that 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.960
 whisked yolk so a bit 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.670
 swallow the yolk and then it works 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.350
 Immediately in the oven that's all 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.870
 important that do not forget a money 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:50.030
 because it makes it puff pastry nice 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.640
 really nice brown and crispy and 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:55.220
 really delicious and then you can 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.830
 Of course, as always garnish with what 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.720
 always you want custard please take 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.400
 The syrup you can through a sieve 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.620
 pour no more pieces in it 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.950
 are from the lemon and it tastes good 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:09.350
 Delicious and all the flavors are 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.660

 melted chocolate also fits 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.800
 very good to the stage 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.860
 I always do that in the microwave 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.540
 at 450 was two minutes because he needs 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.370
 no water bath or anything else 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.170
