00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
caution came out at a time where I

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.830 
caution came out at a time where I
thought<00:01:02.039> sure<00:01:02.820> everyone's<00:01:03.270> going<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> pit<00:01:03.750> and

thought sure everyone's going to pit and

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.090 
thought sure everyone's going to pit and
he<00:01:03.930> says<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.290> know<00:01:04.379> if<00:01:04.500> God's<00:01:04.710> peel<00:01:04.949> off

behind<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.549> go<00:01:06.119> ahead<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.360> pit<00:01:06.689> sold<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> 48

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
behind you go ahead and pit sold the 48

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.250 
behind you go ahead and pit sold the 48
or<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.670> 24<00:01:09.150> kind<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.450> make<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> move<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
or the 24 kind of make a move to the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.590 
or the 24 kind of make a move to the
inside<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.950> assume<00:01:11.250> he<00:01:11.280> was<00:01:12.119> going<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.330> pit

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
inside so I assume he was going to pit

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.000 
inside so I assume he was going to pit
and<00:01:12.750> when<00:01:12.930> he<00:01:13.049> pulled<00:01:13.500> back<00:01:13.560> up<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and when he pulled back up on the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.679 
and when he pulled back up on the
racetrack<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.850> waited<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.360> waited<00:01:15.509> and
