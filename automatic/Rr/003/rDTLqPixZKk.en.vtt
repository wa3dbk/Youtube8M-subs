00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:21.500
 what the hell is that 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:24.680
 there and here the ritz in minecraft and 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.890
 after playing almost a year at 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.800
 minecraft has happened what was wearing a 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.170
 waiting time 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:37.739
 that and that's a loaded kripper if 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.780
 occurs when there is a storm and lightning strikes 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.940
 to sea a maximum of four blocks 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.640
 is more powerful than a cri but 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.940
 it's really twice as powerful as 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.269
 a creepers and 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.870
 the lightning has affected him then 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.489
 has a little less life but but 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.769
 it does not matter if you find this 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.769
 monstrosity in your normal game of 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:06.290
 minecraft you are dead is almost impossible 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.740
 it's better that the attack is with a bow and 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.350
 well what do you think if I proceed to 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.620
 compare the explosions for example I'm going 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.370
 to give I'm going to put here a 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.970
 an egg clipper clip flu and I 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.190
 to burst here one 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.270
 of fleet 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.710
 alright now I'll see if I get here and 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.710
 we compare for example here 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.340
 Well, the truth is that it does not show 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.450
 too much is not twice as many 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.060
 powerful and totally legal 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.939
 and nothing after a year playing 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.890
 minecraft has finally happened and I hope 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:52.860
 that you liked this special video 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.860

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.320
 what are you left the comment 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.479
 more absurd and if he is the craziest 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.509

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.509

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.320
