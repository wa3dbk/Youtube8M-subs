freedom but they don't get to have their
freedom<00:04:45.340> after<00:04:46.180> you<00:04:46.539> know<00:04:46.689> in<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:47.080> in<00:04:48.009> the

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
freedom after you know in the in the

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.670 
freedom after you know in the in the
world<00:04:48.449> after<00:04:49.449> they've<00:04:50.050> already<00:04:50.199> killed<00:04:50.500> two

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
world after they've already killed two

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.209 
world after they've already killed two
kids<00:04:50.889> so<00:04:52.229> look<00:04:53.229> maybe<00:04:53.500> I'm<00:04:53.680> being<00:04:53.860> too<00:04:53.919> harsh

00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:54.219 
kids so look maybe I'm being too harsh

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:56.429 
kids so look maybe I'm being too harsh
by<00:04:54.370> say<00:04:54.550> they<00:04:54.699> killed<00:04:54.969> but<00:04:55.840> I<00:04:55.870> don't<00:04:56.110> think<00:04:56.289> so

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:56.439 
by say they killed but I don't think so

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:58.080 
by say they killed but I don't think so
I<00:04:56.650> think<00:04:57.069> that<00:04:57.219> if<00:04:57.370> they<00:04:57.490> do<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.639> doctor

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
I think that if they do the doctor

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.570 
I think that if they do the doctor
they're<00:04:58.300> alive<00:04:58.539> they<00:04:58.930> purposely<00:04:59.710> didn't<00:05:00.370> take

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
they're alive they purposely didn't take

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.730 
they're alive they purposely didn't take
them<00:05:00.759> the<00:05:00.969> doctor<00:05:01.389> full<00:05:01.960> well<00:05:02.259> knowing<00:05:02.500> they

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
them the doctor full well knowing they

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.950 
them the doctor full well knowing they
could<00:05:02.949> die<00:05:03.099> certainly<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.180> second<00:05:04.629> one<00:05:04.750> I

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
could die certainly the second one I

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.019 
could die certainly the second one I
mean<00:05:05.409> on<00:05:05.529> the<00:05:05.620> first<00:05:05.860> one<00:05:06.129> I<00:05:06.340> might<00:05:06.789> have<00:05:06.909> made

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:07.029 
mean on the first one I might have made

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:08.580 
mean on the first one I might have made
the<00:05:07.120> mistake<00:05:07.449> of<00:05:07.479> being<00:05:07.689> slightly

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
the mistake of being slightly

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.709 
the mistake of being slightly
