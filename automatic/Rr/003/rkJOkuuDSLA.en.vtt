00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
would have been an awesome way to

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.710 
would have been an awesome way to
display<00:01:08.860> these<00:01:09.100> figures<00:01:09.580> but<00:01:10.179> we<00:01:10.300> don't<00:01:10.479> get

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.690 
display these figures but we don't get
that<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:11.259> I'll<00:01:11.740> forever<00:01:12.009> be<00:01:12.280> a<00:01:12.429> little

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
that and I'll forever be a little

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.850 
that and I'll forever be a little
disappointed<00:01:13.330> about<00:01:13.450> that<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:14.259> lion<00:01:14.470> comes

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
strange with this line because I think

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.160

on the lion himself there's a trigger

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.639 
on the lion himself there's a trigger
mechanism<00:01:47.739> I<00:01:48.580> don't<00:01:48.819> think<00:01:49.000> it<00:01:49.090> actually<00:01:49.119> does

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
mechanism I don't think it actually does

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.400 
mechanism I don't think it actually does
anything<00:01:50.649> I<00:01:51.069> can't<00:01:51.640> get<00:01:52.030> it<00:01:52.179> to<00:01:52.209> look<00:01:52.959> like<00:01:53.229> it

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
anything I can't get it to look like it

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.309 
anything I can't get it to look like it
actually<00:01:53.590> triggers<00:01:54.190> anything<00:01:54.970> at<00:01:55.090> all<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:56.259> I'm

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
actually triggers anything at all so I'm

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:58.529 
actually triggers anything at all so I'm
not<00:01:56.440> really<00:01:56.679> sure<00:01:57.099> how<00:01:57.399> it<00:01:57.580> would<00:01:58.149> have<00:01:58.300> worked

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
not really sure how it would have worked

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.029 
not really sure how it would have worked
or<00:01:58.929> if<00:01:59.020> it's<00:01:59.140> supposed<00:01:59.440> to<00:01:59.560> look<00:01:59.709> like<00:01:59.890> it

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
or if it's supposed to look like it

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:01.770 
or if it's supposed to look like it
would<00:02:00.160> have<00:02:00.250> worked<00:02:00.509> but<00:02:01.509> it's<00:02:01.660> got

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
would have worked but it's got

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.600 
would have worked but it's got
mechanisms<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:02.649> stuff<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:03.190> it<00:02:03.369> I<00:02:03.459> guess

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
mechanisms and stuff to it I guess

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.760 
mechanisms and stuff to it I guess
that's<00:02:03.849> an<00:02:04.000> important<00:02:04.479> piece<00:02:04.690> it<00:02:05.170> looks<00:02:05.500> like

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
that's an important piece it looks like

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.070 
that's an important piece it looks like
it<00:02:05.920> actually<00:02:06.280> has<00:02:06.399> some<00:02:06.640> lethality<00:02:07.000> to<00:02:07.539> it<00:02:07.750> it

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
it actually has some lethality to it it

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.059 
it actually has some lethality to it it
also<00:02:08.379> came<00:02:08.800> with<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:09.280> chain<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:10.090> a<00:02:10.989> loop<00:02:11.709> at<00:02:11.950> the

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
also came with a chain and a loop at the

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.610 
also came with a chain and a loop at the
end<00:02:12.190> of<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.430> chain<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.629> this<00:02:13.780> could<00:02:14.110> connect

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
end of the chain and this could connect

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.550 
end of the chain and this could connect
to<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:15.069> but<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:16.330> piece<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:16.870> connects<00:02:17.230> it<00:02:17.410> on

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
to it but the piece that connects it on

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.369 
to it but the piece that connects it on
mine<00:02:17.770> broke<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:19.060> really<00:02:19.900> can't<00:02:20.109> figure<00:02:20.230> out

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
mine broke and I really can't figure out

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.410 
mine broke and I really can't figure out
how<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.590> get<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.189> to<00:02:21.370> look<00:02:21.549> right<00:02:21.609> again

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
how to get it to look right again

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.910 
how to get it to look right again
it's<00:02:23.019> kind<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.379> sad<00:02:23.650> Dorothy<00:02:24.310> came<00:02:24.489> with<00:02:24.700> a

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
it's kind of sad Dorothy came with a

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.040 
it's kind of sad Dorothy came with a
real<00:02:25.220> metal<00:02:25.730> chain<00:02:26.060> for<00:02:26.420> her<00:02:26.510> necklace<00:02:27.020> and

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
real metal chain for her necklace and

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.860 
real metal chain for her necklace and
this<00:02:27.380> is<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.560> plastic<00:02:28.310> chain<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.150> feels<00:02:29.450> so

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
this is a plastic chain and it feels so

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.360 
this is a plastic chain and it feels so
brittle<00:02:30.380> it's<00:02:30.590> another<00:02:30.709> reason<00:02:30.920> I'm<00:02:31.099> afraid

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
brittle it's another reason I'm afraid

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.949 
brittle it's another reason I'm afraid
to<00:02:31.489> fix<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:31.940> I<00:02:32.000> was<00:02:32.180> just<00:02:32.209> going<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.450> put<00:02:32.630> off<00:02:32.780> to

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
to fix it I was just going to put off to

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.160 
to fix it I was just going to put off to
the<00:02:33.080> side<00:02:33.400> it's<00:02:34.400> not<00:02:34.760> too<00:02:35.450> important<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.080> the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
the side it's not too important to the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.720 
the side it's not too important to the
looks<00:02:36.380> of<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.620> whole<00:02:36.739> thing<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.280> just<00:02:37.489> feels

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
looks of the whole thing it just feels

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.220 
looks of the whole thing it just feels
like<00:02:37.849> it's<00:02:38.000> going<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.180> break<00:02:38.360> if<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:38.780> mess<00:02:39.020> with

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
like it's going to break if I mess with

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.770 
like it's going to break if I mess with
it<00:02:39.349> too<00:02:39.380> much<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:40.459> lion<00:02:40.670> also<00:02:40.910> comes<00:02:41.330> with<00:02:41.569> his

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
it too much the lion also comes with his

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.559 
it too much the lion also comes with his
guts<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:43.220> saw<00:02:43.430> in<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.670> beginning<00:02:44.000> he<00:02:44.450> was

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
guts you saw in the beginning he was

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.900 
guts you saw in the beginning he was
holding<00:02:44.989> them<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:46.220> really<00:02:46.430> can't<00:02:46.610> move<00:02:46.760> the

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
holding them you really can't move the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.880 
holding them you really can't move the
figure<00:02:47.090> around<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.840> expect<00:02:48.170> them<00:02:48.319> to<00:02:48.350> stay<00:02:48.650> in

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
figure around and expect them to stay in

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.300 
figure around and expect them to stay in
they<00:02:49.730> peg<00:02:50.180> into<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.630> part<00:02:51.050> in<00:02:51.200> his<00:02:51.350> stomach<00:02:51.739> here

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
they peg into a part in his stomach here

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.960 
they peg into a part in his stomach here
you<00:02:52.940> can<00:02:53.060> kind<00:02:53.330> of<00:02:53.450> wedge<00:02:53.660> him<00:02:53.870> in<00:02:53.959> his<00:02:54.080> hand

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
you can kind of wedge him in his hand

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.840 
you can kind of wedge him in his hand
neither<00:02:55.970> really<00:02:56.360> holds<00:02:56.750> them<00:02:56.840> in<00:02:56.959> too<00:02:57.170> well<00:02:57.380> so

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
neither really holds them in too well so

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.680 
neither really holds them in too well so
take<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:58.910> look<00:02:59.120> at<00:02:59.269> him

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
take a look at him

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.300 
take a look at him
they're<00:03:00.080> pretty<00:03:00.290> nicely<00:03:00.500> sculpted<00:03:00.680> they're

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
they're pretty nicely sculpted they're

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.740 
they're pretty nicely sculpted they're
kind<00:03:01.550> of<00:03:01.580> a<00:03:01.640> softer<00:03:02.120> rubber<00:03:02.360> which<00:03:02.660> is

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
kind of a softer rubber which is

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.059 
kind of a softer rubber which is
probably<00:03:02.989> why<00:03:03.110> they<00:03:03.260> fall<00:03:03.500> out<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.709> little<00:03:03.890> too

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
probably why they fall out a little too

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.670 
probably why they fall out a little too
much<00:03:04.280> not<00:03:04.610> really<00:03:04.850> good<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.180> peg<00:03:05.420> in<00:03:05.600> there<00:03:05.870> I'm

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
much not really good to peg in there I'm

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.750 
much not really good to peg in there I'm
gonna<00:03:06.769> put<00:03:06.830> them<00:03:07.040> off<00:03:07.100> to<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.310> side<00:03:07.340> for<00:03:07.730> now

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
gonna put them off to the side for now

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.979 
gonna put them off to the side for now
and<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.600> sculpting<00:03:09.230> on<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.620> lion<00:03:09.890> is

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
and the sculpting on the lion is

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.610 
and the sculpting on the lion is
phenomenal<00:03:11.989> it's<00:03:12.860> got<00:03:13.010> kind<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.640> Romanesque

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
phenomenal it's got kind of a Romanesque

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.880 
phenomenal it's got kind of a Romanesque
kind<00:03:15.620> of<00:03:15.769> armor<00:03:16.310> going<00:03:16.700> on<00:03:16.880> here<00:03:17.450> it's<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.500> belt

with some pouches honestly it kind of

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.229 
with some pouches honestly it kind of
reminds<00:03:21.590> me<00:03:21.680> of<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:21.890> predator<00:03:22.370> I<00:03:22.580> know<00:03:22.790> what

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.500 
someone is elbow it's a neat look it's
cool<00:03:31.190> because<00:03:31.400> it<00:03:31.579> kind<00:03:31.760> of<00:03:31.850> is<00:03:31.910> reminiscent

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510
