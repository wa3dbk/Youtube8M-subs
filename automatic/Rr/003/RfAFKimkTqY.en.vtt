00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:10.470
 Hello, my name is Sergey, I'm 22 

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:13.840
 of the year and I am from Russia I am from the city of Barnaul 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:18.390
 I recently participated in an international 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.560
 marathon on piano and synthesizer and 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.330
 actually decided to write a small 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:33.609
 I worked on the model synthesizer 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:36.760
 m30 before marathon skills per se 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:39.670
 I didn't have a game. Well, I bought a synthesizer. 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.870
 for a long time but somehow put off learning 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:48.030
 for the future here are the people in the marathon I 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:55.600
 worked for two months during this period was 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:59.829
 dismantled 20 songs well and in the course of training 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:04.449
 the songs were given still different themes different 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:08.710
 subtleties of the game and so on in general which 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.920
 progress after these 20 lessons I in 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:16.840
 first learned to read notes in the second 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:20.350
 make chords in the third studied 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:26.799
 different there are more details on the game such 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.820
 like staccato legato and so on 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.520
 I remember 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:36.580
 First I liked the feed 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:39.180
 material that is first teacher 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.770
 explains in detail how to play 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.009
 what difficulties may arise like with 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.770
 fight them 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:51.430
 plus it is still very comfortable 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:55.479
 simulator which shows how how 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.780
 finger what note to play and difficulties 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:02.259
 practically no altogether arises 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:07.720
 and if there is only the beginning of 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:09.119
 inexperience the material is fed simple to 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.180
 complex 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.849
 so that 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:21.359
 each subsequent lesson is learned 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:24.900
 easier previous in general marathons and 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:27.230
 I was satisfied I will not say that after 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.849
 marathon I became a professional player 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:39.620
 but I already have the skills I'm going 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:41.760
 continue learning well and I recommend you 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.409
 sign up for this marathon 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.040
 learn to achieve results and good luck 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.040
 until
