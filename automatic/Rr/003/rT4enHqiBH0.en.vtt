00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:13.719
 dear tech video friends today vi 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.330
 we present our video review 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.340
 of the blackberry z 30 a terminal that is 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.860
 on the market for a couple of months 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.360
 in fact more than a video review in the 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.329
 show me technical features 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.730
 software is a way to express yourself 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.320
 our impressions our points 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.509
 view on the pros and cons of this 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.750
 worthy successor blackberry terminal 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:37.059
 of the zeta 10 this black barry z 30 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.339
 represents the tip of the current tip 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.589
 of the company blackberry diamond the 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:44.039
 terminal that represents the tip of 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:47.530
 carried out after precisely the blackberry z10 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:49.120
 towards a touch more future and less qwerty 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.780
 from this point of view of the 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.859
 blackberry company that just gave 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.469
 more than others 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.390
 the possibility to qwerty keyboard of 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.899
 establish itself on the market 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.929
 blackberry z 30 is a smartphone with 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:07.840
 operating system blackberry or s 10.2 

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:09.490
 then the latest version available the 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.630
 zone 30 a qualcomm processor 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:16.840
 snapdragon s4 prof dual core from 1.7 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.369
 gigahertz so certainly not the most 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.840
 fast on the market but process 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.819
 processor that allows this 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.890
 terminal to carry out the main ones 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:28.959
 even multimedia functions without 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:31.840
 too many problems at 16 gigabytes of memory 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:35.860
 internal with the possibility of extending 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:40.599
 memory through micro sd up to 64 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.950
 gigabyte the thing that more than blackberry 

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:44.259
 has improved compared to the predecessor 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.849
 at zero to ten and certainly the screen 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:50.140
 here is a 5 inch super amoled with 16 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:54.250
 millions of colors and they are all 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.780
 1280 x 720 pixel solutions 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.940
 also in this case compared to the 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.780
 competition we think of the latest iphone or 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.780
 to the latest model of galaxy s 4 la 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.300
 resolution is not at those levels however it is 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.640
 a resolution that allows you to enjoy 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.650
 full of hd features for both 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.849
 regarding the apps that the sector 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.090
 multimedia 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:18.190
 in total it is generally a smartphone 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.930
 that 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:26.230
 from a great sense of robustness to the 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.520
 despite his 5 of his screen 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.790
 inches is not overly large 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.000
 and its dimensions are large 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:41.560
 quite in the standard e 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.170
 allow you to always carry it with you but 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.250
 even for the most demanding in the pocket 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:52.600
 of the jacket the height is 147 mm 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.970
 width of 72 mm and the thickness of 9.4 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.520
 mm the merits 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.870
 therefore I am at the hardware level of 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.060
 construction in the envelope area in the 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.090
 robustness in the quality of materials e 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.390
 especially in the back certain from the 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.030
 video camera cannot be understood very well 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.520
 the quality but we really assure you 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.070
 an excellent quality and above all exempt 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.480
 from scratches and therefore from imperfections of the 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:23.380
 genre and in general the touch experience 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.720
 the work is felt and evident 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.489
 who did blackberry to bring 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.700
 its terminals we said from a full house 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.870
 qwerty to a full touch 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.489
 as regards then the 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.100
 hardware features 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.640
 we are obviously a step backwards 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.280
 compared to the big players but the user 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.020
 blackberry to be should be 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.690
 users other than b's that I del 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.580
 market ie its blackberry 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.120
 intention was to produce one 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.370
 smartphone that allows you to play 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.980
 all the main functions and also 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:01.060
 the most contextual multimedia ones in the 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:04.060
 best way possible and with the most with 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.120
 a high degree of simplicity therefore 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.040
 for those who want a phone that is not 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.110
 just a phone but it's also one 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.300
 this blackberry multimedia machine 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.519
 surely it is an excellent choice 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.580
 especially because it comes from models already 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:21.180
 of blackberries preceding one of the flaws 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:25.830
 more may be the one linked to the 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:29.699
 vocal still little availability of 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:33.240
 of ap the blackberry world is a market 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:36.689
 which however is growing grows by day 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.750
 in the day we promise to arrive if not 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:42.360
 at google play android level 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.349
 android or di 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.509
 of ios of the app store of anyway of 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:51.689
 carrying on the terminal was a series of 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:53.129
 apps that come close to that 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:55.139
 of the sectors in this case we see 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:57.810
 precisely the presence of whatsapp di 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:01.979
 facebook or the main social networks 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.520
 voter network of Italian news 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.680
 and foreign 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.719
 a particularity compared to 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.530
 competitors or on this blackberry for 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:14.039
 closing the app you switch to windows 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.560
 8 from bottom to top up last 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:20.969
 used you have seen remain in 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.250
 background and then active alongside 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:25.590
 all applications installed that me 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.629
 then here organized in folders for later 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.680
 going to close the recent apps is enough 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:30.389
 a tap in 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.860
 one of the most interesting features of 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.189
 this black bird in the alp in optics 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.080
 blackberry is that of a then 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:40.439
 very simple access just a swipe 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.259
 from left to right for 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:45.599
 go to all notifications 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.490
 notifications concerning accounts 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:50.879
 that has set twitter then and 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.500
 facebook rather than e- mail addresses 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:56.460
 whatever 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.949
 one of the faults of this one of this 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.599
 terminal beyond then of the little 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.849
 vastness of applications we have it 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:04.680
 found and we don't know if caused 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:07.710
 from our from this our model in 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:11.699
 try but we don't believe from the not simple 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.090
 access to the folders created by us ie 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.550
 for 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.610
 to not have all the applications like 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.169
 for example on individual ios on the window 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.850
 we have organized this in a folder 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.610
 as on other terminals difference of 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.449
 other terminals here, however, on blackberry 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.300
 you should return to the screen 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:30.430
 initial with a swipe from bottom to top 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.650
 up as they close 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.680
 However, applications are not always easy 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:39.100
 in fact you see that even with a swipe 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:42.210
 from bottom to top it is not 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:44.680
 always easy to come back, indeed 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.389
 impossible to return to in the 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.729
 main screen is the thing is 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:51.190
 quite unpleasant because if yes 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:54.160
 consider turning off and then turning on 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:56.950
 the terminal is able to unlock the 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.680
 home screen but back to the 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:02.280
 folder just displayed you see only 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.000
 after several attempts you can 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.160
 return to Rome 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.220
 so this is one of the facts that for 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.240
 as for me it is a lot 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.979
 nasty because i'm usual 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.949
 organize a lot in a folder and then if 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:17.289
 however it is not your determinant or if 

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:19.539
 you know that maybe it's not a fault 

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:22.780
 presents on other models so be it a 

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:24.220
 blackberry 30 that we repeat is 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.169
 currently the state of the art 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.419
 a blackberry company a company 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:31.210
 company that we know is in 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:34.300
 difficulty but that knows all the merit of 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:36.490
 having worked to rejuvenate the sui 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.900
 products and content with a system 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.130
 operational that can be approached 

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:43.930
 that of competitors 

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:46.150
 successful operation or not will be the 

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:48.190
 future to say and above all it will be 

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:51.580
 the interest of developers and 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:55.030
 users in expanding their app park 

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:57.220
 for the moment blackberry z 30 in 

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:59.979
 sale at 599 euros on the price list 

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:02.260
 represents a very worthy choice like 

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:06.450
 valid alternative to samsung and apple 

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.450
 a greeting and the next
