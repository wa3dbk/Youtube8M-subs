00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
marking Gail out of course um first

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.679 
marking Gail out of course um first
thing<00:00:18.100> is<00:00:18.310> this<00:00:18.460> has<00:00:18.670> to<00:00:18.789> go<00:00:18.910> through<00:00:19.119> a<00:00:19.210> girth

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
thing is this has to go through a girth

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.779 
thing is this has to go through a girth
so<00:00:20.019> I<00:00:20.050> have<00:00:20.230> my<00:00:20.410> saddle<00:00:20.830> on<00:00:20.949> but<00:00:21.460> it<00:00:21.550> will<00:00:21.699> my

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
so I have my saddle on but it will my

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.089 
so I have my saddle on but it will my
girth<00:00:22.029> on<00:00:22.240> yeah<00:00:22.449> so<00:00:23.380> what<00:00:23.529> I'm<00:00:23.619> going<00:00:23.769> to<00:00:23.800> do<00:00:23.980> is

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
girth on yeah so what I'm going to do is

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.640 
girth on yeah so what I'm going to do is
you<00:00:24.220> can<00:00:24.369> either<00:00:24.550> unbuckle<00:00:25.390> it<00:00:25.480> here<00:00:25.869> or<00:00:26.259> which

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
you can either unbuckle it here or which

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.890 
you can either unbuckle it here or which
it<00:00:26.800> might<00:00:26.919> be<00:00:27.070> simpler<00:00:27.519> to<00:00:27.820> ask<00:00:28.330> the<00:00:28.539> horse<00:00:28.660> and

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
it might be simpler to ask the horse and

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.019 
it might be simpler to ask the horse and
pick<00:00:29.019> his<00:00:29.140> head<00:00:29.320> up<00:00:29.439> you<00:00:30.130> place<00:00:30.369> it<00:00:30.550> over<00:00:30.699> his

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
pick his head up you place it over his

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.050 
pick his head up you place it over his
neck<00:00:31.060> and<00:00:31.770> then<00:00:32.770> you<00:00:32.920> simply<00:00:33.370> take<00:00:33.670> the<00:00:33.880> lead

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.060 
neck and then you simply take the lead

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.990 
neck and then you simply take the lead
rope<00:00:34.530> undo<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.649> lead<00:00:35.860> rope<00:00:36.070> still<00:00:36.579> holding<00:00:36.910> on

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
rope undo the lead rope still holding on

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.310 
rope undo the lead rope still holding on
to<00:00:37.030> your<00:00:37.300> horse<00:00:37.539> and<00:00:37.860> redo<00:00:38.860> it<00:00:38.980> so<00:00:40.199> that<00:00:41.199> this

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
to your horse and redo it so that this

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.400 
to your horse and redo it so that this
is<00:00:41.440> around<00:00:41.649> his<00:00:41.890> neck<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:43.390> I<00:00:43.660> let<00:00:44.020> this<00:00:44.199> sit

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
is around his neck so I let this sit

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:52.349 
is around his neck so I let this sit
around<00:00:44.590> his<00:00:44.800> neck<00:00:44.980> I<00:00:46.020> take<00:00:47.020> my<00:00:47.199> car<00:00:47.609> okay

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:57.470 

put<00:00:53.359> my<00:00:53.480> grandpa

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.720 

and<00:00:57.690> then<00:00:58.140> I'm<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.500> take<00:00:58.740> the<00:00:58.920> girth<00:00:59.130> and

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
and then I'm going to take the girth and

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.040 
and then I'm going to take the girth and
I'm<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.150> reach<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.450> under<00:01:00.720> the<00:01:00.840> horse

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
I'm going to reach it under the horse

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.690 
I'm going to reach it under the horse
I'm<00:01:01.260> not<00:01:01.530> going<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.740> go<00:01:01.830> under<00:01:02.130> the<00:01:02.160> horse<00:01:02.490> I'm

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
I'm not going to go under the horse I'm

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.780 
I'm not going to go under the horse I'm
only<00:01:02.940> reaching<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.620> grab<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.280> end<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
only reaching and I grab the end of the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.980 
only reaching and I grab the end of the
martingale<00:01:06.120> and<00:01:06.950> I<00:01:07.950> speed<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.550> girth<00:01:08.990> through

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
martingale and I speed the girth through

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.150 
martingale and I speed the girth through
the<00:01:10.200> loop<00:01:10.440> on<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> martingale<00:01:11.600> like<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:13.160> and

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
the loop on the martingale like this and

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.190 
the loop on the martingale like this and
once<00:01:14.400> that's<00:01:14.610> done<00:01:14.910> I<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.420> walk<00:01:15.750> around<00:01:16.110> to

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
once that's done I can walk around to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.930 
once that's done I can walk around to
the<00:01:16.260> other<00:01:16.320> side<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.979> attach<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.610> growth<00:01:17.790> on

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
the other side and attach the growth on

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:37.560 
the other side and attach the growth on
the<00:01:18.030> other<00:01:18.180> side

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.680 

okay<00:01:38.230> so<00:01:39.070> now<00:01:40.030> I've<00:01:40.150> got<00:01:40.300> the<00:01:40.420> martingale

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
okay so now I've got the martingale

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.110 
okay so now I've got the martingale
attached<00:01:41.050> to<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.500> girth<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:42.670> next<00:01:42.970> would<00:01:43.090> be

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
attached to the girth the next would be

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.390 
attached to the girth the next would be
to<00:01:43.240> attach<00:01:43.660> it<00:01:43.870> to<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:43.990> reins<00:01:44.380> so<00:01:45.160> again<00:01:45.310> I

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
to attach it to the reins so again I

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.350 
to attach it to the reins so again I
talked<00:01:45.610> about<00:01:45.850> that<00:01:45.940> when<00:01:46.060> you<00:01:46.150> take<00:01:46.300> your

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
talked about that when you take your

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.880 
talked about that when you take your
bridle<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:48.280> your<00:01:49.090> horse<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:50.350> happens<00:01:50.680> is<00:01:50.800> the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
bridle on your horse what happens is the

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.070 
bridle on your horse what happens is the
reins<00:01:51.130> go<00:01:51.280> through<00:01:51.760> the<00:01:52.330> running<00:01:52.630> martingale

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
reins go through the running martingale

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.520 
reins go through the running martingale
and<00:01:53.700> what<00:01:54.700> you<00:01:54.820> do<00:01:54.970> is<00:01:55.210> you<00:01:55.990> want<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.200> put<00:01:56.440> your

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
and what you do is you want to put your

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.000 
and what you do is you want to put your
bridle<00:01:56.830> on<00:01:56.950> your<00:01:57.130> horse<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.560> I<00:01:59.620> would<00:01:59.830> suggest

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
bridle on your horse so I would suggest

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.890 
bridle on your horse so I would suggest
doing<00:02:00.550> this<00:02:00.760> before<00:02:01.180> you<00:02:01.270> put<00:02:01.300> your<00:02:01.540> bottle<00:02:01.810> on

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
doing this before you put your bottle on

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.969 
doing this before you put your bottle on
your<00:02:02.020> horse<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:03.190> again<00:02:03.540> reigns<00:02:04.650> go<00:02:05.650> over<00:02:05.890> the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
your horse and again reigns go over the

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.940 
your horse and again reigns go over the
horse's<00:02:06.340> head<00:02:08.429> halter<00:02:09.750> comes<00:02:10.750> off<00:02:10.990> it<00:02:11.830> goes

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
horse's head halter comes off it goes

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.370 
horse's head halter comes off it goes
around<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.370> horse's<00:02:12.670> neck<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.870> we<00:02:14.020> still<00:02:14.230> have

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
around the horse's neck so we still have

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.590 
around the horse's neck so we still have
control<00:02:14.590> over<00:02:14.770> him<00:02:15.160> if<00:02:15.820> he<00:02:16.000> drops<00:02:16.270> his<00:02:16.450> head

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
control over him if he drops his head

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.699 
control over him if he drops his head
when<00:02:16.780> you're<00:02:16.870> trying<00:02:17.020> to<00:02:17.170> do<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.380> so<00:02:17.530> he's

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
when you're trying to do it so he's

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.250 
when you're trying to do it so he's
eating<00:02:18.010> lunch<00:02:18.190> right<00:02:18.280> now<00:02:18.550> I'm<00:02:18.850> interrupting

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
eating lunch right now I'm interrupting

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.590 
eating lunch right now I'm interrupting
you<00:02:20.260> can<00:02:20.410> whip<00:02:20.620> simply<00:02:21.340> loop<00:02:21.610> your<00:02:21.850> arm<00:02:22.240> around

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
you can whip simply loop your arm around

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.180 
you can whip simply loop your arm around
underneath<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.290> horse<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:23.680> ask<00:02:23.770> him<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.010> pick

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
underneath the horse and ask him to pick

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:36.890 
underneath the horse and ask him to pick
his<00:02:24.310> head<00:02:24.490> up<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:28.590> then<00:02:30.180> we<00:02:31.180> put<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.930> bridle<00:02:32.170> on

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.339 

so<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.530> vital<00:02:37.799> goes<00:02:37.950> on

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.110 

and<00:02:44.950> we're<00:02:45.069> checking<00:02:45.189> all<00:02:45.459> this<00:02:45.670> job<00:02:45.909> so

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
and we're checking all this job so

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:55.649 
and we're checking all this job so
throat<00:02:46.390> latch<00:02:49.829> through<00:02:50.829> its<00:02:50.950> keepers<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:55.480> the

throat latch through its keepers and the

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.750 
throat latch through its keepers and the
nose<00:02:55.810> band<00:02:56.079> and<00:02:56.920> oftentimes<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.519> want<00:02:57.700> to

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
nose band and oftentimes you want to

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.009 
nose band and oftentimes you want to
make<00:02:57.879> sure<00:02:57.909> horse<00:02:58.329> is<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.480> Chilean<00:02:58.840> when<00:02:58.959> you

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
make sure horse is a Chilean when you

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.149 
make sure horse is a Chilean when you
put<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.260> nose<00:02:59.409> band<00:02:59.590> so<00:02:59.769> I'm<00:02:59.859> going<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.040> let

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
put the nose band so I'm going to let

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.099 
put the nose band so I'm going to let
him<00:03:00.340> finish<00:03:00.459> chewing<00:03:00.819> before<00:03:01.000> I<00:03:01.359> close<00:03:01.629> his

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
him finish chewing before I close his

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.740 
him finish chewing before I close his
nose<00:03:02.379> there<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:03.700> while<00:03:03.849> he's<00:03:04.030> doing<00:03:04.180> that<00:03:04.329> I'm

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
nose there so while he's doing that I'm

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.140 
nose there so while he's doing that I'm
going<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.739> show<00:03:05.859> you<00:03:05.889> how<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.340> put<00:03:06.549> the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
going to show you how to put the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.610 
going to show you how to put the
martingale<00:03:07.510> on<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:10.780> see<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.019> loops<00:03:11.169> where

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
martingale on so you see the loops where

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.720 
martingale on so you see the loops where
we<00:03:11.680> talked<00:03:11.859> about<00:03:12.040> how<00:03:12.099> to<00:03:12.159> run<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.370> martingale

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
we talked about how to run a martingale

you take your reins unbuckle the reins
it's<00:03:18.849> very<00:03:19.060> important<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.629> keep<00:03:19.810> a<00:03:19.840> hold

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
it's very important that you keep a hold

it's very important that you keep a hold
of<00:03:20.319> your<00:03:20.439> horse<00:03:20.650> like<00:03:20.829> this<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:22.120> you're<00:03:22.209> going

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
brain goes through the martingale then

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.289

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
reins and make sure make sure that there

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.689 
reins and make sure make sure that there
are<00:03:49.359> no<00:03:49.629> twists<00:03:50.290> in<00:03:50.680> your<00:03:50.889> reins<00:03:51.159> before<00:03:51.609> you

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:51.699 
are no twists in your reins before you

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.780 
are no twists in your reins before you
buckle<00:03:52.060> them<00:03:52.180> again<00:03:52.449> and<00:03:53.199> then<00:03:54.069> yuri<00:03:54.400> buckle

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
buckle them again and then yuri buckle

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.130 
buckle them again and then yuri buckle
them

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.140 

you<00:03:59.770> put<00:03:59.950> them<00:04:00.130> back<00:04:00.340> through<00:04:00.640> their<00:04:00.790> keeper

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
you put them back through their keeper

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.980 
you put them back through their keeper
so<00:04:02.140> that's<00:04:02.860> how<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.069> would<00:04:03.190> do<00:04:03.340> this<00:04:03.480> now<00:04:04.480> it's

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
so that's how you would do this now it's

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.370 
so that's how you would do this now it's
a<00:04:05.050> lot<00:04:05.230> of<00:04:05.260> work<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.680> do<00:04:05.860> um<00:04:06.660> but<00:04:07.660> I<00:04:07.930> hate<00:04:08.140> to<00:04:08.230> say

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
a lot of work to do um but I hate to say

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.020 
a lot of work to do um but I hate to say
you<00:04:08.620> normally<00:04:08.950> don't<00:04:09.069> lead<00:04:09.370> a<00:04:09.400> horse<00:04:09.790> with

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
you normally don't lead a horse with

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.910 
you normally don't lead a horse with
that<00:04:10.209> duck<00:04:10.480> so<00:04:11.140> you<00:04:11.200> wouldn't<00:04:11.560> want<00:04:11.770> to<00:04:11.800> put

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
that duck so you wouldn't want to put

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.590 
that duck so you wouldn't want to put
all<00:04:12.069> this<00:04:12.220> on<00:04:12.400> until<00:04:12.730> you've<00:04:12.970> gotten<00:04:13.330> to<00:04:13.450> where

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
all this on until you've gotten to where

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.480 
all this on until you've gotten to where
you<00:04:13.720> were<00:04:13.840> going<00:04:14.020> to<00:04:14.080> ride<00:04:14.319> the<00:04:14.950> proper<00:04:15.340> way<00:04:15.459> to

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
you were going to ride the proper way to

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.430 
you were going to ride the proper way to
lead<00:04:15.820> a<00:04:15.850> horse<00:04:16.180> with<00:04:16.540> a<00:04:16.570> running<00:04:16.840> martingale

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
lead a horse with a running martingale

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.130 
lead a horse with a running martingale
is<00:04:17.680> I<00:04:18.250> believe<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.609> reins<00:04:18.940> on<00:04:19.239> and<00:04:19.630> just<00:04:19.959> leave

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
is I believe the reins on and just leave

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.920 
is I believe the reins on and just leave
them<00:04:20.350> like<00:04:20.500> this<00:04:20.530> or<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.640> better<00:04:21.940> way<00:04:22.240> is<00:04:22.600> to

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
them like this or the better way is to

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.650 
them like this or the better way is to
actually<00:04:23.260> undo<00:04:23.980> it<00:04:24.130> so<00:04:25.030> you<00:04:25.120> take<00:04:25.240> the<00:04:25.480> reins

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
actually undo it so you take the reins

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.650 
actually undo it so you take the reins
back<00:04:25.900> off<00:04:26.550> you<00:04:27.550> take<00:04:27.730> them<00:04:27.940> out<00:04:28.120> of<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.419> loops

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.159 

like<00:04:31.660> this<00:04:33.360> you<00:04:34.360> make<00:04:34.510> sure<00:04:34.630> this<00:04:34.750> is<00:04:34.930> pulled

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
like this you make sure this is pulled

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.630 
like this you make sure this is pulled
through<00:04:35.260> and<00:04:35.710> you<00:04:35.890> simply<00:04:36.190> loop<00:04:37.000> this<00:04:38.640> like

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
through and you simply loop this like

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.630 
through and you simply loop this like
that<00:04:39.850> just<00:04:40.120> a<00:04:40.210> simple<00:04:40.360> knot<00:04:40.690> um<00:04:41.310> to<00:04:42.310> make<00:04:42.430> sure

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
that just a simple knot um to make sure

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.220 
that just a simple knot um to make sure
that<00:04:42.730> it's<00:04:42.910> not<00:04:43.000> dangling<00:04:43.480> and<00:04:43.720> locking<00:04:44.110> into

that it's not dangling and locking into
