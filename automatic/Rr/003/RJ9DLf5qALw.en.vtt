highest place and start doing pull-ups
on<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.150> basically<00:00:24.269> H<00:00:24.689> point<00:00:24.930> alternatives

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
on it so basically H point alternatives

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.220 
on it so basically H point alternatives
if<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.640> don't<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.390> smith<00:00:27.840> machine<00:00:27.869> or

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
if you don't have a smith machine or

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.169 
if you don't have a smith machine or
doesn't<00:00:28.410> have<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> pull-up<00:00:28.800> bar<00:00:29.010> then<00:00:29.730> use<00:00:30.060> a

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
doesn't have a pull-up bar then use a

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.999 
doesn't have a pull-up bar then use a
lot<00:00:30.480> pull<00:00:30.720> down<00:00:30.929> also<00:00:31.320> if<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.560> find<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
lot pull down also if you find the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.650 
lot pull down also if you find the
pull-ups<00:00:32.309> too<00:00:32.550> hard<00:00:32.730> for<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.969> then<00:00:33.270> also<00:00:33.420> use

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
pull-ups too hard for you then also use

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.870 
pull-ups too hard for you then also use
a<00:00:33.690> lot<00:00:33.930> pull<00:00:34.110> down<00:00:34.290> which<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.530> easier<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.460> it's

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
a lot pull down which is easier and it's

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.080 
a lot pull down which is easier and it's
an<00:00:36.030> alternative<00:00:36.660> for<00:00:36.870> pull<00:00:37.050> ups<00:00:38.090> this

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
an alternative for pull ups this

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.020 
an alternative for pull ups this
exercise<00:00:39.450> will<00:00:39.930> work<00:00:40.200> on<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.559> width<00:00:41.250> width<00:00:41.760> of

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
exercise will work on the width width of

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.850 
exercise will work on the width width of
your<00:00:42.090> back<00:00:42.469> then<00:00:43.469> you're<00:00:43.559> going<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.739> do

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
better of course and this will

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.200 
better of course and this will

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
the plate but that's not a big problem

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.500 
the plate but that's not a big problem
because<00:03:21.070> we're<00:03:21.610> going<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.820> be<00:03:21.910> focusing

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
because we're going to be focusing

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.590 
because we're going to be focusing
mainly<00:03:23.019> on<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.470> ABS<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:25.030> it's<00:03:25.269> not<00:03:25.390> going<00:03:25.510> to

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
sore the next day because small weight

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.590 
sore the next day because small weight
and<00:03:30.660> for<00:03:31.660> final<00:03:31.959> tips<00:03:32.340> for<00:03:33.340> each<00:03:33.550> set<00:03:34.269> you're

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
and for final tips for each set you're

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.920 
and for final tips for each set you're
going<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:34.810> be<00:03:34.870> doing<00:03:34.989> eight<00:03:35.320> to<00:03:35.500> twelve<00:03:35.769> reps

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
going to be doing eight to twelve reps

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.160 
going to be doing eight to twelve reps
now<00:03:37.930> if<00:03:38.110> you<00:03:38.230> can<00:03:38.380> do<00:03:38.530> more<00:03:39.209> by<00:03:40.209> all<00:03:40.390> means<00:03:40.630> go

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
now if you can do more by all means go

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.190 
now if you can do more by all means go
for<00:03:41.200> it<00:03:41.500> do<00:03:41.769> more<00:03:42.060> but<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.510> next<00:03:43.750> time<00:03:43.810> you

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
do more than clothes and go for it go to

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.449 
do more than clothes and go for it go to
failure<00:03:55.170> but<00:03:56.170> if<00:03:56.380> you<00:03:56.470> can't<00:03:56.769> do<00:03:57.160> more<00:03:57.430> than
