00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
the reference kit to case you don't know

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.430 
the reference kit to case you don't know
the<00:03:54.790> reference<00:03:54.940> kit<00:03:55.330> is<00:03:55.540> not<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:55.959> same<00:03:56.170> wood

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
the reference kit is not the same wood

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.930 
the reference kit is not the same wood
all<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.890> way<00:03:57.010> through<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.520> way<00:03:57.610> they<00:03:57.760> make

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
all the way through the way they make

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.460 
all the way through the way they make
these<00:03:58.060> drums<00:03:58.420> as<00:03:58.630> they<00:03:58.750> do<00:03:58.810> different<00:03:59.290> woods

these drums as they do different woods

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.070 
these drums as they do different woods
so<00:04:00.099> they<00:04:00.130> can<00:04:00.370> make<00:04:00.550> they<00:04:01.120> can<00:04:01.300> bring<00:04:01.840> each

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
so they can make they can bring each

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.900 
so they can make they can bring each
drum<00:04:02.380> to<00:04:02.560> bring<00:04:02.739> it's<00:04:02.860> true<00:04:03.069> fundamentals<00:04:03.760> out

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910
