 high responsibility 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.489
 important in the federal government 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.880
 I suppose it was more comfortable to work 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.560
 in the office that you had there 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.630

 win by the will of the citizens 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.280
 in a plebiscite in the convent of 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.020
 acatzingo in the atrium I was a local deputy 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.330
 after three attempts if there 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.790
 had a godfather like some politicians 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.750
 of many parties not just mine 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.360
 I would have been a deputy 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.480
 immediately I was first substitute and 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.190
 after I went I was the owner and good 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.730
 made campaigns over 25 years 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.020
 for federal deputies in the pp here 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.640
 I can give the name of Jesus Arab and 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.160
 ordoño for my first campaign in which 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.460
 participate was the leader of the front 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.200
 juvenile and in the municipality the secretary 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.060
 Youth Action Center in Tibet 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.040
 when jesús sarabia and rodríguez 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.750
 rest was our candidate to 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.980
 MP and as different after 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.470
 all experience this experience 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.900
 policy a device as big as the 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.600
 that brings the opposition candidate for the 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.910
 candidate that was sent from home puebla 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.250
 it is very clear and it is they are 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.990
 preparing a state election 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.960
 undoubtedly they have used all 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.750
 public costs there are more than 11 complaints 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.760
 before the electoral body five of them 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.660
 they are perfectly typified and 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.630
 sanctioned and in that sense the campaign 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.890
 of us serves the legal part 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.280
 we know that they have infringed on 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.890
 the law 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.290
 we know that the organ has been cheated 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.760
 electoral because when you put a banner 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.220
 strong plastic that are prohibited 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.660
 by the law and when you put them in the 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.610
 urban equipment that is also 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.250
 prohibited by law and in each post 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.420
 They put a banner on them because they talk about 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.010
 one of an act of abuse and a mockery to 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.500
 the electoral bodies but good that 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.660
 it's an issue that I hope and the authority 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.370
 electoral process is given to respect 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.060
 who are cheating and who 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.520
 are making illegal use of 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.010
 We cut spaces 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.370
 prepared so that with the force of 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:56.360
 people with the strength of the people we have 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.400
 a choice and we can win that attempt 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.470
 who want to make electoral fraud 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.980
 the day of the day and an election 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:07.090
 of state that is perfectly 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.090
 checked is perfectly 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:15.080
 accredited there are legal elements there 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:19.030
 even notarial elements there are proofs 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:22.340
 more than 89 documentary evidence 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.759
 public and notarized with the 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.219
 that we can prove the 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:31.069
 action of the action candidate 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:32.330
 national towards a state election 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:33.949
 that we are going to win with the strength of 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:38.889
 undoubtedly us people 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:38.889
 apristas cracks now in the bread look 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.939
 they say no but I do not know if in 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.099
 effect have participated at some time 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:47.319
 and he knew he said that the pri pernet with him 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:51.099
 when it competes against the pri but that is 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:53.680
 a pri that was already in the past that is 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:55.629
 the old pri that is the real first 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.889
 in front of which should pri old and 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:59.589
 finally us 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:02.110
 now in this fight that we are 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:03.399
 leading I must say that fernando us 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.399
 they are supporting forces of all 

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:07.569
 public parties precisely for that reason 

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:09.249
 a lot of PAN leaders 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:11.740
 they have supported us we have what does not fit 

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:14.520
 tepeaca in tepatlaxco because they say the 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.370
 candidate of the bank is bread 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.710
 is an invention that also came to 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.169
 make fun of us because he won a 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.909
 election in 2013 the local amozoc and 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:25.199
 the children hanged did not take possession of 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:27.539
 charge and told them he was going to give 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.470
 buenos aires solved today alejandro tú 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:30.240
 anticipates is that this election 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.099
 particularly in this district go away 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.169
 to solve at the polls or in 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:35.490
 not good courts will be resolved in 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.199
 the polls because we will win us 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.419
 with the strength of the people 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:42.770
 juridically good sure really 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:46.680
 there will have to be elements to be able 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:48.720
 prove the legality of the process and the 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.759
 legitimacy will sound the legality 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.710
 will be the documents that are going to 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:55.440
 accredit one last question alejandro 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:58.169
 I remember very well a photograph of you in 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.330
 the newspapers published about two 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:02.699
 months maybe a month and a half surrounded by 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.990
 police the state police you 

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:06.150
 did you ever imagine in that 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.979
 circumstance not but when one 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.539
 participate in this you know the risks that 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:11.130
 you have and if indeed we were attacked 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:14.129
 by the police 

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:16.500
 we know that the state police apparatus 

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:19.409
 and the state attorney's office will be 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.849
 trying to invent anything we 

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:23.550
 they will want to plant some 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:25.889
 substance of those psychotropic with the 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.990
 that later worries you and does not bother me 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:29.699
 it does not take away my sleep because in any case 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:32.159
 they will be wrong they have me 

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:33.779
 completely clean record I have 25 

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:36.240
 years of political trajectory and they are not going to 

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:37.830
 stain a path if they do it is 

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.559
 a number that will return them because 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.729
 I am from the region I do not come with everything 

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:44.719
 respect I say it for my friends 

00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:47.189
 veracruzanos I do not come from veracruz or from 

00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:49.919
 Guanajuato or any other state I am 

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:52.259
 poblano he is a native of the earth 

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:54.479
 made the plane made in the region and by 

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:55.919
 so this is the campaign both the 

00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:58.169
 Ricardo and mine is the campaign of the 

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:59.879
 village is the campaign of the regions the 

00:07:58.169 --> 00:08:02.249
 pride of the region which is going to 

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:04.499
 impose before the attempts of a 

00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:08.309
 state election that is going to fail with
