falling off right now but pretty much I

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.309 
falling off right now but pretty much I
know<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.410> order<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.099> want<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.549> be<00:02:56.760> in

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
I'm gonna start from the middle and work

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.130 
I'm gonna start from the middle and work
my<00:03:01.650> way<00:03:01.920> outwards<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:03.269> take<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.660> big<00:03:03.810> one<00:03:03.989> um

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.690 
my way outwards so take the big one um
you're<00:03:04.379> going<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.590> put<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.010> glue<00:03:05.160> onto<00:03:05.430> the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
you're going to put the glue onto the

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.670 
you're going to put the glue onto the
surface<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.150> then<00:03:06.329> put<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.660> jewel<00:03:06.840> on<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:07.560> the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
surface and then put the jewel on to the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.589 
surface and then put the jewel on to the
barrette<00:03:07.980> rather<00:03:08.640> than<00:03:08.910> putting<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.269> glue<00:03:09.450> on

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
barrette rather than putting the glue on

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.630 
barrette rather than putting the glue on
the<00:03:09.660> jewel<00:03:10.650> but<00:03:10.920> either<00:03:11.129> way<00:03:11.370> it<00:03:11.459> could<00:03:11.609> work

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
the jewel but either way it could work

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.000 
the jewel but either way it could work
but<00:03:11.819> I'm<00:03:12.269> just<00:03:12.540> going<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.780> do<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:13.049> this<00:03:13.140> way<00:03:13.349> so

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
but I'm just going to do it this way so

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.530 
but I'm just going to do it this way so
there's<00:03:14.190> glue<00:03:14.430> dripping<00:03:14.819> out<00:03:14.970> of<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.299> glue

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
there's glue dripping out of the glue

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.720 
there's glue dripping out of the glue
gun<00:03:15.690> if<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.870> can<00:03:16.079> see<00:03:16.290> I'm<00:03:16.530> just<00:03:17.099> going<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.310> dab

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
gun if you can see I'm just going to dab

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.170 
gun if you can see I'm just going to dab
that<00:03:17.760> onto<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.389> center<00:03:18.690> of<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:20.150> barrette<00:03:21.150> and

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
that onto the center of the barrette and

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.110 
that onto the center of the barrette and
squeeze<00:03:21.930> some<00:03:22.200> more<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:25.739> spread<00:03:26.099> it<00:03:26.220> out<00:03:26.370> like

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
squeeze some more and spread it out like

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.729 
squeeze some more and spread it out like
so

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
so

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.659 
so
and<00:03:28.739> then<00:03:28.829> used<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.040> work<00:03:29.280> kind<00:03:29.549> of<00:03:29.609> quickly

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
and then used to work kind of quickly

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.270 
and then used to work kind of quickly
with<00:03:30.180> this<00:03:30.419> because<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:31.139> does<00:03:31.349> dry<00:03:31.919> really

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
with this because it does dry really

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.949 
with this because it does dry really
fast<00:03:33.470> press<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.680> down<00:03:34.829> and<00:03:35.190> then<00:03:35.780> get<00:03:36.780> the

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
fast press it down and then get the

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.330 
fast press it down and then get the
purple<00:03:37.260> one<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:37.950> then<00:03:38.400> press<00:03:38.819> it<00:03:39.000> down<00:03:39.239> and

purple one and then press it down and

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:50.449 
purple one and then press it down and
then<00:03:43.819> squeeze<00:03:44.819> some<00:03:45.120> more<00:03:45.269> glue<00:03:45.599> out

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.470 

and<00:03:50.549> then<00:03:52.069> just<00:03:53.069> keep<00:03:53.310> on<00:03:53.489> squeezing<00:03:53.760> glue<00:03:54.239> out

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
and then just keep on squeezing glue out

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.360 
and then just keep on squeezing glue out
and<00:03:54.719> then<00:03:54.840> pressing<00:03:55.200> your<00:03:55.530> jewel<00:03:55.769> quickly<00:03:56.250> on

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
top of it and then letting it set like

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.929 
top of it and then letting it set like
so<00:04:09.030> so<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:09.870> got<00:04:10.049> this<00:04:10.290> right<00:04:11.129> half<00:04:11.459> of<00:04:11.639> it<00:04:11.760> done

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
so so you got this right half of it done

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:12.979 
so so you got this right half of it done
and<00:04:12.060> we're<00:04:12.180> going<00:04:12.299> to<00:04:12.359> do<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.510> same<00:04:12.689> thing<00:04:12.900> on

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
and we're going to do the same thing on

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:20.150 
and we're going to do the same thing on
this<00:04:13.139> side<00:04:16.340> squeeze<00:04:18.320> pull<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.440> trigger<00:04:19.769> like

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
this side squeeze pull the trigger like

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
this side squeeze pull the trigger like
this<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:20.789> then<00:04:21.380> run<00:04:22.380> it<00:04:22.500> along<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:23.180> threat

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
this and then run it along the threat

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.909 
this and then run it along the threat
and<00:04:24.449> quickly<00:04:25.440> spread<00:04:25.680> it<00:04:26.009> out<00:04:26.160> like<00:04:26.690> so<00:04:27.690> and

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.950 

then<00:04:31.919> drop<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.639> brew<00:04:32.940> on<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.389> Rhinestone<00:04:33.840> on

then drop the brew on the Rhinestone on

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:54.500 
then drop the brew on the Rhinestone on
it<00:04:34.110> and<00:04:34.259> quickly<00:04:34.770> press<00:04:35.009> down

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.070 

like<00:04:55.510> so<00:04:55.810> so<00:04:56.520> I<00:04:57.520> just<00:04:57.700> finished<00:04:58.090> decorating

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
like so so I just finished decorating

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.100 
like so so I just finished decorating
this<00:04:59.740> barrette<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.580> look<00:05:01.300> how<00:05:01.450> cute<00:05:01.780> it<00:05:01.900> came

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
this barrette and look how cute it came

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.860 
this barrette and look how cute it came
out<00:05:02.290> so<00:05:02.830> it<00:05:03.220> took<00:05:03.400> really<00:05:03.820> less<00:05:04.180> than<00:05:04.210> probably

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
out so it took really less than probably

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.750 
out so it took really less than probably
two<00:05:05.470> minutes<00:05:05.590> or<00:05:05.890> so<00:05:06.070> to<00:05:06.370> do<00:05:06.490> this<00:05:06.550> whole

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
two minutes or so to do this whole

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.980 
two minutes or so to do this whole
barrette<00:05:07.030> and<00:05:07.410> this<00:05:08.410> is<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:08.770> finished<00:05:09.100> result
