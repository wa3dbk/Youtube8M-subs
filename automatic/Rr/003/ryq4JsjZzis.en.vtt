that's all you have to do but if you

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.310

want<00:07:11.340> to<00:07:11.430> convert<00:07:11.730> them<00:07:11.970> for<00:07:12.450> Xbox<00:07:12.900> one<00:07:12.990> all

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320 
want to convert them for Xbox one all

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.200 
want to convert them for Xbox one all
you've<00:07:13.410> got<00:07:13.500> to<00:07:13.590> do<00:07:13.710> is<00:07:13.920> press<00:07:14.460> Y<00:07:14.850> and<00:07:15.120> then

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
you've got to do is press Y and then

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.060 
you've got to do is press Y and then
upload<00:07:15.900> save<00:07:16.200> it<00:07:16.440> might<00:07:16.620> take<00:07:16.830> a<00:07:16.860> while

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.070 
upload save it might take a while

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.130 
upload save it might take a while
depending<00:07:17.130> on<00:07:17.670> the<00:07:17.790> world<00:07:17.970> size<00:07:18.300> and<00:07:18.690> then

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:19.140 
depending on the world size and then

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.870 
depending on the world size and then
you've<00:07:19.320> got<00:07:19.440> a<00:07:19.470> go<00:07:19.650> onto<00:07:19.980> the<00:07:20.070> Xbox<00:07:20.460> one<00:07:20.670> and

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 
you've got a go onto the Xbox one and

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.390 
you've got a go onto the Xbox one and
then<00:07:21.000> press<00:07:21.210> X<00:07:21.480> on<00:07:21.810> your<00:07:21.990> Xbox<00:07:22.440> one<00:07:22.650> when

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 
then press X on your Xbox one when

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.860 
then press X on your Xbox one when
you're<00:07:23.550> on<00:07:23.640> the<00:07:23.940> Minecraft<00:07:24.150> menu<00:07:24.660> like<00:07:24.810> this

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:24.870 
you're on the Minecraft menu like this

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.590 
you're on the Minecraft menu like this
so<00:07:25.830> it's<00:07:26.070> quite<00:07:26.220> confusing<00:07:26.430> about<00:07:26.940> the<00:07:27.240> moment

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:27.600 
so it's quite confusing about the moment

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.600 
so it's quite confusing about the moment
the<00:07:27.690> update<00:07:28.020> it<00:07:28.440> does<00:07:28.620> not<00:07:28.830> work<00:07:29.010> they're

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610 
the update it does not work they're

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:30.980 
the update it does not work they're
patching<00:07:29.820> out<00:07:30.120> hopefully<00:07:30.330> in<00:07:30.600> a<00:07:30.660> couple<00:07:30.690> of

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:30.990 
patching out hopefully in a couple of

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.040 
patching out hopefully in a couple of
weeks<00:07:31.200> so<00:07:31.950> yeah<00:07:32.370> I'll<00:07:33.090> probably<00:07:33.450> do<00:07:33.900> a<00:07:33.930> video

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.050 
weeks so yeah I'll probably do a video

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.140 
weeks so yeah I'll probably do a video
on<00:07:34.230> that<00:07:34.290> to<00:07:34.500> say<00:07:34.620> that<00:07:34.800> it's<00:07:34.950> done<00:07:35.160> then<00:07:35.520> but

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.150 
on that to say that it's done then but

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.630 
on that to say that it's done then but
yeah<00:07:36.270> basically<00:07:36.740> if<00:07:37.740> you<00:07:37.890> if<00:07:38.100> you<00:07:38.520> click

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:38.640 
yeah basically if you if you click

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.790 
yeah basically if you if you click
upload<00:07:38.970> save<00:07:39.360> it<00:07:39.630> will<00:07:39.750> upload<00:07:40.200> it<00:07:40.530> but<00:07:40.710> it

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 
upload save it will upload it but it

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.520 
upload save it will upload it but it
will<00:07:40.980> not<00:07:41.250> like<00:07:41.930> you<00:07:42.930> won't<00:07:43.080> be<00:07:43.140> able<00:07:43.230> to<00:07:43.290> get

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:43.530 
will not like you won't be able to get

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.440 
will not like you won't be able to get
it<00:07:43.650> on<00:07:43.800> Xbox<00:07:44.640> one<00:07:44.730> if<00:07:44.910> that<00:07:45.030> kind<00:07:45.180> of<00:07:45.270> makes

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:45.450 
it on Xbox one if that kind of makes

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.180 
it on Xbox one if that kind of makes
sense<00:07:45.630> anyway<00:07:46.410> hopefully<00:07:46.590> you<00:07:46.800> enjoyed<00:07:47.040> this

what<00:07:52.620> he<00:07:52.680> go<00:07:52.800> I<00:07:53.010> prefer<00:07:53.550> to<00:07:53.670> use<00:07:53.760> Amodeo

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:54.210 
what he go I prefer to use Amodeo

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.690 
what he go I prefer to use Amodeo
rather<00:07:54.660> than<00:07:54.810> horizon<00:07:55.350> because<00:07:55.680> it<00:07:56.400> kind<00:07:56.640> of

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:56.700 
rather than horizon because it kind of

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.270 
rather than horizon because it kind of
like<00:07:56.880> I<00:07:57.150> don't<00:07:57.420> know<00:07:57.720> it's<00:07:58.230> more<00:07:58.500> of<00:07:58.770> a<00:07:58.920> hacking

00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 
like I don't know it's more of a hacking

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.710 
like I don't know it's more of a hacking
kind<00:07:59.460> of<00:07:59.520> thing<00:07:59.670> and<00:07:59.850> this<00:07:59.970> is<00:08:00.030> just<00:08:00.180> more<00:08:00.510> of<00:08:00.570> a

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 
kind of thing and this is just more of a

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.780 
kind of thing and this is just more of a
basic<00:08:01.290> place<00:08:01.740> to<00:08:02.010> get<00:08:02.190> your<00:08:02.370> maps<00:08:02.550> and<00:08:02.730> stuff

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:02.790 
basic place to get your maps and stuff

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.120 
basic place to get your maps and stuff
