from<00:01:27.270> your<00:01:27.600> foot<00:01:27.810> being<00:01:28.049> here<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.770> here<00:01:29.130> so

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
from your foot being here to here so

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.749 
from your foot being here to here so
quickly<00:01:30.229> and<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.710> get<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.009> spin<00:01:32.369> going

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
quickly and to just get that spin going

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.359 
quickly and to just get that spin going
really<00:01:32.970> fast<00:01:33.500> for<00:01:34.500> downhill<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.250> my

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
really fast for downhill this is my

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.149 
really fast for downhill this is my
first<00:01:35.820> top<00:01:36.540> mount<00:01:36.780> speed<00:01:37.470> board<00:01:37.799> kind<00:01:38.070> of

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
first top mount speed board kind of

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.149 
first top mount speed board kind of
thing<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.750> I<00:01:39.750> think<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:40.650> really

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
thing and I think it's really

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.260 
thing and I think it's really
controllable<00:01:42.020> it's<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.350> thick<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.890> very<00:01:44.520> very

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
controllable it's so thick is very very

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.230 
controllable it's so thick is very very
stable<00:01:45.750> nice<00:01:46.649> tables<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.189> drop<00:01:47.490> too<00:01:47.729> that's

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
stable nice tables a drop too that's

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.760 
stable nice tables a drop too that's
probably<00:01:48.509> because<00:01:48.780> I'm<00:01:49.079> not<00:01:49.200> used<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.740> yet

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
probably because I'm not used to it yet

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.399 
probably because I'm not used to it yet
as<00:01:50.460> far<00:01:50.520> as<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.939> durability<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.840> haven't<00:01:52.259> hit

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
as far as the durability I haven't hit

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.230 
as far as the durability I haven't hit
it<00:01:52.530> on<00:01:52.649> anything<00:01:52.920> yet<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:54.920> pretty<00:01:55.920> durable

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
it on anything yet so pretty durable

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.060
