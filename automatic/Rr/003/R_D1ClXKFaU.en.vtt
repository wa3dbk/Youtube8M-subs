00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.670
 improvise and that you can see what it is 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.490
 one was an ice cream pot as a 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.949
 broom and I wore a mini tripod 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.050
 articulate and that as incredible as it may seem 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.570

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.300

 Our box is huge too, I do not know why. 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.570
 that this lot of air bubbles 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.059
 the model is a Greek wt 37 51 as 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.160
 It's pretty cool, it's the pressure 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.500
 but a meter 600 very high 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.080
 operation - 62 feeling they closed in 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.790
 64 and he weighs 1 kimi then gives a 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.159
 Very good stability at the time you 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.380
 record that the other team will not stay 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.689
 stirring dangerous until falling 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.610
 it also comes with this pack there Sabeg 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.650
 transport which is very important not 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.619
 only for you to transport he loves 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.830
 also protected tripod to risk on 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:27.350
 base of these feet with ball for 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:30.479
 suitable for any type of surface and 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.880
 there from head working 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.040
 of the tripod and the top of the tripod where 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.970
 will put the camera to do the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.070
 filming 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.310
 this handle you can use to 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.320
 also carry it there in the non- 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.540
 I think you're going to make it regular. 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.700
 lock and then the crank 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.700
 you lift only the part of the head 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.369
 tripod independently to discuss 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.740
 is working with three sessions in the case 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.630
 I'm opening the second session of you. 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.219
 you can also open them in a 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.649
 depending on the type of 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.600
 land you have is working 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.969
 was revealed 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.550
 only with the second open session is 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.310
 nice size for you to film 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.540
 he has these air bubbles there one in the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.150
 loss 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.200
 wing and another on head standing for you 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:22.859
 adjust the level of filming 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.769
 there the foot is adjusting to the ground and I go 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:27.299
 open his last session as well 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.069
 works independently 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.680
 how can you see the size he 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.459
 you have all the sessions open and the 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.819
 The upper part of the head is open there. 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.159
 a handle the crank will not go up 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:45.870
 nor come down for you to brake and it's also 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:48.750
 locked turning of the tripod's head 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.359
 He also does photo and film in the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.579
 vertical of just locking to put the 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:57.299
 work camera again do not run the 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:03:00.840
 risk is from the camera back the case 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:05.879
 how can I just record again now? 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.799
 I 'm going to say brake is part of the spin 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.379
 hit the head 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.650
 it goes front to back and back 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.659
 avaÃ­ so he can make a turn that 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.419
 he has no turning limit 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.729
 You can keep spinning his way there. 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:22.859
 It's very mild in case you start to 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:24.840
 to make a little noise just pass the 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.760
 gifts raikkonen resolving can 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.090
 Take this out , just get up for me. 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.400
 put the camera and go back and it was now 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.859
 a tripod and tripod comparison between 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.269
 pv that by little that it gives a 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.699
 trembling 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.379
 so this is personal I hope you 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:45.290
 Liked the video if you liked it 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:45.290
 to see his fan a strong hug and I went
