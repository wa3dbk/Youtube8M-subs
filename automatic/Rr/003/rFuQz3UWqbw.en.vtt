okay so you all know that the silver is
a<00:01:04.339> pretty<00:01:04.820> high<00:01:05.030> tone<00:01:05.330> on<00:01:05.539> the<00:01:05.570> Excalibur<00:01:06.460> now

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:17.380 
a pretty high tone on the Excalibur now
we're<00:01:07.640> going<00:01:07.789> to<00:01:07.910> test<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.780> platinum

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.780 

it's<00:01:18.170> actually<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.590> different<00:01:19.070> tone<00:01:19.280> it's<00:01:19.580> a

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
it's actually a different tone it's a

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:33.760 
it's actually a different tone it's a
lot<00:01:20.600> lower<00:01:30.100> so<00:01:31.150> there<00:01:32.150> you<00:01:32.300> have<00:01:32.360> it<00:01:32.680> there<00:01:33.680> was

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
lot lower so there you have it there was

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.810 
lot lower so there you have it there was
a<00:01:33.800> difference

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
a difference

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.970 
a difference
Platinum<00:01:35.630> does<00:01:35.840> sound<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.140> lot<00:01:36.260> like<00:01:36.470> gold<00:01:36.770> but

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
Platinum does sound a lot like gold but

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.180 
Platinum does sound a lot like gold but
it<00:01:37.100> is<00:01:37.220> distinct<00:01:37.970> noise<00:01:38.650> don't<00:01:39.650> find<00:01:39.950> a<00:01:40.040> lot<00:01:40.160> of

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
it is distinct noise don't find a lot of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.890 
it is distinct noise don't find a lot of
platinum<00:01:40.640> rings<00:01:40.880> but<00:01:41.120> I<00:01:41.150> do<00:01:41.270> find<00:01:41.630> them<00:01:41.780> on

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
platinum rings but I do find them on

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.890 
platinum rings but I do find them on
occasion<00:01:42.410> and<00:01:43.240> yesterday's<00:01:44.240> rating<00:01:44.540> I<00:01:44.630> found

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
occasion and yesterday's rating I found

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.980 
occasion and yesterday's rating I found
in<00:01:45.080> discriminant<00:01:46.070> mode<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:46.750> made<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:47.780> pretty

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
in discriminant mode and made a pretty

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.540 
in discriminant mode and made a pretty
loud<00:01:48.230> noise<00:01:48.500> it<00:01:48.770> was<00:01:48.860> one<00:01:49.100> of<00:01:49.190> those<00:01:49.280> targets

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
loud noise it was one of those targets

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.030 
loud noise it was one of those targets
that<00:01:49.940> was<00:01:50.150> on<00:01:50.360> edge<00:01:50.600> like<00:01:51.440> we<00:01:51.650> missed<00:01:51.890> it

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
that was on edge like we missed it

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.820 
that was on edge like we missed it
before<00:01:52.160> going<00:01:52.640> back<00:01:52.910> and<00:01:53.120> forth<00:01:53.470> it<00:01:54.470> shows<00:01:54.680> the

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
before going back and forth it shows the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.100 
before going back and forth it shows the
importance<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.750> searching<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:56.900> across

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
importance of searching and across

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.900 
importance of searching and across
pattern<00:01:57.820> or<00:01:58.820> checkerboard<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.479> style<00:01:59.810> what
