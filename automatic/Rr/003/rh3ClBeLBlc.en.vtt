00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:10.349
 today read everything fisherman fisherman we catch 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:17.010
 herring and that is a big shad herring 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:19.859
 there is probably a peering supposedly I will show you 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.420
 tackle on hearing however you can catch and 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.760
 she will decide now the secret of course all simple 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.539
 secrets need to have a light bait then 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.480
 you will see completely and need to have a very 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.059
 good with good soft brake 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.750
 at least four 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:43.200
 at least 4 bearings coil here I am 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.020
 I use this tackle this 4 5 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.110
 hooks usually with wings from 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.120
 plastic me with beads 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.280
 but you can buy it yourself 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.210
 it is not so difficult to do 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.420
 impose impose one way 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.789
 which I show my encyclopedia 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.100
 means when the counter does not like to 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.000
 hooks glistened here be here in this 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:14.130
 case of gold covered gold wings 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.340
 plastic and bead fishing line fishing line here 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.530
 somewhere 04 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:24.290
 she's on leashes so on 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:27.409
 so on the hook knows on the main line 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.409
 can knit 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.820
 Sinker attach which is approximate 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.850
 I use it for long cast this 15 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:44.880
 grams here and if most knit such 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.950
 piece then you can use pendant 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.390
 loop then loop cut and 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.670
 tie hooks to it 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.170
 so that this one is the same gear 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.060
 you can catch a perch 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.790
 Here basically and all as tackle for 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.090
 catching 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.470
 herring main good coil 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.160
 allows to throw 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.520
 light tackle at 30-40 meters or as 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.870
 usually goes near the shore does not fit 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.140
 stands at depth 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:23.180
 you throw give let sinker 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:26.040
 one thing and then for the flow itself 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.019
 trucks also slightly lift from 1 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:34.319
 supporting here i am showing what i caught 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:35.850
 attributed so probably this thing 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.500
 interesting place you want 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.750
 see here 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.580
 pulling her out is certainly not easy she 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:50.360
 herring is strong 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:54.900
 rake on 800 so that's got and 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:03:00.780
 i'm gentle enough rock is small and if 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:03.720
 a bunch like more skin is small and she 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.130

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.440
 herring all secrets 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.450
