00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.260
 Hello, I'm Haruka Kurebayashi. 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.060
 Today I am wearing a Yukata (summer kimono) 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:28.340
 and I'll show you how to apply Japanese makeup by combining the Kurebayashi way. 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.020
 I choose green contact lenses. Color looks like this 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.780
 Now the CC Cream. 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.840
 It also functions as a base, so my makeup base is complete with this unique product. 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.080
 Lastly I apply on the broad areas of the face. 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.100
 Such that. 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.580
 Then I'll apply the concealer. 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:13.400
 The areas that I will cover are the indented and irregular areas, such as below the eyes. 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.560
 If you gently contain bruises and mix the concealer, they will disappear. 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.300
 Fill the area in the outer corner of the eye, between the upper and lower eyelids, 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:39.640
 results in a really altered final result. So make sure you give it a try. 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:56.560
 Apply a little brighter concealer on the protruding areas such as the nose, behind the eyebrows and the like. 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.700
 If you do not have eyebrows, like me, you can hide your natural eyebrow line. 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.840
 In the nose is where I usually look. 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.740
 If you apply the powder from the top, the foundation can slide down, 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.600
 but if you apply it like this from the beginning, it will be more difficult to slide down. 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.440
 The corners of the mouth are getting covered like this. 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.820
 It will lift them up and give it a cheerful appearance, so this is an important point. 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.340
 Finished! 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.340
 I'll highlight next. 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.140
 Choosing a cream color I will apply it on the lower eyelids. 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.820
 The cream colors are close to my natural color and depending on this layer, 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.460
 the next color can come out even better. 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.620
 This was cream color. 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.000
 This type of glitter powder comes next. 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:12.980
 On top of the cream color you cover the powdered white area shining bright. 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:23.620
 Apply on the lower eyelids like this and so on the top of the nose. 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.120
 Also, at the corner of the eyebrows. 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.580
 If you apply a little bit on the upper cheeks, you'll look good, too. 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.240
 That was the highlight. 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.540
 I will choose darker brown. I will apply it very finely. 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:53.840
 Starting from the top side of the nose where the eyebrows are, apply on the inside, 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.240
 caressing down. Keep the light. 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.460
 If you try this, your nose will get a little louder. 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.620
 Can you see that? This is the side where I did not apply and, here is what I did. 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:17.500
 If you apply so far, it leaves a different impression, so this is a very important point. 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.920
 If you exaggerate, it will look a bit like the Kabuki theater, so apply it modestly. 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.180
 Such that.
