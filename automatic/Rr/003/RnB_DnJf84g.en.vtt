right here so it kind of looks like it
should<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.479> top<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.780> map<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.380> go

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
should be on top of the map and if we go

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.710 
should be on top of the map and if we go
all<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> way<00:01:46.829> down<00:01:47.280> at<00:01:47.610> Philly<00:01:47.939> we<00:01:48.570> can

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
all the way down at Philly we can

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.389 
all the way down at Philly we can
actually<00:01:48.840> see<00:01:49.110> some<00:01:49.140> gates<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.860> guess<00:01:50.250> we

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
actually see some gates so I guess we

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.389 
actually see some gates so I guess we
should<00:01:50.430> hop<00:01:50.610> down<00:01:50.820> there<00:01:51.000> now<00:01:51.149> sure<00:01:51.689> okay

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399
