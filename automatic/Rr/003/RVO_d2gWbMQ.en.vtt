the<00:01:41.150> system<00:01:41.570> we're<00:01:41.659> using<00:01:41.869> a<00:01:42.049> similar<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.619> a

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
the system we're using a similar to a

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.410 
the system we're using a similar to a
photo<00:01:42.979> array<00:01:43.159> okay<00:01:43.700> like<00:01:43.909> so<00:01:44.150> but<00:01:44.299> we're

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
photo array okay like so but we're

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.230 
photo array okay like so but we're
looking<00:01:44.659> for<00:01:44.780> hot<00:01:45.080> stuff<00:01:46.090> Andrew<00:01:47.090> made<00:01:47.210> a

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
looking for hot stuff Andrew made a

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.870 
looking for hot stuff Andrew made a
decision<00:01:47.570> early<00:01:47.960> on<00:01:47.990> that<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:49.159> give<00:01:49.729> this

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
decision early on that to give this

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.910 
decision early on that to give this
perhaps<00:01:50.119> a<00:01:50.360> more<00:01:50.509> human<00:01:50.930> feel<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.409> it<00:01:51.470> that

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
perhaps a more human feel to it that

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.280 
perhaps a more human feel to it that
each<00:01:52.100> camera<00:01:52.430> would<00:01:52.880> be<00:01:53.290> individually

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
each camera would be individually

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.620 
each camera would be individually
controlled

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
