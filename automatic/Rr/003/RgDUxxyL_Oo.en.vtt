of our videos he'll go and sweat and a
lot<00:02:17.410> more<00:02:17.440> detail<00:02:17.920> in<00:02:17.950> there<00:02:18.220> but<00:02:18.670> there's

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880

just<00:02:19.000> very<00:02:19.240> briefly<00:02:19.600> I<00:02:20.020> think<00:02:20.320> they're<00:02:20.650> the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
just very briefly I think they're the

just very briefly I think they're the
easiest<00:02:20.890> model<00:02:21.460> to<00:02:21.580> use<00:02:21.760> in<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.000> world<00:02:22.240> I<00:02:22.780> know

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
easiest model to use in the world I know

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.990

I've got the MP 14 budgeting on the site

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.860 
I've got the MP 14 budgeting on the site
for<00:03:30.790> you<00:03:31.080> and<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:33.130> single<00:03:33.940> shot<00:03:34.090> weapon<00:03:34.209> really

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
for you and a single shot weapon really

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.870 
for you and a single shot weapon really
powerful<00:03:35.320> one<00:03:35.500> of<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.650> highest<00:03:35.950> damage<00:03:36.160> the

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
powerful one of the highest damage the

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.010 
powerful one of the highest damage the
assault<00:03:37.150> rifle<00:03:37.420> class<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:37.630> think<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:37.930> is

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
assault rifle class I think it is

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.320 
assault rifle class I think it is
actually<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.380> highest<00:03:38.500> damage<00:03:38.970> if<00:03:39.970> we<00:03:40.180> just

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
actually the highest damage if we just

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.699 
actually the highest damage if we just
turn<00:03:40.480> right<00:03:40.600> before<00:03:40.930> on<00:03:41.050> but<00:03:41.170> what's<00:03:41.440> up<00:03:41.560> and

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
turn right before on but what's up and

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.699 
turn right before on but what's up and

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
left get the flash in and now if I aim

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.330 
left get the flash in and now if I aim
hold<00:03:45.160> down<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.730> right<00:03:45.850> trigger<00:03:46.560> you<00:03:47.560> get<00:03:47.770> full

hold down the right trigger you get full

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.820 
hold down the right trigger you get full
auto<00:03:48.489> is<00:03:49.300> a<00:03:49.360> really<00:03:49.810> good<00:03:49.989> speed<00:03:50.260> as<00:03:50.470> well<00:03:50.650> on

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
auto is a really good speed as well on

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.560 
auto is a really good speed as well on
advanced<00:03:51.100> warfare<00:03:51.580> and<00:03:51.790> as<00:03:51.940> you<00:03:52.060> can<00:03:52.180> see<00:03:52.420> it's

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
advanced warfare and as you can see it's

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.979 
advanced warfare and as you can see it's
deadly<00:03:53.200> accurate<00:03:53.830> it<00:03:54.640> keeps<00:03:55.000> its<00:03:55.239> accuracy<00:03:55.630> -

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
deadly accurate it keeps its accuracy -

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.080 
deadly accurate it keeps its accuracy -
doesn't<00:03:56.770> get<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.190> recoil<00:03:57.730> that<00:03:57.850> you<00:03:57.910> get<00:03:58.060> a
