00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.620
 so besides these mini I hope you 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.300
 go well today I was talking to you 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.549
 burning of the free is also called 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.870
 that the old-fashioned burning and that's it 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.420
 simply a technique that allows for 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.640
 cauterize the ends of the hair no 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.770
 only burned the existing forks 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.840
 if there is, but also to prevent 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.680
 formation of new forks during 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.539
 a very long time 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.160
 this very old method but especially 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.990
 very effective i will show you that 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.640
 right now you are going to need 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.220
 in its hydration whether it's a 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.379
 mask or a shampoo after two passes 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.050
 flat of a lighter of course or a 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.460
 candle and your brush here i'm going 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.190
 use a mixture of aloe vera gel 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.049
 from the compo and coconut oil goes 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.400
 start burning it's really very 

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:46.989
 simple just select one 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.269
 little wick accounts off stage 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.470
 then we pass the douars abrupt oil 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.710
 to bring out the hair that 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.850
 fly and then because the flame 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.260
 do not need to spend the magic 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.760
 directly in the flame just 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.280
 the guard is slightly off and that 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.320
 will burn just as well for spikes 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.470
 just approach the flame very 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.640
 gently and so will greet all alone 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.590
 advise you to apply your are 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.990
 directly on the burned wick without 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.630
 wait then just repeat 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.219
 the whole-head operation at each 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.810
 a torso of the wick 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.340
 we pass the fingers back to hair 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.479
 to bring out hair and 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.729
 then we pass the flame 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.439
 you will quickly notice that it smells 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.789
 grilled pig do not worry 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.399
 it's perfectly normal 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.929
 and the same for the little white tips or 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.219
 black to the tastes of your hair that's all 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.219
 just the points of cauterizing 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.900
 do not forget to apply your care 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.720
 immediately after burning the match 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.250
 when you burned five or six wicks 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.210
 wrap them together and secure them 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.210
 with a flat- nose pliers 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.720
 the setting can be quite heavy here 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.130
 would greet more than an hour and a half but 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.900
 he came to take his time and 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.100
 select the strands at once not 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.100
 Too fine and not kits 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.580
 we take locks big enough because 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.140
 I have fine hair but if your 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.300
 hair is thicker than mine 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.650
 who are curly at the curse do not hesitate 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.030
 especially not to take wicks 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.350
 much smaller 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.270
 because if you make your wicks too 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.230
 fat you're going to burn that a whole 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.230
 small part of the forks 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.939
 if you have hair on your shoulder blades 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.019
 or longer the burning is for you there 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.639
 just need help 2 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.959
 someone because it's very difficult self 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.540
 even if you have a little hair 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.939
 short and especially do not go back 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.079
 towards the scalp always take to 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.079
 about half the length 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.840
 and here we burned the last bit 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.070
 now I'm going to ask the rest 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.930
 of my sowing for a few hours 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.910
 on my hair 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.700
 this is the result after rinsing 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.470
 there is no longer any fork apart 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.550
 some small rebels obviously because 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.650
 we can not eliminate all 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.030
 but as you can see that 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.760
 has nothing to do with what I had 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.790
 before in comparison we see there a 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.100
 photo before burning and after cutting 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.660
 the more the burning does not really have anything to 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.850
 see and there my hair really shines 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.500
 to the tips I hope this 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.790
 video will have pleased you and you will be 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.220
 convinced by burning 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.810
 do not hesitate to consult the blog for 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.480
 more information I wrote several 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.370
 articles about it and about this I you 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.060
 say very soon on the blog and in 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.060
