fast don't use them and the route that I
took<00:01:43.229> was<00:01:44.009> don't<00:01:44.640> use<00:01:44.970> them<00:01:45.240> which<00:01:45.780> actually

took was don't use them which actually

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.800 
took was don't use them which actually
worked<00:01:46.770> out<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.100> well<00:01:47.220> because<00:01:47.780> after<00:01:48.780> you

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
worked out really well because after you

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.660 
worked out really well because after you
eat<00:01:49.170> about<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.470> think<00:01:49.860> you're<00:01:49.979> four<00:01:50.280> servings

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
eat about I think you're four servings

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.039 
eat about I think you're four servings
of<00:01:50.820> fruit<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.119> veggies<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.630> have<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> day

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
of fruit and veggies that you have a day

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.510 
of fruit and veggies that you have a day
you're<00:01:52.350> supposed<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.649> count<00:01:52.799> each<00:01:53.130> serving

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
you're supposed to count each serving

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.600 
you're supposed to count each serving
after<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.880> as<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.420> point<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.320> for<00:01:56.189> me<00:01:56.340> with

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
after that as a point and for me with

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.880 
after that as a point and for me with
not<00:01:56.820> touching<00:01:57.240> my<00:01:57.270> weekly<00:01:57.689> points<00:01:57.960> at<00:01:58.200> all<00:01:58.530> I

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
not touching my weekly points at all I

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.770 
not touching my weekly points at all I
didn't<00:01:59.399> worry<00:01:59.579> about<00:01:59.670> my<00:02:00.119> fruits<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.540> veggies

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
didn't worry about my fruits and veggies

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.080 
didn't worry about my fruits and veggies
that<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.990> ate<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.320> ate<00:02:01.560> as<00:02:01.920> many<00:02:02.159> as<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.490> wanted<00:02:02.880> and

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
that I ate I ate as many as I wanted and

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.120 
that I ate I ate as many as I wanted and
I<00:02:03.719> didn't<00:02:04.020> count<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.290> points<00:02:04.469> or<00:02:04.710> anything

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
I didn't count the points or anything

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.709 
I didn't count the points or anything
but<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.310> also<00:02:05.520> didn't<00:02:05.909> touch<00:02:06.030> my<00:02:06.180> weekly<00:02:06.450> points

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
but I also didn't touch my weekly points

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.499 
but I also didn't touch my weekly points
so<00:02:07.259> if<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.469> think<00:02:07.500> about<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.369> kind<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.819> used

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
so if you think about it I kind of used

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.449 
so if you think about it I kind of used
weekly<00:02:09.869> points<00:02:10.080> on<00:02:10.379> just<00:02:10.679> fruits<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.099> veggies

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
weekly points on just fruits and veggies

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.100 
weekly points on just fruits and veggies
in<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.970> beginning<00:02:12.360> though<00:02:12.510> those<00:02:12.780> weekly

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
in the beginning though those weekly

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.470 
in the beginning though those weekly
points<00:02:13.260> were<00:02:13.530> great<00:02:13.920> for<00:02:14.189> figuring<00:02:14.519> out<00:02:14.790> how

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
points were great for figuring out how

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.539 
points were great for figuring out how
many<00:02:15.900> points<00:02:16.170> each<00:02:16.530> different<00:02:16.829> food<00:02:17.220> is

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
many points each different food is

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.550 
many points each different food is
because<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.299> takes<00:02:18.450> some<00:02:18.689> time<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.959> figure<00:02:19.260> out

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
because it takes some time to figure out

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.890 
because it takes some time to figure out
like<00:02:19.799> what<00:02:20.280> points<00:02:20.819> each<00:02:21.180> different<00:02:21.569> type<00:02:21.780> of

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
like what points each different type of

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.039 
like what points each different type of
food<00:02:22.170> is<00:02:22.470> whatever<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:24.329> was<00:02:24.569> very<00:02:24.840> helpful

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
food is whatever and it was very helpful

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.350 
food is whatever and it was very helpful
at<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.379> end<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.769> day<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.760> be<00:02:26.790> able<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.150> use

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
at the end of the day to be able to use

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.390 
at the end of the day to be able to use
like<00:02:27.569> a<00:02:27.599> point<00:02:28.019> or<00:02:28.170> two<00:02:28.200> while<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:28.739> was<00:02:28.950> figuring

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
like a point or two while I was figuring

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.369 
like a point or two while I was figuring
out<00:02:29.549> like<00:02:29.790> how<00:02:30.180> many<00:02:30.360> points<00:02:30.540> can<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:31.019> eat<00:02:31.200> for

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
out like how many points can I eat for

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.670 
out like how many points can I eat for
breakfast<00:02:31.680> lunch<00:02:31.769> and<00:02:32.069> dinner<00:02:32.129> and<00:02:33.409> like<00:02:34.409> at

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
and try to figure out the points it'll

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.680 
and try to figure out the points it'll
give<00:06:41.190> you<00:06:41.310> pretty<00:06:41.490> accurate<00:06:42.060> but<00:06:42.360> if<00:06:42.450> you<00:06:42.540> can

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
give you pretty accurate but if you can

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.180 
give you pretty accurate but if you can
go<00:06:42.810> on<00:06:42.960> to<00:06:42.990> each<00:06:43.230> holes<00:06:43.500> you<00:06:43.680> can<00:06:43.710> fill<00:06:44.010> that<00:06:44.040> in

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
go on to each holes you can fill that in

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.520 
go on to each holes you can fill that in
and<00:06:44.550> you<00:06:44.820> can<00:06:44.940> maybe<00:06:45.120> play<00:06:45.930> around<00:06:46.170> with<00:06:46.410> like

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530 
and you can maybe play around with like

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.290 
and you can maybe play around with like
well<00:06:46.740> if<00:06:46.800> I<00:06:46.860> have<00:06:47.010> one<00:06:47.220> serving<00:06:47.640> and<00:06:47.820> a<00:06:47.880> quarter

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
well if I have one serving and a quarter

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.660 
well if I have one serving and a quarter
serving<00:06:48.780> you<00:06:49.410> might<00:06:49.620> get<00:06:49.800> the<00:06:49.920> same<00:06:50.100> amount<00:06:50.130> of

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
serving you might get the same amount of

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.760 
serving you might get the same amount of
points<00:06:51.270> for<00:06:51.750> that<00:06:51.900> and<00:06:52.170> so<00:06:52.350> you<00:06:52.410> can<00:06:52.590> get<00:06:52.710> a

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
points for that and so you can get a

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.100 
points for that and so you can get a
little<00:06:53.100> bit<00:06:53.220> more<00:06:53.340> food<00:06:53.700> for<00:06:54.000> the<00:06:54.840> same<00:06:54.990> amount

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
little bit more food for the same amount

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.720 
little bit more food for the same amount
of<00:06:55.320> points<00:06:55.530> and<00:06:55.830> so<00:06:55.920> I<00:06:55.950> always<00:06:56.220> would<00:06:56.520> play

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.730 
of points and so I always would play

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.220 
of points and so I always would play
around<00:06:56.910> with<00:06:57.060> that<00:06:57.180> and<00:06:57.420> figure<00:06:57.600> out<00:06:57.810> like<00:06:58.050> how

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:58.230 
around with that and figure out like how

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.560 
around with that and figure out like how
much<00:06:58.770> can<00:06:58.950> I<00:06:59.040> eat<00:06:59.310> before<00:07:00.030> I<00:07:00.060> go<00:07:00.180> up<00:07:00.360> to<00:07:00.390> the

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:00.570 
much can I eat before I go up to the

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.590 
much can I eat before I go up to the
next<00:07:00.810> point<00:07:01.050> and<00:07:01.410> just<00:07:02.070> play<00:07:02.340> around<00:07:02.490> and<00:07:03.000> eat

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.600 
next point and just play around and eat

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.090 
next point and just play around and eat
as<00:07:03.750> much<00:07:03.900> as<00:07:03.960> you<00:07:04.110> can<00:07:04.350> and<00:07:04.470> for<00:07:04.710> the<00:07:04.800> points
