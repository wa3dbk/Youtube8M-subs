00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
if you really look at the demography em

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.240 
if you really look at the demography em
the<00:03:25.760> demography<00:03:26.300> is<00:03:26.450> not<00:03:26.660> well<00:03:26.840> understood

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
the demography is not well understood

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.590 
the demography is not well understood
because<00:03:28.250> if<00:03:28.520> you<00:03:28.640> look<00:03:28.850> at<00:03:28.970> Colombo<00:03:29.420> for

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
because if you look at Colombo for

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.510 
because if you look at Colombo for
example<00:03:29.989> it's<00:03:30.110> a<00:03:30.170> 30<00:03:30.350> 30<00:03:30.590> 30<00:03:30.800> percent<00:03:31.190> split

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
example it's a 30 30 30 percent split

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.520 
example it's a 30 30 30 percent split
between<00:03:31.940> caramel<00:03:32.390> Muslim<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:32.870> singhalese<00:03:33.260> so

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
of course it's going to command it

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.850 
of course it's going to command it
