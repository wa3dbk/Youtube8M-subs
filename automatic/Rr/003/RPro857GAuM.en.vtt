this<00:00:43.910> is<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.180> tuber<00:00:44.750> and<00:00:45.250> I<00:00:46.250> bought<00:00:46.760> it<00:00:46.910> from

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
this is the tuber and I bought it from

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.260 
this is the tuber and I bought it from
the<00:00:47.180> store<00:00:47.390> like<00:00:48.170> Loblaws<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:49.130> as<00:00:49.880> you<00:00:50.090> can

the store like Loblaws and as you can

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.440 
the store like Loblaws and as you can
see<00:00:50.480> here<00:00:51.370> she's<00:00:52.370> developing<00:00:52.880> roots<00:00:53.150> right

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
see here she's developing roots right

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
so it doesn't really matter if you put

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.220 
so it doesn't really matter if you put
the<00:00:59.270> pot<00:00:59.450> upside<00:00:59.720> down<00:01:01.090> she<00:01:02.090> will<00:01:02.270> just<00:01:02.450> grow

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
the pot upside down she will just grow

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.330

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
you can see I started them with one

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.399 
you can see I started them with one
tuber<00:01:31.760> and<00:01:31.940> I<00:01:32.479> have<00:01:32.780> one<00:01:33.080> two<00:01:34.040> three<00:01:34.930> like<00:01:35.930> four

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
was thinking that maybe I put the super'

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.380 
was thinking that maybe I put the super'
sideways<00:01:51.080> and<00:01:51.530> it<00:01:52.280> developed<00:01:52.850> some<00:01:53.000> kind<00:01:53.330> of

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
sideways and it developed some kind of

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.440 
sideways and it developed some kind of
ice<00:01:53.680> so<00:01:54.680> look<00:01:54.920> at<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.280> leaf<00:01:55.520> it's<00:01:56.000> so

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
ice so look at the leaf it's so

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.160 
ice so look at the leaf it's so
beautiful<00:01:57.049> like<00:01:57.530> that<00:01:58.479> it's<00:01:59.479> heart-shaped

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
beautiful like that it's heart-shaped

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.190 
beautiful like that it's heart-shaped
and<00:02:00.880> like<00:02:01.880> after<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.390> rain<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:02.840> will<00:02:02.960> save

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
and like after the rain it will save

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.190 
and like after the rain it will save
some<00:02:03.380> water<00:02:03.650> like<00:02:03.890> this<00:02:04.220> one<00:02:04.549> and<00:02:05.200> another

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.690 
he did only learn by a slugs and that's
another<00:02:28.000> big<00:02:28.480> one<00:02:29.020> here<00:02:29.350> really<00:02:30.040> big<00:02:30.460> one<00:02:30.670> and
