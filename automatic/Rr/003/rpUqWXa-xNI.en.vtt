00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.269
 hi this is issiaga today I you 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.419
 make a tube 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.339
 very fast on a way to play at the 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:17.890
 guitar the piece to the opposite of 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.900
 master gims and shine is so like 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.500
 usually I will explain the 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.109
 agreements then I will explain the 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.550
 arpeggios and the rhythms we're going 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.860
 use in this song 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.290
 and finally I explain the structure 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.360
 of the song so for the chords we have 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:40.149
 four 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:48.040
 So we have the 6 miners were lured we 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:51.640
 the la and we have the floor knowing that we can 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.489
 play all chords in bar and month 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.230
 and since I'm doing tutorials 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.660
 lungs of people who are new to 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.300
 I prefer to explain the agreements 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.130
 more impossible so there I keep a 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.649
 only crossed out but if you still want 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.210
 in bar you can play them and in 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:13.640
 barring at the party 5 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.560
 and then put your finger like that 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.630
 there you can play it too in 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.729
 barÃ©tous day in bar and 5th box and then 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.010
 the ground you can play it too in 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.210
 small boat 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.159
 after to you to see me personally 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.220
 I do not hold the whole song with 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.210
 bars and I catch my wrist badly so 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.460
 after to you to see 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.479
 without a bar and that makes me just as good 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.540
 so why bother 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:45.110
 that's it for the agreements then for the 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.910
 arpeggios so each chord an arpeggio 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.350
 very specific and will keep it throughout 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.259
 of the song will not change 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:58.460
 so for the six miners 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:02:01.509
 we play the strings the story the tower on the 6th 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.509
 minors it gives 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.009
 to lure we will play the ropes of 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.009
 re sol mieus he indulges 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:18.440
 for there we play ropes of the story 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.440
 only it gives 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.820
 and for the soil we play half bass 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.820
 story 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.980
 or 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.880
 so the chord sequence chained in 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.880
 arpeggios that will give 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.700
 when it comes to rhythm, we're going 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.440
 use it only in both 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.150
 first refrains as well as all 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.630
 last of the song and we will use 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.900
 the rhythmic ba ba ba at once on 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.420
 each agreement simply 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.370
 knowing that all over the song we have 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.330
 a chord sequence that turns into 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.160
 loop after her alone how to them 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.530
 play in arpeggios or technique goes 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.630
 change but we will always be so minor 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.030
 relo and loop floor all over the 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.460
 song so left hand side you 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.580
 can not go wrong 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.340
 so now I who is the structure 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.100
 so for the introduction we play two 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.140
 times the chord sequence in arpeggios 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.050
 for the first verse we want 10 times 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.700
 the chord sequence an arpeggio 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.800
 then we have our first chorus so 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.620
 there we will play it in rhythm and 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.080
 bewitched four times the chord sequence 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.590
 the couple and two we take the arpeggios 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.960
 and we play six times the tuning sequence 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.240
 for the second chorus it's the same 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.030
 that first so in rhythmic four 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:56.560
 agreeing sequences then we have a tone 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:59.230
 we will actually play arpeggios and 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.120
 does four chord sequences happen 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.070
 the penultimate chorus that we will play 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.260
 this one exceptionally in arpeggios 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.720
 we play four chord sequences 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.790
 in arpeggios and then the last chorus of 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.210
 the song we have in rhythm and we 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.160
 play six sequences okay here's for 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.250
 this extremely fast tutorial 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.860
 I will try to make you a cover but 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.790
 maybe not now and then internship 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.550
