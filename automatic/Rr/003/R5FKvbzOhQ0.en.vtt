 like me who is a friend and my mother and 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.630
 another friend more than we had and 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.550
 We took advantage of the free time and 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.960
 first time I came safe no no no it's 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.810
 the first time we've come like this 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.910
 what good when we can come to 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.670
 visit it and well I came because in my 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.199
 case has already come in another in others 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.210
 moments that in the selection do not 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.270
 we were also the eliminator 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.890
 as with Peru and Venezuela and good 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.230
 true that there's been grateful there 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.030
 to recognize and good and we had a 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.500
 tomorrow free and happens I like your 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.170
 name is very dear to you 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.940
 flowery teams, yes I think 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.730
 that there is not a player who speaks ill of 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.920
 minuta not the truth that we are we are 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.620
 very happy because it's good 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.620
 been a person the juvenile that comes 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.320
 comes with us and good moments 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.660
 that one suddenly in children is just 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.119
 starting at that head you can go 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.900
 for for another part and in that sense 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.510
 has many 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.880
 much supports youth and 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.500
 well now we have it the biggest that 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.020
 good as a father to us like that 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.550
 who said this last cup america for 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.110
 here some criticisms to the selection by 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.910
 the way to play again in quarters 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.100
 of the end and that it was a very 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.810
 controversial against chile truth 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.000
 where Uruguay may have left 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.040
 very departed with the change you want the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.800
 it's true that they are going to me 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.470
 how to play us I saw it so so negative so 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.150
 of what was the American Cup I think that 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.110
 there were many young players that what 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.020
 good to debut in the national team that's a 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.610
 process that will be long because good 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.290
 now the tie that what not 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.810
 we are preparing that the most important thing 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.420
 although we are already going to the america cup to 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.400
 do a good paper I think it was not 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.460
 all negative I think the match against 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.320
 Peru or an image marked left there for a 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.970
 little complicated by how it happened 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.990
 but but hey that's football and have 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.030
 I left things too 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.849
 the fifa and the conmebol all those things 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.040
 that Uruguay obviously does not favor them 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.410
 you never have to make excuses but you know 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.060
 they are real so good to us 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.220
 our side 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.030
 We did everything to leave Uruguay as much 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.190
 up possible 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.260
 could not there are things to improve as 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.989
 always because it was not that we played what 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.510
 nice but there were good things 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.010
 they looked good matches were seen and 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.450
 good things to improve as there are always 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.180
 the pain is still what happened 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.250
 in that match 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.980
 yes now a little less but but good 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.680
 at the time it was hard because because 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.959
 good things happen that suddenly one does not 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.430
 can do anything between the court not 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.110
 even suddenly take reactions that 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.480
 what good then he regrets because 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.390
 then they suspend you later but good 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.269
 one is hot it is difficult suddenly 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.040
 controlled but but as I just said 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.710
 you have that feeling that good 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.840
 Uruguay becomes difficult 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.150
 in all where it will be seen even in the 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.470
 own centennial stadium is made to us 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.870
 difficult we know that I have to play 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.690
 against that they always play against that and 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.250
 well I think you have to prepare 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.950
 contract and it is getting more complicated 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.130
 the favoring of favoring or not 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.590
 Uruguay is not more, it is fair that it is fair 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.780
 the decisions that are made and of course it is 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.900
 what we always pretend because because 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.850
 well we always look how good 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.920
 to win we have to be better 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.670
 that we have to play better and 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.310
 well I'm going thing that good now times the 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.470
 referee who made us against chile then 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.650
 I was referee of the final then there's 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.820
 things that are normally clear but and 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.640
 we can not do anything because 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.100
 we even complicate ourselves not 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.540
 you can walk talking we know 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.819
 we play against everything and we have to 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.310
 prepare us 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.379
 always be 100% because what 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.849
 Contrary any doubt you know that for 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.709
 find if you would like this kind of 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.569
 situations what is your analysis in 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.400
 what it has to do does not 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.469
 much that you are in European football and 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.060
 you pretty much know how you can handle 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:08.469
 at European level also what happens in 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.260
 this type of decisions that to uruguay 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:14.469
 never favors them and never because the 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.939
 Uruguayan does not sell, does not sell, does not sell 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.849
 TV does not sell for anything in 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:20.410
 Europe in the clubs if you're Argentine and 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.870
 Brazilian sells one thing and if you're 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.370
 Uruguayan you sell another one is like this the reality 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.210
 it's like that now obviously not from now there's 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.830
 Uruguayan players have played the best 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.479
 world team now we have the case 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.070
 recent of the wii that is in the 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.560
 barcelona that is one of the best 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.510
 players 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.880
 but then the Uruguayan player 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.830
 behind the Brazilian Argentina 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.410
 suddenly about the last champion is the 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.090
 last champion of america and idea had 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.370
 to go to Uruguay to Argentina thanks to 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.740
 everyone but good are things that 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.720
 they pass and I believe that the Uruguayan does not sell 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.570
 but but good 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.010
 the Uruguayan mother when she likes the most 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.130
 when he knows he has everything against 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.600
 how good we are Uruguayan and we know 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.000
 we can can against everyone and talk a lot 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.040
 of your maximum future where you are going to play and 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.280
 he knows what will happen to his future 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.470
 it means do not modify it is difficult 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.240
 to continue in charity the now that 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.500
 we still do not have it very clear I'm 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.900
 I'm deciding on a little bit of the 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.290
 family 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.669
 seeing all the options and good the most 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.979
 important that one wants the family 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.100
 it's okay to make the decision together 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:28.500
 I already have four kids so imagine 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.270
 that is not everything economic but there is 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.910
 to think it over and take the best 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.910
 decision did not export if they talked about it 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.830
 if you are talking a lot but but good 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.139
 is the option but still not what 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.970
 we should say but as I just said one 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.110
 wants the best for the family and for 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.419
 the future of the family that the most 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.370
 important I'm going to hit the spin no no 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.440
 no no I do not think I have a choice of 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.840
 to be able to stay there 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.910
 the priority to stay there after we go 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.310
 to have time but as I always said 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.920
 I said yes when I get back I'm in 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.370
 conditions of being able to give a hand if I 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.410
 touches and peñarol well and if not good 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:07.560
 I would hope that one of my kids could 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.360
 dress her but the good we go to the last 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.590
 from me you speak of Jonathan 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.030
 Rodriguez the floridense you had it in 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.610
 benfica of companions six months also 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.520
 in the selection 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:19.100
 and the head to share these six months 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.520
 with the 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:25.370
 it's a gray very very good the truth that 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.870
 well we call together 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.550
 training we share a lot of 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.950
 things we talk about a lot of things 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.870
 we try to good in my case of not 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.570
 leave him alone and you saw that good 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.580
 when one arrives it is difficult 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.750
 being alone misses her family but 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.180
 it has a huge future 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.740
 the truth that good if yes they stay 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.240
 benfica exploit it and if it goes to another 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.120
 team can also a conditions 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.340
 barbarians and what good if you do not touch me 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.300
 continue with the special the best as 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.730
 always the same 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.160
 we are in constant contact and 

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.140
 Well, I hope you get the best 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.760
 possible and good in the selection in 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.830
 any time you will see him playing 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.290
 because because good has surprised us 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.650
 all as a partner and then to follow 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.650
 doing
