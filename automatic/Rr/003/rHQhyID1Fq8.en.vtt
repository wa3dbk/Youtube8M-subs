00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.340
 now the enemy is put on your 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.709
 doors to the closed side 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.499
 you put the block in your front hand and 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:14.349
 slightly pockets climb and foot to the side and 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:15.609
 undercutting 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:17.960
 then immediately here are the paths straight 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.179
 blow in an open body translation from the side 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.179
 hand in front 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.289
 block in a similar design more 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.520
 reliable as a circular rear kick 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.669
 many have strong foot 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.710
 therefore block conception somewhat 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.019
 dodging you guaranteed 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:37.019
 protect from any 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.010
 the same can be done by defending yourself from 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.010
 direct kick 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.600
 pay attention to then put 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.600
 worked with spring effect 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.549
 on a circular kick to the head 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.420
 younger do back stand forward 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.490
 arm and blocking it with water her strength 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.340
 lower your leg to the floor 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.350
 so that the enemy spun and he 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.820
 lost stability 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.399
 and at this moment
