when<00:00:37.469> steam<00:00:37.829> was<00:00:38.040> down<00:00:38.250> for<00:00:38.489> me<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:38.910> was<00:00:39.149> not

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
when steam was down for me so I was not

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.299 
when steam was down for me so I was not
able<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.690> choose<00:00:39.930> any<00:00:40.140> other<00:00:40.260> weapons<00:00:40.860> oh<00:00:41.100> no

able to choose any other weapons oh no

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.250 
able to choose any other weapons oh no
but<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:41.969> still<00:00:42.329> pretty<00:00:42.510> fun<00:00:42.809> round<00:00:43.020> as<00:00:43.230> a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
but it's still pretty fun round as a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.049 
but it's still pretty fun round as a
sniper<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.860> when<00:00:44.070> I'm<00:00:44.190> pretty<00:00:44.520> successful

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
sniper and when I'm pretty successful

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.560 
sniper and when I'm pretty successful
with<00:00:45.710> as<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.920> could<00:00:47.129> maybe<00:00:47.579> notice<00:00:48.360> they're

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
with as you could maybe notice they're

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.680 
with as you could maybe notice they're
in<00:00:48.690> bit<00:00:49.680> back<00:00:49.920> when<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.910> could<00:00:51.059> see<00:00:51.300> my<00:00:51.480> HUD

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
in bit back when you could see my HUD

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.860 
in bit back when you could see my HUD
it's<00:00:52.350> kind<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.559> broken<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.980> little<00:00:53.100> bit<00:00:53.309> now<00:00:53.489> and

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
it's kind of broken a little bit now and

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.209 
it's kind of broken a little bit now and
Miami<00:00:54.870> was<00:00:55.050> not<00:00:55.260> really<00:00:55.469> showing<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
Miami was not really showing but for the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.500 
Miami was not really showing but for the
sniper<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.579> guess<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:56.910> not<00:00:57.030> really<00:00:57.090> important

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.920 
those files into your TF folder and you
will<00:01:29.430> be<00:01:29.610> good<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.000> go<00:01:30.180> but<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.600> guess<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.810> would

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
will be good to go but I guess I would

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.050 
will be good to go but I guess I would
guess<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.380> guess<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.890> was<00:01:32.009> too<00:01:32.220> lazy<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.820> this

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
guess I guess I was too lazy in this

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.200 
guess I guess I was too lazy in this

before this video to do that but I have

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.350 
before this video to do that but I have
it<00:01:36.360> all<00:01:36.540> fixed<00:01:36.840> now<00:01:37.200> for<00:01:37.530> future<00:01:37.740> videos<00:01:38.360> but

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360

about the polycount update a bit talked
about<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.860> few<00:01:56.130> specific<00:01:56.250> things<00:01:56.780> first<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.930> all

tf2 community and also just want to talk
about<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.350> polycount<00:02:08.009> updated<00:02:08.280> as<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.369> whole

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
about the polycount updated as a whole

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.780 
about the polycount updated as a whole
whether<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.479> think<00:02:09.690> it's<00:02:09.810> successful<00:02:10.410> or<00:02:10.530> not

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
whether I think it's successful or not

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
whether I think it's successful or not
and<00:02:11.790> now<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:11.910> think<00:02:12.090> I'll<00:02:12.299> actually<00:02:12.360> start<00:02:12.599> with

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
and now I think I'll actually start with

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.900 
and now I think I'll actually start with
that<00:02:12.989> overall<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.040> think<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.370> polycount

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
that overall I think that polycount

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.520 
that overall I think that polycount
update<00:02:15.180> was<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.360> pretty<00:02:15.780> good<00:02:15.989> update<00:02:16.170> for

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
update was a pretty good update for

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.530 
update was a pretty good update for
valve<00:02:16.819> when<00:02:17.819> he<00:02:17.879> actually<00:02:18.150> think<00:02:18.330> about<00:02:18.390> it

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
valve when he actually think about it

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.270 
valve when he actually think about it
all<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.900> stuff<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.140> was<00:02:19.379> released<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.950> is

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
all the stuff that was released and is

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.920 
all the stuff that was released and is
the<00:02:20.580> biggest<00:02:20.790> update<00:02:21.239> that<00:02:21.420> Valve<00:02:21.629> has

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
the biggest update that Valve has

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.140 
the biggest update that Valve has
released<00:02:22.319> for<00:02:22.590> us<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:23.430> course<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:23.849> have<00:02:23.970> like

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
released for us of course we have like

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.630 
released for us of course we have like
18<00:02:24.629> new<00:02:24.810> weapons<00:02:25.290> or<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.709> think<00:02:25.890> there's<00:02:26.129> a<00:02:26.220> 15

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
18 new weapons or I think there's a 15

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.800 
18 new weapons or I think there's a 15
new<00:02:26.819> weapons<00:02:27.180> or<00:02:27.299> something<00:02:27.599> I<00:02:27.660> actually

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
new weapons or something I actually

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.150 
new weapons or something I actually
don't<00:02:27.989> know<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.260> exact<00:02:28.530> number<00:02:28.799> I'm<00:02:28.920> kind

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
don't know the exact number I'm kind

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.410 
don't know the exact number I'm kind
just<00:02:29.340> pulling<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.700> off<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.940> top<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.150> my<00:02:30.209> head

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
just pulling that off the top of my head

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.539 
just pulling that off the top of my head
but<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:30.959> lot<00:02:31.349> of<00:02:31.379> new<00:02:31.500> weapons<00:02:31.980> against<00:02:32.340> let's

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
but a lot of new weapons against let's

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.490 
but a lot of new weapons against let's
say<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.690> think<00:02:33.989> that'll<00:02:34.170> actually<00:02:34.260> did<00:02:34.470> a

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
say and I think that'll actually did a

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.319 
say and I think that'll actually did a
great<00:02:34.769> job<00:02:34.799> designing<00:02:35.220> them<00:02:35.670> all<00:02:35.849> a<00:02:36.000> lot<00:02:36.299> of

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
great job designing them all a lot of

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.539 
great job designing them all a lot of
them<00:02:36.540> have<00:02:36.840> their<00:02:37.019> own<00:02:37.260> certain<00:02:38.010> appeal<00:02:38.370> to

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
them have their own certain appeal to

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:39.770 
them have their own certain appeal to
them<00:02:38.700> they<00:02:38.819> only<00:02:38.970> have<00:02:39.150> they<00:02:39.360> all<00:02:39.450> have<00:02:39.660> their

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
them they only have they all have their

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.680 
them they only have they all have their
own<00:02:39.959> cool<00:02:40.590> little<00:02:40.739> attributes<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.549> them<00:02:41.700> and

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
own cool little attributes to them and

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.970 
own cool little attributes to them and
one<00:02:43.049> of<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.170> actually<00:02:43.379> the<00:02:43.410> cool<00:02:43.680> things<00:02:43.890> I

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
one of the actually the cool things I

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.430 
one of the actually the cool things I
think<00:02:44.040> valve<00:02:44.640> did<00:02:44.970> well<00:02:45.269> was<00:02:45.569> they<00:02:46.079> balanced

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
think valve did well was they balanced

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.140 
think valve did well was they balanced
the<00:02:46.470> weapons<00:02:46.829> quite<00:02:47.190> good<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.640> haven't<00:02:47.849> really

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
the weapons quite good I haven't really

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.869 
the weapons quite good I haven't really
actually<00:02:48.810> heard<00:02:49.349> very<00:02:49.709> many<00:02:49.860> cries<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.670> oh

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
actually heard very many cries of oh

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.729 
actually heard very many cries of oh
this<00:02:51.090> weapon<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.629> underpowered<00:02:52.110> or<00:02:52.470> this

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
this weapon is underpowered or this

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.920 
this weapon is underpowered or this
weapon<00:02:53.099> is<00:02:53.220> extremely<00:02:53.730> overpowered<00:02:54.180> quite

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
weapon is extremely overpowered quite

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.229 
weapon is extremely overpowered quite
yet<00:02:55.200> maybe<00:02:55.859> a<00:02:55.980> few<00:02:56.280> weapons<00:02:56.430> like<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.910> Sydney

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
yet maybe a few weapons like the Sydney

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.849 
yet maybe a few weapons like the Sydney
sleeper<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.750> lot<00:02:58.109> of<00:02:58.200> people<00:02:58.410> are<00:02:58.470> saying<00:02:58.739> oh

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
sleeper a lot of people are saying oh

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.860 
sleeper a lot of people are saying oh
they're<00:02:59.129> useless<00:02:59.459> but<00:03:00.120> even<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:00.690> city

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
they're useless but even the city

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.039 
they're useless but even the city
sleeper<00:03:01.319> is<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.440> lot<00:03:01.739> of<00:03:01.859> fun<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.220> use<00:03:03.019> so<00:03:04.019> I

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
sleeper is a lot of fun to use so I

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.660 
sleeper is a lot of fun to use so I
think<00:03:04.200> they'll<00:03:04.470> did<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.709> great<00:03:04.920> job<00:03:04.950> with<00:03:05.220> that

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
think they'll did a great job with that

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.670 
think they'll did a great job with that
and<00:03:05.760> that's<00:03:06.299> actually<00:03:06.569> not<00:03:06.660> really<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.930> easy

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
and that's actually not really a easy

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.620 
and that's actually not really a easy
thing<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.010> do<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.519> know<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:08.970> lot<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.239> people<00:03:09.480> have

saved valve should play test more and I

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.530

speculation that one more little
polycount<00:04:44.600> pack<00:04:44.840> is<00:04:45.020> going<00:04:45.169> to<00:04:45.229> be<00:04:45.290> released

polycount pack is going to be released

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.870 
polycount pack is going to be released
because<00:04:45.919> valve<00:04:46.160> said<00:04:46.400> that<00:04:46.520> there<00:04:46.669> is<00:04:46.790> gonna

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
because valve said that there is gonna

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.240 
because valve said that there is gonna
be<00:04:46.970> a<00:04:47.120> bonus<00:04:47.479> polycount<00:04:47.900> pack<00:04:48.139> so<00:04:48.740> basically

be a bonus polycount pack so basically

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.190

gonna<00:04:49.370> save<00:04:49.550> all<00:04:49.700> my<00:04:49.850> weapons<00:04:50.240> so<00:04:50.479> I<00:04:50.510> can<00:04:50.780> craft

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
gonna save all my weapons so I can craft

gonna save all my weapons so I can craft
that<00:04:51.470> new<00:04:51.710> packs<00:04:52.310> weapons<00:04:52.820> right<00:04:53.090> off<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:53.419> bat

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
that new packs weapons right off the bat

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.330 
that new packs weapons right off the bat
and<00:04:53.840> I<00:04:54.260> do<00:04:54.320> encourage<00:04:54.770> you<00:04:54.919> guys<00:04:55.070> to<00:04:55.130> do<00:04:55.310> that

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
and I do encourage you guys to do that

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.250 
and I do encourage you guys to do that
too<00:04:55.729> unless<00:04:56.120> you<00:04:56.300> want<00:04:56.540> to<00:04:56.660> buy<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:56.810> weapons

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
too unless you want to buy the weapons

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.080 
too unless you want to buy the weapons
off<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.470> start<00:04:57.889> and<00:04:58.130> I<00:04:58.220> guess<00:04:58.400> support<00:04:58.820> valve

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
off the start and I guess support valve

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.820 
off the start and I guess support valve
so<00:04:59.660> that's<00:04:59.780> one<00:04:59.930> of<00:04:59.990> the<00:05:00.050> things<00:05:00.200> I'm<00:05:00.380> gonna<00:05:00.530> do

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
so that's one of the things I'm gonna do

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.890 
so that's one of the things I'm gonna do
and<00:05:01.100> and<00:05:01.580> that's<00:05:02.210> actually<00:05:02.389> awesome<00:05:02.810> now

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
and and that's actually awesome now

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.930 
and and that's actually awesome now
valve<00:05:03.169> let<00:05:03.320> you<00:05:03.440> do<00:05:03.680> that<00:05:03.860> if<00:05:04.520> they<00:05:04.640> really

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
valve let you do that if they really

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.670 
valve let you do that if they really
really<00:05:05.330> really<00:05:05.570> wanted<00:05:05.930> to<00:05:05.990> be<00:05:06.080> mean<00:05:06.440> they

could probably just release new content
totally<00:05:10.039> on<00:05:10.160> the<00:05:10.250> cash<00:05:10.430> system<00:05:10.880> not<00:05:11.030> have<00:05:11.210> any

bonus without having to pay I think it's

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.090 
bonus without having to pay I think it's
like<00:05:44.150> it's<00:05:44.930> like<00:05:44.990> eighteen<00:05:45.530> dollars<00:05:45.889> for<00:05:46.070> a

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
like it's like eighteen dollars for a

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.590 
like it's like eighteen dollars for a
hat<00:05:46.250> which<00:05:46.430> I<00:05:46.580> do<00:05:46.639> personally<00:05:47.240> think<00:05:47.450> is<00:05:47.570> a

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
hat which I do personally think is a

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.110 
hat which I do personally think is a
little<00:05:47.870> bit<00:05:48.169> high<00:05:48.350> so<00:05:49.220> if<00:05:49.520> I<00:05:49.610> were<00:05:49.789> you<00:05:49.820> I<00:05:49.970> just

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
little bit high so if I were you I just

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.180 
little bit high so if I were you I just
kind<00:05:50.840> of<00:05:50.900> stock<00:05:51.139> up<00:05:51.320> on<00:05:51.440> my<00:05:51.530> weapons<00:05:51.950> if<00:05:52.070> you
