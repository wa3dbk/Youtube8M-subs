00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 the most practical trend of this spring 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.010
 feminine and stylish overalls we sew 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.690
 her for a couple of hours 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.059
 then the overalls will be very simple and 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.500
 elegant at the base of the top blouse with 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.260
 one-piece sleeves and 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.050
 stand-up collar down smooth 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.910
 from the line of the hips hips and legs 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.050
 going to gum will be very beautiful 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.300
 fabric choose universal crepe i 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.189
 I suggest to take a dense viscose cream with 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.410
 The effect of building this horse is beautiful 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.669
 drapes and keeps its shape well 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.890
 back of us 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.020
 satin textures therefore collar 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.390
 rack and straps for fasteners placed on 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.790
 This side as a decor will be very 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.910
 Let's start from the top 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.390
 overalls fold the fabric in 4 layers and 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.739
 we take two measurements hip girth and length 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.510
 Shelves open up the jumpsuit easier 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.940
 simple bottom 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.340
 note a quarter of the hip gauge and 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.110
 draw a line along the central fold 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.750
 lay the shelf length plus 10 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.869
 centimeters and draw a line bottom 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.700
 from the top fold mark the width of the sleeve 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:19.350
 it's 25 centimeters draw the sleeve itself 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:22.320
 corner round and do the neck here 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.030
 all the cut left to cut everything is not 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.240
 forget to leave seam allowances 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.670
 and in front of the neck do a little 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.690
 deeper 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:39.460
 we cut a shelf we connect side seams 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:43.659
 and stitch them on the machine and process 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.899
 on the overlock cut the strap to fasten 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:53.170
 these are strips 8 centimeters wide and 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:54.490
 length equal to the length of the shelf strengthen them 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:03.700
 thin fleece 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:06.399
 and sew left to do the rack 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:13.080
 measure the length of the neck and the edge of the strip 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:13.080
 8 centimeters wide fasten collar 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.200
 the bottom of the suit will be cut by 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.090
 favorite jeans straight style 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.980
 fold them and apply to the fabric 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.630
 contour the front half 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.049
 unfold them and put butt to 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.030
 we draw a side seam note 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.940
 the back half should be a bit 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.980
 wider than the front in the line of sitting waters and 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.760
 the entire edge of the side hose will not 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.760
 cut left 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:49.540
 flash stepper 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.680
 and the central seam we connect both parts 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.900
 overalls 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.900
 sew a drawstring at the waist line 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:05.760
 that's all such a jumpsuit 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.730
 thing universal can be outfit on 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.420
