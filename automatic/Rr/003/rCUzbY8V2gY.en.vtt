my skin and my nails are a lot healthier

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.410 
my skin and my nails are a lot healthier
now<00:00:49.160> just<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.309> they<00:00:50.460> look<00:00:50.640> cleaner<00:00:51.210> and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
now just like they look cleaner and

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.799 
now just like they look cleaner and
nicer<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.010> then<00:00:53.010> my<00:00:53.250> hair<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:54.270> normal<00:00:54.660> it's

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
nicer and then my hair it's normal it's

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.209 
nicer and then my hair it's normal it's
growing<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.320> that's<00:00:56.160> good<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:57.120> um<00:00:58.219> actually

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
growing so that's good but um actually

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.950 
growing so that's good but um actually
the<00:00:59.879> reason<00:01:00.059> why<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.329> started<00:01:00.629> taking<00:01:00.780> these

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the reason why I started taking these

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.360 
the reason why I started taking these
was<00:01:01.140> because<00:01:01.440> when<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.649> was<00:01:01.710> little<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.010> was<00:01:02.100> fat

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
was because when I was little I was fat

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.359 
was because when I was little I was fat
and<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.940> when<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.719> lost<00:01:04.019> all<00:01:04.229> my<00:01:04.260> weight<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.920> had

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
and so when I lost all my weight I had

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.429 
and so when I lost all my weight I had
all<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> extra<00:01:05.820> skin<00:01:06.030> left<00:01:06.210> over<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.229> still

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
all the extra skin left over and I still

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.820 
all the extra skin left over and I still
do<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:08.010> after<00:01:08.820> taken<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.540> pills<00:01:09.780> my<00:01:10.470> skin<00:01:10.740> is

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
do but after taken the pills my skin is

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.390 
do but after taken the pills my skin is
a<00:01:10.860> lot<00:01:11.040> more<00:01:11.189> taut<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:12.979> before<00:01:13.979> taking<00:01:14.100> these

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
a lot more taut and before taking these

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.429 
a lot more taut and before taking these
if<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:14.939> went<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.659> easily<00:01:16.229> had

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
if I like went like this I easily had

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.590 
if I like went like this I easily had
like<00:01:16.680> two<00:01:16.890> or<00:01:17.009> three<00:01:17.070> tins<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.759> now<00:01:18.360> if<00:01:18.479> I'm

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
like two or three tins and now if I'm

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.469 
like two or three tins and now if I'm
just<00:01:18.750> normal<00:01:19.189> there's<00:01:20.189> not<00:01:20.759> as<00:01:20.939> much<00:01:21.180> it's

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
just normal there's not as much it's

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.690 
just normal there's not as much it's
definitely<00:01:21.720> decreased<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.950> especially<00:01:23.490> like

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
definitely decreased and especially like

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.820 
definitely decreased and especially like
this<00:01:23.850> area<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.869> only<00:01:24.960> pull<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.530> far

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
this area I can only pull it that far

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.530 
this area I can only pull it that far
without<00:01:25.950> really<00:01:26.610> extending<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.119> before<00:01:27.509> I

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
without really extending it before I

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.399 
without really extending it before I
could<00:01:27.750> go<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.890> there<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:30.420> like<00:01:30.630> twice<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.200> far

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
could go to there so like twice as far

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.520 
could go to there so like twice as far
so<00:01:32.130> it's<00:01:32.280> actually<00:01:32.460> made<00:01:32.729> my<00:01:32.909> skin<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.329> lot

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.440 
um I think of pudding how and you have
pudding<00:01:49.439> or<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:49.890> jello<00:01:50.579> or<00:01:50.970> gelatin<00:01:51.299> or

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
pudding or like jello or gelatin or

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.300 
pudding or like jello or gelatin or
something<00:01:51.750> you'd<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.890> mush<00:01:53.159> it

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
something you'd have it you can mush it

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.800 
something you'd have it you can mush it
around<00:01:53.340> but<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.700> still<00:01:53.880> stays<00:01:54.240> together

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
around but it still stays together
