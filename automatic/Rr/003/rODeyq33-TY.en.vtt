00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.680
 ladies and gentlemen starts the game in 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.530
 the orange bowl touched the ball at the 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:15.459
 Canadians to repeat it again now 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:19.150

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.240
 well the center the header winning by 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.910
 above 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.740
 marcus jaber 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.740
 first the clearest party 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.680
 there comes the header the goalkeeper 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.900
 little left but for his fortune his 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.220
 position and vision follow vision attention 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.450
 what good ball can it be here is the 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.079
 first it can be here it's fine the 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.260
 shot the archer 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.329
 what fancy fictional play and a great 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.909
 habilitation for the fars captain 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.950
 brother and the archer saves to install 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.720
 Water 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.640
 excellent vision action of those of 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.220
 greater talent in the team of martín and 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.270
 that a measured pass to his captain who takes out 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.870
 the auction but in good position 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.750
 again the Canadian goalkeeper and the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.760
 embolism 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.100
 The technique that has been more attention comes 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.660
 the center here this can be the 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.660
 controls more than in the center 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.330
 he just lost it arnold in the 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.180
 center was from arkham again martín 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.730
 she forgives and that a very bad 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.470
 control in the first instance and we see the 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.380
 central defender of the Martinique team 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.390
 that came to close 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.460
 laugh at the bad defense coverage 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.979
 Canadian evil against the one has been a 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.960
 center to the heart of the area and arnold an 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.960
 with the auction to the clouds 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.520
 dangerous poisonous tension comes johnson 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.520
 center 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.520
 Olympus 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:59.310
 ladies and gentlemen finish the first 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.310
 45 minutes of this gold cup tied at 0 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.670
 to the left 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.570
 the selection of Martinique 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.060
 in fiction control 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.060
 in the center circle in the opening with 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.340
 olivier thomert eating advances to take in 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.519
 the center head 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.560
 from johann arkham and basically he went to 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.560
 final parce me mani Milan Borjan is 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.090
 stays with the ball 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.150
 perfect head off of me parce man 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.030
 although the power is a bit weak 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.870
 of its big cap that we see the 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.400
 number 20 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.400
 toronto player etc 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.990
 Martinic escapes the ball in the area 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.470
 It may be the forehand that covered by 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:50.490
 milian guardian again there again 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:54.080
 what to avoid week 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.510
 and now I play a little more on tip 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.290
 pull out the right and that covered of Milan 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.239
 guardian 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.400
 he has changed his position with joana 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.150
 second time authorizes the referee to 3 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.440
 on the wall 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.870
 actually they are two of Canada auction 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.820
 and that there was pink in someone and almost 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.130
 complicates the life of the goalkeeper Milan 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.510
 goal kick guard there it is again 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.510
 per week coming worse 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.860
 good auction by staff with the 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.080
 web and the openings by the right band 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.610
 of the best moments of canada in the 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.040
 match goes into the header area 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.740
 de édgar was close to surprising the 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.800
 incredible limpa goalkeeper 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:45.610
 incredible is in charge 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.590
 nodded badly yet it was so close to 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.740
 long that the ball hit him he hit on the 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.740
 crossbar 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.770
 it's called possession of the ball in 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:58.180
 keeper kevin olympia 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.180
 is this after long 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.190
 Chest like 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.310
 is in the area, takes the shot 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.470
 an embolism just saved what 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.320
 it looked just like the Martinique painting 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.840
 that is covered here we have it again 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.000
 in repetition they like what good does 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.820
 luxury gets into the area hits him hard the 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.190
 the goalkeeper's stick and bojan that deflects it 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.190
 sends it to the corner that opportunity 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.440
 corner shot for martinica 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:35.270
 we see the center the ball is still in play 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.270
 and at the end you see well is the defense 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.040
 About the hour 

00:04:57.489 --> 00:05:03.739
 martita one anything but if someone 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:06.409
 he claimed to win in Martinique and he has not 

00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:08.959
 got on the hour like a bolazo 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:11.509
 from rupert he had just done his 

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:14.379
 I entered a couple of balls I had touched 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.379
 before and look at what 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.430
 the nail in the impossible angle for the 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.170
 Burian archer and in this way it is done 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.540
 justice on the scoreboard 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:27.360
 Martinique went looking for him until 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.390
 last sigh and get it in the 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.129
 last sigh three gold points for 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.009
 martínez 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:37.659
 earns deservedly and gives the first 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.659
 bump of this one
