you've got it going away from that so
I'm<00:00:35.969> I'm<00:00:36.210> I'm<00:00:37.110> against<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.890> think<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.340> it's

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
I'm I'm I'm against it I think it's it's

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.440 
I'm I'm I'm against it I think it's it's
not<00:00:39.090> good<00:00:39.360> for<00:00:39.390> your<00:00:39.840> overall<00:00:40.820> MMA<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> short

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
not good for your overall MMA is a short

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.139 
not good for your overall MMA is a short
thing<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.870> one's<00:00:43.350> life<00:00:43.590> competitively<00:00:44.520> and

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
thing in one's life competitively and

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.770 
thing in one's life competitively and
life<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> long<00:00:46.350> things<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:47.129> think<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.850> think

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
life is a long things I think I think

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.130 
life is a long things I think I think
and<00:00:49.460> I<00:00:50.460> think<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.180> an<00:00:51.329> unfair<00:00:51.660> advantage<00:00:54.140> it

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
and I think it is an unfair advantage it

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.010 
and I think it is an unfair advantage it
makes<00:00:55.379> guys<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.920> aren't<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.539> have<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.809> use

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
makes guys that aren't on it have to use

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.400 
makes guys that aren't on it have to use
it<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.440> be<00:00:58.829> able<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.070> compete<00:00:59.550> sometimes

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
it to be able to compete sometimes

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.779 
it to be able to compete sometimes
believe<00:01:01.410> are<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.620> technique<00:01:02.070> but<00:01:02.430> when<00:01:02.640> you're

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
believe are in technique but when you're

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.690 
believe are in technique but when you're
doing<00:01:03.120> time<00:01:03.690> matches<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:05.100> about<00:01:05.309> who<00:01:05.519> can

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
doing time matches it's about who can

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.109 
doing time matches it's about who can
explode<00:01:06.090> more<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.420> lot<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.750> times<00:01:07.909> steroids<00:01:08.909> do

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
explode more a lot of times steroids do

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.140 
explode more a lot of times steroids do
that<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.710> don't<00:01:11.070> like<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.939> one

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
that so so I don't like it it's one

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.580 
that so so I don't like it it's one
thing<00:01:12.360> I've<00:01:12.510> always<00:01:12.630> been<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.990> fan<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.439> guys
