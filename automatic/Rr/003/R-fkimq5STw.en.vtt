wondering about this the headphones do
clip<00:03:23.540> i<00:03:23.630> think<00:03:23.870> within<00:03:24.260> here<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:24.709> didn't<00:03:25.069> 100%

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
clip i think within here I didn't 100%

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.569 
clip i think within here I didn't 100%
pretty<00:03:26.420> sure<00:03:26.600> clips<00:03:27.170> into<00:03:27.350> there<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:27.980> is<00:03:28.280> clips

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
pretty sure clips into there it is clips

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.340 
pretty sure clips into there it is clips
onto<00:03:28.790> your<00:03:29.090> shirt<00:03:29.359> which<00:03:29.690> actually<00:03:29.870> makes<00:03:30.200> it

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
onto your shirt which actually makes it

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.720 
onto your shirt which actually makes it
so<00:03:30.530> it<00:03:30.590> doesn't<00:03:30.620> gain<00:03:30.950> your<00:03:31.100> way<00:03:31.280> while<00:03:31.519> you're

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730

convenient was the extra tips I've
gotten<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:40.880> think<00:03:41.569> that<00:03:41.690> gave<00:03:41.810> me<00:03:41.840> like<00:03:42.079> 10<00:03:42.380> or

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
gotten I think that gave me like 10 or

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.979 
gotten I think that gave me like 10 or
so<00:03:42.709> and<00:03:42.980> what<00:03:43.670> these<00:03:43.819> tips<00:03:44.090> were<00:03:44.389> very<00:03:44.780> good

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.509 
so and what these tips were very good
for<00:03:45.230> is<00:03:45.319> that<00:03:45.440> they're<00:03:45.709> different<00:03:45.859> sizes<00:03:46.130> so

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
for is that they're different sizes so

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.759 
for is that they're different sizes so
they<00:03:46.700> can<00:03:46.880> sue<00:03:47.060> anyone's<00:03:47.540> ears<00:03:47.930> so<00:03:48.440> if<00:03:48.620> you're

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
they can sue anyone's ears so if you're
