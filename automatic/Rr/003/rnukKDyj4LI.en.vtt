soldering this new Jetta or it's our
latest<00:00:12.889> port<00:00:13.129> and<00:00:13.339> we<00:00:14.089> will<00:00:14.209> probably<00:00:14.509> release

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
latest port and we will probably release

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.070 
latest port and we will probably release
this<00:00:15.499> but<00:00:15.980> now<00:00:16.520> I<00:00:16.550> have<00:00:17.060> to<00:00:17.270> solder<00:00:17.810> it<00:00:17.840> and

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
this but now I have to solder it and

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.040 
this but now I have to solder it and
test<00:00:18.470> it<00:00:18.560> and<00:00:19.030> you'll<00:00:20.030> see<00:00:20.180> I<00:00:20.210> have<00:00:20.480> different

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
test it and you'll see I have different

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.070 
test it and you'll see I have different
components<00:00:21.710> I've<00:00:22.550> grabbed<00:00:22.940> them<00:00:23.180> from<00:00:23.900> my

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
components I've grabbed them from my

and<00:01:01.609> these<00:01:02.420> are<00:01:02.600> going<00:01:02.749> to<00:01:02.839> be<00:01:03.049> mounted<00:01:03.440> on

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
and these are going to be mounted on

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.180 
and these are going to be mounted on
this<00:01:03.889> PCB<00:01:04.220> oh<00:01:04.519> yeah<00:01:05.480> I<00:01:05.510> have<00:01:05.900> my<00:01:06.190> soldering

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
this PCB oh yeah I have my soldering

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.360 
this PCB oh yeah I have my soldering
station<00:01:07.760> which<00:01:08.510> is<00:01:08.840> temperature<00:01:09.470> regulated

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
station which is temperature regulated

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.780 
station which is temperature regulated
and<00:01:10.690> currently<00:01:11.690> this<00:01:12.170> is<00:01:13.150> cooling<00:01:14.150> off

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
and currently this is cooling off

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.440 
and currently this is cooling off
because<00:01:16.790> I've<00:01:17.210> just<00:01:17.270> soldered<00:01:18.170> this<00:01:19.450> tiny

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
because I've just soldered this tiny

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.010 
because I've just soldered this tiny
picture<00:01:21.400> FTD<00:01:22.400> I<00:01:22.430> use<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.770> gay<00:01:24.770> tack<00:01:25.100> chip

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
picture FTD I use the gay tack chip

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.080 
picture FTD I use the gay tack chip
using<00:01:27.020> track<00:01:27.290> silvering<00:01:27.830> method<00:01:28.160> so<00:01:28.850> that's

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
using track silvering method so that's

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:37.420 
using track silvering method so that's
with<00:01:29.720> this<00:01:30.790> tip<00:01:34.780> so<00:01:35.780> now<00:01:35.930> I'm<00:01:36.200> going<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.740> let

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
with this tip so now I'm going to let

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.140 
with this tip so now I'm going to let
this<00:01:37.610> cool<00:01:38.240> off<00:01:38.300> and<00:01:38.720> then<00:01:39.200> switch<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:39.530> this

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
this cool off and then switch to this

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.730 
this cool off and then switch to this
fine<00:01:41.150> pitch<00:01:43.060> tip<00:01:44.060> instead<00:01:44.480> so<00:01:44.870> I<00:01:44.900> can<00:01:45.140> solder

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
fine pitch tip instead so I can solder

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.590 
fine pitch tip instead so I can solder
the<00:01:45.830> rest<00:01:46.040> of<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:47.090> SMD<00:01:47.570> components<00:01:48.280> so<00:01:49.600> this

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
the rest of the SMD components so this

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.840 
the rest of the SMD components so this
is<00:01:50.720> going<00:01:50.900> to<00:01:51.020> be<00:01:51.170> funny<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:51.740> see<00:01:51.920> if<00:01:52.100> it<00:01:52.310> works

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
is going to be funny to see if it works

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.330 
is going to be funny to see if it works
I<00:01:53.120> hope<00:01:53.630> so

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
I hope so

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.050 
I hope so
so<00:01:55.340> that's<00:01:55.850> just<00:01:56.270> yeah<00:01:57.159> yeah<00:01:58.190> an<00:01:58.400> overview<00:01:59.000> of

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
so that's just yeah yeah an overview of

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.050 
so that's just yeah yeah an overview of
my<00:01:59.510> year<00:02:00.460> working<00:02:01.460> place<00:02:03.010> so<00:02:04.010> now<00:02:04.159> I<00:02:04.190> got<00:02:04.820> the

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
my year working place so now I got the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.930 
my year working place so now I got the
box<00:02:05.570> order<00:02:06.050> together

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
box order together

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.320 
box order together
unfortunately<00:02:07.940> I've<00:02:08.860> popped<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.640> t's<00:02:11.030> up

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
unfortunately I've popped the t's up

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.040 
unfortunately I've popped the t's up
version<00:02:12.050> of<00:02:12.080> this<00:02:12.940> ee<00:02:13.940> prom

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
version of this ee prom

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.210 
version of this ee prom
so<00:02:15.170> I<00:02:15.200> had<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.710> make<00:02:16.040> some<00:02:17.410> minor<00:02:18.410> adjustment

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
so I had to make some minor adjustment

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.630 
so I had to make some minor adjustment
to<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:20.110> eeproms<00:02:21.110> pin<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.670> EPROM<00:02:23.450> pins<00:02:24.040> but<00:02:25.040> I

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
to the eeproms pin the EPROM pins but I

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.020 
to the eeproms pin the EPROM pins but I
think<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.090> works<00:02:26.650> but<00:02:27.650> let's<00:02:28.100> see<00:02:28.280> now<00:02:28.760> it's

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
think it works but let's see now it's

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.590 
think it works but let's see now it's
soldered<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.200> let's<00:02:30.860> get<00:02:31.130> in<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.490> connect<00:02:32.450> it

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
soldered so let's get in and connect it

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.620 
soldered so let's get in and connect it
to<00:02:32.990> our<00:02:33.170> computer

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
to our computer

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.750 
to our computer
finally<00:02:35.630> some<00:02:35.840> line<00:02:36.020> signs<00:02:36.320> of<00:02:36.500> life<00:02:36.730> you<00:02:37.730> have

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
finally some line signs of life you have

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.980 
finally some line signs of life you have
our<00:02:38.180> jadeite<00:02:38.540> board<00:02:39.020> with<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.910> iOS<00:02:41.450> from

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
our jadeite board with the the iOS from

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.550 
our jadeite board with the the iOS from
the<00:02:42.230> FTDI<00:02:42.890> trip<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:44.360> then<00:02:44.930> I<00:02:45.020> made<00:02:45.290> an

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
the FTDI trip and then I made an

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.800 
the FTDI trip and then I made an
official<00:02:45.890> basic<00:02:46.370> application<00:02:47.030> you'll<00:02:47.570> see

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
official basic application you'll see

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.920 
official basic application you'll see
here<00:02:48.080> on<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.380> computer<00:02:48.560> that<00:02:49.660> currently<00:02:50.660> it

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
here on the computer that currently it

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.540 
here on the computer that currently it
just<00:02:51.230> connects<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.730> FTA<00:02:53.980> FC<00:02:54.980> driver

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
just connects to the FTA FC driver

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.510 
just connects to the FTA FC driver
it's<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:56.170> d2x<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.770> write<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.400> iOS<00:02:59.200> um<00:03:00.490> so<00:03:01.490> I

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
it's the d2x to write to the iOS um so I

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.770 
it's the d2x to write to the iOS um so I
can<00:03:01.880> both<00:03:02.450> write<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.440> can<00:03:03.650> also<00:03:03.770> read<00:03:04.780> so

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
can both write and I can also read so

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.590 
can both write and I can also read so
we're<00:03:05.990> now<00:03:06.140> if<00:03:06.470> we<00:03:07.090> click<00:03:08.090> set<00:03:08.390> although

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
we're now if we click set although

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.530 
we're now if we click set although
you'll<00:03:09.230> see<00:03:09.470> that<00:03:10.070> they<00:03:10.400> go<00:03:10.580> low<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.150> if<00:03:11.420> I

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
you'll see that they go low and if I

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.060 
you'll see that they go low and if I
click<00:03:11.720> set<00:03:12.110> all<00:03:12.290> IO<00:03:12.890> high<00:03:13.420> they<00:03:14.420> go<00:03:14.630> why<00:03:15.070> so

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
click set all IO high they go why so

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.880 
click set all IO high they go why so
when<00:03:16.340> I<00:03:16.670> can<00:03:17.180> also<00:03:17.330> click<00:03:17.870> set<00:03:18.230> random<00:03:18.650> and

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
when I can also click set random and

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.199 
when I can also click set random and
then<00:03:19.790> it<00:03:19.910> just<00:03:20.209> turns<00:03:21.340> sort<00:03:22.340> of<00:03:22.400> them<00:03:22.550> randomly

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
then it just turns sort of them randomly

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:30.340 
then it just turns sort of them randomly
on<00:03:24.640> so<00:03:25.640> this<00:03:25.880> is<00:03:26.060> using<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:27.290> FTDI<00:03:28.120> d2<00:03:29.120> XX<00:03:29.780> dll

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
on so this is using the FTDI d2 XX dll

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.660 
on so this is using the FTDI d2 XX dll
but<00:03:31.250> I'm<00:03:31.370> going<00:03:31.670> to<00:03:31.730> check<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.920> FTC<00:03:33.920> JTAG

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
but I'm going to check the FTC JTAG

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.880 
but I'm going to check the FTC JTAG
dealer<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.330> to<00:03:35.870> see<00:03:36.050> how<00:03:36.230> that<00:03:36.410> works<00:03:36.760> but<00:03:38.890> Isle

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
dealer to to see how that works but Isle

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:50.380 
dealer to to see how that works but Isle
works<00:03:40.550> now<00:03:41.030> for<00:03:41.360> the<00:03:41.480> gate<00:03:41.690> ACK

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.510 

after<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.200> long<00:03:51.560> time<00:03:51.860> of<00:03:51.920> messing<00:03:52.400> around

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
after a long time of messing around

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.380 
after a long time of messing around
finally<00:03:53.270> got<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:54.820> universal<00:03:55.820> JTAC

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
finally got the universal JTAC

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.990 
finally got the universal JTAC
programmer<00:03:56.750> working<00:03:57.280> so<00:03:58.280> now<00:03:58.310> I've

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
programmer working so now I've

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
programmer working so now I've
programmed<00:03:59.240> this<00:03:59.600> LPC<00:04:00.530> board<00:04:01.250> to<00:04:01.880> just<00:04:02.270> blink

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
programmed this LPC board to just blink

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.530 
programmed this LPC board to just blink
a<00:04:03.200> LED<00:04:04.720> but<00:04:05.890> it<00:04:06.890> worked<00:04:07.070> quite<00:04:07.310> well<00:04:07.540> currently

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
a LED but it worked quite well currently

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.440 
a LED but it worked quite well currently
I'm<00:04:08.840> using<00:04:08.870> open<00:04:09.680> OCD<00:04:10.400> with<00:04:10.940> feeling<00:04:11.270> sick

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
I'm using open OCD with feeling sick

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.080 
I'm using open OCD with feeling sick
here<00:04:11.750> so<00:04:12.710> if<00:04:12.860> I<00:04:12.980> for<00:04:13.160> example<00:04:13.190> now<00:04:13.880> it's

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
here so if I for example now it's

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.120 
here so if I for example now it's
connected<00:04:14.480> to<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.720> upper<00:04:14.870> see<00:04:15.140> if<00:04:15.350> I<00:04:15.470> write

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
connected to the upper see if I write

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.710 
connected to the upper see if I write
scan<00:04:16.820> chain<00:04:17.440> then<00:04:18.440> they<00:04:18.970> will<00:04:19.970> see<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:21.140> LPC

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
scan chain then they will see the LPC

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:29.590 
scan chain then they will see the LPC
CPU<00:04:23.720> here<00:04:26.170> and<00:04:27.170> then<00:04:27.740> I<00:04:27.830> can<00:04:28.040> hold<00:04:28.730> it<00:04:29.060> I<00:04:29.240> can

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
CPU here and then I can hold it I can

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.960 
CPU here and then I can hold it I can
reset<00:04:29.870> it<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.170> so<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:31.010> it's<00:04:31.400> working<00:04:31.640> quite

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
reset it and so and it's working quite

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.000 
reset it and so and it's working quite
well<00:04:32.290> so<00:04:33.290> I<00:04:33.920> can<00:04:34.610> use<00:04:34.790> open<00:04:35.180> OCD<00:04:35.630> but<00:04:35.960> I'm<00:04:36.650> going

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
well so I can use open OCD but I'm going

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.750 
well so I can use open OCD but I'm going
to<00:04:37.040> make<00:04:37.340> a<00:04:37.840> program<00:04:38.840> myself<00:04:39.080> -<00:04:39.560> -<00:04:39.860> just<00:04:40.370> to

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
to make a program myself - - just to

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.800 
to make a program myself - - just to
check<00:04:41.000> if<00:04:41.180> it's<00:04:41.360> possible<00:04:41.630> to<00:04:41.900> use<00:04:42.050> EFT<00:04:42.980> and

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
check if it's possible to use EFT and

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.760 
check if it's possible to use EFT and
eighty<00:04:44.810> CJ<00:04:45.590> tack<00:04:45.890> DLL<00:04:46.430> file<00:04:46.700> to<00:04:47.000> program<00:04:47.390> it<00:04:47.540> -

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
eighty CJ tack DLL file to program it -

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.200 
eighty CJ tack DLL file to program it -
but<00:04:48.770> the<00:04:48.800> let<00:04:49.640> me<00:04:49.730> show<00:04:49.880> you<00:04:49.940> how<00:04:50.750> it<00:04:50.870> works

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
but the let me show you how it works

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.470 
but the let me show you how it works
here<00:04:53.210> we<00:04:54.110> have<00:04:54.260> the<00:04:54.380> board<00:04:55.120> which<00:04:56.120> is<00:04:56.270> our

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
here we have the board which is our

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.680 
here we have the board which is our
jtech<00:04:57.730> programmer<00:04:58.730> Universal<00:04:59.330> jtech

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
jtech programmer Universal jtech

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.120 
jtech programmer Universal jtech
programmable<00:05:00.260> and<00:05:01.570> it's<00:05:02.570> connected<00:05:03.140> by<00:05:04.100> USB

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
programmable and it's connected by USB

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:10.380 
programmable and it's connected by USB
and<00:05:05.290> then<00:05:06.290> it<00:05:06.500> has<00:05:06.740> this<00:05:07.330> jtech<00:05:08.330> port<00:05:08.630> which<00:05:09.260> is

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
and then it has this jtech port which is

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.570 
and then it has this jtech port which is
universal<00:05:11.390> which<00:05:11.840> means<00:05:12.140> it<00:05:12.350> can<00:05:12.560> go<00:05:12.740> from<00:05:13.070> as

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
universal which means it can go from as

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:21.159 
universal which means it can go from as
low<00:05:14.000> as<00:05:14.300> a<00:05:15.250> 1.5<00:05:16.250> volt<00:05:16.790> to<00:05:17.650> about<00:05:18.650> 5<00:05:18.980> volt<00:05:20.169> so

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
low as a 1.5 volt to about 5 volt so

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.480 
low as a 1.5 volt to about 5 volt so
this<00:05:21.460> is<00:05:22.460> especially<00:05:22.790> yeah<00:05:23.600> ID<00:05:23.840> this<00:05:24.500> is<00:05:24.560> ideal

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
this is especially yeah ID this is ideal

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.590 
this is especially yeah ID this is ideal
