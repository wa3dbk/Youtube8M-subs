here<00:00:16.770> Roger<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.640> debug<00:00:18.060> screen<00:00:18.270> okay

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
here Roger this is a debug screen okay

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.710 
here Roger this is a debug screen okay
so<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.590> actually<00:00:19.800> what<00:00:20.369> we<00:00:20.640> see<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.390> the

so this is actually what we see on the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.380 
so this is actually what we see on the
surface<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.619> we<00:00:22.650> see<00:00:22.859> multiple<00:00:23.160> hands<00:00:23.640> right<00:00:24.359> I

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
surface so we see multiple hands right I

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.240 
surface so we see multiple hands right I
can<00:00:24.689> kind<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.050> tell<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.470> I'm<00:00:25.529> married<00:00:25.800> here

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
can kind of tell and I'm married here

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
right I can see that down there we did

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.279 
right I can see that down there we did
this<00:00:28.699> demo<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.880> see<00:00:30.210> we<00:00:30.330> move<00:00:30.510> some<00:00:30.720> stuff<00:00:31.019> over

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
this demo I see we move some stuff over

this demo I see we move some stuff over
the<00:00:31.679> eye<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:32.040> see<00:00:32.070> oh<00:00:33.020> I<00:00:34.640> actually<00:00:35.640> got<00:00:35.940> an

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
impression of the card look at that well

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.280 
impression of the card look at that well
look<00:00:38.100> at<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.280> see<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.750> actually<00:00:40.110> put

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
look at this see this you actually put

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.290 
look at this see this you actually put
that<00:00:40.440> down<00:00:40.590> what<00:00:40.829> does<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.010> say<00:00:41.160> yes<00:00:41.730> right<00:00:41.910> cuz

that down what does it say yes right cuz

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.000 
that down what does it say yes right cuz
I<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.600> see<00:00:42.780> right<00:00:43.170> right<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.649> threw<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
I can see right right so you threw the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.760 
I can see right right so you threw the
paper<00:00:44.239> absolutely<00:00:45.239> absolutely<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.140> but<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
paper absolutely absolutely so but the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.920 
paper absolutely absolutely so but the
pixel<00:00:47.100> sense<00:00:47.309> technology<00:00:47.539> we<00:00:48.539> basically

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
pixel sense technology we basically

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.080 
pixel sense technology we basically
we're<00:00:49.590> processing<00:00:49.920> all<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.640> information

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
we're processing all the information

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.090 
we're processing all the information
that's<00:00:51.180> here<00:00:51.449> right<00:00:51.780> like<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.260> said<00:00:52.320> LCD

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
that's here right like I said LCD

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.189 
that's here right like I said LCD
outputs<00:00:53.610> at<00:00:53.730> 60<00:00:54.030> frames<00:00:54.059> per<00:00:54.329> second<00:00:54.809> row<00:00:54.989> also

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
outputs at 60 frames per second row also

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.350 
outputs at 60 frames per second row also
in<00:00:55.530> putting<00:00:55.890> at<00:00:56.160> 60<00:00:56.489> frames<00:00:56.520> per<00:00:56.789> second<00:00:57.270> and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
in putting at 60 frames per second and

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.540 
in putting at 60 frames per second and
the<00:00:57.780> pixel<00:00:58.109> sense<00:00:58.320> technologies<00:00:58.859> processing

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the pixel sense technologies processing

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.310 
the pixel sense technologies processing
everything<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.940> seized<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.049> we<00:01:04.140> pull

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
everything is seized here so so we pull

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.990 
everything is seized here so so we pull
out<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.589> these<00:01:04.680> videos<00:01:04.860> here<00:01:05.339> cliff<00:01:05.670> diving

cliff diving right I myself personally I

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.010 
cliff diving right I myself personally I
don't<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> whole<00:01:09.210> lot<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.450> clipped<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.840> know

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
don't do a whole lot of clipped I know

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.630 
don't do a whole lot of clipped I know
it's<00:01:10.170> gonna<00:01:10.260> say<00:01:10.470> cliff<00:01:10.740> diving<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.189> way<00:01:11.369> cool

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
it's gonna say cliff diving is way cool

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.030 
it's gonna say cliff diving is way cool
now<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.869> might<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.260> interesting<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.740> one

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
now this might be interesting for one

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.039 
now this might be interesting for one
person<00:01:14.250> right<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.210> imagine<00:01:15.600> us<00:01:15.689> sitting<00:01:15.990> in

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
person right but imagine us sitting in

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.590 
person right but imagine us sitting in
the<00:01:16.140> lodge<00:01:16.320> around<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.799> table<00:01:17.009> right<00:01:17.600> we

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the lodge around this table right we

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.850 
the lodge around this table right we
want<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> put<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> other<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.350> down<00:01:19.619> here

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
want to put the other can down here

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
right it brings up a different set of

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.940 
right it brings up a different set of
experiences<00:01:23.400> red<00:01:23.790> bull<00:01:24.000> racing<00:01:24.290> okay<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.830> now

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950

fine-tuning it well yeah when you create
a<00:01:43.710> new<00:01:43.770> technology<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.579> pixel<00:01:44.880> sense<00:01:45.149> there

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
a new technology like pixel sense there

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.300 
a new technology like pixel sense there
is<00:01:45.479> some<00:01:45.689> some<00:01:46.110> firmware<00:01:46.470> type<00:01:46.770> stuff<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.159> have

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
is some some firmware type stuff we have

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.440 
is some some firmware type stuff we have
to<00:01:47.460> continue<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.970> tweak<00:01:48.240> yeah<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:50.450> another

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
to continue to tweak yeah so another

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.969 
to continue to tweak yeah so another
thing<00:01:51.540> we've<00:01:51.869> been<00:01:51.899> working<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.470> here<00:01:52.860> is

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
thing we've been working on here is

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.590 
thing we've been working on here is
we've<00:01:53.430> created<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:54.000> Bing<00:01:54.329> application<00:01:55.340> and<00:01:56.600> it

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
we've created a Bing application and it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.429 
we've created a Bing application and it
is<00:01:57.869> still<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:59.070> beta<00:01:59.579> state<00:01:59.850> as<00:01:59.969> well<00:02:00.290> hmm<00:02:01.290> and

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
is still in a beta state as well hmm and

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.230 
is still in a beta state as well hmm and
so<00:02:01.799> what<00:02:02.009> we<00:02:02.159> eventually<00:02:02.430> be<00:02:02.700> able<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.909> do<00:02:03.030> is

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
so what we eventually be able to do is

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.700 
so what we eventually be able to do is
do<00:02:03.420> sort<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.780> being<00:02:04.020> searched<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.469> things

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
do sort of being searched on the things

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.770 
do sort of being searched on the things
that<00:02:04.770> are<00:02:04.920> local<00:02:05.280> around<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.850> but<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:06.689> this
