I'm Stephen quick I'm a lead interior
artist<00:00:07.040> on<00:00:07.160> saints<00:00:07.490> row<00:00:07.580> the<00:00:07.609> third<00:00:07.900> well<00:00:08.900> and

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
artist on saints row the third well and

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.890 
artist on saints row the third well and
sr3<00:00:09.470> we<00:00:09.830> really<00:00:10.370> wanted<00:00:10.550> to<00:00:10.610> tie<00:00:10.820> each<00:00:11.120> gang<00:00:11.360> to

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
sr3 we really wanted to tie each gang to

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.079 
sr3 we really wanted to tie each gang to
different<00:00:12.589> aspects<00:00:12.889> of<00:00:12.950> the<00:00:13.070> city<00:00:13.280> so<00:00:13.610> you'll

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
different aspects of the city so you'll

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:15.610 
different aspects of the city so you'll
see<00:00:14.209> different<00:00:14.330> architectural<00:00:15.019> styles<00:00:15.080> and

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:15.620 
see different architectural styles and

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.710 
see different architectural styles and
different<00:00:15.679> colors<00:00:16.190> that<00:00:16.670> are<00:00:16.880> unique<00:00:17.450> or<00:00:17.600> he

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
different colors that are unique or he

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.420 
different colors that are unique or he
wrote<00:00:17.870> to<00:00:18.050> each<00:00:18.140> gang<00:00:18.410> first<00:00:19.100> we<00:00:19.250> break

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
wrote to each gang first we break

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.010 
wrote to each gang first we break
through<00:00:19.520> concepts<00:00:20.090> and<00:00:20.270> we<00:00:20.330> try<00:00:20.810> to<00:00:20.840> think

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
through concepts and we try to think

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.300 
through concepts and we try to think
about<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:21.380> deckers<00:00:21.710> like<00:00:21.860> what<00:00:22.010> makes<00:00:22.160> them

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
about the deckers like what makes them

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.650 
about the deckers like what makes them
up<00:00:22.460> as<00:00:22.580> a<00:00:22.610> gang<00:00:22.880> and<00:00:23.090> then<00:00:23.330> you<00:00:23.390> think<00:00:23.570> about

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
up as a gang and then you think about

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.390 
up as a gang and then you think about
the<00:00:23.870> leader<00:00:24.110> of<00:00:24.200> this<00:00:24.380> gang<00:00:24.560> Matt<00:00:24.860> Miller<00:00:25.130> and

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
the leader of this gang Matt Miller and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.400 
the leader of this gang Matt Miller and
what<00:00:25.550> makes<00:00:25.760> him<00:00:25.940> tick<00:00:25.970> and<00:00:26.390> he's<00:00:27.020> the<00:00:27.170> cyber

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
what makes him tick and he's the cyber

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.530 
what makes him tick and he's the cyber
God<00:00:27.680> and<00:00:27.830> this<00:00:27.920> is<00:00:28.040> his<00:00:28.160> fortress<00:00:28.580> of<00:00:28.700> power<00:00:28.910> he

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:29.540 
God and this is his fortress of power he

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.450 
God and this is his fortress of power he
calls<00:00:29.780> all<00:00:29.930> the<00:00:29.960> shots<00:00:30.110> he's<00:00:30.500> all-powerful<00:00:30.680> I

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
calls all the shots he's all-powerful I

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.069 
calls all the shots he's all-powerful I
mean<00:00:31.730> he's<00:00:31.910> already<00:00:32.390> messed<00:00:32.629> with<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:32.809> Saints

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
mean he's already messed with the Saints

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.690 
mean he's already messed with the Saints
so<00:00:33.200> much<00:00:33.379> in<00:00:33.530> this<00:00:33.620> he's<00:00:33.800> you<00:00:34.250> know<00:00:34.309> tanked

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
so much in this he's you know tanked

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.299 
so much in this he's you know tanked
your<00:00:34.820> money<00:00:35.000> and<00:00:35.749> he's<00:00:36.249> branched<00:00:37.249> a

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
your money and he's branched a

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:38.889 
your money and he's branched a
helicopter<00:00:37.850> you're<00:00:37.999> trying<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:38.269> fly<00:00:38.480> in<00:00:38.629> so

what time you get up get to him you

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.299 
what time you get up get to him you
really<00:00:41.269> want<00:00:41.420> to<00:00:41.480> take<00:00:41.600> him<00:00:41.749> down<00:00:42.039> so<00:00:43.039> we

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
really want to take him down so we

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.579 
really want to take him down so we
really<00:00:43.460> wanted<00:00:43.699> to<00:00:43.760> focus<00:00:43.940> on<00:00:44.320> few<00:00:45.320> unique

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
really wanted to focus on few unique

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.399 
really wanted to focus on few unique
details<00:00:46.039> to<00:00:46.190> really<00:00:46.429> frame<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:47.929> environment

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:48.409 
details to really frame the environment

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:50.709 
details to really frame the environment
and<00:00:48.829> get<00:00:48.980> the<00:00:49.069> player<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:49.579> feel<00:00:49.789> like<00:00:49.969> where<00:00:50.539> am

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
and get the player to feel like where am

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.860 
and get the player to feel like where am
i<00:00:51.309> what<00:00:52.309> is<00:00:52.429> this<00:00:52.460> place<00:00:52.670> is<00:00:52.850> this<00:00:53.030> still

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
i what is this place is this still

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.619 
i what is this place is this still
Saints<00:00:54.230> Row<00:00:54.409> like<00:00:54.710> where<00:00:54.859> the<00:00:54.949> hell<00:00:54.979> am<00:00:55.129> I<00:00:55.629> so

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
Saints Row like where the hell am I so

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:57.549 
Saints Row like where the hell am I so
when<00:00:56.719> we<00:00:56.839> came<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.229> idea<00:00:57.469> of<00:00:57.499> the

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
when we came to the idea of the

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.309 
when we came to the idea of the
cyberspace<00:00:58.010> we<00:00:58.339> really<00:00:58.640> wanted<00:00:58.879> to<00:00:59.109> give<00:01:00.109> the

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:00.319 
cyberspace we really wanted to give the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:02.200 
cyberspace we really wanted to give the
player<00:01:00.589> sensitive<00:01:01.159> this<00:01:01.429> is<00:01:01.579> a<00:01:01.609> game<00:01:01.850> within<00:01:02.059> a

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
player sensitive this is a game within a

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.210 
player sensitive this is a game within a
game<00:01:02.239> and<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:03.109> for<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.530> Decker's<00:01:03.769> we<00:01:03.889> explored

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
game and so for the Decker's we explored

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.469 
game and so for the Decker's we explored
several<00:01:04.400> looks<00:01:04.699> of<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:04.879> environment<00:01:05.269> we<00:01:05.330> had

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
several looks of the environment we had

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.569 
several looks of the environment we had
a<00:01:05.510> lot<00:01:05.720> of<00:01:05.750> very<00:01:06.080> noisy<00:01:06.860> kind<00:01:07.190> of<00:01:07.310> circuit

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 
a lot of very noisy kind of circuit

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:09.160 
a lot of very noisy kind of circuit
boards<00:01:07.909> stuff<00:01:08.570> that<00:01:08.719> started<00:01:08.960> to<00:01:09.020> actually

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
boards stuff that started to actually

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.539 
boards stuff that started to actually
burn<00:01:09.469> your<00:01:09.680> retina<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.250> player<00:01:10.460> was

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
burn your retina and the player was

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:11.950 
burn your retina and the player was
actually<00:01:10.850> getting<00:01:11.000> lost<00:01:11.240> in<00:01:11.509> there<00:01:11.689> so<00:01:11.840> we

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
actually getting lost in there so we

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.080 
actually getting lost in there so we
decided<00:01:12.259> to<00:01:12.380> kind<00:01:12.560> of<00:01:12.649> tone<00:01:12.860> back<00:01:13.040> a<00:01:13.070> few<00:01:13.310> of

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
decided to kind of tone back a few of

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.480 
decided to kind of tone back a few of
the<00:01:14.180> areas<00:01:14.509> like<00:01:14.600> more<00:01:15.290> polished<00:01:15.740> floors<00:01:15.979> with

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
the areas like more polished floors with

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.520 
the areas like more polished floors with
these<00:01:16.640> energy<00:01:17.360> lines<00:01:17.570> going<00:01:17.780> through<00:01:18.079> and<00:01:18.380> we

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
these energy lines going through and we

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.130 
these energy lines going through and we
used<00:01:19.340> a<00:01:19.490> lot<00:01:19.640> of<00:01:19.759> the<00:01:19.880> circuitry<00:01:20.509> moving<00:01:20.960> on

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
used a lot of the circuitry moving on

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.109 
used a lot of the circuitry moving on
the<00:01:21.560> structures<00:01:21.979> of<00:01:22.009> really<00:01:22.460> Service<00:01:22.909> land

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
the structures of really Service land

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.340 
the structures of really Service land
much<00:01:23.299> to<00:01:23.450> guide<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.750> player<00:01:23.930> through<00:01:24.229> the

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
much to guide the player through the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.499 
much to guide the player through the
environment<00:01:24.860> so<00:01:25.640> you'll<00:01:25.759> notice<00:01:25.909> as<00:01:26.210> a<00:01:26.240> gang

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
environment so you'll notice as a gang

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.090 
environment so you'll notice as a gang
they<00:01:26.689> have<00:01:26.869> a<00:01:26.899> lot<00:01:27.110> of<00:01:27.140> blue<00:01:27.380> accents<00:01:27.829> to<00:01:27.950> their

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
they have a lot of blue accents to their

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.039 
they have a lot of blue accents to their
clothes<00:01:28.369> we<00:01:29.000> wonder<00:01:29.240> glows<00:01:29.420> under<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.810> cars

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
clothes we wonder glows under the cars

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.649 
clothes we wonder glows under the cars
and<00:01:30.860> they'll<00:01:30.979> have<00:01:31.189> a<00:01:31.460> lot<00:01:31.759> of<00:01:31.789> like<00:01:32.090> LED

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
and they'll have a lot of like LED

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.149 
and they'll have a lot of like LED
lights<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:33.229> kind<00:01:33.409> of<00:01:33.439> evoke<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:33.859> feeling<00:01:33.890> of
