yeah<00:04:49.470> i<00:04:50.470> think<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.220> gravity<00:04:51.520> really<00:04:51.729> gravy

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
yeah i think the gravity really gravy

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.060 
yeah i think the gravity really gravy
that<00:04:52.150> far<00:04:52.360> away<00:04:52.450> but<00:04:52.710> apparently<00:04:53.710> things<00:04:53.979> are
