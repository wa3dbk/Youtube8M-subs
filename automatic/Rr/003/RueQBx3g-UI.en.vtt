00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
post a screen cap or maybe just like a

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.149 
post a screen cap or maybe just like a
tiny<00:01:21.090> little<00:01:21.330> clip<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.990> your<00:01:22.110> game<00:01:22.320> which<00:01:22.979> is

tiny little clip of your game which is

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.950 
tiny little clip of your game which is
still<00:01:23.369> cool<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.240> wish<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.630> could<00:01:24.780> upload

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
the whole game straight from there cuz

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.310 
the whole game straight from there cuz
that<00:01:26.729> would<00:01:26.880> be<00:01:27.000> awesome<00:01:27.180> now<00:01:27.780> with<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.080> new

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
light bar on the controller I guess it's

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.810

were<00:01:52.170> focusing<00:01:52.770> really<00:01:53.040> heavily<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.729> this

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
were focusing really heavily on this

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.969 
were focusing really heavily on this
instant<00:01:54.750> which<00:01:55.049> i<00:01:55.200> think<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.530> really<00:01:55.799> cool

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
instant which i think is really cool

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.469 
instant which i think is really cool
because<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.399> know<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.790> would<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:56.939> awesome<00:01:57.030> to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
because you know it would be awesome to

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.690 
because you know it would be awesome to
play<00:01:57.600> games<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.920> don't<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.369> anymore

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
play games that you don't have anymore

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.340 
play games that you don't have anymore
or<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.210> don't<00:02:00.360> work<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.930> console<00:02:01.320> and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
or that don't work on the console and

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.600 
or that don't work on the console and
you<00:02:01.469> could<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:01.740> literally<00:02:02.070> click<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> button

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
you could just literally click a button

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.360 
you could just literally click a button
and<00:02:02.880> start

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
and start

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.740 
and start
playing<00:02:03.610> it<00:02:03.790> I<00:02:03.820> think<00:02:04.120> that's<00:02:04.270> a<00:02:04.360> really

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
playing it I think that's a really

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.960 
playing it I think that's a really
really<00:02:04.780> cool<00:02:05.140> concept<00:02:05.440> I<00:02:05.920> like<00:02:06.310> this<00:02:06.580> idea<00:02:06.760> I

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
really cool concept I like this idea I

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.330 
really cool concept I like this idea I
think<00:02:07.060> it's<00:02:07.300> very<00:02:07.480> current<00:02:07.690> Netflix<00:02:08.560> is<00:02:08.770> doing

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
think it's very current Netflix is doing

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.680 
think it's very current Netflix is doing
really<00:02:09.490> well<00:02:09.700> with<00:02:09.760> the<00:02:10.090> instant<00:02:10.510> streaming

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
really well with the instant streaming

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.830 
really well with the instant streaming
but<00:02:11.080> my<00:02:11.530> question<00:02:11.980> is<00:02:12.190> if<00:02:12.940> our<00:02:13.210> games<00:02:13.480> are

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
but my question is if our games are

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.110 
but my question is if our games are
going<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.170> be<00:02:14.290> streaming<00:02:14.770> what<00:02:15.370> happens<00:02:15.910> if

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
going to be streaming what happens if

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.030 
going to be streaming what happens if
you<00:02:16.240> want<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.540> play<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.410> have<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.590> terrible
