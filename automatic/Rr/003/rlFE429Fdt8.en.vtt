actually the second Depot would be the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.420 
actually the second Depot would be the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
logical choice but could actually be

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.280 
logical choice but could actually be
prepared<00:01:32.820> by<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.329> time<00:01:33.659> these<00:01:33.810> six<00:01:34.049> Ling's

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
time plenty of space to defend against

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.430 
time plenty of space to defend against
the<00:02:32.430> six<00:02:32.670> full<00:02:32.820> vial<00:02:33.030> Hawk<00:02:33.270> GG's<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.110> three
