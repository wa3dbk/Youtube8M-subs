where he had a little bit of a bum

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.430 
where he had a little bit of a bum
Achilles<00:00:57.730> butt<00:00:58.059> so<00:00:58.540> he<00:00:58.660> was<00:00:58.780> just<00:00:58.930> going<00:00:59.050> 12

later<00:01:02.199> he's<00:01:02.379> doing<00:01:02.619> Frankfurt<00:01:03.129> but<00:01:03.250> it<00:01:03.369> was

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
later he's doing Frankfurt but it was

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.730 
later he's doing Frankfurt but it was
nice<00:01:03.610> to<00:01:03.820> see<00:01:03.970> these<00:01:04.119> two<00:01:04.330> outs<00:01:04.600> out<00:01:05.500> there

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
nice to see these two outs out there

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.530 
nice to see these two outs out there
together<00:01:05.950> which<00:01:06.700> we<00:01:06.820> didn't<00:01:07.030> have<00:01:07.060> last<00:01:07.299> week

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
together which we didn't have last week

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.940 
together which we didn't have last week
and<00:01:07.720> I<00:01:07.750> think<00:01:07.960> that<00:01:08.080> helped<00:01:08.290> Matt<00:01:08.440> today<00:01:08.680> for

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
and I think that helped Matt today for

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.910 
and I think that helped Matt today for
sure<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:10.240> addition<00:01:10.630> to<00:01:10.869> just<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.260> the<00:01:11.680> hard

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
sure in addition to just the the hard

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.770 
sure in addition to just the the hard
effort<00:01:12.040> itself<00:01:12.490> we're<00:01:12.729> also<00:01:12.850> as<00:01:13.240> you<00:01:13.360> see<00:01:13.540> here

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
effort itself we're also as you see here

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.510 
effort itself we're also as you see here
practicing<00:01:14.439> fluids<00:01:14.950> I<00:01:15.130> think<00:01:15.310> that's<00:01:15.430> a

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
practicing fluids I think that's a

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.340 
practicing fluids I think that's a
really<00:01:15.729> important<00:01:16.119> part<00:01:16.330> of<00:01:16.450> marathon

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
really important part of marathon

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.600 
really important part of marathon
training<00:01:17.650> that<00:01:17.860> can<00:01:18.040> be<00:01:19.860> often<00:01:20.860> overlooked<00:01:21.310> so

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
training that can be often overlooked so

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.399 
training that can be often overlooked so
having<00:01:22.210> that<00:01:22.420> incorporated<00:01:23.110> into<00:01:23.260> the

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
having that incorporated into the

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.380 
having that incorporated into the
training<00:01:23.740> is<00:01:23.830> a<00:01:23.860> really<00:01:23.920> important<00:01:24.490> important

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
training is a really important important

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.700 
training is a really important important
aspect

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.330 

that's<00:01:31.710> quite<00:01:31.979> clear<00:01:33.770> 507<00:01:34.770> gotta<00:01:34.920> go<00:01:35.070> back<00:01:35.219> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that's quite clear 507 gotta go back to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.169 
that's quite clear 507 gotta go back to
512<00:01:35.820> gotta<00:01:36.479> go<00:01:36.630> back<00:01:37.399> well<00:01:38.399> that<00:01:38.700> was<00:01:38.820> too<00:01:38.939> fast

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
512 gotta go back well that was too fast

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.120 
512 gotta go back well that was too fast
507<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:42.030> know<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> quarter<00:01:43.979> mile

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
507 you know you have the quarter mile

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.770 
507 you know you have the quarter mile
mark<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.700> don't<00:01:45.030> know<00:01:45.119> how<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.329> happened

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
mark so I don't know how that happened

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.209 
mark so I don't know how that happened
probably<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.259> there<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> little<00:01:46.740> dot<00:01:46.950> on

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
probably like there is a little dot on

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.789 
probably like there is a little dot on
that<00:01:47.340> while<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.270> yelled<00:01:49.170> at<00:01:49.380> him<00:01:49.469> to<00:01:49.560> get<00:01:49.709> it

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
that while so I yelled at him to get it

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.570 
that while so I yelled at him to get it
back<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.069> 512<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:50.850> that's

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
back to 512 so that's

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:01.080 
back to 512 so that's
do

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.319 

my<00:02:01.930> goal<00:02:02.140> time<00:02:02.380> today<00:02:02.680> is<00:02:02.920> 5:12<00:02:03.790> per<00:02:04.119> mile

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
my goal time today is 5:12 per mile

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:05.969 
my goal time today is 5:12 per mile
which<00:02:04.630> down<00:02:04.990> at<00:02:05.140> sea<00:02:05.320> level<00:02:05.470> would<00:02:05.710> equate<00:02:05.920> to

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
which down at sea level would equate to

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.680 
which down at sea level would equate to
about<00:02:06.570> 457<00:02:07.649> 455<00:02:08.649> to<00:02:08.679> 457<00:02:09.580> since<00:02:10.390> we're<00:02:10.509> up<00:02:10.569> at

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
about 457 455 to 457 since we're up at

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.740 
about 457 455 to 457 since we're up at
7,000<00:02:11.260> feet<00:02:14.400> yeah<00:02:15.400> halfway<00:02:15.640> they<00:02:15.910> look<00:02:16.060> good

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
7,000 feet yeah halfway they look good

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.380 
7,000 feet yeah halfway they look good
that<00:02:17.709> was<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.860> 5/10<00:02:18.370> at<00:02:18.489> a<00:02:18.550> 509<00:02:19.150> though

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
that was a 5/10 at a 509 though

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.850 
that was a 5/10 at a 509 though
back-to-back<00:02:19.989> so<00:02:20.230> they<00:02:20.349> just<00:02:20.530> got<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.769> be

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
back-to-back so they just got to be

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.800 
back-to-back so they just got to be
careful<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.220> mean<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.430> just<00:02:21.519> you<00:02:21.790> know<00:02:21.970> he<00:02:22.599> can't

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
four more to go so it's pretty mentally

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.530 
four more to go so it's pretty mentally
challenging<00:03:28.760> when<00:03:28.880> you<00:03:28.940> have<00:03:29.090> someone<00:03:29.330> with

then they're done and you saw a third of

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.210 
then they're done and you saw a third of
the<00:03:33.740> way<00:03:33.800> to<00:03:33.860> go

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
the way to go

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.190 
the way to go

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
all right can breathe easy through 15

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.949 
all right can breathe easy through 15

the first few miles are so up and down

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.840 
the first few miles are so up and down
that<00:04:38.810> it's<00:04:38.960> hard<00:04:39.140> together<00:04:39.580> it's<00:04:40.580> hard<00:04:40.790> to

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
that it's hard together it's hard to

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.390 
that it's hard together it's hard to
lock<00:04:41.030> in<00:04:41.210> on<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.390> right<00:04:41.570> pace<00:04:41.810> but<00:04:42.170> today<00:04:43.130> we

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
lock in on the right pace but today we

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.670 
lock in on the right pace but today we
were<00:04:43.550> pretty<00:04:44.420> much<00:04:44.660> spot<00:04:44.930> on<00:04:44.960> from<00:04:45.350> the<00:04:45.440> first

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
were pretty much spot on from the first

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.800 
were pretty much spot on from the first
mile<00:04:45.890> we<00:04:46.190> were<00:04:46.310> turning<00:04:47.120> three<00:04:47.240> seconds<00:04:47.630> slow

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
mile we were turning three seconds slow

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.320 
mile we were turning three seconds slow
but<00:04:48.400> I'd<00:04:49.400> rather<00:04:49.520> be<00:04:49.730> a<00:04:49.760> little<00:04:49.940> slow<00:04:50.120> than<00:04:50.300> a

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
but I'd rather be a little slow than a

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.680 
but I'd rather be a little slow than a
little<00:04:50.540> too<00:04:50.660> fast<00:04:51.880> you<00:04:52.880> know<00:04:52.970> nine<00:04:53.240> to<00:04:53.420> twelve

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
little too fast you know nine to twelve

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.870 
little too fast you know nine to twelve
you<00:04:53.900> face<00:04:54.080> a<00:04:54.110> couple<00:04:54.410> little<00:04:54.760> gradual<00:04:55.760> up

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
you face a couple little gradual up

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.240 
you face a couple little gradual up
hills<00:04:56.120> but<00:04:56.450> I<00:04:56.750> usually<00:04:57.470> kind<00:04:57.800> of<00:04:57.920> struggle

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
hills but I usually kind of struggle

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.370 
hills but I usually kind of struggle
there<00:04:58.370> so<00:04:58.700> once<00:04:59.540> I<00:04:59.660> was<00:04:59.690> able<00:04:59.870> to<00:04:59.990> get<00:05:00.170> through

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
there so once I was able to get through

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.910 
there so once I was able to get through
that<00:05:01.810> right<00:05:02.810> on<00:05:02.960> pace<00:05:03.170> and<00:05:03.380> even<00:05:03.560> a<00:05:03.620> little<00:05:03.740> bit

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
that right on pace and even a little bit

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.710 
that right on pace and even a little bit
quick<00:05:04.160> that<00:05:04.880> was<00:05:05.000> kind<00:05:05.210> of<00:05:05.240> a<00:05:05.300> little<00:05:05.450> bit<00:05:05.540> of<00:05:05.660> a

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
quick that was kind of a little bit of a

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.780 
quick that was kind of a little bit of a
boost<00:05:05.870> of<00:05:06.020> confidence<00:05:06.050> and<00:05:06.620> then<00:05:06.770> you<00:05:07.670> go

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
boost of confidence and then you go

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.040 
boost of confidence and then you go
through<00:05:08.030> a<00:05:08.060> couple<00:05:08.240> miles<00:05:08.510> where<00:05:08.780> you<00:05:08.840> start

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
through a couple miles where you start

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.690 
through a couple miles where you start
coming<00:05:09.230> back<00:05:09.320> down<00:05:09.650> so<00:05:10.070> that<00:05:10.220> feels<00:05:10.490> really

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
coming back down so that feels really

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.000 
coming back down so that feels really
nice<00:05:10.910> for<00:05:11.810> the<00:05:11.900> legs<00:05:12.080> it's<00:05:12.380> a<00:05:12.440> lot<00:05:12.590> easier<00:05:12.800> to

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
nice for the legs it's a lot easier to

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:21.970 
nice for the legs it's a lot easier to
hit<00:05:13.280> the<00:05:13.840> 509<00:05:14.840> to<00:05:15.130> 512<00:05:16.330> range<00:05:20.650> miles<00:05:21.650> down<00:05:21.950> a

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
hit the 509 to 512 range miles down a

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.710 
hit the 509 to 512 range miles down a
little<00:05:22.430> bit<00:05:22.580> this<00:05:22.820> week<00:05:23.030> I<00:05:23.270> mean<00:05:23.390> not<00:05:23.480> a<00:05:23.510> whole

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
little bit this week I mean not a whole

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.180 
little bit this week I mean not a whole
lot<00:05:23.870> for<00:05:24.050> just<00:05:24.200> a<00:05:24.260> little<00:05:24.380> bit<00:05:24.530> helped<00:05:24.920> to<00:05:25.070> kind

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
lot for just a little bit helped to kind

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.960 
lot for just a little bit helped to kind
of<00:05:25.780> kept<00:05:26.780> my<00:05:26.900> feeling<00:05:27.320> back<00:05:27.500> and<00:05:27.800> allow<00:05:28.790> myself

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
of kept my feeling back and allow myself

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.490 
of kept my feeling back and allow myself
to<00:05:29.210> be<00:05:29.390> able<00:05:29.480> to<00:05:29.570> walk<00:05:29.750> into<00:05:29.930> that<00:05:30.110> pace<00:05:30.320> and

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
to be able to walk into that pace and

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.990 
to be able to walk into that pace and
just<00:05:30.680> feel<00:05:30.830> smooth<00:05:31.160> and<00:05:31.400> ride<00:05:31.520> the<00:05:31.670> rhythm<00:05:31.790> all

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
just feel smooth and ride the rhythm all

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.940 
just feel smooth and ride the rhythm all
the<00:05:32.090> way<00:05:32.180> out<00:05:32.590> definitely<00:05:33.590> better<00:05:33.710> than<00:05:33.800> the

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
the way out definitely better than the

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.700 
the way out definitely better than the
12<00:05:34.280> out<00:05:34.430> here<00:05:34.670> I'd<00:05:35.360> say<00:05:35.600> it<00:05:35.660> was<00:05:35.750> pretty

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
12 out here I'd say it was pretty

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.760 
12 out here I'd say it was pretty
comparable<00:05:37.070> to<00:05:37.600> the<00:05:38.600> 15<00:05:39.140> I<00:05:39.170> did<00:05:39.560> out<00:05:39.740> here

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
comparable to the 15 I did out here

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.120 
comparable to the 15 I did out here
before<00:05:40.400> world<00:05:40.940> half<00:05:41.210> down<00:05:42.050> on<00:05:42.260> average<00:05:42.500> 511

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
before world half down on average 511

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.950 
before world half down on average 511
and<00:05:43.250> felt<00:05:43.460> really<00:05:43.610> smooth<00:05:44.030> doing<00:05:44.330> it<00:05:44.480> so<00:05:44.720> I

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
and felt really smooth doing it so I

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.050 
and felt really smooth doing it so I
didn't<00:05:45.740> feel<00:05:45.830> quite<00:05:46.160> as<00:05:46.280> smooth<00:05:46.520> today<00:05:46.820> but<00:05:47.000> I

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
didn't feel quite as smooth today but I

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.460 
didn't feel quite as smooth today but I
have<00:05:47.150> a<00:05:47.180> lot<00:05:47.330> more<00:05:47.390> miles<00:05:47.690> on<00:05:47.870> my<00:05:47.960> legs<00:05:48.170> doing

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
have a lot more miles on my legs doing

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.260 
have a lot more miles on my legs doing
it<00:05:48.560> so<00:05:48.770> I<00:05:49.040> think<00:05:49.430> even<00:05:49.640> the<00:05:49.820> fact<00:05:50.000> that<00:05:50.090> maybe

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
it so I think even the fact that maybe

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.580 
it so I think even the fact that maybe
we'll<00:05:50.390> get<00:05:50.510> through<00:05:50.780> the<00:05:50.900> whole<00:05:51.050> thing<00:05:51.290> on

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
we'll get through the whole thing on

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.180 
we'll get through the whole thing on
pace<00:05:52.430> is<00:05:52.730> a<00:05:52.760> good<00:05:52.970> time

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.580 

what's<00:05:57.640> your

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.800 

confidence

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.860 

first<00:06:07.110> inversion
