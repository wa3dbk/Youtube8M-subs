 some quite pretty colors 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.050

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.789
 quite handsome a small variant and 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.890
 another color that is what I now carry in 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.600
 the environment in case there is someone who 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.579

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.589
 commented what if I will give you the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.479
 thank you obviously from here and I'll 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.870
 I will comment but this is not the color 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.330
 of child that I bring 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.370
 then I'm going to leave everything you know 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.990
 that for the people who are in my crew already 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.820
 he's just going to have to go to the saints 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.740
 just and put this color that now what 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.240
 we are going to teach and if you are not in me I think 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.500
 Well, you're going to have them all in the 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.600
 description of the video since it has 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.550
 updated the color in all and it's going to 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.040
 be in the first screen of playstation 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.840
 3 in the second also of playstation 3 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.900
 since the first one was also full 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.510
 you have two xbox 360 crews one is 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.340
 it fills the other not evidently and I believe 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.830
 which is for only people from 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.570
 playstation 4 then if it's not the only thing 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.940
 what are you going to have to do these people is 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.680
 go to the custom saints and put the color 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.960
 I'm going to leave a child 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.910
 code and a video of how to put 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.680
 this color if people do not want to enter 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.950
 in my people mind I do not force anyone 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.660
 it's worth that I show it the color and nothing 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.490
 guys will teach you will teach 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.960
 this piece of color that I like 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.270
 much this color that I wear right now 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.700
 during environment and also the piece of 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.930
 color let's see now if you 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.040
 you want to put the one you wear right now 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.420
 in the center I'm not going to say it now 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.790
 same guys you have to do a 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.910
 trick to be able to put pearl in the 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.690
 in the mate now I'm going to show you what is 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.430
 very very easy 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.140
 I believe that people will like it 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.200
 because I bring you a variant of colors 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.460
 quite pretty good and even worth what 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.050
 First let's make guys as 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.790
 it's very easy I think everything in this 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.590
 trick to be able to finish in the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.020
 Matt knows everyone but good 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.090

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.950

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.320
 We are going to go to mate and 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.720
 let's put the red voucher we put the 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.130
 normal red we buy it and now guys 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.230
 we have to go to metallized and we 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.630
 we walk a little bit by metallic without 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.760
 buy anything we throw back we throw 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.800
 once again back and we go by 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.690
 example to license plate we bought a 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.430
 license plate of another color as you see the 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.770
 we have to buy guys is to do 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.140
 this trick and now go back to painting 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.690
 You are going to see if you go to pearlescent you will 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.820
 to let put a clarification how is it guys 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.380
 It is a very easy trick now 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.360
 let's put yellow races but 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.950
 as you can see you can put any other 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.080
 that another color of the face where the 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.450
 matter you know that you can not go 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.430
 to put yellow and here we will have the 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.530
 color that I was in the environment 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.080
 in case there is someone who has it and now 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.670
 we're going to today's star color guys 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.520
 see what 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.900
 piece of exposed color you will have 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.270
 the code in the description of the video 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.280
 but it's a green we can not call it 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.280
 lime green but it's a green that is 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.989
 really like guys and we're going or 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.690
 be the sun is brutal remains 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.459
 spectacular but we can add a 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.500
 small modification 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.790
 let's go to chromed, you have the 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.400
 normal breeding color that I think that 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.380
 this green is very cool and apart 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.140
 guys if you go to chrome you can 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.230
 buy chrome plated first and if now 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.239
 you're going to mess me up if you're going to kid 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.090
 you can put the color of kiwi 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.860
 how is it worth to see how you get to 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.720

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.150
 you can have this variant which is the 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.280
 chromed with green this one that looks 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.140

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.810
 leave the normal green and nothing more and here 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.910
