00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.460
 hello girls in this tutorial let's see 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.960
 the daring look a look in which we go 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.090
 to give all the prominence to the eyes 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.520
 in blue tones so good I hope that 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.200
 you like it and let's start in the first 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.240
 step let's first work the face 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.500
 to prepare it for makeup like this 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.450
 that the first thing is the concealer 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.010
 luminol colors and we will apply it in 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.879
 the area of ​​the eyes both on the eyelid 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:38.070
 fixed as in the mobile and the lower one we 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.590
 we apply a little and with the brush 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.890
 we are depositing it in the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.890
 zone 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.320
 we are leaving well in the eyelid 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.210
 and then we can blur it so that it does not 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.100
 there is no type of cut with the finger 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.690
 then we will continue with the face 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.040
 we are going to use the new base of 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.510
 makeup of pur light that is going to 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.610
 leave a very bright face and about 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.110
 everything very natural and as always knows and 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.430
 let's use the brush because of 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.500
 this way we make it fix much more 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.140
 the makeup because first we go to 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.509
 press make small touches to 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.300
 clog the pores and in this way do 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.670
 that fix much more the base remember that 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.110
 we have to take very little product and 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.640
 that once we finish the 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.060
 areas we have to beat very well for 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:32.040
 Blur with the tip of the brush 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.040
 small light touches to blur 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.510
 It is also a foundation for makeup 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.190
 light that you will like a lot because 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.710
 It is very comfortable for any type 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.900
 of skin below we will qualify 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.190
 those areas that we usually expel a 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.840
 little bit of brightness 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.720
 so we take the loose powders of 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.430
 luminol colors a little bit on the lid and 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.720
 As you know , we will only apply 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.940
 in zone t so as not to shorten the 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.260
 makeup a light pass on the 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.280
 front 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.280
 another is the nose 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.590
 and on the chin 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.930
 we would finish with the face so 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.760
 Next, let's start 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.220
 work with the eyes we will use 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.630
 the new color duos nature 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.090
 in this case we are going to use two 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.280
 we start with the dark and we're going to do 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.720
 a half banana in the in the eye already 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.700
 you know that the concealer brush is a 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.440
 little bit more precise in this case we have 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.300
 to arrive by marking the outside of the 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.310
 eye half is worth and the same in the 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.840
 lower eyelid so we're going following 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.840
 the basin marking a line 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.410
 we close it well on the outside of the eye 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:39.100
 and we mark the lower lashes 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.350
 up to half closing always with the 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.300
 very important superior always 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.690
 blur so we pick up a brush 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.880
 angular and we blur that line 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.560
 once the eyes are marked we are going to 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.870
 work with the next shadow you 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.880
 let's use number 21 and turquoise 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.610
 and we will integrate it with the color 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.440
 dark we have done right now 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.480
 then it is a pretty intense color and 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.340
 be careful, let's go a little bit 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.590
 of the product and we are depositing it in 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.010
 the tear until it gets together 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.940
 with the other color but without mounting 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.940
 over is important 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.080
 do not forget the eyelashes either 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.080
 lower 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.770
 you have seen that I have not reached 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.090
 put over the dark color and now what 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.980
 what we have to do is integrate them with 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.320
 the angular brush so let's go 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.000
 blurring so that those 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.860
 two colors 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.490
 but without removing is the contrast that 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.490
 we have created previously 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.819
 once integrated the two colors do not 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.439
 worry if you have stained a bit the 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.639
 lower eyelid area because with the 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:53.079
 same makeup brush that we have 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.969
 previously used we can 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.909
 clean it and make more defined the 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:59.920
 strokes with the next step that we're going to 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:02.680
 perform in the eyes is the boat 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.450
 with the cold pencil of luminol colors and 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.730
 let's make a very pegadita line 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.510
 of the eyelashes from the middle of the eye 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.510
 outward 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.820
 and then with a beveled brush 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.970
 let's blur that line very well 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.500
 and raise it a little outside 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.500
 to continue framing the eye 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.030
 and the final step to finish the look 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.760
 let's apply the mascara 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.250
 360 degrees with it let's get a 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.660
 fine now mico and separate very 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.660
 very good our lashes 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.520
 and before the first layer dries 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.020
 remember to apply a second to 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.020
 still intensify more lashes 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.169
 once the eyes are finished to 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.419
 harmonize the makeup set 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.240
 let's mark the cheekbones with a 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:17.060
 rouge which you prefer is worth 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.009
 then remember to always do it 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.910
 by small touches just above 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:23.610
 of the cheekbone 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.560
 with the specific rouge brush and 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.450
 then very important to integrate it with the 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.710
 makeup brush so there is no 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.710
 no type of color cut 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.280
 and finally to finish we're going to 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.199
 Make up the lips chosen a tone 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.599
 apricot that perfectly with a 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.220
 coloration of the eyes but it does not 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:47.669
 that prominence that we have given him thus 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.610
 how important the brush of the 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.650
 lips 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.759
 and we apply it as always from the 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.759
 center towards the sides 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.370
 and with this came in and it happened to me we finished the 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.870
 bug is a very bold look as you have 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.210
 could check and as his own name 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.560

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.970
