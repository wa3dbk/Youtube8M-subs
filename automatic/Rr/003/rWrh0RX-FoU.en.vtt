00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
for this next shot I'm still just typing

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.200 
for this next shot I'm still just typing
/cam<00:01:16.590> P<00:01:19.009> and<00:01:20.009> then<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.490> last<00:01:20.640> shot<00:01:20.909> will<00:01:21.090> be

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
/cam P and then the last shot will be

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.289 
/cam P and then the last shot will be
right<00:01:21.390> here<00:01:21.799> so<00:01:22.799> that's<00:01:22.890> nice<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.790> then

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
right here so that's nice so it's then

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.660 
right here so that's nice so it's then
to<00:01:24.689> create<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> Eren<00:01:25.350> type<00:01:25.500> /cam<00:01:25.770> sp'

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
to create a Eren type /cam sp'

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.950 
to create a Eren type /cam sp'
so<00:01:27.420> it'll<00:01:27.570> say<00:01:27.780> curve<00:01:28.140> path<00:01:28.530> registered<00:01:29.130> and

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
so it'll say curve path registered and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.789 
so it'll say curve path registered and
then<00:01:31.369> /cam<00:01:32.369> go<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.850> p1<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.320> want<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.530> start

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
then /cam go to p1 if you want to start

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.710 
then /cam go to p1 if you want to start
and<00:01:35.119> then<00:01:36.590> type<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.829> /cam<00:01:38.329> start<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.540> then<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
and then type in /cam start and then the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.760 
and then type in /cam start and then the
amount<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:39.960> time<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.229> want<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.380> take<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.680> I'm

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
amount of time you want to take so I'm

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.649 
amount of time you want to take so I'm
gonna<00:01:40.920> want<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.340> take<00:01:41.490> 20<00:01:42.030> seconds<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.600> go

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
gonna want it to take 20 seconds to go

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.120 
gonna want it to take 20 seconds to go
around<00:01:43.430> f1<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:45.439> look<00:01:46.439> how<00:01:46.560> smooth<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.070> is

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
around f1 and look how smooth this is

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.950 
around f1 and look how smooth this is
not<00:01:47.549> pressing<00:01:47.790> any<00:01:48.000> buttons<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.420> my<00:01:48.450> keyboard

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
not pressing any buttons on my keyboard

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.380 
not pressing any buttons on my keyboard
and<00:01:49.189> I<00:01:50.189> think<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.790> part<00:01:50.939> where<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.149> go

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
and I think this is the part where I go

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.149 
and I think this is the part where I go
up<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.880> all<00:01:54.060> smooth<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.899> nice<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.100> if

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
up so it's all smooth and nice and if

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.050 
up so it's all smooth and nice and if
you<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.990> GLSL<00:01:57.990> shaders<00:01:58.020> mod<00:01:58.530> or<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.460> really

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
you have a GLSL shaders mod or a really

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.700 
you have a GLSL shaders mod or a really
nice<00:02:00.210> texture<00:02:00.600> pack<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.079> could<00:02:01.259> look<00:02:01.350> really

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
nice texture pack this could look really

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.090 
nice texture pack this could look really
really<00:02:02.070> good<00:02:02.659> but<00:02:03.659> if<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.140> want<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.979> be

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
really good but if you want it to be

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.290 
really good but if you want it to be
even<00:02:05.340> better<00:02:07.099> ok<00:02:08.099> if<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.670> want<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.940> be<00:02:09.030> even

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
even better ok if you want it to be even

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.050 
even better ok if you want it to be even
better<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.660> can<00:02:09.840> set<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> target<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.739> which<00:02:11.060> you

and such cams start 15 seconds and now
I'm<00:02:37.380> always<00:02:37.620> looking<00:02:38.069> at<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.370> middle<00:02:38.610> button

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
I'm always looking at that middle button

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.390 
I'm always looking at that middle button
without<00:02:39.150> having<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.540> keep<00:02:39.750> my<00:02:39.930> mouse<00:02:40.400> looking

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
without having to keep my mouse looking

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.699 
without having to keep my mouse looking
at<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.640> mountain<00:02:42.200> so<00:02:43.200> now<00:02:43.350> I'm<00:02:43.500> always
