00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.619 
probably see see them in the trilogy as
soldiers<00:00:54.160> just<00:00:54.850> because<00:00:55.090> you<00:00:55.180> know<00:00:55.269> they<00:00:55.480> had

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
soldiers just because you know they had

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.060 
soldiers just because you know they had
to<00:00:55.750> distinguish<00:00:56.140> between<00:00:56.260> male<00:00:56.859> and<00:00:56.890> female

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
to distinguish between male and female

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.799

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
but as a main character is definitely

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.479

on<00:01:12.370> how<00:01:12.550> this<00:01:12.850> DLC<00:01:13.330> with<00:01:13.510> mo<00:01:13.930> all<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.800> story

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
on how this DLC with mo all the story

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.340

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
but we definitely knew that it would be

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.930 
but we definitely knew that it would be
interesting<00:02:52.049> to<00:02:52.200> have<00:02:52.440> actually<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.280> dedicated
