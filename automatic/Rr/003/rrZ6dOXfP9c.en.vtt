00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.940
 hello today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:15.690
 How to root your Samsung Galaxy Fein 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.789
 for that we have to first go to 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.800
 settings 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.390
 and in the bottom part that appears 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.090
 developer options 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:30.070
 then we activate this 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.070
 and a warning does not come out we give it to be 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.040
 now in usb decoration the 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.050
 we select 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.050
 and we say yes 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:47.339
 inside the computer we need 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.130
 access the cell phone card to 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.160
 can copy 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:55.470
 the hill file 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:00.430
 it has to stay in the root 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:03.380
 that is, outside as it is there 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.990
 so that when we did the recovery mode 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.219
 allows us to decompress this was going to be 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.689
 the one that will surround the cell 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:13.130
 3 finish ready let's turn off the 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.189
 phone 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.189
 i 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.580
 As for the computer, we need 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.940
 this program called odin that is the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.270
 I'm going to leave it at the bottom and what 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.100
 what we are going to do is open it 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.420
 the next step in this cell since 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:44.440
 we do not have off is touching this button 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.540
 along with the low volume plus this to the 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.440
 same time so you can go into 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.440
 double mic mode 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:02:00.009
 now it appears on this screen 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.630
 that with the one above we can continue and 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.700
 with the one below going back to where 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.200
 we were like us we must enter and 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.200
 we press the above 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.890
 and now we are in a double mode 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.180
 therefore it is time to connect our 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.180
 phone footprint 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.290
 when we start the solo of we select 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.060
 these two that everything is simply 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.140
 we select this and the pda what 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.990
 we find in the psir that leaves them and 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.510
 then decompress 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.590
 you just have to press start while 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.590
 we are in that mode 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:53.489
 and our cell and was ready to 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.489
 less in this step 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.969
 for the next step we do not need 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.859
 enter the recovery mode and let's stop 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:03.930
 the volume above the off button 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.930
 and the start at the same time 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.750
 Y 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.850
 and what we did on the computer was 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.520
 change this menu so that we 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.720
 appear like this and the zip that we already added 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:28.380
 we could execute it and we're going to 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:32.790
 where it says urges yes and to 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.440

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.070
 select where we put the and how 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.750
 is the external one we go to sd and 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.750
 we select again with the one below 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:53.920
 we continue navigating with what are these 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:58.209
 and here are the chips in the roxy 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:01.319
 we will select it one more time and we will 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.319
 we give that if we want 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.720

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.780
 Ready says that she is you what 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.090
 correctly and now we can continue 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:21.410
 with our happy life 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.410
 we return with the one of bach 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:27.199
 and here says installing bots the user 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.080
 now we give you in robot system so that

 start the cell phone as normally 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.320
 would do 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.120
 we give in yes 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.720
 once we can consolidate 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:05.040
 We regularly see an application 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.040
 what is this 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:12.950
 superuser that is what allows you 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:18.220
 give the permissions to the applications 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.220
 necessary for example titanium vehicle 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.440
 in some cases before they were catches 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:31.560
 with this application you will see 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.830
 yes and no and you can use them as if 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.830
 nothing 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.350

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.030
 phone was already surrounded if they have 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.000
 some doubts and I can solve them 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:46.570
 leave them down here if you dare 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.130
