today is show you the the override
switch<00:00:06.960> on<00:00:07.350> one<00:00:07.500> of<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.649> water<00:00:07.859> valves<00:00:08.690> right

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
switch on one of the water valves right

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.390 
switch on one of the water valves right
now<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.900> boiler<00:00:10.440> is<00:00:10.530> currently<00:00:10.860> going<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.280> the

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
now the boiler is currently going to the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.700 
now the boiler is currently going to the
second<00:00:11.790> floor<00:00:11.969> but<00:00:12.450> as<00:00:13.019> long<00:00:13.200> as<00:00:13.230> it's<00:00:13.410> pumping

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
second floor but as long as it's pumping

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.250 
second floor but as long as it's pumping
water<00:00:13.950> that's<00:00:14.219> all<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.490> needs<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:15.170> for<00:00:16.170> this

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
water that's all it needs and for this

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.689 
water that's all it needs and for this
one<00:00:16.440> I'm<00:00:16.500> going<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.680> focus<00:00:16.740> on<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.220> basement

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
one I'm going to focus on the basement

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.390 
one I'm going to focus on the basement
since<00:00:18.090> everything<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.600> nearby<00:00:19.220> the<00:00:20.220> only

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
since everything is nearby the only

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.160 
since everything is nearby the only
problem<00:00:20.760> with<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> basement<00:00:21.150> air<00:00:21.480> handler<00:00:21.990> is

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
problem with the basement air handler is

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.050 
problem with the basement air handler is
I<00:00:22.439> kind<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.680> call<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:22.980> an<00:00:23.130> installation<00:00:23.760> fail

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
I kind of call it an installation fail

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.120 
I kind of call it an installation fail
and<00:00:24.930> by<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.380> mean<00:00:25.410> look-see<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.949> wall

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
and by this I mean look-see the wall

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.830 
and by this I mean look-see the wall
right<00:00:26.310> here<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.300> where<00:00:27.510> they<00:00:27.630> put

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
right here this is where they put

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.480 
right here this is where they put
everything<00:00:28.050> for<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.650> right<00:00:28.890> along<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.310> wall

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
everything for it right along the wall

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.950 
everything for it right along the wall
instead<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.090> other<00:00:30.269> side<00:00:30.570> like<00:00:30.750> on<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
instead of on the other side like on the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.840 
instead of on the other side like on the
first<00:00:31.230> floor<00:00:31.470> one<00:00:31.679> why<00:00:32.250> they<00:00:32.460> did<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.669> I

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
first floor one why they did that I

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.690 
first floor one why they did that I
don't<00:00:33.030> know<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:33.980> okay<00:00:34.980> anyway<00:00:35.399> if<00:00:35.579> you

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
don't know but okay anyway if you

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.209 
don't know but okay anyway if you
remember<00:00:36.000> from<00:00:36.090> what<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.329> said<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.680> heat

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
remember from what I said the the heat

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.560 
remember from what I said the the heat
exchanger<00:00:38.640> thermostats<00:00:39.210> are<00:00:39.360> always

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
exchanger thermostats are always

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.240 
exchanger thermostats are always
energized<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.350> when<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> water<00:00:40.800> gets<00:00:40.980> hot

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
energized and when the water gets hot

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.100 
energized and when the water gets hot
enough<00:00:41.370> they'll<00:00:41.670> turn<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.420> that's<00:00:43.020> what

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
enough they'll turn on so that's what

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.600 
enough they'll turn on so that's what
I'm<00:00:43.200> going<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.379> do<00:00:43.500> today<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.010> just<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.309> prove

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
I'm going to do today and just to prove

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.819 
I'm going to do today and just to prove
to<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:44.960> it's<00:00:45.960> not<00:00:46.170> being<00:00:46.350> turned<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.739> by

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
to you that it's not being turned on by

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.920 
to you that it's not being turned on by
the<00:00:46.890> thermostat<00:00:50.000> see<00:00:51.000> right<00:00:51.360> now<00:00:51.480> switch<00:00:51.780> is

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the thermostat see right now switch is

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.450 
the thermostat see right now switch is
currently<00:00:52.230> set<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.590> off<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.100> we're<00:00:53.280> going<00:00:53.370> to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
currently set to off and we're going to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.369 
currently set to off and we're going to
leave<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.820> there<00:00:54.000> right<00:00:54.120> now<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:55.020> now<00:00:55.199> what

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
leave it on there right now so now what

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.689 
leave it on there right now so now what
I'm<00:00:55.469> gonna<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:57.859> I'm<00:00:58.859> gonna<00:00:58.949> try<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.309> go<00:00:59.489> down

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try to go down

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.119 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try to go down
here<00:01:00.059> carefully<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.870> carefully<00:01:01.859> move<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
here carefully and carefully move the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.640 
here carefully and carefully move the
override<00:01:03.059> switch<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.570> here<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.989> right<00:01:04.229> see

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
override switch on here to the right see

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.179 
override switch on here to the right see
if<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:04.920> get<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.129> into<00:01:05.220> my<00:01:05.369> place<00:01:10.189> perfect

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
if I can get it into my place perfect

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.600 
if I can get it into my place perfect
got<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.729> okay<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:12.720> right<00:01:13.170> now<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.310> still

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
got it okay so right now this is still

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.600 
got it okay so right now this is still
running<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:14.970> pumping<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.310> right<00:01:17.310> now<00:01:17.460> it's

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
running and pumping so right now it's

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.880 
running and pumping so right now it's
currently<00:01:17.790> sending<00:01:18.240> all<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.200> hot<00:01:19.350> water<00:01:19.590> to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
currently sending all the hot water to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.530 
currently sending all the hot water to
the<00:01:20.009> basement<00:01:20.430> heat<00:01:20.729> exchanger<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.360> when<00:01:21.450> it

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
the basement heat exchanger and when it

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.120 
the basement heat exchanger and when it
gets<00:01:21.689> hot<00:01:21.840> enough<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.290> should<00:01:22.500> turn<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.860> even

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
gets hot enough it should turn on even

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.490 
gets hot enough it should turn on even
with<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> thermostat<00:01:23.729> set<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.210> off<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:25.409> you

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
with the thermostat set to off so you

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.410 
with the thermostat set to off so you
know<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> pretty<00:01:25.920> cool<00:01:26.130> thing<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.460> have<00:01:26.670> in

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
know it's a pretty cool thing to have in

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.020 
know it's a pretty cool thing to have in
case<00:01:28.049> you're<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.979> know<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.189> case<00:01:29.400> your<00:01:29.610> valve

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
case you're you know in case your valve

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.520 
case you're you know in case your valve
ever<00:01:30.240> fails<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.079> water<00:01:34.290> is

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
ever fails and and the water is

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.679 
ever fails and and the water is
currently<00:01:34.979> about<00:01:36.439> maybe<00:01:37.640> 175<00:01:38.640> degrees<00:01:39.030> so

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
currently about maybe 175 degrees so

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.030 
currently about maybe 175 degrees so
it's<00:01:39.840> definitely<00:01:40.170> definitely<00:01:40.530> at<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.829> proper

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
it's definitely definitely at the proper

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.260 
it's definitely definitely at the proper
operating<00:01:41.520> temperature<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.150> heat

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
operating temperature for the heat

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.810 
operating temperature for the heat
exchanger<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:43.100> since<00:01:44.100> everything<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.610> right

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
exchanger and since everything is right

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.280 
exchanger and since everything is right
here<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.180> shouldn't<00:01:45.479> take<00:01:45.509> too<00:01:45.630> long<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:46.229> it

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
here it shouldn't take too long for it

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.639 
here it shouldn't take too long for it
to<00:01:46.320> turn<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:48.380> everything<00:01:49.380> should<00:01:49.530> be

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
to turn on so everything should be

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.010 
to turn on so everything should be
working<00:01:49.829> properly<00:01:50.100> now<00:01:50.689> I<00:01:51.689> guess<00:01:51.869> we'll<00:01:51.990> just

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
working properly now I guess we'll just

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.850 
working properly now I guess we'll just
wait<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.530> turn<00:01:52.710> on

auto so you can tell that the thermostat
is<00:02:37.980> not<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.250> cause<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.640> heat<00:02:38.760> going<00:02:39.080> so

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
is not the cause of the heat going so
