the<00:00:11.250> best<00:00:11.670> shape<00:00:11.929> humanly<00:00:12.929> possible<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:14.000> this

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
the best shape humanly possible and this

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.880 
the best shape humanly possible and this
bathing<00:00:15.179> suit<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:16.109> their<00:00:16.770> uniform<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:21.890> think

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
bathing suit is their uniform I think

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.310 
bathing suit is their uniform I think
that<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.310> gives<00:00:23.880> them<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.150> chance<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.570> show<00:00:25.170> off

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
that it gives them a chance to show off

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.259 
that it gives them a chance to show off
what<00:00:25.560> they've<00:00:25.740> been<00:00:25.920> working<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.609> hard<00:00:26.640> for<00:00:27.240> I

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
what they've been working so hard for I

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.109 
what they've been working so hard for I
mean<00:00:27.570> especially<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:28.140> pageants<00:00:28.650> but<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.130> think

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
mean especially in pageants but I think

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.150 
mean especially in pageants but I think
that<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.960> know<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.349> body<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> beautiful

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
that you know the body is a beautiful

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.040 
that you know the body is a beautiful
thing<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.180> think<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.450> it's<00:00:33.719> great<00:00:33.930> that

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
thing and I think that it's great that

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.810 
thing and I think that it's great that
we<00:00:34.469> get<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.649> celebrate<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.340> by<00:00:35.550> wearing

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
we get to celebrate that by wearing

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.160 
we get to celebrate that by wearing
little<00:00:36.719> bikinis<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:38.270> mean<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.300> think<00:00:39.390> most<00:00:39.899> women

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
little bikinis I mean I think most women

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.530 
little bikinis I mean I think most women
probably<00:00:40.620> are<00:00:40.829> nervous<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.190> wear<00:00:41.399> bikini<00:00:41.790> but

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
probably are nervous to wear bikini but

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.670 
probably are nervous to wear bikini but
I<00:00:42.750> think<00:00:43.020> that's<00:00:43.170> something<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.559> have

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
I think that's something that you have

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.229 
I think that's something that you have
to<00:00:43.829> overcome<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.579> something<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.090> do

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
to overcome and something that you do

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.779 
to overcome and something that you do
overcome<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.320> think<00:00:46.739> confidence<00:00:47.039> shines

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
overcome and I think confidence shines

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.430 
overcome and I think confidence shines
through<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.360> regardless<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.870> what<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.230> look

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
through so regardless of what you look

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.470 
through so regardless of what you look
like<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> bikini<00:00:50.250> if<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.670> feel<00:00:50.969> great<00:00:51.360> in

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
like in the bikini if you feel great in

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.850 
like in the bikini if you feel great in
it<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.960> look<00:00:52.079> great

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.310 

when<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.890> wear<00:00:56.190> swimsuit<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.000> feel<00:00:57.420> quite

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
when I wear swimsuit I feel quite

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.799 
when I wear swimsuit I feel quite
confident<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.160> play<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> lot<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.239> sport<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.719> I

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
confident I play a lot of sport and I

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.149 
confident I play a lot of sport and I
think<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.289> shows<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.890> my<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.640> my<00:01:02.719> body<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.199> I'm

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
think that shows in my in my body so I'm

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.920 
think that shows in my in my body so I'm
quite<00:01:05.760> proud<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.540> can<00:01:06.720> feel

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
quite proud of that and I can feel

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.090 
quite proud of that and I can feel
contract

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
contract

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.840 
contract
I<00:01:08.630> think<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> swimsuit<00:01:10.140> competition<00:01:10.850> one

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
I think the swimsuit competition one

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.760 
I think the swimsuit competition one
shows<00:01:12.240> your<00:01:12.450> health<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.810> fitness<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.229> two

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
shows your health and fitness and two

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.249 
shows your health and fitness and two
shows<00:01:14.070> your<00:01:14.250> femininity<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.390> elegance<00:01:16.020> and

shows your femininity and elegance and

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.359 
shows your femininity and elegance and
sex<00:01:16.979> appeal

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.319 

I<00:01:21.109> think<00:01:22.109> it's<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.710> most<00:01:22.859> important<00:01:23.520> thing<00:01:23.880> in

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
I think it's the most important thing in

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.870 
I think it's the most important thing in
the<00:01:24.719> pageant<00:01:25.200> because<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.219> totally<00:01:26.640> see

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the pageant because you can totally see

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.760 
the pageant because you can totally see
the<00:01:27.030> full<00:01:27.329> woman<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.990> how<00:01:28.109> she<00:01:28.140> looks<00:01:28.560> like

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
how she walks and how she can really

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.459 
how she walks and how she can really
show<00:01:32.819> that<00:01:33.030> attitude<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.899> bikini<00:01:35.539> it<00:01:36.539> was<00:01:36.780> 60
