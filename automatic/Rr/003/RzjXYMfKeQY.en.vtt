better level of conditioning that I've

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.730 
better level of conditioning that I've
seen<00:01:10.240> in<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.450> last<00:01:10.509> two<00:01:10.900> weeks<00:01:10.930> he<00:01:11.619> was

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.770 
seen in the last two weeks he was
dominant<00:01:12.310> here<00:01:12.580> this<00:01:13.030> is<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.270> Chi<00:01:13.450> that<00:01:13.750> I

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
dominant here this is the Chi that I

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.679 
dominant here this is the Chi that I
would<00:01:14.350> like<00:01:14.470> to<00:01:14.500> see<00:01:14.770> it<00:01:14.950> a<00:01:14.979> lot<00:01:15.490> of<00:01:15.689> upcoming

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
shows I think he gets too big sometimes

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.670 
shows I think he gets too big sometimes
and<00:01:19.420> it<00:01:19.509> ruins<00:01:19.780> his<00:01:19.840> shape<00:01:20.080> I<00:01:20.259> still<00:01:20.530> like<00:01:20.650> to

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
what we learn from Dexter is like

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.070 
what we learn from Dexter is like
Dexter's<00:02:12.909> shredded<00:02:13.330> yeah<00:02:13.450> of<00:02:13.629> course<00:02:13.840> because

Dexter's shredded yeah of course because

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.289 
Dexter's shredded yeah of course because
Dexter's<00:02:14.470> texture<00:02:14.799> but<00:02:14.950> he's<00:02:15.400> just<00:02:15.970> smaller

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
Dexter's texture but he's just smaller

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.600 
Dexter's texture but he's just smaller
and<00:02:16.569> I<00:02:17.110> surging<00:02:17.560> branch<00:02:17.830> Warren<00:02:18.190> makes<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.489> nice

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
and I surging branch Warren makes a nice

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.860 
and I surging branch Warren makes a nice
comeback<00:02:18.970> from<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.209> Olympia<00:02:19.599> he'll<00:02:19.720> take

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
comeback from the Olympia he'll take

comeback from the Olympia he'll take
third<00:02:20.170> here<00:02:20.349> today<00:02:20.620> not<00:02:21.040> not<00:02:21.340> much<00:02:21.519> to<00:02:21.790> really

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
third here today not not much to really

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.960 
third here today not not much to really
know<00:02:22.450> compete<00:02:23.319> with<00:02:23.500> branch<00:02:23.830> but<00:02:24.549> branch<00:02:24.790> is<00:02:24.909> a

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
know compete with branch but branch is a

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.220 
know compete with branch but branch is a
lot<00:02:25.150> tighter<00:02:25.390> here<00:02:25.599> than<00:02:25.780> we<00:02:25.870> saw<00:02:26.019> him<00:02:26.140> at<00:02:26.200> the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
lot tighter here than we saw him at the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.869 
lot tighter here than we saw him at the
Olympia<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:26.680> was<00:02:26.860> not<00:02:27.280> impressed<00:02:27.519> at<00:02:27.849> the

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
Olympia I was not impressed at the

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.030 
Olympia I was not impressed at the
Olympia<00:02:28.269> much<00:02:28.780> better<00:02:29.080> here<00:02:29.379> but<00:02:29.799> of<00:02:29.980> course

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
Olympia much better here but of course

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.830 
Olympia much better here but of course
you<00:02:30.310> got<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.610> right<00:02:30.760> leg<00:02:31.000> that<00:02:31.209> he<00:02:31.420> had<00:02:31.540> you

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
you got the right leg that he had you

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.900 
you got the right leg that he had you
know<00:02:31.870> torn<00:02:32.349> is<00:02:32.830> still<00:02:33.129> not<00:02:33.280> up<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.549> snuff<00:02:33.610> at

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
know torn is still not up to snuff at

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.980 
know torn is still not up to snuff at
the<00:02:33.970> other<00:02:34.090> one<00:02:34.240> and<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.480> think<00:02:34.720> it's<00:02:34.810> like

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
the other one and I think it's like

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.200 
the other one and I think it's like
sighs<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.470> general<00:02:35.800> is<00:02:35.890> down

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
sighs in general is down

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.520 
sighs in general is down
a little<00:02:36.480> bit<00:02:36.600> which<00:02:36.900> takes<00:02:37.140> away<00:02:37.350> some<00:02:37.410> of

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
a little bit which takes away some of

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.080 
a little bit which takes away some of
the<00:02:37.650> freakiness<00:02:38.070> from<00:02:38.310> branch<00:02:38.520> yeah<00:02:39.000> I

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
the freakiness from branch yeah I

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.840 
the freakiness from branch yeah I
totally<00:02:39.450> agree<00:02:39.750> like<00:02:40.620> from<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.370> back<00:02:41.550> and

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
totally agree like from the back and

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.780 
totally agree like from the back and
from<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.450> front<00:02:42.720> branches<00:02:43.530> like<00:02:43.830> shredded<00:02:44.310> to

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
from the front branches like shredded to

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.480 
from the front branches like shredded to
the<00:02:44.880> bone<00:02:45.410> but<00:02:46.410> he<00:02:46.920> has<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.130> get<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.370> ice

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
the bone but he has to get the ice

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.120 
the bone but he has to get the ice
symmetry<00:02:47.910> in<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.030> legs<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.770> text<00:02:49.770> was<00:02:49.890> just

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
symmetry in the legs and text was just

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.210 
symmetry in the legs and text was just
better<00:02:50.280> so<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:50.580> think<00:02:50.670> branch<00:02:51.360> will<00:02:51.540> take<00:02:51.690> third

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
better so I think branch will take third

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.740 
better so I think branch will take third
fourth<00:02:53.220> place<00:02:53.430> might<00:02:53.760> be<00:02:53.790> controversial<00:02:54.510> e

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
fourth place might be controversial e

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.260 
fourth place might be controversial e
Tony<00:02:54.990> Freeman<00:02:55.470> who<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.650> think<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:56.280> probably<00:02:56.880> one

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
Tony Freeman who I think is probably one

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.520 
Tony Freeman who I think is probably one
of<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.420> worst<00:02:57.540> Tony<00:02:57.870> Freeman's<00:02:58.260> I've<00:02:58.350> ever

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
of the worst Tony Freeman's I've ever

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.800 
of the worst Tony Freeman's I've ever
seen<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.670> I'm<00:02:59.790> saying<00:03:00.240> this<00:03:00.450> because<00:03:00.570> the

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
seen and I'm saying this because the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.900 
seen and I'm saying this because the
truth<00:03:01.050> he's<00:03:01.260> just<00:03:01.440> very<00:03:01.590> soft<00:03:02.070> here<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.490> would

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
truth he's just very soft here I would

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.640 
truth he's just very soft here I would
have<00:03:03.030> actually<00:03:03.180> had<00:03:03.420> William<00:03:03.630> Banach<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:04.530> was

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
have actually had William Banach it was

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.320 
have actually had William Banach it was
a<00:03:04.680> surprise<00:03:04.950> from<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.550> Netherlands<00:03:06.060> I

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
a surprise from the Netherlands I

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.910 
a surprise from the Netherlands I
thought<00:03:06.900> he<00:03:07.020> should<00:03:07.140> have<00:03:07.230> done<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.410> 212<00:03:07.740> but

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
thought he should have done the 212 but

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.110 
thought he should have done the 212 but
he's<00:03:08.070> going<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.520> would<00:03:08.760> have<00:03:08.850> had<00:03:08.940> him<00:03:09.030> in

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
he's going to I would have had him in
