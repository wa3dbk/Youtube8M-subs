00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 very good everyone I'm secret and we're 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.060
 in a video in an explanatory video like this 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.790
 a little because many of you have 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.010
 asked what happened to the affiliation of 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.570
 you already know that walton streaming by 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.360
 there that is lost 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.789
 I explain, it's worth the last streaming of 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.439
 the movie of tri andy and we did it more 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.020
 soon that we made around 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.060
 5 and 7 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.760
 suddenly good they put forward the hour of 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.529
 tournament closing then at 7 o'clock 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.630
 they cut the connection was cut off for me 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.170
 play combats and other super 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.300
 problems when starting streaming 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.469
 but let's go as he let me continue not 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.170
 for the end and the beginning of a new one 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:45.059
 and I think that's why later when a 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.339
 Once the streaming finished, it received the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.559
 video from youtube instead of putting everything 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.449
 the streaming I put on the 18 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.579
 first minutes worth is that not even 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:59.370
 until the first fight ends as 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.489
 I was trying to do things and I do not have 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.320
 Tailored or option to put again 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.470
 they discriminate you whole 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.830
 well obviously left hidden I want 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.030
 they could see from that luck I 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.360
 I really feel that I can not do anything 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.390
 plus 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.369
 and good talking about the play off and andy 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.800
 the results have come out today 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.390
 then describe a bit then 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.680
 you have participated if to a crisis 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.990
 participate in a cough tournament in 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.790
 line as you can look at things like 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.259
 this page is very slow and will take a long time 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.180
 You've already seen all the tabs aside 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.030
 ok this would be the main page 3 of 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.820
 that dot pokemon dash dot 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.800
 we would go to online tournaments worth tournaments 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.800
 online then we could select to 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.540
 here in prison and master category 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.710
 I will put the explanation published and 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.240
 well this would be the global explanation 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.970
 OK 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.540
 this would be the top 10 let's say best 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.830
 classified with more than 10 thousand 900 and in 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.820
 my 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:06.909
 in my profile it can be seen that of 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.869
 157 is worth 37 and you can see 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.869
 to combat 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.480
 in principle it should be seen with 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.920
 with this with me 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.220
 with my little good and others 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.420
 good 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.950
 advanced here and good if you have 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.950
 participated then you can give to 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.700
 our country when Spain and the 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.700
 we recorded that 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:50.300
 will be the eighth according to Spanish eighth 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.300
 Spanish in the ranking let's say 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:57.090
 and well here you see the pokemon too 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.450
 the most used because they are in English after 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.670
 accept terms miuto and if you 25 days 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.660
 of them you can see then the 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.660
 percentage of uses 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:14.270
 five of the last days a line and of 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:17.830
 return respite to impart 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.320
 and then also victories data 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.840
 of defeats but it 's because those who 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.310
 normally the skill is good 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.230
 the natures 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.650
 the object, as most people wear ink 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.650
 chosen 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.620
 then so a little justification and 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.750
 others and something else because I wanted to say 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.500
 is that good here we take to my 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.500
 classification 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.910
 defeats 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.420
 the combat box thank you why 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.420
 it leaves me 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.070
 why 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.580
 and here 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.880
 If you see it, I'll do it a little more 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.880
 big 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.349
 these are the ones that we fought 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.970
 I played several then some of my 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.739
 rivals because as I was in 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.560
 streaming I'm not going to save those 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:23.970
 codes I was already fat a lot of the 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.740
 another 16 then here you see as some 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.830
 of my rivals also a combo test that 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.500
 I won because there were some 700 that 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.930
 you have because a combat against optimyth 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.080
 will have against since it has been another with 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:41.270
 trabs team 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:43.729
 via the fighting or if you meteis 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.430
 you already know in the camera fight connected 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.919
 to the internet you can put these three not 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.689
 put four codes and you can see 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.610
 these four combats that stay is 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:54.830
 the same as watching them in streaming but 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.629
 well at least you can see a 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.449
 little some of the things that happened in 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:01.550
 the last day and they were not so nothing 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.139
 the explanations have already come out 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.200
 I wanted the process in more or less like 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.830
 you can go looking and more 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.830
 everything 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:17.810
 we are not left behind 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.280
 endorsements that previously left classifications 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.210
 156 then here it takes you 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.210
 directly to 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.390
 and then that I just hope that I have 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.100
 liked and streaming connections 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.410
 at least 4 fighters that you can see 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:37.030
 here that nothing else we do in the next 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.030
 goodbye video
