these these ornamental cabbages in the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.150 
these these ornamental cabbages in the
spring<00:00:30.510> when<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.080> cabbages<00:00:31.590> are<00:00:31.740> starting<00:00:32.070> to

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
spring when the cabbages are starting to

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.310 
spring when the cabbages are starting to
die<00:00:32.340> down<00:00:32.369> then<00:00:33.149> therefore<00:00:34.079> those<00:00:34.200> were

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
die down then therefore those were

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.410 
die down then therefore those were
actually<00:00:34.739> peek<00:00:35.340> through<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.940> will<00:00:36.210> grow

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
actually peek through and will grow

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.510 
actually peek through and will grow
through<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> cabbages<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.500> then<00:00:37.590> create

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
through the cabbages and then create

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.459 
through the cabbages and then create
beautiful<00:00:39.149> flowers<00:00:39.510> again<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.350> have

during the winter they will actually

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.810 
during the winter they will actually
start<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.579> form<00:01:35.579> sprouts<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.420> roots<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.820> they

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
start to form sprouts and roots and they

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.539 
start to form sprouts and roots and they
can<00:01:38.970> actually<00:01:39.860> handle<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.890> cold<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.400> they

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
can actually handle the cold so they

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.910 
can actually handle the cold so they
will<00:01:41.670> not<00:01:41.759> freeze<00:01:42.500> should<00:01:43.500> not<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:43.860> any

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
danger of that and the cabbages will

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.760 
danger of that and the cabbages will
actually<00:01:47.840> keep<00:01:48.840> color<00:01:49.140> for<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> entire
