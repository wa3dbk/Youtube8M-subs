00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
of those dumb things I have no clue what

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.490 
of those dumb things I have no clue what
these<00:00:27.029> are<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.449> they<00:00:27.810> look<00:00:28.050> really<00:00:28.230> cool

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.490 
these are and they look really cool
though<00:00:28.820> I'm<00:00:29.820> guessing<00:00:30.660> maybe<00:00:30.900> these<00:00:31.199> are<00:00:31.380> like

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
though I'm guessing maybe these are like

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.540 
though I'm guessing maybe these are like
pictures<00:00:31.949> from<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.369> movie<00:00:32.610> yeah<00:00:33.860> I<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.340> seen

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
pictures from the movie yeah I have seen

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.260 
pictures from the movie yeah I have seen
people<00:00:35.850> do<00:00:36.090> videos<00:00:36.420> on<00:00:36.540> these<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.040> um<00:00:38.270> I've

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
people do videos on these and um I've

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.180 
people do videos on these and um I've
also<00:00:39.480> opened<00:00:39.629> up<00:00:40.020> smaller<00:00:40.379> versions<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.980> these

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
also opened up smaller versions of these

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.830 
also opened up smaller versions of these
and<00:00:41.489> they<00:00:41.579> weren't<00:00:41.760> accurate<00:00:42.000> equality<00:00:42.600> but

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
and they weren't accurate equality but

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.290
