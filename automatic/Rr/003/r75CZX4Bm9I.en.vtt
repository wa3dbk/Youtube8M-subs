00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
play on a pearl tom drum for you we use

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.210 
play on a pearl tom drum for you we use
this<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.350> lot<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.979> Tom's<00:01:24.290> especially<00:01:25.290> sometimes

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
this a lot on Tom's especially sometimes

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.999 
this a lot on Tom's especially sometimes
horns<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:26.850> not<00:01:27.030> really<00:01:27.509> we<00:01:27.990> tend<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
horns but not really we tend to like the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.940 
horns but not really we tend to like the
audix<00:01:29.369> microphones<00:01:30.270> because<00:01:30.780> they're<00:01:31.259> really

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
audix microphones because they're really

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.190 
audix microphones because they're really
really<00:01:32.100> directional<00:01:32.939> they've<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:33.630> such<00:01:34.170> a

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
really directional they've like such a

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.800 
really directional they've like such a
sharp<00:01:34.560> cardioid<00:01:35.430> pattern<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.659> don't

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
sharp cardioid pattern that you don't

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.120 
sharp cardioid pattern that you don't
have<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.960> really<00:01:37.409> worry<00:01:37.500> about<00:01:37.799> getting

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
have to really worry about getting

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.850 
have to really worry about getting
symbols<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:39.030> them<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.750> they<00:01:40.380> actually<00:01:40.710> have<00:01:40.829> a

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
symbols in them and they actually have a

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.429 
symbols in them and they actually have a
decent<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.549> decent<00:01:42.090> sound<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.689> them<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
decent a decent sound to them for the

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.520 
decent a decent sound to them for the
price<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.369> again<00:01:45.270> that's<00:01:45.570> kind<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.049> what<00:01:46.290> we

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
price so again that's kind of what we

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.260 
price so again that's kind of what we
focus<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.340> here<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.270> getting<00:01:48.750> really<00:01:49.409> usable

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
focus on here it's getting really usable

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.780 
focus on here it's getting really usable
sounds<00:01:51.270> as<00:01:52.079> little<00:01:52.470> past<00:01:52.680> as<00:01:52.950> possible<00:01:53.610> just

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
sounds as little past as possible just

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.660 
sounds as little past as possible just
to<00:01:54.060> kind<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.329> sustain<00:01:54.810> ourselves<00:01:55.049> as<00:01:55.920> as<00:01:56.250> an

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
to kind of sustain ourselves as as an

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.480 
to kind of sustain ourselves as as an
independent<00:01:57.329> studio<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.320> label<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.159> think

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
independent studio and label I think

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.950 
independent studio and label I think
we've<00:01:59.610> been<00:01:59.729> pretty<00:02:00.000> successful<00:02:00.119> with<00:02:00.750> these

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
we've been pretty successful with these

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.130 
we've been pretty successful with these
and<00:02:01.320> I'll<00:02:01.500> give<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.180> an<00:02:03.180> example<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.810> what<00:02:03.990> it

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
and I'll give you an example of what it

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.310 
and I'll give you an example of what it
sounds<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:04.640> so<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:05.909> an<00:02:06.180> odd<00:02:06.329> XD<00:02:06.689> one<00:02:07.079> on

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
sounds like so this is an odd XD one on

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.479 
sounds like so this is an odd XD one on
a<00:02:08.479> Tom
