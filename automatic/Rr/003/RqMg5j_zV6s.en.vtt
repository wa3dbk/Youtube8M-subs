00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:16.119
 2012 season to frame that 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.699
 we have won everything better almost everything 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.140
 via myth the enduro 1 with me all e3 with 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.240
 both inside 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.510
 we arrived only seconds with 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.190
 cristobal guerrero in and we have 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.619
 however won the three constructors' titles 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.079
 so we say that all things are 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.579
 go the right way 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.829
 unlike the previous season 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.360
 in 2011 where in practice we did not have 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.170
 won nothing 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.780
 we brought very little home 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.540
 definitely good at all all 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.260
 team guys 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.640
 especially the pilots are also at ktm 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.100
 who believed 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.910
 all we have done so far and 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.200
 has supported us 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.460
 one hundred percent on the points of view 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.449
 hello we are all here with renato 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.370
 mechanical governor of Prince's motorcycle 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.590
 warrior the echoes of love directly 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.950
 what are the peculiarities of this 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.950
 time 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.350
 at the cycling and truck level are the 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.800
 suspensions which are the suppressions 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.630
 wolves factory is the shock absorber that the 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.570
 then there is something different 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.000
 I owe you that we use excellent originals 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.160
 the film's layout is from Brembo 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.560
 this is also all factory stuff there 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.930
 are driving peculiarities of 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.750
 driving style that wants to restore him 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.520
 uses a very backward position because of them 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.130
 like practically for inclusion in 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.619
 curve uses very backward position 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.810
 world with regards to the engine 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.880
 instead the engine is made by the factory 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.160
 obviously the basics of the series however was 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.110
 modified inside but I know that he 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.550
 I wanted a control unit practically 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.350
 with a softer engine than di 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.149
 orientation I understood why when 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.280
 I tried it initially I was a motor 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.630
 little more we say from cross and has possibilities 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.640
 of choice during the competition 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.580
 however the service was chosen 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.440
 the colors begin and then use that of 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.350
 did not use notes ducts Crugnola roles 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.940
 because you say so you are fine then 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.380
 basically the shirt remains the 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.390
 standard motorcycle c 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.400
 all the particularities that the 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.720
 pilot and those tricks that 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.230
 they can arrive directly from the house 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.790
 mother 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.790
 I urge thanks immediately 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.329
 we are doing with fabio who will talk to us about 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.900
 johnny aubert fabio's motorbike this 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:40.780
 can tell of years of this but 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.299
 basically johnny i use a motorcycle 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.040
 practically as a basis that of series is 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.170
 a bit optimized the engine he likes 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.030
 very sweet very fluid 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.010
 we see the cross tank because 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.359
 prefers looks smaller with ready 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.879
 since we have the bikes and injection 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:57.840
 there is no longer even the problem 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.129
 we don't see autonomy here, but him 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.840
 I don't usually say but sometimes 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.849
 use the cell with the step for the 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.919
 Gianni 's driving position is one of the 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.599
 few pilots who are perennially seated 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:11.260
 chose on acceleration which is 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:13.590
 detached if not mentally apart 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.970
 of the plates the suspensions 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.360
 the wheels are the same all the bikes 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.069
 official the bike is not far from 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.810
 the standard one 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.430
 there is so much work at the end of 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.530
 fair even if still arriving at 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.099
 fashion of cells you know is basically 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.150
 we are already starting from an excellent base 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.129
 we can do nothing but 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.790
 optimizing ok okay 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.910
 transcripts 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.739
 apart from that anyway a speech that 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.510
 especially applies to forks because 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.209
 even the shock can be can 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.880
 then be reduced to a modification of 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.750
 colors 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.540
 with the standard the brakes 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.640
 for example the brembo that are brakes 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.190
 factory we call them Rome parties are not 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.680
 another than standard brakes assembled at 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.750
 hand then just a little more cared for and then 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.600
 for the rest, as mentioned, there are many 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.490
 little things that makes the difference between the 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.850
 standard bike and the one and the factory one 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.850
 it is right that this be so thanks 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.120
 the official bike 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:20.519
 the other 50 of guerrero very funny 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.460
 a lot more toy the 4 50 of hoover 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.650
 it's definitely more challenging than that 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.630
 you have to give him your settings 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.360
 very personalized then driving 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.699
 set back because I was a guide instead 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.760
 encrusted more on the front but well 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:38.250
 but effective and above all fun 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.669
 not so far as the expect from 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.669
 overview 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.470
 very progressive suspensions in the 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.270
 first part they can give you an excellent one 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.630
 traction especially on the ugly and on the 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.860
 five who found it softer today 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.780
 and guerrero progressive 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.420
 absolutely more challenging and nervous 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.800
 that of certainly having both in 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.910
 excess of Rome a speed e 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.910
 above all an experience 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.370
 leinster engine 50 because the real a lot 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:13.379
 progressive and sweet in the first part of 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.499
 delivery allows you to exit from 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:18.449
 shapes with great agility and speed what 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:22.080
 50 for aubert absolutely more 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:25.139
 more vigorous but also very demanding 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.089
 more linear than the supply if you had to 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.999
 choose with a little training 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:33.710
 probably 50 for a trip 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:33.710
 of days absolutely 3 m
