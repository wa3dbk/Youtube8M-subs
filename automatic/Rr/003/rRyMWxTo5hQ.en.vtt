00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.620
 within the steps that the process has 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.140
 of chocolate production is found 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.150
 the spot in which through a 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.980
 mechanical procedure are integrated 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.780
 necessary ingredients for 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.550
 achievement of the different types of 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.870
 chocolate but we must that our 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.910
 instructors explain us in a way 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.910
 complete this process 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.690
 the first ingredient is sugar 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.300
 powdered we will pay 63 kilograms 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.950
 of powdered sugar when I go to 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.110
 start with loading the ingredients 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.960
 to choco and if it was one of the 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.320
 ingredients is the cocoa liquor the 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.520
 which I told you that was previously 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.220
 since he melted when 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.690
 we store it becomes very hard and for 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.190
 our country it is important that it is very 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.450
 liquid so yesterday the process of 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.970
 mixed we will load the liquor 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.890
 which as you can see is very 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.960
 very plastic liquid because right now 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.610
 We are going to add ingredients that are very 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.160
 dried very solid like fruit the 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.500
 powdered whole milk powder the 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.510
 skim milk powder and finally 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.810
 the cocoa butter I tell you that 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.790
 when when the conchabo starts in the dry 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.190
 we are going to have a very solid mixture very 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.500
 very dry that's why it's called so he's going to 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.070
 last in this process about 4 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.410
 to 6 hours in which within the team 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.090
 we have pallets that help us 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.940
 shake the product helps us make that 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.150
 homogeneous mixture and already in the part of 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.759
 inside the equipment there are some tubes that 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.830
 they will inject hot air 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.570
 directly to the mass this in order 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.400
 of what help us soon 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.020
 eliminate excessive moisture from 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.350
 product that remains after the process 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.930
 of the liquor and help us eliminate 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.060
 all the volatile acids that are in the 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.729
 mix well since the product's good 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.250
 the fermentation of cocoa and 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.050
 grinding of the knicks then this 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.200
 process is a little slow it 's a 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.440
 a little bit suddenly wasteful as they 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.479
 I commented delay of 4 to 6 hours but there 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.510
 what to do to make sure that the 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.840
 final product that with the ideal humidity 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.840
 and with the without the presence of acids 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.569
 volatile as acetic butter if 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.010
 well we know well in solid state 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.100
 after the extraction that is done 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.950
 of the knicks but if we add it and you 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.069
 we incorporate in solid state suddenly 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.720
 it will be difficult for us to mix and 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.880
 will cause us problems with the 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.730
 palettes that's why it previously melted 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.280
 we want like me in the is already adding 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.990
 is melted practically remains as 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.319
 an oil cooked after it 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.319
 melt 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.870
 in traction we collaborate with the load of 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.040
 the machine the rest of the ingredients 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.710
 I will explain how the drive 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.120
 and suddenly clarify some comments 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.800
 that it is admitted that suddenly they stayed 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.770
 very clear part of what we are going to do 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.790
 in this counted is to apply temperature 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.340
 Now I can explain what 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.020
 temperatures we apply as to the 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.020
 shell as such because the shell has 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.420
 a double shirt through which passes 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.800
 hot water yes because he applied 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.320
 temperature and because it does not have a 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.080
 fan that goes directly to the mass 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.570
 liquid injecting the hot air is 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.100
 humidity is what I have to eliminate by 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.060
 average of the temperature that applied 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.880
 with the shell and with the fans 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.200
 I have to eliminate it up to a few levels 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.120
 0.5 percent practically can not 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.170
 get moisture because this is harmful 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.170
 for the final quality of the product 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.970
 initially I have to light the 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.550
 pumps that will heat me the shell and 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.599
 the pipe that goes to the mill 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.879
 initially for her to warm up 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.920
 and that the product does not stick 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.569
 inside the pipes and that what is 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.830
 here in the shell and start receiving 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.830
 the temperature that we want 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.380
 water heater temperature of the mill 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.849
 it's the water that goes to the mill that is going to 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.849
 warm the mill jacket 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.800
 and temperature air heating is 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.960
 the fans that are injecting the 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.890
 air to the dough directly then what 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.890
 temperature I'm going to place 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.729
 after that we went to good operation 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.590
 student where will I find the subject of the 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:26.919
 fan then here I have 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.139
 air heating without or with me 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.550
 action or with warming because I want 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.370
 that I warm the air to 70 degrees 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.630
 centigrade the mass of the product and then 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.630
 I tell him to turn on fan 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.310
 good friends, viewers after 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:48.159
 six long hours of shell goes dry 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.590
 where he told them they were done with 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:52.180
 Chad or a very dry mixture after 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.639
 ingredients were very dry very 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.669
 solids there was not yet a possibility 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:00.939
 they were very separate there is no texture 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.979
 uniform and there is no appearance of liquid 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:05.529
 we are already with a mixture that 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.689
 we could call plastic but I was 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:09.460
 we could call the shell or plastic 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:11.020
 let's put the favor to jon that we 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.060
 took the product sample to 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.879
 to BE ABLE show viewers the 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:20.710
 advance of the mass as the product up 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:21.920
 now and then we have here a sample 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.890
 of 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:30.320
 of the plastic mass if we observe 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:34.100
 that is already with a medium appearance 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.850
 solid liquid medium has some fall 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.080
 we can see a brown color 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.570
 uniform and very similar to what is the 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:45.080
 milk chocolate after this 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.180
 then we already have the plastic mixture 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:53.290
 Now what we need is to add the 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:55.190
 remaining cocoa butter started here 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.830
 practically what he calls the conchabo 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.190
 liquid this with chad or liquid is going to 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.560
 take about 1 to 2 hours to be able to 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.210
 and to leave the mixture ready for the process 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.190
 of the refinement that is with the product 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.080
 final 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.700
 of obtaining the coverage of 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.370
 oscar milk chocolate 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.660
 dry and liquid conching board 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.270
 handles the same parameters of 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.130
 temperature or vary in something they change in 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.620
 there are no big differences 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.630
 difference number one is time 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.510
 we have to dry 6 hours 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:30.870
 that has already been fulfilled at this time and for 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.490
 the shell of the liquid we handle 12 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.170
 hours there are two differences with the 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.630
 conchabo dry dry conchabo 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.400
 we talked about what we needed 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.930
 shell temperature at 70 degrees 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.300
 centigrade warming the 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:45.240
 shell and temperature of the fan 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.370
 hot air at 70 degrees with strips and the 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.740
 water heating the mill too 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.270
 it should be at 45 degrees centigrade 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.760
 this would be like the final stage and what 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.770
 we would miss after doing the 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.270
 liquid conchabo but we will start 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.940
 in liquid state 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.860
 well I nor dear viewers in 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.530
 this moment three hours have passed 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.900
 of refining in this ball mill 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.490
 and theoretically we can say that the 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.370
 product is refined that is ready 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.500
 to be emptied but first we must 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:17.350
 do a quality control that is 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.750
 sample taker of this team and 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.760
 take it and make a measurement by means 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:25.180
 of a micrometer to make sure that 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.660
 and the micro is between 20 and 25 which is what 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.340
 ideal for a chocolate of this type 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:33.610
 then please me while I go to 

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:35.530
 do the measurement of microns control 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.510
 of this the variables of the equipment of the 

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:40.210
 control panel ensuring that it is not 

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:42.040
 much the pressure of the refiner and I already 

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.450
 I come to inform you if we can finish 

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.260
 refining and proceed to empty the 

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.260
 team agreement
