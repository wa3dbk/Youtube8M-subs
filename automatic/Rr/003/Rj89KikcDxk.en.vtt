00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.440
 just a few seconds ago, which is 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.150
 Great here by my side and have me 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.940
 his newest baby also screws the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.219
 avatar shown now is the way for him 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.990
 had to reach a plane but here 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.279
 I am the game for you 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.289
 to introduce you if you have never 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.050
 what had it so it is a herb 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.800
 funded project it is a real one 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.840
 Role playing for real MMO RPG players 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.160
 who just put on role-playing and 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.689
 not in any way how do I learn 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.430
 as fast as I strike 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.010
 as soon as possible the monster dead with it 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.870
 it gives me as many items as possible 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.340
 from big announced as well over the bayer 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.850
 Ultima online was the case 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.910
 and how it works is for 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.399
 example that my power in the man 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.250
 really the raw material sporadically collects 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.800
 and then a unique item 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.670
 produces and not somehow big 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.739
 sword number two sword of the basterds 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.149
 So not things like that 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.280
 usually in usual at the moment 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.539
 Every item should be forgotten 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.080
 made by players 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.380
 everything that is worn in the player 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.630
 was just made the fight 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.860
 for example, is not running 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.600
 neither in constant rotation from the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.280
 you somehow fall asleep as the be 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.890
 Part of modern roleplaying is 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.439
 also it does not click through from where 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.259
 you fight in action therefore schlawiner 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.540
 but one does it in such a way 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.439
 card system that is similar to magic 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.070
 or half store 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.360
 you put your own deck together 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.640
 the further the character development is 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.439
 the more possibilities you have it 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.240
 does not mean that you are better 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.670
 but you should definitely more variation 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.380
 and that is also the difference you make it 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.079
 does not give the best there is not that 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.939
 Best skillung there is not that the 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.500
 best equipment the best cards away 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.049
 but it is always dependent on the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.060
 situation and of it own kind of play the 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.700
 world itself is based on the unity 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.430
 engine in the latest version unit i5 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.960
 the whole part is the performance 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.119
 still a little bit weak one is 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.399
 so to speak that still alphaversion the 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.050
 Final version will now be in the course of 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.570
 Year that is in the month 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.670
 not published any more in the year and 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.710
 if that is the case then it will 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.980
 more content than before 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.730
 so far already there 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.710
 it is published in several episodes 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.360
 form even more content 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.180
 For example, things like 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.440
 go by boat across the water and 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.550
 miscellaneous is but so far it does 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.400
 very good impression 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.280
 The developers work diligently in one 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.660
 30 man team in the implementation so far 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.700
 Every update was really punctual 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.530
 I have to deliver other herbs 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.820
 financed companies and projects 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.860
 certainly can take a turn for 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.480
 and she must be curious how it is 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.360
 going on steam is the whole thing 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.570
 available and who gets paid once 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.000
 access him to current episode woman 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.640
 the avatar is called the first episode and 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.260
 the second will follow in months but 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.420
 not in years and over in each case 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.070
 the annual difference is total 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.990
 interesting project that just above all 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.370
 this from cool multiplayer role playing game 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.270
 but also the singleplayer roleplaying 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.270
 appeals
