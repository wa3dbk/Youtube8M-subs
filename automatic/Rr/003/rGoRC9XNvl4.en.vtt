00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
hell that I mean some really care

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.550 
hell that I mean some really care
it's<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.740> Samson<00:00:20.480> USB<00:00:21.480> computer<00:00:22.380> microphone

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
it's the Samson USB computer microphone

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.500 
it's the Samson USB computer microphone
comes<00:00:23.400> with<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.640> stand<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.119> stuff<00:00:24.300> so

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
comes with the stand and stuff so

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.599 
comes with the stand and stuff so
apparently<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.039> supposed<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.369> be<00:00:26.460> like

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
apparently this is supposed to be like

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.609 
apparently this is supposed to be like
the<00:00:26.760> better<00:00:26.910> buy<00:00:27.090> than<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.750> blue<00:00:28.289> Yeti

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the better buy than the blue Yeti

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.640 
the better buy than the blue Yeti
because<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:30.000> blue<00:00:30.179> Yeti<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.599> $50<00:00:31.140> more<00:00:31.170> and

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
because the blue Yeti is $50 more and

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.190 
because the blue Yeti is $50 more and
it's<00:00:32.489> about<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.790> same<00:00:32.940> quality<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.690> only

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
it's about the same quality the only

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.860 
it's about the same quality the only
difference<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.980> can<00:00:35.010> use<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.630> mate

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
difference is is you can use on mate

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.319 
difference is is you can use on mate
direction<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:37.800> recording<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:39.059> and

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
direction like recording and that and

but<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.230> doesn't<00:00:43.260> matter<00:00:43.559> because<00:00:43.680> that's<00:00:44.040> all

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
I'm figuring it out unfortunately I had

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.240 
I'm figuring it out unfortunately I had
a<00:03:06.830> results<00:03:07.160> in<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.310> social<00:03:07.610> media<00:03:07.850> I<00:03:08.150> know

sucks I don't screw so you screw the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.280 
sucks I don't screw so you screw the
bottom<00:03:16.580> you<00:03:17.090> put<00:03:17.300> the<00:03:17.750> little<00:03:17.990> connector

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
bottom you put the little connector

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.780 
bottom you put the little connector
piece<00:03:18.620> on<00:03:18.770> put<00:03:19.700> this<00:03:19.850> on<00:03:20.590> under<00:03:21.590> it<00:03:21.740> screw<00:03:22.730> it

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
piece on put this on under it screw it

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.470 
piece on put this on under it screw it
back<00:03:22.910> in<00:03:23.080> now<00:03:24.080> we<00:03:24.140> have<00:03:24.350> this<00:03:24.440> part<00:03:25.450> okay<00:03:26.450> I

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
back in now we have this part okay I

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.290 
back in now we have this part okay I
figured<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:26.990> out<00:03:27.550> this<00:03:28.550> does<00:03:29.330> not<00:03:29.360> fit<00:03:29.870> this

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
figured it out this does not fit this

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.340 
figured it out this does not fit this
obviously<00:03:32.300> because<00:03:32.600> this<00:03:32.750> is<00:03:32.810> an<00:03:32.900> inner<00:03:33.050> piece

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
obviously because this is an inner piece

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.850 
obviously because this is an inner piece
is<00:03:33.800> too<00:03:34.340> small<00:03:34.610> so<00:03:34.880> they<00:03:35.780> threw<00:03:36.020> those<00:03:36.080> remove

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
is too small so they threw those remove

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.640 
is too small so they threw those remove
this<00:03:37.130> it<00:03:37.340> was<00:03:37.700> they<00:03:37.910> call<00:03:38.120> it<00:03:38.240> an<00:03:38.390> adapter<00:03:38.930> by

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
this it was they call it an adapter by

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.230 
this it was they call it an adapter by
using<00:03:39.860> I'm<00:03:40.310> guessing<00:03:40.670> a<00:03:40.760> Phillips<00:03:41.120> head

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
using I'm guessing a Phillips head

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.990 
using I'm guessing a Phillips head
screwdriver<00:03:41.660> because<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.080> vc<00:03:42.580> it<00:03:43.580> looks<00:03:43.790> like

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
screwdriver because the vc it looks like

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.120 
screwdriver because the vc it looks like
Phillip<00:03:44.300> I<00:03:44.450> mean<00:03:44.720> that<00:03:44.810> Phillips<00:03:45.140> a<00:03:45.290> flathead

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
Phillip I mean that Phillips a flathead

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.160 
Phillip I mean that Phillips a flathead
could<00:03:46.370> fit<00:03:46.550> right<00:03:46.730> through<00:03:46.760> there<00:03:47.180> I<00:03:47.360> have<00:03:47.900> the

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
could fit right through there I have the

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.259 
could fit right through there I have the
world's<00:03:48.650> longest<00:03:48.950> flat-head<00:03:49.670> screwdriver

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.550 

all<00:03:55.269> right<00:03:55.390> just<00:03:56.110> to<00:03:56.200> show<00:03:56.379> you<00:03:56.439> the
