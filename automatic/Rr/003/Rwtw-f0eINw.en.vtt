if i can dye it black or something like

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.969 
if i can dye it black or something like
that<00:04:13.580> color<00:04:14.580> that<00:04:14.790> would<00:04:14.880> suit<00:04:15.090> me<00:04:15.269> them<00:04:15.979> and

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
that color that would suit me them and

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.080 
that color that would suit me them and
this<00:04:17.130> was<00:04:17.570> seven<00:04:18.570> pounds<00:04:19.760> and<00:04:20.760> then<00:04:20.910> i<00:04:20.940> got

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
this was seven pounds and then i got

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.990

five<00:04:21.239> percent<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.660> that<00:04:21.690> so<00:04:22.200> that<00:04:22.229> is<00:04:23.000> ultimate

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
five percent of that so that is ultimate

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.629 
five percent of that so that is ultimate
bargain<00:04:24.450> it's<00:04:25.380> hard<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.650> hold<00:04:26.250> up<00:04:26.490> because

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
bargain it's hard to hold up because

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.159 
bargain it's hard to hold up because
it's<00:04:27.350> quite<00:04:28.350> not<00:04:28.560> shape<00:04:28.880> so<00:04:29.880> that's<00:04:30.060> that<00:04:30.270> and

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
it's quite not shape so that's that and

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:41.519 
it's quite not shape so that's that and
then<00:04:31.380> I<00:04:32.360> got<00:04:33.620> this<00:04:34.620> it<00:04:34.919> Randy<00:04:36.110> home
