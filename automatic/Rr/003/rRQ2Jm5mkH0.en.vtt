Call of Duty ever and however it's also
the<00:01:43.469> the<00:01:43.950> most<00:01:44.100> frustrating<00:01:44.899> because<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.289> play

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
the the most frustrating because I play

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.639 
the the most frustrating because I play
on<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.130> ps3<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:48.149> I've<00:01:48.600> had<00:01:48.869> some<00:01:49.079> pretty

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
on the ps3 and I've had some pretty

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.459 
on the ps3 and I've had some pretty
nasty<00:01:50.070> problems<00:01:50.820> with<00:01:51.030> them<00:01:51.240> with<00:01:51.960> lag<00:01:52.200> in

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
nasty problems with them with lag in

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.980 
nasty problems with them with lag in
virtually<00:01:53.009> every<00:01:53.280> single<00:01:54.240> lobby<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.689> get

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
virtually every single lobby that I get

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.370 
virtually every single lobby that I get
into<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:56.159> don't<00:01:56.960> 100%<00:01:57.960> know<00:01:58.140> how<00:01:58.320> to

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
into and I don't 100% know how to

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.859 
into and I don't 100% know how to
describe<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:59.189> leg<00:01:59.460> but<00:01:59.700> it<00:02:00.180> seems<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.570> be<00:02:00.659> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
describe this leg but it seems to be the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.560 
describe this leg but it seems to be the
framerate<00:02:01.649> lagging<00:02:02.549> as<00:02:02.700> opposed<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
framerate lagging as opposed to the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.529 
framerate lagging as opposed to the
actual<00:02:03.869> game<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.670> sometimes<00:02:05.670> I'll<00:02:05.880> turn<00:02:06.390> my

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
actual game and sometimes I'll turn my

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.150 
actual game and sometimes I'll turn my
character<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.259> left<00:02:07.439> or<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.619> right<00:02:07.710> and

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
character to the left or the right and

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.440 
character to the left or the right and
that<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.359> process<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:10.049> turning<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.799> kind<00:02:11.039> of

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
that the process of turning is kind of

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.120 
that the process of turning is kind of
mysteries<00:02:12.450> it's<00:02:12.780> not<00:02:13.019> smooth<00:02:13.410> it's<00:02:13.739> like<00:02:13.950> it

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
mysteries it's not smooth it's like it

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.190 
mysteries it's not smooth it's like it
jumps<00:02:14.549> from<00:02:14.640> from<00:02:15.329> where<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.630> were<00:02:15.660> looking

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
jumps from from where you were looking

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.960 
jumps from from where you were looking
to<00:02:16.230> where<00:02:16.560> you're<00:02:16.709> looking<00:02:16.769> now<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.489> without

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
to where you're looking now and without

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.259 
to where you're looking now and without
having<00:02:18.359> seen<00:02:18.930> what<00:02:19.109> happened<00:02:19.440> in<00:02:19.530> between<00:02:19.650> and

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
having seen what happened in between and

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.180 
having seen what happened in between and
so<00:02:21.269> it's<00:02:21.390> it's<00:02:22.019> not<00:02:22.140> really<00:02:22.350> lagging<00:02:22.950> the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
so it's it's not really lagging the

description to a forum post that someone
made<00:04:21.079> this<00:04:21.949> explained<00:04:22.759> a<00:04:22.849> way<00:04:22.970> to<00:04:23.030> reduce<00:04:23.449> the

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:23.659 
made this explained a way to reduce the

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.060 
made this explained a way to reduce the
amount<00:04:23.810> of<00:04:23.960> lag<00:04:24.139> that<00:04:24.320> was<00:04:24.440> going<00:04:24.710> on<00:04:24.830> and

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
amount of lag that was going on and

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.159 
amount of lag that was going on and
seems<00:04:25.789> to<00:04:26.000> relate<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.630> audio

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
seems to relate to the audio

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.529 
seems to relate to the audio
configuration<00:04:28.039> and<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:28.820> play<00:04:29.090> with<00:04:29.240> a<00:04:29.300> headset

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
configuration and I play with a headset

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.210 
configuration and I play with a headset
and<00:04:29.870> when<00:04:30.050> I<00:04:30.080> followed<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.620> instructions<00:04:31.099> it

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
and when I followed the instructions it

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.249 
and when I followed the instructions it
did<00:04:31.610> seem<00:04:31.789> to<00:04:32.000> help<00:04:32.180> her<00:04:32.360> a<00:04:32.479> little<00:04:32.720> bit<00:04:33.020> and

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
did seem to help her a little bit and

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.230 
did seem to help her a little bit and
not<00:04:33.919> clear<00:04:34.099> everything<00:04:34.460> up<00:04:34.669> but<00:04:34.880> it

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
not clear everything up but it

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.149 
not clear everything up but it
definitely<00:04:35.539> improved<00:04:36.050> it<00:04:36.289> and<00:04:36.470> so<00:04:37.009> if<00:04:37.070> you

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:37.159 
definitely improved it and so if you

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.649 
definitely improved it and so if you
have<00:04:37.250> a<00:04:37.340> ps4<00:04:37.610> in<00:04:37.789> a<00:04:37.880> headset<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:38.389> want<00:04:38.570> to

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:38.659 
have a ps4 in a headset and you want to

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.019 
have a ps4 in a headset and you want to
get<00:04:39.139> rid<00:04:39.289> of<00:04:39.320> you<00:04:39.650> know<00:04:40.099> maybe<00:04:40.340> a<00:04:40.460> percentage

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:41.029 
get rid of you know maybe a percentage

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.959 
get rid of you know maybe a percentage
of<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.300> leg<00:04:41.479> and<00:04:41.510> go

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:41.969

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:44.859

00:04:44.859 --> 00:04:44.869 
to having the leg that everyone else has
