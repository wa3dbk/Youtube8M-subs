00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
aggressive when it comes to the tank so

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.310 
aggressive when it comes to the tank so
there's<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.599> compatibility<00:00:12.599> issues<00:00:12.929> when<00:00:13.200> it

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
there's a compatibility issues when it

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.509 
there's a compatibility issues when it
comes<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.650> them<00:00:13.799> just<00:00:14.009> because<00:00:14.160> they<00:00:14.429> are

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
lacking the AI there are some that do

lacking the AI there are some that do
have<00:00:16.920> an<00:00:17.130> AI<00:00:17.480> but<00:00:18.480> these<00:00:18.690> guys<00:00:18.869> have<00:00:18.930> been<00:00:19.199> the

ninety nine at pet stores and they're

great for new tanks older tanks
something<00:00:30.269> different<00:00:30.689> but<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.679> said

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
something different but like I said

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.680 
something different but like I said
there<00:00:32.040> are<00:00:32.070> some<00:00:32.250> compatibility<00:00:32.610> issues<00:00:33.030> but

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
there are some compatibility issues but

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.090 
there are some compatibility issues but
first<00:00:33.870> I'll<00:00:34.050> talk<00:00:34.140> about<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.469> requirements

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
first I'll talk about the requirements

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.100 
first I'll talk about the requirements
for<00:00:35.700> temperature<00:00:36.149> these<00:00:36.300> guys<00:00:36.540> require<00:00:36.930> about

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
for temperature these guys require about

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.700 
for temperature these guys require about
68<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.070> 82<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.149> there<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> wide<00:00:40.260> range<00:00:40.469> of

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
68 to 82 so there is a wide range of

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.729 
68 to 82 so there is a wide range of
temperature<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.670> they<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:42.000> tolerate<00:00:42.739> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
temperature that they can tolerate the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.220 
temperature that they can tolerate the
pH<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.309> anywhere<00:00:44.640> from<00:00:44.820> six<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.450> seven<00:00:45.989> point

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
pH is anywhere from six to seven point

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.170 
pH is anywhere from six to seven point
eight<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> wide<00:00:46.890> range<00:00:47.340> for<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.700> -<00:00:47.940> they

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
eight so a wide range for that - they

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.240 
eight so a wide range for that - they
also<00:00:48.329> get<00:00:48.629> about<00:00:48.840> four<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.289> five<00:00:49.469> inches<00:00:49.500> and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
also get about four to five inches and

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.029 
also get about four to five inches and
live<00:00:51.120> about<00:00:51.420> anywhere<00:00:52.289> from<00:00:52.350> three<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.770> five

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
live about anywhere from three to five

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.520 
live about anywhere from three to five
years<00:00:53.690> but<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.870> said<00:00:54.930> with<00:00:55.170> these<00:00:55.260> guys

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
years but like I said with these guys

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.740 
years but like I said with these guys
compatibility<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> huge<00:00:56.850> issue<00:00:57.059> because

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
compatibility is a huge issue because

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.720 
compatibility is a huge issue because
they<00:00:58.079> are<00:00:58.170> blind<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.829> do<00:00:59.010> see<00:00:59.250> pretty<00:00:59.609> much

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
they are blind that do see pretty much

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.220 
they are blind that do see pretty much
anything<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.359> moves<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.690> front<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.989> them<00:01:01.109> as

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
anything that moves in front of them as

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.260 
anything that moves in front of them as
a<00:01:01.260> food<00:01:01.530> source<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.160> they're<00:01:02.910> definitely<00:01:03.090> not

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
a food source so they're definitely not

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.179 
a food source so they're definitely not
compatible<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.170> Guppies<00:01:04.589> mollies

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189

kind of like one of the more aggressive
tetras<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:52.170> say<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.470> because<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:53.280> they

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
tetras I just say that because if they

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.950 
tetras I just say that because if they
could<00:01:53.549> they<00:01:53.909> pretty<00:01:54.119> much<00:01:54.240> turn<00:01:54.540> around<00:01:54.780> if

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
could they pretty much turn around if

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.410 
could they pretty much turn around if
their<00:01:55.140> own<00:01:55.229> tail<00:01:55.530> thinking<00:01:55.920> its<00:01:56.040> food<00:01:56.360> until<00:01:57.360> I

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
their own tail thinking its food until I

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.700 
their own tail thinking its food until I
realize<00:01:57.750> they're<00:01:57.960> chewing<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.320> themselves

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
realize they're chewing on themselves

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.560 
realize they're chewing on themselves
they<00:01:59.070> do<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> ragged<00:01:59.969> appearance<00:02:00.390> when

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
they do have a ragged appearance when

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.749 
they do have a ragged appearance when
you<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:00.750> biome<00:02:01.079> from<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.350> pet<00:02:01.560> store<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.549> just

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
you do biome from a pet store so just

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.609 
you do biome from a pet store so just
keep<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.240> mind<00:02:03.450> it's<00:02:03.630> perfectly<00:02:04.049> normal

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
keep that in mind it's perfectly normal

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.230 
keep that in mind it's perfectly normal
there<00:02:04.770> are<00:02:04.890> gonna<00:02:05.040> be<00:02:05.130> fins<00:02:05.460> nipped<00:02:05.790> just

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
there are gonna be fins nipped just

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.850 
there are gonna be fins nipped just
because<00:02:06.509> they<00:02:06.899> think<00:02:06.930> it's

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
because they think it's

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.370 
because they think it's
if<00:02:09.160> you<00:02:09.369> are<00:02:09.520> looking<00:02:09.789> for<00:02:10.090> these<00:02:10.270> guys<00:02:10.450> pretty

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
if you are looking for these guys pretty

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.920 
if you are looking for these guys pretty
much<00:02:11.530> any<00:02:11.770> pet<00:02:12.010> store<00:02:12.040> sells<00:02:12.550> on<00:02:12.790> they<00:02:13.510> do<00:02:13.569> come

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
much any pet store sells on they do come

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.660 
much any pet store sells on they do come
in<00:02:13.959> like<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.260> pinkish<00:02:14.740> pale<00:02:15.040> color<00:02:15.310> which<00:02:15.520> is

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
in like a pinkish pale color which is

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.490 
in like a pinkish pale color which is
the<00:02:15.760> most<00:02:15.940> common<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.569> then<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:16.989> also<00:02:17.140> come<00:02:17.410> in

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
the most common and then I also come in

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.580 
the most common and then I also come in
like<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.650> silvery<00:02:18.220> brown<00:02:19.090> pale<00:02:19.420> looking<00:02:19.810> color

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
like a silvery brown pale looking color

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.090 
like a silvery brown pale looking color
so<00:02:21.220> both<00:02:21.760> colorations<00:02:22.450> will<00:02:22.750> have<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:24.010> know

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
so both colorations will have you know

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.070 
so both colorations will have you know
different<00:02:24.280> variants<00:02:24.970> but<00:02:25.270> also<00:02:25.420> remember

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
different variants but also remember

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.720 
different variants but also remember
they<00:02:26.200> do<00:02:26.260> have<00:02:26.530> an<00:02:26.650> eye<00:02:26.800> on<00:02:27.040> some<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.400> forms

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
they do have an eye on some of the forms

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.970 
they do have an eye on some of the forms
and<00:02:27.910> they<00:02:28.030> are<00:02:28.150> becoming<00:02:28.510> more<00:02:28.840> common<00:02:29.800> in<00:02:29.860> the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
and they are becoming more common in the

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.220 
and they are becoming more common in the
pet<00:02:30.100> industry<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.640> have<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.940> eyes<00:02:31.110> when<00:02:32.110> it

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
pet industry to have the eyes when it

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.960 
pet industry to have the eyes when it
comes<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.560> sexing<00:02:32.950> these<00:02:33.100> guys<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.580> females

comes to sexing these guys the females

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.300 
comes to sexing these guys the females
are<00:02:34.090> going<00:02:34.239> to<00:02:34.300> be<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.420> little<00:02:34.540> bit<00:02:34.720> broader<00:02:34.900> and

cave tetras in the group they scatter
the<00:02:49.569> eggs<00:02:49.950> but<00:02:50.950> they<00:02:51.040> want<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.280> problem<00:02:51.580> these

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670

guys a sentence they are blind they do
tend<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.860> eat<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.130> eggs<00:02:54.160> pretty<00:02:54.550> quick<00:02:54.819> so<00:02:54.970> you

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
tend to eat the eggs pretty quick so you

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.430 
tend to eat the eggs pretty quick so you
need<00:02:55.239> to<00:02:55.360> take<00:02:55.540> them<00:02:55.690> out<00:02:55.810> as<00:02:55.989> soon<00:02:56.200> as<00:02:56.319> the

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
need to take them out as soon as the

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.830 
need to take them out as soon as the
breeding<00:02:56.680> has<00:02:56.950> occurred<00:02:57.420> they<00:02:58.420> kind<00:02:58.630> of<00:02:58.720> do

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
breeding has occurred they kind of do

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.020 
breeding has occurred they kind of do
almost<00:02:58.989> like<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.260> ritual<00:02:59.560> little<00:03:00.100> dance<00:03:00.310> as<00:03:00.670> I

that's gonna help plump on them up and
get<00:03:12.250> them<00:03:12.370> into<00:03:12.579> that<00:03:12.640> breeding<00:03:13.090> mode<00:03:13.299> also<00:03:14.230> if

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
get them into that breeding mode also if

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.319 
get them into that breeding mode also if
you<00:03:14.650> want<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:15.070> help<00:03:15.280> encourage<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.790> breeding

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
you want to help encourage the breeding

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.380 
you want to help encourage the breeding
you<00:03:16.750> can<00:03:17.049> do<00:03:17.500> water<00:03:17.680> changes<00:03:18.220> like<00:03:18.519> 25<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.120> 50

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
you can do water changes like 25 to 50

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.930 
you can do water changes like 25 to 50
percent<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:20.170> slightly<00:03:20.950> cool<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.459> water<00:03:21.670> down

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
percent and slightly cool the water down

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.120 
percent and slightly cool the water down
this<00:03:22.810> is<00:03:22.959> gonna<00:03:23.109> give<00:03:23.380> it<00:03:23.500> more<00:03:23.680> of<00:03:23.799> like<00:03:23.950> that

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
this is gonna give it more of like that

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.640 
this is gonna give it more of like that
cave<00:03:24.459> appearance<00:03:25.060> in<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.750> wild<00:03:26.200> with<00:03:26.560> the
