00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.830
 hello everyone today let's see how it comes 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.510
 presented a genius filter in 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:22.300
 concrete of the eclipse range I do not know if what 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.250
 you know but menus since 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.680
 a few weeks has decided that it's only going to 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.280
 market 77 and 82 filters 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.200
 millimeters 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.510
 and the rest of the measures we 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.750
 to adapt and between some rings 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.970
 adapters that are included with the 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.950
 filter when we buy measures like 67 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.930
 62 58 52 that is if we buy a filter of 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.720
 58 millimeters what we are buying 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:52.130
 it really is a 77 filter with a 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:55.750
 adapter ring from 58 to 77 let's see 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.750
 how the filters come 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.000
 what they have in a box a box of 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.400
 rigid protection for when we had 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.900
 a job that are well protected and 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.020
 we can put it in the backpack without 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.409
 no fear of scratching sar 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.950
 encouragement in the breasts break 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.109
 we open the box that comes with a chamois 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.390
 for cleaning it is important that the 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:22.390
 chen filter is clean because they are 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.670
 very prone to pick up speckles 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.790
 of dust 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.439
 if we remove the chamois what we find 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.439
 it is already the defunct filter 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.570
 here we have the filter we have here 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.570
 in the rotation 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.830
 we have here if you see it here the eight 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.470
 the eight steps that the filter has 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.860
 You see here correctly from the maximum 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.390
 up to the minimum of here we go 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.610
 rotating 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.409
 and we can go selecting how much 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.450
 amount of light we want to enter us 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.640
 This type of filters is essential for 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.280
 work with cameras like sony nex 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.500
 cfs 100 that there are not certain neutrals 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.509
 built-in or to work with cameras 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.069
 dslr and be able to take advantage of what is 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.140
 the shutter speed 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.349
 as I said the filters that are 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.299
 marketed now are 77 millimeters 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.219
 so do we adapters needed 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.439
 we will deliver with each 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:25.420
 filter your corresponding adapter and 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.969
 we will also have a kit for sale 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.939
 all the adapter rings of both 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:33.459
 77 millimeters to all measures as 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:35.650
 another 82 millimeter kit to all 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.010
 measures therefore if we buy a filter 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.439
 of 82 millimeters and we bought the kit 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.510
 of rings we will have a single filter 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.669
 we can take advantage of it for all 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.900
 lenses that we have are of the measure 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:51.699
 that we are this team will be composed of 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.030
 made without mind are adapter rings 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:59.319
 this to 52 millimeters 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:02.319
 here we have to 58 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.410
 the one of 62 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.050
 67 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:11.920
 and the one with 72 with this one 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:15.720
 with this kit and a 77 filter 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.550
 millimeters really what we have are 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.230
 a filter that we can use in 6 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.990
 different optics depending on the 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.700
 as no one who has that comes 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.310
 pretty good if we have a park 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.990
 of large optics and we do not have to 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.550
 buy a filter for each optic but 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.600
 with a single filters we can take advantage of 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.630
 all all all lenses and 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.950
 filter for everything good as this is all 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.890
 what is major aging of the filters 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.030
 neutral density on our website and in 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.920
 internet you have a lot of tests and 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.180
 of samples of how how is the 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.220
 operation when we are recording 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.290
 videos taking pictures so you 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.760
 I summon you to see it both on camera 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.560
 'dot com' or anywhere in the 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.130
 web if you want to see exactly what 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.590
 result can you get this is 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.480
 I hope everything has helped you 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.330
 see what it is that is presented 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.260
 the filter and nothing we see in the next 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.260
 video thank you very much
