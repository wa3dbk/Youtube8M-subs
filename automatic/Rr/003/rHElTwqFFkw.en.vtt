any place that xref uses it gets
automatically<00:00:50.129> updated<00:00:50.550> as<00:00:50.670> well<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.120> makes<00:00:51.570> a

create menu down to the xref submenu and

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.080 
create menu down to the xref submenu and
there's<00:00:58.590> an<00:00:58.710> ADD<00:00:58.890> xref<00:00:59.340> command<00:00:59.730> but<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.910> don't

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
there's an ADD xref command but I don't

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.790 
there's an ADD xref command but I don't
like<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.359> do<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.690> prefer<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.260> add<00:01:01.530> it

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
like to do that I prefer to add it

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.830 
like to do that I prefer to add it
manually<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.520> I'm<00:01:02.820> going<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.000> add<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.300> an<00:01:03.390> xref

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
manually so I'm going to add in an xref

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.320 
manually so I'm going to add in an xref
and<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.619> red<00:01:04.920> icon<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.760> indicates<00:01:06.240> that

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
and this red icon here indicates that

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.570 
and this red icon here indicates that
the<00:01:06.479> xref<00:01:06.780> has<00:01:07.020> no<00:01:07.200> reference<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.130> so

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the xref has no reference to it and so

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.219 
the xref has no reference to it and so
under<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> object<00:01:09.060> properties<00:01:09.659> for<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.840> xref

under the object properties for the xref

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.289 
under the object properties for the xref
I'm<00:01:10.439> going<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.040> tell<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.340> look<00:01:11.760> at<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> scene

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
updated wherever i'm using the xref so

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.750 
updated wherever i'm using the xref so
let's<00:02:25.620> take<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.890> look<00:02:26.099> at<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.550> practical

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
let's take a look at that in a practical

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.390 
let's take a look at that in a practical
application<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:28.140> I've<00:02:28.230> got<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.440> car-chase<00:02:28.890> here

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400

and<00:02:29.580> let<00:02:30.569> me<00:02:30.629> just<00:02:30.810> rewind<00:02:30.989> back<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.379> 0<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.860> hit

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
and let me just rewind back to 0 and hit

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.530 
and let me just rewind back to 0 and hit
play<00:02:32.220> let's<00:02:32.549> bring<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.819> perspective<00:02:33.390> view

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540

I've got to swap the cars out well the

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.740 
I've got to swap the cars out well the
xref<00:02:50.220> process<00:02:50.640> makes<00:02:50.849> that<00:02:51.030> really<00:02:51.390> quick<00:02:51.569> and

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
xref process makes that really quick and

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.479 
xref process makes that really quick and
easy<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.560> way<00:02:52.739> I've<00:02:52.860> built<00:02:53.099> my<00:02:53.190> hierarchy

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
easy the way I've built my hierarchy

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.089 
easy the way I've built my hierarchy
here<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.569> I<00:02:54.630> have<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:55.200> dummy<00:02:55.650> car<00:02:55.920> object

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
here is that I have a dummy car object

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.160 
here is that I have a dummy car object
that's<00:02:56.400> being<00:02:56.610> animated<00:02:57.090> along<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.510> spline<00:02:57.900> and

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
that's being animated along a spline and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.199 
that's being animated along a spline and
underneath<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.040> second<00:02:59.610> null<00:02:59.760> object

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
underneath that is a second null object

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.479 
underneath that is a second null object
that<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:00.959> controlling<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.829> direction<00:03:02.010> that

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
that is controlling the direction that

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.880 
that is controlling the direction that
car<00:03:02.700> is<00:03:02.819> facing<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.510> then<00:03:03.930> under<00:03:04.349> that<00:03:04.379> I've

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
car is facing and then under that I've

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.000 
car is facing and then under that I've
got<00:03:05.400> my<00:03:05.549> xref<00:03:06.060> now<00:03:06.569> that<00:03:06.900> may<00:03:07.019> seem<00:03:07.079> excessive

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
got my xref now that may seem excessive

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.039 
got my xref now that may seem excessive
for<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.220> parenting<00:03:08.670> arrangement<00:03:09.180> but<00:03:09.569> that

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
for a parenting arrangement but that

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.050 
for a parenting arrangement but that
means<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.440> I<00:03:10.470> can<00:03:10.709> move<00:03:10.890> this<00:03:11.099> xref<00:03:11.579> or<00:03:11.760> swap

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
means that I can move this xref or swap

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.880 
means that I can move this xref or swap
it<00:03:12.239> out<00:03:12.329> and<00:03:12.599> not<00:03:13.110> affect<00:03:13.470> any<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.829> the
