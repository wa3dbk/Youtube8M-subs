 Persian Gulf 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:09.080
 [Music] 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.860
 both for a fighter pilot and for a 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.920
 assigned to the bridge 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.010
 life aboard an aircraft carrier and dense 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.410
 of dangers and this film proves it 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.650
 among the most dramatic ever released by 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.650
 aeronautics 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.350
 he said jb bridges is the example of 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.970
 how the simplest of tasks can 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:35.220
 prove to be fatal while a colleague 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.440
 blocks a fighter to 6 and prepares it to the 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.370
 take off 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.140
 jd is approaching for checks 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.030
 I was in charge of checking the plane 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.710
 before he left the bridge is one of the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.820
 most dangerous jobs on an aircraft carrier 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.820
 jd is absolutely right 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.810
 I don't know why or how it came into me 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.180
 mind of approaching me that way I have 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:09.620
 wrong I should have been 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.140
 kneeling n something takes a step of 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.500
 too much and gets sucked in suddenly by the 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.500
 engine 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.050
 flames fragments are expelled from the 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:23.160
 rear of the engine while jd ends in 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.160
 the rotating blades of jazz 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.830
 my glasses were sucked into my helmet 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.780
 protective gloves also in 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:37.119
 life jacket the shirt and has it 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.830
 a colleague has already been shredded 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.980
 notices what is happening e 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.550
 tells the pilot to turn off the engine 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.840
 the bridge staff intervenes 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.530
 expecting a gruesome scene 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.210
 but to everyone's surprise 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.210
 jd frees himself 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.590
 if I seven lives like cats and I believe 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:11.459
 who still have 38 left had one 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.590
 incredible luck the jb helmet has 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.230
 blocked the sharp blades of the engine 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.950
 slowing down a few seconds 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.830
 before it was torn to pieces 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:27.160
 I didn't think he could suck it 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.400
 just a false step is an error and yes 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.230
 risks losing their lives 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.980
 the imprudence committed by jd has it 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.709
 procured several injuries and in quantity 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.400
 higher than the average of his 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.400
 profession
