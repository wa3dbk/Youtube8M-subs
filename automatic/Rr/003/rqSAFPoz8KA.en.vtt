be the entry level requirement the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.690 
be the entry level requirement the
expectations<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.180> they<00:01:18.299> had<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:19.700> thought

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
expectations that they had I thought

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.210 
expectations that they had I thought
really<00:01:21.299> aligned<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:22.140> our<00:01:22.320> strengths<00:01:22.770> one<00:01:23.130> of

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
really aligned with our strengths one of

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.890 
really aligned with our strengths one of
the<00:01:23.310> things<00:01:23.549> about<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.970> program<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.509> it

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the things about this program is it

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.399 
the things about this program is it
builds<00:01:25.290> upon<00:01:26.299> the<00:01:27.299> foundation<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
education where we need to really look

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.600
