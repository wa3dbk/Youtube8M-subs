 teach how to make this beautiful hairstyle 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.689
 Well the first thing I'll do will 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.050
 take the hair here from this part 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.920
 from here above your ear 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.920
 towards here 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.490
 A) Yes 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.490
 in this way as if it were half pigtail 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.649
 As you can see, I did it from here 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.900
 top of your ear in both 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.930
 sides is the same 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.450
 I'm going to pick up this hair 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.010
 Now I'm going to hold my half pigtail with 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.550
 An eraser 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.680
 and we will have something like this now of this 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.180
 pigtail that I left here I will take a 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.180
 small section of hair 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.509
 nothing big like this I'm going to stop 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.130
 here with a pin now this section 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.820
 of hair I'm going to divide it into two 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.430
 equal parts 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.430
 I'm going to hold this half with this hook 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:14.010
 and I'm going to work with this half I'm going to 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.010
 put some hair spray 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.360
 I'll brush your hair well we 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.120
 remember that you can load the 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.459
 hair in this way to give more 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.380
 volume I do not like to do that 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.080
 because this badly treats the hair 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.160
 but in tastes you break genres 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.230
 you can do it 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.050
 well once I have my way 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.090
 hair I 'm just going to take I 'm going to 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.080
 take my hair and I'm going to bend it towards 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.180
 down this way 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.220
 you will know that it is so great they do 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.220
 I'm going to leave it like that 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.750
 and I'm only going to fasten with pins 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.750
 in this part 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.900
 and as you can see our bow is already taking 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.030
 shape 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.959
 now I'm going to release this lock of 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.959
 hair that I left here 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.480
 and I'm going to do exactly the same thing 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.480
 I'm going to put hair spray 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:31.010
 and I'm going to do the same, I'm just going to 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.019
 fold in this way 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.739
 in the same way I will hold with 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.739
 pins 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.060
 now I'm going to take the small section of 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:48.550
 hair that I left here in the middle 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.550
 I will also stage 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.290
 I'm going to comb very well 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.480
 and I'm going to fasten with pins 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.560
 now it's just a matter of returning and 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.310
 accommodate the bow as we do 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.730
 like 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.319
 you can open it more like this or 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.419
 leave it thus more closed 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:20.479
 well look and that's how you see it right now 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.280
 Real hairstyle that looks beautiful now 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.100
 I'm going to make your colors so that 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.960
 you see it even more beautiful remember 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.560
 always use a good protector to 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.479
 the hair so as not to burn the hair 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.479
 As I tell you, this is the first time 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:38.330
 I am doing courses with heat to 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.849
 my daughter but always remember to use 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.610
 a very good heat protector 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:46.759
 I have these two this is called action 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.759
 elements and they get it and this 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:52.940
 it's called chi and they also get it 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.860
 you go out or maybe even in good walmart 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.220
 then I will apply my protector 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.220
 hot 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.240
 and I'm going to start doing my courses I'm going to 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.120
 Take a small section of hair from 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.730
 here and I am using this machine that 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.750
 there is nothing special you can 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.750
 use the one they have 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.630
 I'm just going to tangle my hair like this 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:20.840
 this way up 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.500
 we leave it for about 10 seconds and let go 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.500
 the hair 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.420
 and here we have our first good choir 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.550

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.900
