00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
comfortable I wanted to try to really

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.820 
comfortable I wanted to try to really
fit<00:02:44.630> into<00:02:44.780> his<00:02:45.280> whatever<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.460> is<00:02:46.580> that<00:02:47.060> is<00:02:47.570> so

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
fit into his whatever it is that is so

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.770

amazing<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:48.890> special<00:02:49.730> about<00:02:50.270> having

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.780 

I<00:02:55.040> think<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.100> thing<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.280> has<00:02:56.459> me<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.640> most

I think the thing that has me the most

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.820 
I think the thing that has me the most
excited<00:02:57.330> is<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.450> amount<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.900> faith<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.590> trust

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
excited is the amount of faith and trust

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.080 
excited is the amount of faith and trust
that<00:02:58.950> when<00:02:59.160> he's<00:02:59.310> putting<00:02:59.550> in<00:02:59.700> me<00:02:59.819> to<00:02:59.910> make

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
that when he's putting in me to make

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.740
