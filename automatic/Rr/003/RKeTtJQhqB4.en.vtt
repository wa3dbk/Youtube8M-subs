00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:08.639
 everything can say you can close and 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:12.330
 happy owners of toyota corolla in 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:16.320
 my case 2000 8 years old here is my swallow 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.539
 and what I learned when I walked across the expanses 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.609
 internet what 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.109
 Wishlist and hits and jumps that you 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.080
 eating them is not necessary to put up 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.810
 The fact is that you can at home 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.000
 do the so -called initialization 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.289
 gear boxes 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.059
 how it is done in principle this 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.230
 information is absolutely free and 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.430
 available on the internet but in our world 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.160
 armed with this video you can just 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.660
 repeat my actions and do at home 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.969
 the same thing you need to give it 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.610
 write that there is a very specialized 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.710
 some detail that can be bought from 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.090
 them and take advantage of it in principle 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:01.289
 more than a jumper between the two 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:04.019
 contacts we go to the connector all that 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:09.330
 we do it just feathers mikhail 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:15.440
 2 contacts mix the top contact 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:18.080
 left 4 and lower right 4 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.930
 these gold contacts are bridged and after 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:26.930
 what sequence 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.460
 he is so necessary I should have explained 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.520
 one more thing except that 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.630
 initialization 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.880
 automatic gear shift 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.370
 there is still a clutch initialization 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.800
 improvisation and it needs transmission 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.350
 just do a little different action 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.420
 but we will focus on 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.940
 initialize and electronic unit 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.440
 controls because that's exactly what 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:55.070
 solve the problem of jumps in the car that we 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.330
 need to do first make sure that 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:02.240
 we have ignition keys 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.729
 open the ignition set on 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.140
 neutral 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.630
 when we open the ignition 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.440
 we see this illumination 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:15.160
 so many different light bulbs just 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:21.530
 blink it says what we found in 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.160
 mode and door coding first thing we 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.970
 push 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.330
 7 times 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.770
 children not three seconds on the brake pedal and 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:33.360
 after which we have to hear two sounds 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.220
 You can listen to the signal and 7 can and 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.500
 more than all out screw on 7 here are two 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.870
 beeps we heard which 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.330
 confirms that we can we went 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.780
 to mode and now and 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.960
 loading while holding the brake pedal 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.600
 we shift the lever next 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.400
 sequences from neutral to letter 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.740
 CNC and 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.400
 letters and on m and 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.520
 means to make us and 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.620
 initialization 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.720
 electronic control unit but he's already 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.880
 four times a minus which we will do 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.860
 now prince or date clutch plus 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.770
 minus plus minus during initialization 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.330
 transmissions minus minus plus plus we 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:17.580
 now we are doing minus minus minus minus 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.670
 after which we return to and return to 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.950
 do not let go and press the pedal 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:27.390
 brake and listen to audible confirmation 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.300
 there is a sound confirmation for 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.950
 it takes three to fix this memory 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.930
 press the brake pedal 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.510
 this confirmation also we had after 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.800
 what we turn off the ignition 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.800
 pull out our jumper and 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.190
 again you need to do the following 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.010
 the following 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:04:00.700
 otherwise she won't remember we open and 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:04.340
 wait 40 seconds, and hear what you hear that 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.430
 gearbox doing some action 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.160
 Now she whips to zero all 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.680
 appeared neutral and burns with us and 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.330
 constantly they blink mean process 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.049
 just completed completely 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.790
 after that we can enjoy our 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.030
 a very smooth ride for many of you 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:26.930
 will be opening 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:29.900
 how the car can drive beautifully 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:33.950
 because for example, I bought this car 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.230
 and when I was two years old and had never 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.570
 no not thought she really 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.710
 man so smoothly behave like after 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:49.930
 This is the procedure of all successful and 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:49.930
 all the best and i expect all likes from you
