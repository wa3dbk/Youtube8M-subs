00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.160
Hello, in this section

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.320
a very frequently asked question to us again

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.840
let's say especially distress

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.120
beginner

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.140
one of the biggest problems

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.480
water

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.940
we must say that;

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.940
buoyancy

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.740
There is a difference between

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.740
and the lifting force of water is superior.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.960
Hence our physical

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.240
we cannot sink in water.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.440
And this is in our lungs.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.160
if we think we support with air cuts

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040
as you know

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.540
alveolar sacs in our lungs

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.640
and these sachets filled with air

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.720
in them also warehouse air available

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.260
so even though we have given a deep breath

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.360
it is impossible to evacuate the air in our alveolar sacs

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.240
so even this air to our swim,

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.540
water

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.820
It helps.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.560
If we accept 70% of our body as water

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.100
we know that water will not sink into water.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
In this case our swim is quite easy.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.280
Why is the man sinking?

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.520
Let's try to clarify this:

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.260
In fact on earth another human and monkey live

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.660
do not drown!

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.620
As far as I remember, the reason for this;

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.820
they have feelings.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.120
Monkey and human beings,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.360
know the fear of death

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.880
therefore instinctively do not swim.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.180
But a human being is a conscious being.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.720
With the example we will do soon

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.280
I believe that your consciousness will increase even more.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.720
I can say,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.080
bodies in water

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.060
(try to explain with the simplest term)

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.760
sinking up to the highest peaks, buried

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.880
There is much more detailed physical expression of this

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.880
but no need. Let's not confuse too much.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.080
Let me try to explain here in summary

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.920
Let me apply.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.920
As I said; objects sink to their peak.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.360
Let's consider the water level to be zero

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.440
Let's call it 'surface'.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.680
So, the more you rise from the surface,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.800
you have to be buried under water.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.320
Without confusing your head,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.840
Let me give you an example:

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.720
my top point with my finger

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.120
over my head.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.120
So when I take a deep breath

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.120
if I wait still in the water

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.120
Look what will happen ..

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.040
My feet don't come down now,

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.760
I took my feet off the floor.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.840
You've seen me buried by myself the most.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.320
There is a 'mirror' principle in water;

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.320
The level of water

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.320
If you start above

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.280
You will be buried so much in the first place.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.040
So you can jump and jump like a ball

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.760
you get zero again.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.760
Be careful when I start this movement.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.760
between the surface and the surface about 20 cm.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.760
20 cm when I first started. I'll be buried,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.480
then I will,

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.760
I will, I will,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.280
at the end; if you show patience

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.280
you'll see it balanced.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.440
Sample:

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.960
Yes, as you see.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.880
After a point of focus,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.040
water lifting force-gravity

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.040
as a result.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.280
About 10 seconds

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.280
you can see that our body remains stable.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.360
We always say this in our trainings;

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.360
- an adult who can hold his breath for at least 12 seconds

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.120
can learn to swim easily.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.000
Because water reconciliation, staying on water

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.720
usually we need 10 seconds.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.280
If you can hold your breath for ten seconds,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.840
you will be able to see that the water has lifted you.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.800
We said the objects sank to their peak.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.800
So if we raise our peak,

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.680
Let's see what will happen.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.480
Let me try to summarize;

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.560
Upward from the surface

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.560
how much I raise my fingers

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.040
because my top is now my fingers

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.040
water naturally as a rule of physics

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.520
he pulled me to the tip of my fingers.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.320
I mean, my head was buried about the inch.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.840
That will prevent me from getting air!

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.280
Sorry for not getting air

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.720
I'm in danger of suffocation!

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.120
Why do people drown?

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.840
Because of the reflex. As a result, we are Mediterranean people,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.840
We can't be cold-blooded.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.560
First we raise our arms

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.560
we ask for help from a remote location.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.600
But naturally when asking for help

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.360
we are buried in the water and our throat

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.040
locks in reflex to prevent water from escaping

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.760
Yes, the water does not escape, but we cannot

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.720
fainting situation.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.280
Instead of asking for remote assistance

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.640
first of all we need to keep our air ducts open.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.120
So we must have mouth and nose at the top.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.760
After we come to ourselves, we can ask for help remotely.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.960
So if we need to summarize;

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.280
If we breathe through the mouth or nose, then

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.560
we should designate our peak as the mouth and nose.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.560
Please watch carefully.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.840
I'il show you one more time.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.840
My feet don't come down when I'm doing this move,

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.480
I'm completely on the water.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.400
It's like lying down on a pillow

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.400
my mouth and nose can lift up when I get back

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.560
I can breathe. I don't need to hold my breath.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.560
Sample:

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.560
Yeah, well, in this study, my arms and legs

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.080
I did not use. They are also broken as a result of an accident

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.360
or if you accept cramping,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.920
let's face the worst scenario.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.920
However, you can easily stay on the water.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.400
You can breathe, you can talk that way,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.720
You can shout.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.240
When you use your arms and legs

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.920
we call it standing on the water and swimming.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.920
To get to this level

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.160
Again our trainers

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.520
support.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.532
Hope to see you ..
