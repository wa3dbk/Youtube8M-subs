 put the goal is that his charter that makes 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.310
 the very selective race now timo 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.829
 is in second position with their 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.360
 group that has to solicit timoko for 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.960
 stay in touch because you're exaggerating 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.970
 very quickly 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.409
 using the third valais a little 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.030
 noise that is not yet launched followed 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.070
 by napoleon bar we also find 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.480
 in tadic quasi who comes from farther 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.490
 with robben 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.740
 also with his crutches or 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.880
 slight shrinkage on the dry finish which 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.860
 try to put ko all his opponents 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.450
 the hope team ben brik who took the 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.320
 way of help 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.020
 roland dumas me 4th and eric asic 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.909
 of 58 with that the more one is what good 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.159
 little time 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.780
 31 that it shocks which keeps the 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.149
 pressure and I left go 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.430
 complicate galloping disaster - ben 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.620
 brik was that knowing that the name mental 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.780
 come back quickly kimongo team in what way 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.790
 believe that there is now with sacha 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.580
 who are going to count that sir sir ne 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.050
 did not return that she was loathsome 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.390
 side that this people who will count that 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.280
 seventh is my vote of the mourning countries 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.140
 techradium says banco who wins this 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.540
 price 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.160
 who will copy his new exploit which 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.440
 wins the prize of France fight has charmed 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.910
 second 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.190
 wait a few moments for 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.070
 determine the places with maybe a 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.140
 big surprise with google and casey who 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.450
 may be third that started 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.400
 very quickly 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.500
 afraid of timoko I did not have 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.950
 star being well he held the key of 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.989
 the race 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.640
 he held the key to the same race 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.989
 if he did not win he's the one who has everything 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.090
 changed in the physiognomy of the race 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.280
 if he was good he was able to go 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.819
 in front of printing a hyper fast pace 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.049
 the ten just before departure and 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.519
 it was he who held the key to the 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.129
 race and a half did that race 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.659
 happened so and imoko gave birth to it 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.219
 the constant good rain and that it was 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.719
 already beaten in the last turn but 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.069
 never ridden jean-michel started to 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.930
 move his hands he could not 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.980
 he could not lead the race to his 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.629
 like it did in the price 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.129
 of america and that changed the whole 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.409
 corpulence of the valais very disappointing 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.209
 tigo relax with his number comes 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.909
 finish 5th is very very good and good 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.459
 sure we have we have surprises with 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.819
 this number 11 linda kasic meaning to 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.819
 start 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.440
 in fact it was done 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.350
 for culture 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.150
 like that you really have to 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.819
 search but maybe he missed 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.930
 one to contemplate to deserve that 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.960
 it is now that he's gone 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.880
 explains how 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.530
 worse for a little while 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.830
 the key will be yes all this it is 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.280
 there's what sells us 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.280
 in plain 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.790
 that's what kind of thoughts then 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.810
 fuction 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.079
 I thought they were made for 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.069
 charge to leave to the photo the sully to 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.769
 the excess reac and Welsh 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.109
 yes these cans yield because actually 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.310
 the arrival in the final phase 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:12.560
 incredible emotion look richard 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.969
 weird yes because good jean-philippe 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.750
 will probably go to meet him in 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:16.430
 moments 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.810
 it's still an exceptional victory 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.850
 it's the most beautiful with the clubs for 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.380
 bench 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.630
 he was there two years he won group 1 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.400
 and where there is no ep of america it is 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.229
 sure to his record but hey he'll have everything 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.930
 of the groove jean-philippe blackburn groupe 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.949
 bjarne we know more about how to talk 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.270
 of this horse so he is awesome 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.729
 it's the horse I led that 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.759
 did not see you like you did not have that 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:43.400
 normal and that's it and that's when it 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:44.980
 goes weakly and that's when he's going to do 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.070
 war and 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.860
 it's beautiful you did not have 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.130
 necessarily a lot of gas a top of the 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.180
 side 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.320
 I saw that you were in the process of 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.720
 solicit and he also me to the sites and 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.420
 timoko yeah but that was my body he 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.760
 can stop sometimes even to ventilate it 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.610
 he does not like doing the most because he 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.560
 stays gas to go right but I 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.330
 just went with tests the climb 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.710
 it's a bit of a problem to ensure him 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.890
 because you want that he wants more non 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:15.160
 but really he has it remains gascou the 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.920
 straight line he's there he won with 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.440
 but with half a meter but that's enough 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.690
 the elite the fart plus the price of france 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.070
 in the same in the same year 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.950
 it's magic but it's mostly a 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.580
 out of the ordinary mental that there no yes but 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.650
 it is a magnificent horse that he has alas 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.570
 always go back there was beaten but 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.580
 there always amazed is a fear that 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.470
 know something it's not it's not 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.280
 something that is not normal not 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.280
 normal well done
