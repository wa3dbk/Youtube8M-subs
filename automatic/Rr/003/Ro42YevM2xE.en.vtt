00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
advanced warfare it's just a very very

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.610 
advanced warfare we could always go back
and<00:01:57.610> look<00:01:58.060> at<00:01:58.270> skill<00:01:58.540> based<00:01:58.750> matchmaking<00:01:58.960> we

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
and look at skill based matchmaking we

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.840 
and look at skill based matchmaking we
could<00:01:59.800> say<00:01:59.950> that<00:01:59.980> it's<00:02:00.250> an<00:02:00.340> absolutely

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
people we could absolutely wreck so

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.479 
people we could absolutely wreck so
whenever<00:02:27.050> they<00:02:27.170> say<00:02:27.380> that<00:02:27.620> I'm<00:02:27.830> like<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.160> don't

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
whenever they say that I'm like I don't

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.040 
whenever they say that I'm like I don't
know<00:02:28.849> if<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:29.090> could<00:02:29.150> agree<00:02:29.450> with<00:02:29.690> you<00:02:29.870> on<00:02:29.900> that

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
know if I could agree with you on that

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.990 
know if I could agree with you on that
so<00:02:30.920> I'm<00:02:31.040> not<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.220> fan<00:02:31.489> of<00:02:31.520> skill<00:02:31.819> based

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
so I'm not a fan of skill based

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.790 
so I'm not a fan of skill based
matchmaking<00:02:32.209> again<00:02:33.080> it's<00:02:33.230> not<00:02:33.380> because<00:02:33.770> of

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
matchmaking again it's not because of

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.410 
matchmaking again it's not because of
the<00:02:33.980> fact<00:02:34.190> that<00:02:34.340> I<00:02:34.459> don't<00:02:34.760> like<00:02:34.910> going<00:02:35.090> against

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
the fact that I don't like going against

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.660 
the fact that I don't like going against
people<00:02:35.780> who<00:02:35.810> are<00:02:36.110> similar<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:37.010> my<00:02:37.130> skill<00:02:37.459> give

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
people who are similar to my skill give

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.240 
people who are similar to my skill give
a<00:02:37.880> skill<00:02:38.330> level<00:02:38.630> in<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.870> game<00:02:39.110> it's<00:02:39.860> due<00:02:40.100> to

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
a skill level in the game it's due to

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.559 
a skill level in the game it's due to
the<00:02:40.370> fact<00:02:40.550> that<00:02:40.730> every<00:02:41.090> time<00:02:41.270> I<00:02:41.300> get<00:02:41.540> on

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
the fact that every time I get on

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.120 
the fact that every time I get on
advanced<00:02:41.989> warfare<00:02:42.410> I<00:02:42.620> don't<00:02:42.800> want<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:42.980> go<00:02:43.100> out

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
advanced warfare I don't want to go out

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.510 
advanced warfare I don't want to go out
there<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.640> try<00:02:44.330> my<00:02:44.450> ass<00:02:44.810> off<00:02:45.230> use<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.739> bell<00:02:45.920> 27

and just really really have a hard time
getting<00:02:49.670> these<00:02:50.209> fun<00:02:50.569> fun<00:02:50.900> game<00:02:51.170> plays<00:02:51.470> and

getting these fun fun game plays and

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.250 
getting these fun fun game plays and
that<00:02:52.069> again<00:02:52.370> kind<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.840> goes<00:02:53.840> back<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.170> the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
that again kind of goes back to the

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.690 
that again kind of goes back to the
subject<00:02:54.530> that<00:02:54.920> call<00:02:55.220> of<00:02:55.280> duty<00:02:55.459> advanced

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
subject that call of duty advanced

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.940 
subject that call of duty advanced
warfare<00:02:55.790> is<00:02:56.300> not<00:02:56.480> addicting<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.410> again<00:02:57.769> it's

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
warfare is not addicting and again it's

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.470 
warfare is not addicting and again it's
due<00:02:58.100> to<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.370> fact<00:02:58.519> that<00:02:58.700> I<00:02:59.000> don't<00:02:59.209> want<00:02:59.330> to<00:02:59.390> go

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
due to the fact that I don't want to go

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.120 
due to the fact that I don't want to go
against<00:02:59.690> people<00:02:59.989> who<00:03:00.019> are<00:03:00.319> so<00:03:00.590> goddamn<00:03:00.830> good

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
against people who are so goddamn good

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.180 
against people who are so goddamn good
at<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.610> game<00:03:01.640> like<00:03:02.630> me<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:03.440> I<00:03:03.470> have<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.920> try

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
at the game like me that I have to try

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.100 
at the game like me that I have to try
really<00:03:04.700> really<00:03:04.910> hard<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.510> then<00:03:05.690> I<00:03:05.720> don't<00:03:05.840> even

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
really really hard and then I don't even

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.620 
really really hard and then I don't even
get<00:03:06.350> that<00:03:06.620> grade<00:03:06.980> of<00:03:07.130> game<00:03:07.280> plays<00:03:07.610> so<00:03:08.299> for<00:03:08.540> that

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
get that grade of game plays so for that

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.030 
get that grade of game plays so for that
I<00:03:08.900> feel<00:03:09.110> call<00:03:09.500> duty<00:03:09.680> advanced<00:03:09.920> warfare

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
I feel call duty advanced warfare

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.240 
I feel call duty advanced warfare
doesn't<00:03:11.030> really<00:03:11.150> draw<00:03:11.630> me<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.140> also<00:03:12.620> score

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
doesn't really draw me and also score

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.100 
doesn't really draw me and also score
streaks<00:03:13.549> in<00:03:13.670> this<00:03:13.790> game<00:03:14.000> are<00:03:14.030> probably<00:03:14.900> one<00:03:15.080> of

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
streaks in this game are probably one of
