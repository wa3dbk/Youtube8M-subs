from this company world of watches and

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.020 
from this company world of watches and
again<00:01:52.530> as<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:52.799> see<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.399> seems<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.909> have

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
again as you can see it seems to have

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
all the Invicta markings

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.310 
all the Invicta markings
I<00:01:56.159> think<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.000> watch<00:01:57.600> retails<00:01:58.049> for<00:01:58.140> about

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
I think this watch retails for about

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.730 
I think this watch retails for about
$600<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.520> think<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.820> paid<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.420> hundred<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.530> thirty

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
$600 I think I paid a hundred and thirty

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.620 
$600 I think I paid a hundred and thirty
dollars<00:02:01.860> for<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.880> guess<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.420> get<00:02:03.570> what

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
dollars for it so I guess you get what

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.310 
dollars for it so I guess you get what
you<00:02:03.899> pay<00:02:04.020> for

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
you pay for

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.700 
you pay for
