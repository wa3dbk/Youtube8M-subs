also works with my laptop screen so I

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.520 
also works with my laptop screen so I
can<00:04:48.700> just<00:04:48.940> have<00:04:49.120> regular<00:04:49.330> touchscreen<00:04:50.020> laptop

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530

can just have regular touchscreen laptop
with<00:04:50.740> this

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.810 

you<00:05:12.160> can<00:05:12.280> get<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:12.490> basic<00:05:12.820> idea<00:05:12.940> at<00:05:14.100> Johnny<00:05:15.100> Lee

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
you can get the basic idea at Johnny Lee

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.450 
you can get the basic idea at Johnny Lee
dotnet<00:05:16.720> I<00:05:17.080> think<00:05:17.440> that's<00:05:17.950> where<00:05:18.190> I<00:05:18.220> got<00:05:18.370> the

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
dotnet I think that's where I got the

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.290 
dotnet I think that's where I got the
idea<00:05:18.700> from<00:05:19.380> he<00:05:20.380> has<00:05:20.470> kind<00:05:20.830> of<00:05:20.860> a<00:05:20.980> tutorial<00:05:21.300> on

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
idea from he has kind of a tutorial on

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.270 
idea from he has kind of a tutorial on
the<00:05:22.420> basics<00:05:22.900> no<00:05:23.590> it<00:05:23.710> doesn't<00:05:23.950> give<00:05:24.040> you<00:05:24.160> any

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
the basics no it doesn't give you any

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.470 
the basics no it doesn't give you any
other<00:05:24.370> program<00:05:24.850> it<00:05:24.970> gives<00:05:25.000> you<00:05:25.180> one<00:05:25.300> of<00:05:25.420> the

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
other program it gives you one of the

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.740 
other program it gives you one of the
throat<00:05:25.690> wrench<00:05:25.900> but<00:05:26.110> it's<00:05:26.200> only<00:05:26.320> for<00:05:26.560> Windows

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
throat wrench but it's only for Windows

00:05:44.060 --> 00:06:09.700 

does<00:05:44.720> need<00:05:45.530> to<00:05:45.560> be<00:05:45.740> calibrated

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.570 

and<00:06:10.250> tells<00:06:10.520> you<00:06:10.639> even<00:06:11.060> the<00:06:12.100> Wiimote<00:06:13.100> battery
