00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.679 
we live we have a gym and an ice rink
and<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:26.400> have<00:00:26.519> keys<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.939> both<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.269> those<00:00:27.359> places

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
and we have keys to both of those places

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.410 
and we have keys to both of those places
so<00:00:28.109> were<00:00:28.199> able<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.500> go<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.949> pretty<00:00:29.880> much<00:00:30.000> every

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
so were able to go in pretty much every

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.209 
so were able to go in pretty much every
day<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.599> set<00:00:30.990> up<00:00:31.109> her<00:00:31.230> own<00:00:31.349> schedule<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.070> do

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
day and set up her own schedule and do

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.069

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.570 
real good optimism around the locker
room<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.870> think<00:03:04.680> we<00:03:04.950> know<00:03:05.070> we<00:03:05.190> have<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.310> great

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
room I think we know we have a great

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.160 
room I think we know we have a great
group<00:03:05.790> of<00:03:05.940> guys<00:03:06.060> coming<00:03:06.390> back<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.959> we<00:03:07.080> were

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
group of guys coming back and we were

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.290 
group of guys coming back and we were
very<00:03:07.410> tight<00:03:07.740> and<00:03:08.040> it's<00:03:08.610> nice<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.880> see<00:03:09.060> some<00:03:09.270> of

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
very tight and it's nice to see some of

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.730 
very tight and it's nice to see some of
the<00:03:09.420> pieces<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.050> characters<00:03:10.500> and

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
the pieces and the characters and

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.220 
the pieces and the characters and
personalities<00:03:10.920> we've<00:03:11.610> added<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.570> think

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
personalities we've added and I think

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.410 
personalities we've added and I think
there's<00:03:13.380> just<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.650> quiet<00:03:13.890> just<00:03:14.790> general<00:03:15.150> sense

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
there's just a quiet just general sense

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.140 
there's just a quiet just general sense
of<00:03:15.540> confidence<00:03:16.019> right<00:03:16.110> now<00:03:16.290> knowing<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.150> we

of confidence right now knowing that we

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.220 
of confidence right now knowing that we
have<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.269> potential<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.870> do<00:03:19.019> something

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230
