00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.350 
falls apart and I I think I could use a
couple<00:03:09.720> more<00:03:09.959> like<00:03:10.230> town<00:03:11.070> things<00:03:11.670> I<00:03:11.880> really

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
couple more like town things I really

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.150 
couple more like town things I really

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
hope this is making sense or throughout

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.569
