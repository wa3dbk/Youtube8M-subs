00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 very good welcome to a new video 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.660
 from halo boutique we are going to play a 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.000
 duel by team in free fall with the sa 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:16.139
 805 attentive to the owner of the article 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.359
 because the thing promises and we're not going to 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.750
 watch any video of rihanna with her boyfriend 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.360
 this is a subject a little more serious and for 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.000
 so nothing good 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.690
 the holder is the following security 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.920
 of the planes in check by a hacker the 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.930
 word game is a serious topic yes 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.800
 but the joke and the word game 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.220
 I think it has softened it a bit 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.460
 we go with the news rubén santamarta a 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.140
 researcher in cyber security 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.140
 He says he found the way to 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.379
 hack the communications equipment of 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.510
 the airplanes through the wifi signal and 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.640
 of entertainment systems or 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.250
 game that I'm going to do systems emphasis 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.210
 entertainment offered in the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.930
 I do not know what rubén is referring to 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.060
 with entertainment systems 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.700
 inside an airplane because the planes 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.649
 normal those that come to us in the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.250
 clear movies because in the movies 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.410
 they offer us there what we do not have in 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.360
 house has it there you do not have an xbox 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.950
 you have a play a movie in bluray 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.530
 you have popcorn has next 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.369
 you have a lot of airplane things there 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.560
 super big rows of 9 people like this 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.170
 side by side I wanted that is is a 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.210
 exaggeration no friend rubén the airplanes 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.009
 normal those who do not make the 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.600
 movies there there is nothing there is no 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.310
 entertainment good entertainment if 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.549
 you kick the guy in front 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.340
 Yours is not that little by little and little else 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.740
 well if the one behind you also takes you 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.080
 your support is backwards and they touch 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.599
 the balls to the kid behind 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.549
 not like that you play not far away is a bit 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:07.490
 the one in the back and a little in front of the 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.220
 in front that Ruben is the only 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.670
 entertainment system that they offer 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.160
 the real planes the normal ones so 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.110
 except those that I have seen but not good 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.959
 let's continue with the news because 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.930
 he knew that rubén when he says that he can 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.310
 access using the wifi signal 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.319
 Thanks to these systems 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.140
 entertainment is that there are not 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.569
 those planes that tell the legend 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.579
 exist even though I have not seen them 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.269
 better some of you yes and here 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:41.959
 talking about that is worth an affirmation 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.939
 that could cause a review in the 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.730
 aircraft safety 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:49.280
 rubén is a consultant of the firm and 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.349
 activate and exposed all the details 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.719
 technicians of his research in the 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:57.230
 blackhat hacking conference that 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:03:00.470
 two weeks ago and something in the 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.889
 vegas' if I'm not wrong a convention 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.709
 annual where thousands of hackers and experts 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:09.340
 in safety that the truth is that they are 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.920
 two professions 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:16.060
 how to say that they are separated by a 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.280
 line very very very thin let's say yes 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.379
 you work for a company and you are paid 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.989
 if you're not a security expert and 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.420
 hackers for nothing these people meet 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.690
 to discuss the latest threats 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.239
 IT companies that have emerged and this 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.030
 so that we can improve the measures of 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:37.870
 security I am not an expert of 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:42.670
 security let alone a hacker but 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.980
 it is clear that this if rubén confirms it 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.730
 well confirmed the conference I suppose 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.989
 because the news is before the 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.640
 conference therefore I'm not sure 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.040
 obviously what was spoken there not me 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.730
 I was not there and little else not the best 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.709
 some news could have or not because 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.340
 the best I know the companies of these 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.930
 of aviation said hey you ruben you go to 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.660
 work with me darling but this 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.730
 information you shut up because you can 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.160
 cause our actions and those of 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.060
 others are going to take it for ass 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:22.510
 it is possible in this world the money sends 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:26.050
 and if they want the light to come out 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.840
 that information does not come out and point and good 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.880
 therefore I do not know what was said in 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.730
 that conference I do not know if it was confirmed 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.950
 surely that rubén has said 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:40.640
 it's not that I can access and such and then 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:43.310
 has been a trola a trola I doubt the 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.510
 thing would be to see how this would affect the 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.490
 flights 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.490
 I guess no good obviously because 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.520
 that of accessing an airplane by signal 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.400
 wifi by any signal or through 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:59.830
 any way that has to be a 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:03.440
 big said vulgarly a great bitch 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:07.040
 amputated from the big ones I do not know what could 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.110
 be rubén accessing the plane but 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.810
 sure to change things and modify 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.090
 things that could cause a 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.920
 very impossible accident 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.430
 Ruben will not do it as a ruben is 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.900
 good people who said it and all that 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.670
 he could have stayed quiet and 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.870
 sell it to the bad guys in the movie 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.810
 but he has not done it he has not done it he has 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.650
 said is good people and good to have 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.000
 care and little more 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.170
 I hope you liked it like and 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.170
 until the next goodbye
