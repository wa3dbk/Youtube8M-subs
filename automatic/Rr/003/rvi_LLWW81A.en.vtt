00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
making this a kind of a cross see Hale

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.439 
making this a kind of a cross see Hale
I'm<00:00:22.949> just<00:00:23.189> doing<00:00:23.400> these<00:00:23.550> little<00:00:23.850> squiggly

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
I'm just doing these little squiggly

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.589 
I'm just doing these little squiggly
grassy<00:00:25.439> marks<00:00:25.949> just<00:00:26.189> makes<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.210> look<00:00:27.390> very

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
grassy marks just makes it look very

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.900 
grassy marks just makes it look very
grassy<00:00:28.199> very<00:00:28.410> quickly<00:00:28.650> very<00:00:29.010> easy<00:00:29.279> now<00:00:29.789> I'm

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
grassy very quickly very easy now I'm

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.269 
grassy very quickly very easy now I'm
gonna<00:00:30.029> move<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.330> cross<00:00:30.539> over<00:00:31.019> here<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.740> what

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
gonna move the cross over here and what

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.940 
gonna move the cross over here and what
we<00:00:32.430> need<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:33.180> do<00:00:33.329> all<00:00:33.480> 3d<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.290> vanishing

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
we need to do all 3d is a vanishing

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.220 
we need to do all 3d is a vanishing
point<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.430> I'm<00:00:35.610> gonna<00:00:35.790> put<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.030> little<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.450> little

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
point so I'm gonna put a little a little

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.650 
point so I'm gonna put a little a little
X<00:00:37.649> over<00:00:38.129> here<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.969> then<00:00:39.149> you're<00:00:39.270> gonna<00:00:39.360> need<00:00:39.480> a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
X over here and then you're gonna need a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.760 
X over here and then you're gonna need a
ruler<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.320> place<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:40.950> X<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:42.440> join<00:00:43.440> up

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
ruler and place it on that X and join up

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.100 
ruler and place it on that X and join up
with<00:00:43.829> these<00:00:44.309> all<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.850> corner<00:00:45.270> points<00:00:45.629> up<00:00:45.809> here

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
with these all the corner points up here

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.430 
with these all the corner points up here
so<00:00:46.350> there's<00:00:46.559> one<00:00:47.329> and<00:00:48.329> draw<00:00:48.719> quite<00:00:48.989> lightly

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
so there's one and draw quite lightly

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.200 
so there's one and draw quite lightly
because<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.190> didn't<00:00:50.370> want<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.550> erase<00:00:50.940> these

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
because you didn't want to erase these

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.889 
because you didn't want to erase these
later<00:00:52.340> don't<00:00:53.340> press<00:00:53.670> hard<00:00:53.969> for<00:00:54.360> then<00:00:54.510> when<00:00:54.750> you

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
later don't press hard for then when you

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.000 
later don't press hard for then when you
try<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.680> rub<00:00:55.920> them<00:00:56.070> out<00:00:56.219> at<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> wound<00:00:58.010> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
try to rub them out at the wound and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.240 
try to rub them out at the wound and
then<00:00:59.190> into<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.550> corner<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:01.079> finally<00:01:01.710> you

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
then into that corner and finally you

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.189 
then into that corner and finally you
want<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.550> up<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.180> corner<00:01:03.510> there<00:01:03.809> as<00:01:03.960> well

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
want it up to that corner there as well

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.640 
want it up to that corner there as well
now<00:01:04.500> start<00:01:05.489> decide<00:01:06.210> how<00:01:06.570> kind<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.170> deep<00:01:07.409> you

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
now start decide how kind of deep you

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.380 
now start decide how kind of deep you
want<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.729> I'm<00:01:08.880> going<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.270> it

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
want this to be so I'm going to have it

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.020 
want this to be so I'm going to have it
about<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.900> deep<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:11.040> I'm<00:01:11.159> gonna<00:01:11.280> start<00:01:11.729> at

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
about that deep and I'm gonna start at

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.780 
about that deep and I'm gonna start at
the<00:01:12.060> top<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.990> angle<00:01:13.350> line<00:01:13.890> I'm<00:01:14.520> gonna

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the top on that angle line I'm gonna

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.270 
the top on that angle line I'm gonna
bring<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.240> down<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.500> top<00:01:16.770> arm<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
bring that down to the top arm of the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.210 
bring that down to the top arm of the
Cross<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.790> stop<00:01:18.150> now<00:01:18.390> from<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.650> angle<00:01:19.920> line

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
Cross and stop now from this angle line

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.760 
Cross and stop now from this angle line
I'm<00:01:20.369> gonna<00:01:20.490> bring<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.880> down<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:22.380> make<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.530> go

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
I'm gonna bring this down and make it go

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.670 
I'm gonna bring this down and make it go
behind<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> hill<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:24.720> next<00:01:25.229> thing<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.500> want

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
behind the hill the next thing you want

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.510 
behind the hill the next thing you want
to<00:01:25.740> do<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:27.409> go<00:01:28.409> across<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.189> must<00:01:29.400> be

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
to do is go across so this must be

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.330 
to do is go across so this must be
parallel<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.329> arm<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.549> go<00:01:32.750> across<00:01:34.340> and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
parallel to the arm and go across and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.130 
parallel to the arm and go across and
from<00:01:35.700> there<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.119> want<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.329> go<00:01:36.450> across<00:01:36.750> until

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
from there you want to go across until

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.590 
from there you want to go across until
you<00:01:37.259> join<00:01:37.560> up<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.250> line<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.240> goes<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
you join up the line that goes to the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.140 
you join up the line that goes to the
vanishing<00:01:39.930> point<00:01:40.110> now<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.250> side<00:01:41.460> here<00:01:41.970> you

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
vanishing point now on the side here you

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.179 
vanishing point now on the side here you
want<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.420> draw<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> line<00:01:43.250> paint<00:01:44.750> vertically<00:01:45.750> up

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
want to draw a line paint vertically up

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.420 
want to draw a line paint vertically up
and<00:01:47.189> then<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.549> can<00:01:47.700> draw<00:01:47.880> all<00:01:48.210> these

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
and then you can draw all these

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.300 
and then you can draw all these
connecting<00:01:50.780> angled<00:01:51.780> lines<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.770> these<00:01:53.130> open

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
connecting angled lines and these open

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.859 
connecting angled lines and these open
be<00:01:53.520> slightly<00:01:53.759> different<00:01:54.000> angles<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.570> don't

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
be slightly different angles so don't

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.830 
be slightly different angles so don't
remember<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.470> move<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> ruler<00:01:55.890> around<00:01:56.840> to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
remember to move the ruler around to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.569 
remember to move the ruler around to
change<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.350> angle<00:01:59.930> then<00:02:00.930> one<00:02:01.200> more<00:02:01.439> over<00:02:01.649> here
