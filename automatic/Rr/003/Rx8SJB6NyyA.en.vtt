00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.899 
coach Mickey Wilson views class 3a
region<00:01:45.479> 8<00:01:45.689> heading<00:01:46.470> into<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.799> season<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.399> think

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
region 8 heading into the season I think

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.010 
region 8 heading into the season I think
Wilson<00:01:48.060> probably<00:01:48.450> has<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> favorite

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
Wilson probably has to be the favorite

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.929 
Wilson probably has to be the favorite
with<00:01:49.350> all<00:01:49.439> those<00:01:49.560> guys<00:01:49.770> coming<00:01:50.130> back<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.700> that

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
with all those guys coming back on that

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.399 
with all those guys coming back on that
side<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> ball<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.630> mean<00:01:51.780> don't<00:01:51.869> put<00:01:52.320> our

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
side of the ball I mean don't put our

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.340 
side of the ball I mean don't put our
team<00:01:52.700> so<00:01:53.700> it's<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.270> tough<00:01:54.479> region<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.229> know

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
team so it's a tough region and you know

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.749 
team so it's a tough region and you know
we<00:01:55.470> got<00:01:55.590> some<00:01:55.740> new<00:01:55.860> coaches<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.399> there<00:01:56.579> that

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
we got some new coaches in there that

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.100 
we got some new coaches in there that
are<00:01:56.820> doing<00:01:56.850> some<00:01:57.149> great<00:01:57.299> things<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.930> think

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
are doing some great things and I think

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.090 
are doing some great things and I think
that<00:01:58.259> reach<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.530> will<00:01:58.619> do<00:01:58.740> nothing<00:01:58.890> but

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that reach it will do nothing but

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.460 
that reach it will do nothing but
improve
