00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
there's a part of here for a battery I

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.010 
there's a part of here for a battery I
don't<00:01:37.650> know<00:01:37.740> what<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.920> batteries<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:39.020> nobody

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.319 
don't know what the batteries for nobody
oh<00:01:40.560> not<00:01:41.159> sure<00:01:41.369> if<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:41.850> something<00:01:42.150> in

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329
