another<00:00:05.060> daily<00:00:05.240> routine<00:00:05.720> is<00:00:06.020> the<00:00:06.050> we<00:00:06.560> have<00:00:06.680> to

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:06.800 
another daily routine is the we have to

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.190 
another daily routine is the we have to
weigh<00:00:06.920> out<00:00:07.040> the<00:00:07.220> feed<00:00:07.490> every<00:00:07.850> day<00:00:08.000> every<00:00:08.750> all

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
weigh out the feed every day every all

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.560 
weigh out the feed every day every all
the<00:00:09.469> feeder<00:00:09.680> have<00:00:09.920> a<00:00:09.950> specific<00:00:10.940> feed<00:00:11.180> ration

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
the feeder have a specific feed ration

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.390 
the feeder have a specific feed ration
it's<00:00:11.690> a<00:00:11.750> percent<00:00:12.110> of<00:00:12.200> their<00:00:12.320> body<00:00:12.500> weight<00:00:12.680> so

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
it's a percent of their body weight so

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.890 
it's a percent of their body weight so
these<00:00:13.580> young<00:00:13.850> fish<00:00:14.059> get<00:00:14.270> maybe<00:00:14.420> five<00:00:14.690> or<00:00:14.750> six

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
these young fish get maybe five or six

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.140 
these young fish get maybe five or six
percent<00:00:15.230> of<00:00:15.559> their<00:00:15.680> body<00:00:15.920> weight<00:00:16.039> at<00:00:16.760> the

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
percent of their body weight at the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.460 
percent of their body weight at the
start<00:00:17.390> and<00:00:17.510> they<00:00:17.600> then<00:00:17.869> they<00:00:17.900> have<00:00:18.140> to<00:00:18.260> start

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
start and they then they have to start

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.200 
start and they then they have to start
with<00:00:18.619> very<00:00:18.890> very<00:00:19.070> fine<00:00:19.430> feet<00:00:19.789> it's<00:00:20.000> a<00:00:20.029> very

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
with very very fine feet it's a very

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.419 
with very very fine feet it's a very
critical<00:00:20.449> stage<00:00:20.900> of<00:00:21.109> fish<00:00:21.289> culture<00:00:21.500> is<00:00:22.039> to<00:00:22.279> get

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:22.429 
critical stage of fish culture is to get

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.359 
critical stage of fish culture is to get
these<00:00:22.580> a<00:00:22.970> Lovins<00:00:23.359> and<00:00:23.660> they<00:00:23.869> swim<00:00:24.109> up<00:00:24.140> fry<00:00:24.499> onto

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
these a Lovins and they swim up fry onto

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.339 
these a Lovins and they swim up fry onto
their<00:00:25.519> feed<00:00:25.789> so<00:00:26.359> that's<00:00:26.570> that's<00:00:26.810> kind<00:00:27.109> of<00:00:27.169> a

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
their feed so that's that's kind of a

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.409 
their feed so that's that's kind of a
first<00:00:27.769> step<00:00:28.039> first<00:00:28.519> you<00:00:28.910> know<00:00:28.970> I<00:00:29.029> need<00:00:29.179> a<00:00:29.240> clock

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
first step first you know I need a clock

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.530 
first step first you know I need a clock
in<00:00:29.539> the<00:00:29.599> morning<00:00:29.630> fish<00:00:30.230> culture<00:00:30.439> arrives<00:00:30.890> and

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
in the morning fish culture arrives and

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.060 
in the morning fish culture arrives and
we<00:00:32.540> got<00:00:32.660> to<00:00:32.780> get<00:00:32.840> these<00:00:32.990> just<00:00:33.380> like<00:00:33.590> any<00:00:33.739> farm

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
we got to get these just like any farm

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.250 
we got to get these just like any farm
we<00:00:34.220> have<00:00:34.340> to<00:00:34.460> get<00:00:34.610> them<00:00:34.790> have<00:00:35.750> to<00:00:35.900> get<00:00:36.050> them<00:00:36.170> on

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
we have to get them have to get them on

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.770 
we have to get them have to get them on
their<00:00:36.440> feet<00:00:36.620> we<00:00:37.610> order<00:00:37.910> maybe<00:00:38.120> two<00:00:38.390> or<00:00:38.510> three

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
their feet we order maybe two or three

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.860 
their feet we order maybe two or three
times<00:00:38.990> a<00:00:39.260> year<00:00:39.470> and<00:00:39.940> feed<00:00:40.940> you<00:00:41.090> you<00:00:41.390> see<00:00:41.600> here

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
times a year and feed you you see here

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.330 
times a year and feed you you see here
probably<00:00:42.230> is<00:00:42.530> good<00:00:42.770> for<00:00:42.980> three<00:00:43.220> or<00:00:43.310> four

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
probably is good for three or four

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.500 
probably is good for three or four
months<00:00:43.670> as<00:00:44.140> the<00:00:45.140> fish<00:00:45.550> get<00:00:46.550> bigger<00:00:47.000> of<00:00:47.240> course

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
months as the fish get bigger of course

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.870 
months as the fish get bigger of course
we<00:00:47.720> have<00:00:47.870> to<00:00:48.080> increase<00:00:48.830> the<00:00:49.070> size<00:00:49.280> of<00:00:49.490> the<00:00:49.670> of

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
we have to increase the size of the of

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.360 
we have to increase the size of the of
the<00:00:50.360> feed<00:00:50.570> that<00:00:50.780> they<00:00:50.930> get<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:51.980> you<00:00:52.070> can<00:00:52.220> see

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
the feed that they get and you can see

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.030 
the feed that they get and you can see
the<00:00:52.580> the<00:00:53.060> very<00:00:53.270> fine<00:00:53.570> powder<00:00:53.870> is<00:00:54.230> for<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:54.530> for

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
the the very fine powder is for the for

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.980 
the the very fine powder is for the for
the<00:00:55.100> elements<00:00:55.580> just<00:00:55.670> as<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:56.000> it's<00:00:56.720> the<00:00:56.840> very

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
the elements just as a it's the very

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.570 
the elements just as a it's the very
first<00:00:57.260> feed<00:00:57.530> that<00:00:57.650> they<00:00:57.770> get<00:00:57.950> is<00:00:58.100> very<00:00:58.280> very

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
first feed that they get is very very

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.510 
first feed that they get is very very
fine<00:00:58.880> and<00:00:59.650> you<00:01:00.650> know<00:01:00.740> the<00:01:00.860> bigger<00:01:01.040> feed<00:01:01.310> would

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
fine and you know the bigger feed would

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.640 
fine and you know the bigger feed would
be<00:01:01.640> as<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.000> fish<00:01:02.180> are<00:01:02.360> maybe<00:01:03.080> get<00:01:03.320> enough<00:01:03.530> to

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
be as the fish are maybe get enough to

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.190 
be as the fish are maybe get enough to
ten<00:01:03.800> or<00:01:03.920> fifteen<00:01:04.250> grams<00:01:04.659> so<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.810> fish<00:01:05.990> culture

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
ten or fifteen grams so the fish culture

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.380 
ten or fifteen grams so the fish culture
ist's<00:01:06.590> write<00:01:07.100> down<00:01:07.280> all<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:07.790> stock<00:01:08.030> numbers

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
ist's write down all the stock numbers

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.060 
ist's write down all the stock numbers
of<00:01:08.749> each<00:01:08.960> of<00:01:09.109> the<00:01:09.170> different<00:01:09.259> containers<00:01:09.859> and

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
of each of the different containers and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.889 
of each of the different containers and
then<00:01:10.729> they<00:01:10.909> write<00:01:11.090> down<00:01:11.119> how<00:01:11.450> much<00:01:11.630> food<00:01:11.840> they

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
then they write down how much food they

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:13.929 
then they write down how much food they
want<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:12.350> of<00:01:12.619> what<00:01:12.799> food<00:01:13.039> type<00:01:13.249> or<00:01:13.549> what<00:01:13.759> food

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
want and of what food type or what food

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.719 
want and of what food type or what food
size<00:01:14.179> and<00:01:15.020> then<00:01:15.469> it's<00:01:15.619> my<00:01:15.740> job<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:16.249> weigh<00:01:16.609> it

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
size and then it's my job to weigh it

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.800 
size and then it's my job to weigh it
out<00:01:16.820> into<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.210> buckets

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.969 

then<00:01:22.810> we<00:01:22.990> bring<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.320> food<00:01:23.439> into<00:01:23.679> the<00:01:23.770> trough

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
then we bring the food into the trough

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:36.450 
then we bring the food into the trough
room<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.600> fish<00:01:34.810> get<00:01:35.049> fed<00:01:35.289> about<00:01:35.469> every<00:01:36.250> half

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
room the fish get fed about every half

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.600 
room the fish get fed about every half
hour<00:01:36.670> by<00:01:37.569> hand<00:01:37.810> feeding<00:01:38.079> and<00:01:38.350> then<00:01:39.189> we<00:01:39.310> also

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
hour by hand feeding and then we also

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.550 
hour by hand feeding and then we also
load<00:01:39.819> some<00:01:40.030> feed<00:01:40.240> into<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.719> auto<00:01:40.899> feeders<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
load some feed into the auto feeders and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.370 
load some feed into the auto feeders and
they<00:01:44.560> go<00:01:44.709> off<00:01:44.860> every<00:01:45.039> half<00:01:45.340> hour<00:01:45.520> as<00:01:45.729> well<00:01:46.380> we

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
they go off every half hour as well we

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.819 
they go off every half hour as well we
try<00:01:47.619> and<00:01:47.770> time<00:01:47.950> it<00:01:48.130> so<00:01:48.850> that<00:01:49.030> our<00:01:49.149> hand<00:01:49.420> feeding

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
try and time it so that our hand feeding

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.770 
try and time it so that our hand feeding
feeds<00:01:50.829> in<00:01:51.219> between<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:52.299> auto<00:01:52.479> feeder

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
feeds in between the auto feeder

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.050 
feeds in between the auto feeder
feedings<00:01:56.009> what<00:01:57.009> what<00:01:57.429> looks<00:01:57.610> like<00:01:57.700> rain

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
feedings what what looks like rain

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.449 
feedings what what looks like rain
falling<00:01:58.479> is<00:01:58.659> actually<00:01:59.439> deprived<00:01:59.950> coming<00:02:00.369> up

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459 
falling is actually deprived coming up

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.010 
falling is actually deprived coming up
to<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.729> surface<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:01.090> take<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.420> little<00:02:01.659> bit<00:02:01.869> of

of some foreign matter or or a disease
in<00:02:44.769> one<00:02:44.889> group<00:02:45.130> it's<00:02:45.340> not<00:02:45.400> spread<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:45.940> the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
in one group it's not spread to the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.199 
in one group it's not spread to the
others<00:02:46.859> so<00:02:47.859> we<00:02:47.889> have<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.430> separate<00:02:49.030> little

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
others so we have a separate little

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.839 
others so we have a separate little
brush<00:02:49.540> for<00:02:49.840> each<00:02:49.989> trough<00:02:50.430> it's<00:02:51.430> kind<00:02:51.670> of<00:02:51.730> a

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
brush for each trough it's kind of a

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.989 
brush for each trough it's kind of a
biosecurity<00:02:52.359> thing
