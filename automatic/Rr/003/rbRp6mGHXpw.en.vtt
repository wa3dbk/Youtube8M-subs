00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.429 
basically I can walk on it for about 20
minutes<00:04:26.060> 30<00:04:26.240> minutes<00:04:26.659> and<00:04:26.900> I<00:04:26.960> go<00:04:27.139> through<00:04:27.319> this

00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:27.439 
minutes 30 minutes and I go through this

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:29.860 
minutes 30 minutes and I go through this
really<00:04:27.680> excruciating<00:04:28.490> pain<00:04:28.789> in<00:04:29.120> my<00:04:29.479> stump

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
really excruciating pain in my stump

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.379 
really excruciating pain in my stump
area<00:04:30.229> when<00:04:31.099> I<00:04:31.129> first<00:04:31.490> got<00:04:31.639> my<00:04:31.789> prosthetic<00:04:32.300> I

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
area when I first got my prosthetic I

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:33.640 
area when I first got my prosthetic I
honestly<00:04:32.689> thought<00:04:32.900> that<00:04:32.960> I<00:04:33.139> was<00:04:33.319> going<00:04:33.439> to<00:04:33.499> be

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
honestly thought that I was going to be

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.059 
honestly thought that I was going to be
just<00:04:33.860> as<00:04:34.340> good<00:04:34.490> as<00:04:34.639> I<00:04:34.759> was<00:04:35.029> with<00:04:35.900> the<00:04:35.960> BK<00:04:36.409> and<00:04:36.710> it

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:37.069 
just as good as I was with the BK and it

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.339 
just as good as I was with the BK and it
wasn't<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.520> case<00:04:37.759> it<00:04:38.060> was<00:04:38.719> really<00:04:39.050> trying

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
wasn't the case it was really trying

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.739 
wasn't the case it was really trying
that's<00:04:40.069> when<00:04:40.279> I<00:04:40.310> really<00:04:40.849> started<00:04:40.879> to<00:04:41.360> walk<00:04:41.539> on

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:41.749 
that's when I really started to walk on

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:43.600 
that's when I really started to walk on
the<00:04:41.840> crutches<00:04:42.259> a<00:04:42.289> lot<00:04:42.499> more<00:04:42.710> and<00:04:42.949> that's<00:04:43.340> why<00:04:43.580> I

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
the crutches a lot more and that's why I

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.600 
the crutches a lot more and that's why I
don't<00:04:43.879> use<00:04:44.090> it<00:04:44.120> just<00:04:44.539> because<00:04:44.779> of<00:04:44.900> sheer<00:04:45.050> pain

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
don't use it just because of sheer pain

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.119 
don't use it just because of sheer pain
the<00:04:46.610> liner<00:04:46.909> that<00:04:47.060> I<00:04:47.240> have<00:04:47.569> is<00:04:47.930> a<00:04:48.259> suction<00:04:48.710> fit

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:49.129 
the liner that I have is a suction fit

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:51.459 
the liner that I have is a suction fit
liner<00:04:49.400> like<00:04:49.849> it<00:04:50.120> would<00:04:50.629> literally<00:04:50.960> take

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:51.469 
liner like it would literally take

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:53.950 
liner like it would literally take
everything<00:04:52.249> in<00:04:52.400> your<00:04:52.580> power<00:04:52.849> and<00:04:53.090> everybody's

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
everything in your power and everybody's

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.689 
everything in your power and everybody's
power<00:04:54.229> deployed<00:04:55.099> they<00:04:55.219> could<00:04:55.340> probably<00:04:55.490> hang

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
power deployed they could probably hang

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:56.950 
power deployed they could probably hang
me<00:04:55.789> upside<00:04:55.909> down<00:04:56.090> with<00:04:56.360> it<00:04:56.479> it<00:04:56.599> wouldn't<00:04:56.840> come

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
me upside down with it it wouldn't come

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.050 
me upside down with it it wouldn't come
off<00:04:57.219> it's<00:04:58.219> it's<00:04:58.669> a<00:04:58.819> very<00:04:59.090> unique<00:04:59.360> deal

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
off it's it's a very unique deal

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.090 
off it's it's a very unique deal
I<00:05:01.150> couldn't<00:05:02.139> imagine<00:05:02.200> going<00:05:02.590> through<00:05:02.919> life

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
I couldn't imagine going through life

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.400 
I couldn't imagine going through life
and<00:05:03.520> not<00:05:03.669> being<00:05:03.880> active<00:05:04.330> any<00:05:04.480> longer<00:05:04.900> it's<00:05:05.260> not

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
and not being active any longer it's not

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.290 
and not being active any longer it's not
something<00:05:06.100> that's<00:05:06.220> feasible<00:05:06.610> to<00:05:07.000> me<00:05:07.150> any

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
something that's feasible to me any

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.000 
something that's feasible to me any
longer<00:05:07.690> and<00:05:07.900> it's<00:05:08.230> something<00:05:08.650> I<00:05:08.860> could

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
longer and it's something I could

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.680 
longer and it's something I could
probably<00:05:09.190> could<00:05:09.669> have<00:05:09.760> accepted<00:05:10.270> in<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.450> past

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
probably could have accepted in the past

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.950 
probably could have accepted in the past
but<00:05:10.990> not<00:05:11.500> in<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.680> present<00:05:12.389> my<00:05:13.389> favorite<00:05:13.810> thing

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
but not in the present my favorite thing

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.810 
but not in the present my favorite thing
in<00:05:14.050> the<00:05:14.110> world<00:05:14.290> to<00:05:14.560> do<00:05:14.710> is<00:05:14.919> get<00:05:15.220> out<00:05:15.370> there<00:05:15.639> and

it just it just drives me crazy I'm like
The<00:05:20.590> Exorcist<00:05:20.980> my<00:05:21.160> head<00:05:21.310> starts<00:05:21.639> spinning<00:05:21.700> and

The Exorcist my head starts spinning and

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:30.830 
The Exorcist my head starts spinning and

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.840 

when<00:05:31.380> I'm<00:05:31.530> there<00:05:31.830> on<00:05:31.980> a<00:05:32.010> mountain<00:05:32.400> and<00:05:32.670> I'm

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
when I'm there on a mountain and I'm

when I'm there on a mountain and I'm
sitting<00:05:33.630> in<00:05:33.660> a<00:05:33.810> lineup<00:05:34.050> with<00:05:34.500> even<00:05:35.070> a<00:05:35.130> guy<00:05:35.280> with

sitting in a lineup with even a guy with
two<00:05:35.670> legs<00:05:35.880> I<00:05:36.120> don't<00:05:36.180> feel<00:05:36.450> any<00:05:36.660> different<00:05:37.050> than

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.170 
two legs I don't feel any different than

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.770 
two legs I don't feel any different than
they<00:05:37.350> do<00:05:37.410> I<00:05:37.530> feel<00:05:37.950> exactly<00:05:38.460> the<00:05:38.730> same<00:05:38.850> the<00:05:39.600> only
