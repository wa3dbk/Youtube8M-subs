00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.850 
well I think being in a home that's open
really<00:01:12.010> provides<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.960> a<00:01:13.990> much<00:01:14.170> greater<00:01:14.530> use

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
really provides for a much greater use

of the overall home we spend probably
90%<00:01:17.440> of<00:01:17.770> our<00:01:17.890> time<00:01:18.160> in<00:01:18.490> three<00:01:19.000> rooms<00:01:19.330> whereas
