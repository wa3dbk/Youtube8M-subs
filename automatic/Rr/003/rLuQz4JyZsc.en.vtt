some<00:01:56.610> shedding<00:01:57.060> going<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.479> but<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.719> was<00:01:57.810> just

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
some shedding going on but it was just

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.819 
some shedding going on but it was just
one<00:01:58.649> time<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.700> did<00:01:59.939> have<00:02:00.180> any<00:02:00.570> shutting<00:02:01.200> at

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
one time that I did have any shutting at

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.530 
one time that I did have any shutting at
all<00:02:02.659> I<00:02:03.659> would<00:02:04.259> definitely<00:02:05.009> say<00:02:05.369> about<00:02:06.329> this

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
all I would definitely say about this

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.070 
all I would definitely say about this
hair<00:02:06.750> that

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
hair that

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.230 
hair that
I<00:02:07.110> wish<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.890> would<00:02:08.070> have<00:02:08.190> chose<00:02:08.370> a<00:02:08.670> longer

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
I wish I would have chose a longer

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.620 
I wish I would have chose a longer
closure<00:02:09.660> my<00:02:10.410> closure<00:02:10.710> is<00:02:11.010> actually<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.580> 14<00:02:12.240> inch

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
closure my closure is actually a 14 inch

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.540 
closure my closure is actually a 14 inch
closure<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.590> wish<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:13.980> would<00:02:14.130> have<00:02:14.160> picked<00:02:14.430> a

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
closure and I wish I would have picked a

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.520 
closure and I wish I would have picked a
longer<00:02:14.910> closure<00:02:15.180> because<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:16.050> felt<00:02:16.230> like<00:02:16.290> the

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
longer closure because I felt like the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.840 
longer closure because I felt like the
closure<00:02:16.740> was<00:02:16.980> just<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.220> little<00:02:17.400> bit<00:02:17.610> too<00:02:17.820> short

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
closure was just a little bit too short

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.780 
closure was just a little bit too short
so<00:02:18.630> if<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.840> guys<00:02:18.990> are<00:02:19.230> interested<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:20.250> a

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
so if you guys are interested in a

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.970 
so if you guys are interested in a
closure<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.720> would<00:02:21.900> suggest<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.560> pick<00:02:22.770> a

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
closure I would suggest that you pick a

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.660 
closure I would suggest that you pick a
16<00:02:23.760> or<00:02:23.970> 18<00:02:24.480> inch<00:02:24.750> closure<00:02:25.620> but<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.160> choice<00:02:26.370> is

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
16 or 18 inch closure but the choice is

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.640 
16 or 18 inch closure but the choice is
yours<00:02:26.700> but<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.390> wish<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.960> would<00:02:28.230> have<00:02:28.260> picked<00:02:28.500> a

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
yours but I wish I would have picked a

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.620 
yours but I wish I would have picked a
longer<00:02:29.040> closure<00:02:29.310> but<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:29.970> blend<00:02:30.360> in<00:02:30.600> really

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
longer closure but I blend in really

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.230 
longer closure but I blend in really
really<00:02:31.200> well<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.920> didn't<00:02:32.220> bleach<00:02:32.430> my<00:02:32.640> closure<00:02:32.940> I

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
really well I didn't bleach my closure I

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.090 
really well I didn't bleach my closure I
just<00:02:33.510> added<00:02:33.690> some<00:02:33.840> mineral<00:02:34.380> finishing<00:02:34.830> valve

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
just added some mineral finishing valve

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.670 
just added some mineral finishing valve
onto<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:36.030> did<00:02:36.270> Tweety's<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.320> closure

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
onto it and I did Tweety's the closure

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.040 
onto it and I did Tweety's the closure
just<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.550> closure<00:02:39.150> can<00:02:39.420> be<00:02:39.570> a<00:02:39.600> little<00:02:39.930> bit

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
just so the closure can be a little bit

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.030 
just so the closure can be a little bit
wider<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:40.620> they<00:02:40.890> can<00:02:41.100> match<00:02:41.820> my<00:02:42.330> parting<00:02:43.040> as

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
wider so they can match my parting as

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.970 
wider so they can match my parting as
well<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.970> would<00:02:45.210> say<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.200> have<00:02:46.560> been<00:02:46.710> paying

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
well I would say that I have been paying

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.220 
well I would say that I have been paying
attention<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.610> like<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.240> back<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.050> hair

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
attention to like the back of the hair

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.630 
attention to like the back of the hair
because<00:02:49.410> especially<00:02:49.620> when<00:02:49.920> it's<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.220> wet<00:02:50.460> and

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
because especially when it's a wet and

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.080 
because especially when it's a wet and
wavy<00:02:50.940> or<00:02:51.480> if<00:02:52.320> it's<00:02:52.530> just<00:02:52.680> curly<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.940> know

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
wavy or if it's just curly you know

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.940 
wavy or if it's just curly you know
sometimes<00:02:54.600> it'll<00:02:54.930> get<00:02:55.170> matted<00:02:55.440> up<00:02:55.650> in<00:02:55.860> the

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
sometimes it'll get matted up in the

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.380 
sometimes it'll get matted up in the
back<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.310> start<00:02:56.490> looking<00:02:56.550> like<00:02:56.820> dreadlocks

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
back and start looking like dreadlocks

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.050 
back and start looking like dreadlocks
and<00:02:57.630> I<00:02:57.930> haven't<00:02:58.320> experienced<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.040> at<00:02:59.730> all

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
and I haven't experienced that at all

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.350 
and I haven't experienced that at all
