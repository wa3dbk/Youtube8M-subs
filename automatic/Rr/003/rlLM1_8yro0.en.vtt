00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.570
 Accurate calculation is a quality 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.270
 basic that you friend or friend xerecista 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.130
 you must acquire if you have 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.019
 expectations of success in chess 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.720
 there are countless occasions when 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.850
 we have heard phrases as I could give 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.970
 Checkmate but I was blinded because I had 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.360
 many pieces and moved the horse to 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.070
 defend the bishop but neglect the pawn 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.320
 and many more 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.900
 I consider the subject of calculation as one 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.630
 of the crucial aspects in the process 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.690
 of improvement and therefore I dedicate 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.680
 enough attention when I work with my 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.500
 students 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.440
 a big greeting to all my name is 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.330
 Robert pictures in the first two 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.210
 videos from this series to train the 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.040
 calculation we had concentrated on the 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.510
 color boxes board 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.060
 Chess 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.470
 now we will work with the geometry of the 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.630
 board 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.630
 this new type of exercise has 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.050
 also 12 questions for each 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.870
 question will have 8 seconds before 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.480
 to begin I suggest that you stop the video and 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.150
 look for a sheet of paper and a pencil 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.330
 well while they are responding to the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.010
 questions may be registering the 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.010
 number of hits they got 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.300

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.470
 they enjoyed the exercise 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.930
 I trust each other and also have them 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.330
 gone well with the result 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.310
 but how to know what is a good 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.280
 result 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:04.280
 considered to have eight or more hits 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.380
 it's a good result if they got less 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.380
 of eight successes I encourage you to follow 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:12.530
 practicing the simplest form of 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:15.500
 doing it is between two people one 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:19.330
 mention two boxes and the other says yes 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.330
 they are on the same diagonal or not 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:27.540
 it has been all because of today's video 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.540
 dismisses robert pictures until soon
