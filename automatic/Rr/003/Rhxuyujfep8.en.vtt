00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
to hear it on a riff raff album because

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.300 
to hear it on a riff raff album because
he's<00:04:33.580> nothing<00:04:34.090> if<00:04:34.360> not<00:04:34.590> weirdly<00:04:35.590> unique<00:04:36.040> and

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
he's nothing if not weirdly unique and

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.340 
he's nothing if not weirdly unique and
songs<00:04:37.030> like<00:04:37.240> this<00:04:37.419> just<00:04:37.600> failed<00:04:37.930> to<00:04:38.050> live<00:04:38.320> up
