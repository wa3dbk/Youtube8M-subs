00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
that we want to view were more and

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.620 
that we want to view were more and
volley<00:01:46.860> we've<00:01:47.189> got<00:01:47.340> some<00:01:47.460> notes<00:01:47.729> at<00:01:48.180> bottom

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
volley we've got some notes at bottom

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.600 
volley we've got some notes at bottom
and<00:01:48.810> we<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.470> amend<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.799> just<00:01:50.009> by<00:01:50.159> tapping<00:01:50.369> on

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
and we can amend that just by tapping on

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.080 
and we can amend that just by tapping on
it<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.380> we<00:01:52.380> can<00:01:52.560> into<00:01:53.040> whatever<00:01:53.220> we<00:01:53.399> want<00:01:53.640> we

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
it and we can into whatever we want we

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.969 
it and we can into whatever we want we
can<00:01:54.270> also<00:01:54.420> prioritize<00:01:55.170> them<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.500> well<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:55.890> I've

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
can also prioritize them as well so I've

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.530 
can also prioritize them as well so I've
currently<00:01:56.219> got<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.579> set<00:01:56.850> as<00:01:56.969> high<00:01:57.210> which

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
currently got that set as high which

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.580 
currently got that set as high which
means<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:57.899> going<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.110> be<00:01:58.170> at<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.290> bottom<00:01:58.439> of

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
means it's going to be at the bottom of

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.440 
means it's going to be at the bottom of
the<00:01:58.710> screen<00:01:58.860> but<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.520> wasn't<00:01:59.850> very<00:01:59.909> important

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
the screen but it wasn't very important

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.289 
the screen but it wasn't very important
I<00:02:00.540> could<00:02:00.750> select<00:02:01.200> low<00:02:01.560> or<00:02:01.979> medium<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.790> your

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
I could select low or medium and your

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.840 
I could select low or medium and your
place<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:04.070> I'll<00:02:05.070> place<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.460> either<00:02:05.549> at<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.790> top

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
place it I'll place it either at the top

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.600 
place it I'll place it either at the top
or<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.329> middle<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.310> jumping<00:02:08.310> into<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
or in the middle and jumping into the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.210 
or in the middle and jumping into the
settings<00:02:09.030> we<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:09.959> adjust<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.709> temperature

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
settings we can adjust the temperature

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.840 
settings we can adjust the temperature
so<00:02:11.520> we've<00:02:11.640> got<00:02:11.819> Celsius

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
so we've got Celsius

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.340 
so we've got Celsius
at<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.000> moment<00:02:13.150> we<00:02:13.420> can<00:02:13.600> we<00:02:13.870> can<00:02:14.020> change<00:02:14.170> that

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
at the moment we can we can change that

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.830 
at the moment we can we can change that
to<00:02:14.500> Fahrenheit<00:02:14.920> or<00:02:15.040> Calvin<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:15.670> will<00:02:16.630> also

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
to Fahrenheit or Calvin and will also

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.480 
to Fahrenheit or Calvin and will also
change<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.170> LED<00:02:17.560> color<00:02:17.860> so<00:02:18.130> when<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.400> app

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
change the LED color so when the app

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.490 
change the LED color so when the app
actually<00:02:19.500> resets<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.770> it<00:02:21.760> will<00:02:21.880> flash<00:02:22.180> the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
actually resets and it will flash the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.830 
actually resets and it will flash the
flesh<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.680> LED<00:02:24.430> at<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.970> information<00:02:25.540> I

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
flesh the LED at the information I

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.620 
flesh the LED at the information I
triumph<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:26.610> just<00:02:27.610> by<00:02:27.730> plugging<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.420> face<00:02:28.600> down

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
triumph I just by plugging it face down

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.200 
triumph I just by plugging it face down
I'll<00:02:29.140> reset<00:02:29.560> it<00:02:29.770> and<00:02:29.950> obviously<00:02:30.610> up<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.120> whole

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
I'll reset it and obviously up the whole

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.120 
I'll reset it and obviously up the whole
point<00:02:31.390> of<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:31.660> is<00:02:31.870> that<00:02:31.900> if<00:02:32.830> you're<00:02:33.070> in

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
point of this is that if you're in

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.500 
point of this is that if you're in
meetings<00:02:33.490> that<00:02:33.610> sort<00:02:33.850> of<00:02:33.880> thing<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.150> can<00:02:34.300> kind

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
meetings that sort of thing you can kind

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.090 
meetings that sort of thing you can kind
of<00:02:34.570> tilt<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.900> phone<00:02:35.050> towards<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.710> it

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
of tilt the phone towards you and it

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.530 
of tilt the phone towards you and it
although<00:02:36.520> it<00:02:37.060> will<00:02:37.150> show<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.420> the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
although it will show you the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.120 
although it will show you the
information<00:02:37.750> let's<00:02:38.320> just<00:02:38.500> see<00:02:38.620> well<00:02:38.980> then

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
information let's just see well then

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.720 
information let's just see well then
that<00:02:39.220> resets<00:02:39.700> if<00:02:39.880> it's<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.830> fires<00:02:41.830> off<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.070> LED

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
that resets if it's a fires off the LED

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.050 
that resets if it's a fires off the LED
there<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:45.850> didn't<00:02:46.060> for<00:02:46.210> some<00:02:46.240> reason<00:02:48.060> well

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
there it didn't for some reason well

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.540 
there it didn't for some reason well
anyway<00:02:50.020> I've<00:02:50.080> as<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.350> can<00:02:50.440> see<00:02:50.590> it's<00:02:50.920> it's
