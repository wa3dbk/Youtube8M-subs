00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
way to watch these cards and then you

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.170 
way to watch these cards and then you
double<00:01:11.900> the<00:01:11.960> horsepower<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:12.619> then<00:01:12.799> they<00:01:13.180> you

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
double the horsepower and then they you

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.730 
double the horsepower and then they you
know<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:14.360> get<00:01:14.600> some<00:01:14.840> angry<00:01:15.200> people<00:01:15.530> bashing

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740

each other car to car which you never
get<00:01:17.210> before<00:01:17.570> so<00:01:17.780> it's<00:01:17.900> cool<00:01:18.110> I<00:01:18.770> think<00:01:19.460> it's<00:01:19.580> a

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
get before so it's cool I think it's a

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.220 
get before so it's cool I think it's a
great<00:01:19.790> way<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:20.060> kick<00:01:20.330> start<00:01:20.480> this<00:01:20.780> sport<00:01:21.110> in

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
great way to kick start this sport in

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.220 
great way to kick start this sport in
the<00:01:21.290> States<00:01:22.420> it's<00:01:23.420> kind<00:01:23.570> of<00:01:23.690> like<00:01:23.750> where<00:01:24.110> you

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
the States it's kind of like where you

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.470 
the States it's kind of like where you
have<00:01:24.410> Baja<00:01:25.160> racing<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:25.700> endurance<00:01:26.000> racing

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
have Baja racing and endurance racing

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.250 
have Baja racing and endurance racing
off<00:01:27.470> road<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.880> then<00:01:29.600> you<00:01:29.690> have<00:01:29.840> short<00:01:30.080> course

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
off road and then you have short course

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.870 
off road and then you have short course
racing<00:01:30.590> in<00:01:30.680> stadiums<00:01:31.160> it's<00:01:31.370> two<00:01:31.580> separate

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
racing in stadiums it's two separate

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.850 
racing in stadiums it's two separate
things<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.570> they<00:01:33.050> have<00:01:33.170> a<00:01:33.200> totally<00:01:33.590> different

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
things and they have a totally different

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.990 
things and they have a totally different
flavor<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.340> them<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:34.520> know<00:01:34.580> totally

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
flavor to them you know totally

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.270 
flavor to them you know totally
different<00:01:35.270> field<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:36.440> I<00:01:36.500> think<00:01:36.740> this<00:01:36.920> short

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
different field and I think this short

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.400 
different field and I think this short
course<00:01:37.550> racing<00:01:38.120> is<00:01:38.300> more<00:01:38.570> like<00:01:38.960> an<00:01:39.080> action

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
course racing is more like an action

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.230 
course racing is more like an action
sport<00:01:39.830> and<00:01:40.159> you'll<00:01:40.490> get<00:01:40.580> a<00:01:40.640> lot<00:01:40.760> of<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:40.970> stars

sport and you'll get a lot of the stars

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.390
