00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
low but enough whatever let's start this

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:29.530

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.980 

so<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.690> was<00:01:31.130> pretty<00:01:32.130> loud<00:01:32.340> but<00:01:33.060> go<00:01:33.750> ahead<00:01:33.900> and

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
so it was pretty loud but go ahead and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.960

what<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.180> sounds<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.540> if<00:01:37.200> he's<00:01:37.440> lost<00:01:37.680> on

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
what it sounds like if he's lost on

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:47.090 
what it sounds like if he's lost on
because<00:01:39.300> it<00:01:39.510> does<00:01:40.760> dampen<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:46.470> noise<00:01:46.500> quite<00:01:47.070> a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
