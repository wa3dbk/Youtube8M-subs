hi<00:00:14.170> guys<00:00:14.410> welcome<00:00:14.680> again<00:00:16.920> here<00:00:17.920> is<00:00:18.100> a<00:00:18.960> small

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
hi guys welcome again here is a small

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.490 
hi guys welcome again here is a small
project<00:00:20.170> I<00:00:20.560> made<00:00:21.509> recharge<00:00:22.509> my<00:00:25.349> what's<00:00:26.349> this

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
project I made recharge my what's this

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.530 
project I made recharge my what's this
12<00:00:26.890> volt<00:00:27.210> battery<00:00:28.210> packed<00:00:28.630> yeah<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:31.029> seems<00:00:31.390> to

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
12 volt battery packed yeah it seems to

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.670 
12 volt battery packed yeah it seems to
be<00:00:31.570> working<00:00:32.079> well<00:00:32.370> although<00:00:33.570> as<00:00:34.570> I<00:00:34.840> said<00:00:35.110> with

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
be working well although as I said with

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.549 
be working well although as I said with
the<00:00:36.030> rechargeables<00:00:37.030> they<00:00:37.239> don't<00:00:37.450> really<00:00:37.870> go

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
the rechargeables they don't really go

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.290 
the rechargeables they don't really go
up<00:00:38.590> to<00:00:38.890> 12<00:00:39.190> volts<00:00:39.700> and<00:00:41.309> maximum<00:00:42.309> I<00:00:42.460> was<00:00:42.760> able<00:00:43.270> to

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
up to 12 volts and maximum I was able to

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.990 
up to 12 volts and maximum I was able to
get<00:00:43.540> was<00:00:43.750> eleven<00:00:44.199> point<00:00:44.469> 42<00:00:45.100> volts<00:00:45.550> on<00:00:45.730> this

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
get was eleven point 42 volts on this

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.229 
get was eleven point 42 volts on this
but<00:00:46.300> it<00:00:46.449> works<00:00:46.750> fine<00:00:46.989> for<00:00:47.350> my<00:00:47.699> for<00:00:48.699> my<00:00:48.730> other

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
but it works fine for my for my other

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.520 
but it works fine for my for my other
projects<00:00:50.429> especially<00:00:51.429> the<00:00:51.609> ones<00:00:51.899> if<00:00:52.899> you've

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
projects especially the ones if you've

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.139 
projects especially the ones if you've
been<00:00:53.710> following<00:00:53.920> my<00:00:54.190> video<00:00:54.670> I've<00:00:54.789> been<00:00:54.940> using

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
been following my video I've been using

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.229 
been following my video I've been using
this<00:00:55.420> battery<00:00:55.929> pack<00:00:56.280> although<00:00:57.280> I<00:00:57.309> do<00:00:57.460> have<00:00:57.820> the

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
this battery pack although I do have the

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.610 
this battery pack although I do have the
6<00:00:58.870> volt<00:00:59.140> here<00:00:59.530> and<00:00:59.769> a<00:01:00.370> 12<00:01:00.670> volt<00:01:00.730> over<00:01:01.239> there

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
6 volt here and a 12 volt over there

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.619 
6 volt here and a 12 volt over there
this<00:01:02.620> one<00:01:02.920> is<00:01:02.949> easier<00:01:03.609> to<00:01:03.640> put<00:01:03.969> inside<00:01:04.420> the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
this one is easier to put inside the

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.010 
this one is easier to put inside the
case<00:01:04.930> rather<00:01:05.350> than<00:01:05.590> those<00:01:06.490> two<00:01:06.880> anyway<00:01:07.659> this

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
case rather than those two anyway this

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.880 
case rather than those two anyway this
is<00:01:08.230> a<00:01:08.260> 6<00:01:08.740> cell<00:01:09.900> solar<00:01:10.900> panel<00:01:11.530> which<00:01:11.680> I've

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
is a 6 cell solar panel which I've

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.540 
is a 6 cell solar panel which I've
assembled<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.570> I<00:01:14.229> place<00:01:14.530> it<00:01:14.710> in<00:01:14.830> a<00:01:14.950> sturdy

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
assembled and I place it in a sturdy

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.580 
assembled and I place it in a sturdy
case<00:01:18.630> epoxy<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:20.490> do<00:01:21.490> it<00:01:21.670> so<00:01:22.510> it<00:01:22.600> one<00:01:22.810> won't<00:01:23.320> come

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
case epoxy to do it so it one won't come

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.630 
case epoxy to do it so it one won't come
off<00:01:23.620> using<00:01:24.010> just<00:01:24.370> jb<00:01:24.820> weld<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:25.630> of<00:01:26.290> course

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
off using just jb weld and of course

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.410 
off using just jb weld and of course
this<00:01:27.640> is<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:27.940> connector<00:01:29.250> for<00:01:30.250> my<00:01:30.490> battery

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
this is the connector for my battery

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.139 
this is the connector for my battery
pack<00:01:31.470> over<00:01:32.470> here

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:42.010 

and<00:01:36.820> there's<00:01:37.820> my<00:01:39.640> connectors<00:01:40.640> but<00:01:41.600> what's

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
and there's my connectors but what's

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.840 
and there's my connectors but what's
important<00:01:42.590> here<00:01:42.829> is<00:01:42.890> there<00:01:43.340> should<00:01:43.579> be<00:01:43.729> a<00:01:43.759> diet

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
important here is there should be a diet

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.899 
important here is there should be a diet
from<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.090> solar<00:01:47.359> cell<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:48.729> there<00:01:49.729> should

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
from the solar cell and there should

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.889 
from the solar cell and there should
also<00:01:50.119> be<00:01:50.299> a<00:01:50.420> diode<00:01:50.719> going<00:01:51.619> in<00:01:52.299> to<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.420> battery

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
also be a diode going in to the battery

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.880 
also be a diode going in to the battery
pack<00:01:53.929> because<00:01:54.590> once<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:56.590> daylight<00:01:57.590> are

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
pack because once the daylight are

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.590 
pack because once the daylight are
there's<00:01:58.189> no<00:01:58.369> more<00:01:58.579> Sun<00:02:00.579> the<00:02:01.579> solar<00:02:01.789> cells<00:02:02.240> have

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
there's no more Sun the solar cells have

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.359 
there's no more Sun the solar cells have
a<00:02:02.630> penchant<00:02:03.319> for<00:02:04.209> sucking<00:02:05.209> up<00:02:05.329> the<00:02:05.479> power<00:02:05.750> that

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
a penchant for sucking up the power that

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.620 
a penchant for sucking up the power that
placed<00:02:07.369> into<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.119> battery<00:02:08.750> pack<00:02:09.049> okay<00:02:10.450> if<00:02:11.450> you

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
placed into the battery pack okay if you

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.569 
placed into the battery pack okay if you
will<00:02:11.780> see<00:02:11.959> some<00:02:12.170> videos<00:02:12.709> youtube<00:02:12.950> videos

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579

basically<00:03:14.170> works<00:03:14.440> is<00:03:15.190> that<00:03:15.430> when<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:17.560> Sun

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
basically works is that when the Sun

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.520 
basically works is that when the Sun
hits<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.280> solar<00:03:18.870> panels<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.730> red<00:03:21.730> light<00:03:22.000> the

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
hits the solar panels the red light the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.590 
hits the solar panels the red light the
light<00:03:23.530> turns<00:03:24.040> on<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:26.410> do<00:03:26.590> need<00:03:26.770> to<00:03:27.600> adjust

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
light turns on you do need to adjust

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:35.930 
light turns on you do need to adjust
this<00:03:29.140> based<00:03:29.410> on<00:03:29.650> what<00:03:29.770> the<00:03:31.320> original<00:03:32.430> author

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.570 

on<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.830> required<00:03:38.830> voltage<00:03:40.440> by<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.500> 5<00:03:41.800> 5<00:03:42.010> 5<00:03:42.280> -

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
on the required voltage by the 5 5 5 -

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.220 
on the required voltage by the 5 5 5 -
10<00:03:42.820> hit<00:03:43.150> on<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.540> ten<00:03:43.960> point<00:03:44.200> nine<00:03:44.320> volts<00:03:44.500> and<00:03:46.230> if

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
10 hit on a ten point nine volts and if

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.460 
10 hit on a ten point nine volts and if
the<00:03:47.410> solar<00:03:47.620> panel<00:03:48.160> which<00:03:48.370> doesn't<00:03:48.850> really<00:03:49.060> go

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
the solar panel which doesn't really go

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.500 
the solar panel which doesn't really go
all<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.920> way<00:03:50.950> up<00:03:51.400> to<00:03:53.400> 15<00:03:54.400> point<00:03:54.700> 4<00:03:54.940> volts<00:03:55.000> with

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
all the way up to 15 point 4 volts with

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.310 
all the way up to 15 point 4 volts with
a<00:03:55.540> load<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.830> green<00:03:57.130> if<00:03:57.970> it<00:03:58.360> goes<00:03:58.630> over<00:03:58.870> that

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
a load the green if it goes over that

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.460 
a load the green if it goes over that
one<00:03:59.680> will<00:04:00.310> just<00:04:00.910> dump<00:04:01.240> the<00:04:02.160> dump<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.370> excess

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
one will just dump the dump the excess

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.990 
one will just dump the dump the excess
when<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.620> religious<00:04:06.190> clicks<00:04:06.490> to<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.850> other

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
when the religious clicks to the other

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.410 
when the religious clicks to the other
side<00:04:07.330> and<00:04:07.630> there's<00:04:08.380> nothing<00:04:08.800> on<00:04:09.280> that<00:04:09.340> part<00:04:10.300> of

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
side and there's nothing on that part of

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.790 
side and there's nothing on that part of
the<00:04:10.480> relay<00:04:11.260> actually<00:04:12.510> or<00:04:13.510> if<00:04:14.290> you<00:04:14.440> want<00:04:14.680> a

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
the relay actually or if you want a

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.590 
the relay actually or if you want a
dummy<00:04:15.040> load<00:04:15.280> for<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:15.760> testing<00:04:16.270> for<00:04:16.480> the

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
dummy load for the testing for the

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:24.560 
dummy load for the testing for the
turbine<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:19.630> author<00:04:22.470> said<00:04:23.470> that<00:04:23.500> if<00:04:23.950> you

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
turbine the the author said that if you

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:32.100 
turbine the the author said that if you
use<00:04:25.570> a<00:04:25.960> car<00:04:26.880> really<00:04:28.830> this<00:04:30.780> solar<00:04:31.780> charge

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
use a car really this solar charge

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.560 
use a car really this solar charge
controller<00:04:32.620> is<00:04:33.460> capable<00:04:34.090> up<00:04:34.420> to<00:04:34.810> 40<00:04:35.200> amps

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
controller is capable up to 40 amps

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.990 
controller is capable up to 40 amps
right<00:04:38.080> now<00:04:38.290> this<00:04:38.740> is<00:04:38.800> only<00:04:39.190> in<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.490> melee<00:04:39.730> air

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
right now this is only in the melee air

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.360 
right now this is only in the melee air
so<00:04:40.360> I'm<00:04:41.139> not<00:04:41.500> too<00:04:41.710> worried<00:04:42.100> about<00:04:44.370> this

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
so I'm not too worried about this

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.580 
so I'm not too worried about this
particular<00:04:46.000> circuit<00:04:46.419> overheating<00:04:47.169> right<00:04:47.350> now

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
particular circuit overheating right now

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.629 
particular circuit overheating right now
it<00:04:48.310> does<00:04:48.669> charge<00:04:49.060> the<00:04:49.960> battery<00:04:50.350> pack<00:04:50.650> but<00:04:51.040> it

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
it does charge the battery pack but it

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.340 
it does charge the battery pack but it
takes<00:04:52.120> quite<00:04:52.510> some<00:04:52.810> time

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
takes quite some time

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.560 
takes quite some time
I've<00:04:53.740> tried<00:04:53.980> to<00:04:54.190> discharge<00:04:54.790> it<00:04:55.030> all<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.450> way

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
I've tried to discharge it all the way

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.560 
I've tried to discharge it all the way
down<00:04:55.600> to<00:04:56.139> 9<00:04:56.350> volts<00:04:56.380> and<00:04:57.280> it<00:04:57.790> brought<00:04:58.030> it<00:04:58.210> up<00:04:58.389> to

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
down to 9 volts and it brought it up to

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.920 
down to 9 volts and it brought it up to
11<00:04:58.990> point<00:04:59.260> for<00:04:59.530> at<00:04:59.710> the<00:04:59.860> moment<00:05:00.510> this<00:05:01.510> was<00:05:01.750> the

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
11 point for at the moment this was the

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.300 
11 point for at the moment this was the
wool<00:05:02.139> day<00:05:02.350> actually<00:05:03.010> so<00:05:04.290> it<00:05:05.290> should<00:05:05.530> go<00:05:05.740> higher

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
wool day actually so it should go higher

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.940 
wool day actually so it should go higher
if<00:05:07.060> I<00:05:07.300> recharge<00:05:07.720> it<00:05:07.900> again<00:05:08.020> tomorrow

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
if I recharge it again tomorrow

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.620 
if I recharge it again tomorrow
all<00:05:09.430> right<00:05:09.669> now<00:05:09.850> I'm<00:05:10.030> using<00:05:10.240> the<00:05:10.510> other

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
all right now I'm using the other

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.020 
all right now I'm using the other
batteries<00:05:11.200> for<00:05:11.940> some<00:05:12.940> other<00:05:14.100> tests<00:05:15.100> but<00:05:15.880> then

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
batteries for some other tests but then

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.719 
batteries for some other tests but then
again<00:05:16.150> there's<00:05:16.660> your<00:05:17.370> solar<00:05:18.370> charge

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
again there's your solar charge

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:23.219 
again there's your solar charge
controller<00:05:19.240> which<00:05:19.870> I've<00:05:20.380> replicated<00:05:21.450> and<00:05:22.450> of

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
controller which I've replicated and of

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.230 
controller which I've replicated and of
course<00:05:23.470> don't<00:05:23.590> forget<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:24.100> diodes<00:05:24.550> over<00:05:24.910> here

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
course don't forget the diodes over here

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.150 
course don't forget the diodes over here
one<00:05:25.950> as<00:05:26.950> if<00:05:27.160> as<00:05:27.490> the<00:05:27.930> voltage<00:05:28.930> from<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:29.800> solar

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
one as if as the voltage from the solar

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.360 
one as if as the voltage from the solar
panel<00:05:30.580> goes<00:05:30.790> here<00:05:31.090> and<00:05:31.300> one<00:05:32.110> as<00:05:32.650> the<00:05:32.889> voltage

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
panel goes here and one as the voltage

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.480 
panel goes here and one as the voltage
goes<00:05:33.820> in<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:35.380> battery<00:05:35.800> pack<00:05:36.180> all<00:05:37.180> right

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
goes in the battery pack all right

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.310 
goes in the battery pack all right
hope<00:05:39.490> I<00:05:39.639> don't<00:05:39.970> forget<00:05:40.180> to<00:05:40.479> post<00:05:40.690> a<00:05:40.900> link<00:05:41.080> on

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
hope I don't forget to post a link on

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.810 
hope I don't forget to post a link on
that<00:05:42.300> have<00:05:43.300> a<00:05:43.330> nice<00:05:43.600> day
