to be in episode 4 and it's really fun
and<00:00:35.650> cute<00:00:35.920> and<00:00:36.250> similar<00:00:36.610> to<00:00:36.760> what<00:00:36.880> we<00:00:36.970> had<00:00:37.090> on

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
and cute and similar to what we had on

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.190 
and cute and similar to what we had on
arrow<00:00:37.450> and<00:00:37.810> there's<00:00:38.530> a<00:00:38.620> lot<00:00:38.829> more<00:00:39.130> of<00:00:39.280> it<00:00:39.960> but<00:00:40.960> I

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
arrow and there's a lot more of it but I

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.720 
arrow and there's a lot more of it but I
don't<00:00:41.260> think<00:00:41.590> that's<00:00:41.829> really<00:00:42.190> gonna<00:00:42.310> go<00:00:42.670> too

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
don't think that's really gonna go too

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.780 
don't think that's really gonna go too
much<00:00:43.060> further<00:00:43.329> right<00:00:43.570> now<00:00:43.690> because<00:00:43.900> I<00:00:44.790> Barry's

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
much further right now because I Barry's

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.610 
much further right now because I Barry's
in<00:00:45.820> love<00:00:46.060> with<00:00:46.180> Iris<00:00:46.360> but<00:00:46.899> like<00:00:47.110> I<00:00:47.230> said<00:00:47.290> that

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
in love with Iris but like I said that

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.500 
in love with Iris but like I said that
can't<00:00:47.950> happen<00:00:48.220> either<00:00:48.579> so<00:00:49.000> I<00:00:49.030> don't<00:00:49.360> think

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
can't happen either so I don't think

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.200 
can't happen either so I don't think
love<00:00:50.230> is<00:00:50.260> really<00:00:51.130> gonna<00:00:51.340> be<00:00:51.550> something<00:00:51.790> that's

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
love is really gonna be something that's

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.450 
love is really gonna be something that's
I<00:00:52.540> think<00:00:52.930> it's<00:00:53.050> mostly<00:00:53.440> just<00:00:53.530> haunting<00:00:54.280> him

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
I think it's mostly just haunting him

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.760 
I think it's mostly just haunting him
since

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770

haven't really gotten into it yet I mean
he<00:01:42.490> I<00:01:43.060> think<00:01:43.750> our<00:01:44.050> experiences<00:01:44.710> are<00:01:44.800> gonna<00:01:44.950> be

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
he I think our experiences are gonna be

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.219 
he I think our experiences are gonna be
really<00:01:45.250> different<00:01:45.550> so<00:01:46.060> I<00:01:46.090> don't<00:01:46.479> he<00:01:47.020> hasn't

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
really different so I don't he hasn't

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.420 
really different so I don't he hasn't
really<00:01:47.380> giving<00:01:47.619> me<00:01:47.680> too<00:01:47.800> much<00:01:47.830> advice<00:01:48.159> but

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
really giving me too much advice but

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.950 
really giving me too much advice but
he's<00:01:48.759> definitely<00:01:48.970> there<00:01:49.300> for<00:01:49.509> me<00:01:49.600> I<00:01:49.630> think<00:01:49.750> if

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
he's definitely there for me I think if

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.930 
he's definitely there for me I think if
I<00:01:50.020> ever<00:01:50.140> needed<00:01:50.440> any<00:01:50.710> he<00:01:51.190> would<00:01:51.430> willingly

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
I ever needed any he would willingly

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.310 
I ever needed any he would willingly
give<00:01:52.360> it

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.230 

yeah<00:01:57.320> is<00:01:57.620> I<00:01:57.800> mean<00:01:58.010> Henry's<00:01:58.820> been<00:01:58.970> locked<00:01:59.150> away

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
yeah is I mean Henry's been locked away

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.850 
yeah is I mean Henry's been locked away
for<00:01:59.360> 14<00:01:59.870> years<00:02:00.080> and<00:02:00.229> I<00:02:00.380> think<00:02:00.440> he's<00:02:00.680> probably

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
for 14 years and I think he's probably

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.520 
for 14 years and I think he's probably
Barry's<00:02:01.580> visit<00:02:01.880> him<00:02:02.000> visited<00:02:02.990> him<00:02:03.170> probably

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
Barry's visit him visited him probably

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.440 
Barry's visit him visited him probably
on<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:03.890> weekly<00:02:04.310> basis<00:02:04.700> I<00:02:04.880> would<00:02:04.940> imagine<00:02:05.180> at

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
on a weekly basis I would imagine at

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.440 
on a weekly basis I would imagine at
least<00:02:06.280> so<00:02:07.280> I<00:02:07.310> mean<00:02:07.610> Henry<00:02:07.760> hasn't<00:02:08.179> been<00:02:08.300> able

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
least so I mean Henry hasn't been able

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.350 
least so I mean Henry hasn't been able
to<00:02:08.630> provide<00:02:08.929> much<00:02:09.350> to<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.039> relationship<00:02:10.640> but

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
to provide much to the relationship but

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.630 
to provide much to the relationship but
Joe's<00:02:12.200> been<00:02:12.500> pretty<00:02:12.800> incredible<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.490> them

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
Joe's been pretty incredible to them

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.699 
Joe's been pretty incredible to them
over<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.150> years<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:14.600> now<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.380> Barry<00:02:15.560> has

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
over the years and now that Barry has

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.980 
over the years and now that Barry has
these<00:02:15.860> powers<00:02:16.280> Joe's<00:02:17.180> kind<00:02:17.570> they're<00:02:17.780> kind<00:02:17.959> of

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
these powers Joe's kind they're kind of

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.780 
these powers Joe's kind they're kind of
butting<00:02:18.290> heads<00:02:18.320> because<00:02:19.100> Joe<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.430> trying<00:02:19.730> to

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
butting heads because Joe is trying to

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.060 
butting heads because Joe is trying to
keep<00:02:19.910> him<00:02:20.030> safe<00:02:20.320> but<00:02:21.320> Barry<00:02:21.560> wants<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:21.950> keep

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
keep him safe but Barry wants to keep

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.949 
keep him safe but Barry wants to keep
the<00:02:22.160> city<00:02:22.400> safe<00:02:22.490> and<00:02:22.970> those<00:02:23.120> two<00:02:23.360> things<00:02:23.630> don't

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
the city safe and those two things don't

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.440 
the city safe and those two things don't
go<00:02:24.140> hand-in-hand

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
go hand-in-hand

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.020 
go hand-in-hand
yeah<00:02:26.450> but<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:26.810> think<00:02:26.959> he's<00:02:27.140> got<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:28.030> great

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
yeah but I think he's got a great

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.760 
yeah but I think he's got a great
relationship<00:02:29.630> with<00:02:29.750> both<00:02:29.810> both<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.380> them<00:02:30.650> as

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
relationship with both both of them as

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.590 
relationship with both both of them as
much<00:02:30.920> as<00:02:31.160> as<00:02:31.580> good<00:02:31.760> as<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.090> could<00:02:32.150> possibly<00:02:32.330> be

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
much as as good as it could possibly be

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.199 
much as as good as it could possibly be
with<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.050> past<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.530> he<00:02:33.739> has<00:02:33.950> how<00:02:34.910> much<00:02:35.030> do

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
with the past that he has how much do

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.699 
with the past that he has how much do
you<00:02:35.270> enjoy<00:02:35.330> playing<00:02:35.690> what<00:02:36.170> really<00:02:36.350> seems<00:02:36.590> to

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
you enjoy playing what really seems to

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.220 
you enjoy playing what really seems to
be<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:37.100> like<00:02:37.370> brighter<00:02:37.730> more<00:02:38.480> optimistic<00:02:39.050> happy

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
be a like brighter more optimistic happy

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.110 
be a like brighter more optimistic happy
or<00:02:39.500> superhero<00:02:39.920> that<00:02:40.100> I<00:02:40.190> think<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.790> lot<00:02:40.910> of

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
or superhero that I think a lot of

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.670 
or superhero that I think a lot of
people<00:02:41.360> are<00:02:41.690> used<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.870> seeing<00:02:41.930> I'd<00:02:42.320> like<00:02:42.500> that

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
people are used to seeing I'd like that

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.350 
people are used to seeing I'd like that
yeah<00:02:42.830> yeah<00:02:42.860> it's<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.670> only<00:02:43.940> reason<00:02:44.239> I'm

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
yeah yeah it's the only reason I'm

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.640 
yeah yeah it's the only reason I'm
playing<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.720> role<00:02:44.750> I<00:02:44.930> think<00:02:45.140> if<00:02:45.380> it<00:02:45.500> was<00:02:45.620> a

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
playing the role I think if it was a

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.729 
playing the role I think if it was a
darker<00:02:46.130> show<00:02:46.340> they<00:02:46.640> wouldn't<00:02:47.239> be<00:02:47.360> me<00:02:47.570> so<00:02:48.019> I'm

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
darker show they wouldn't be me so I'm

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.320 
darker show they wouldn't be me so I'm
loving<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.280> that's<00:02:49.519> it's<00:02:49.910> like<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:50.120> said

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
loving it that's it's like I said

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.690 
loving it that's it's like I said
someone<00:02:50.570> wasn't<00:02:50.720> at<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.900> job<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:51.470> I'm<00:02:52.070> having

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
someone wasn't at the job so I'm having

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.160 
someone wasn't at the job so I'm having
more<00:02:52.910> fun<00:02:53.090> than<00:02:53.269> I've<00:02:53.390> ever<00:02:53.420> had<00:02:53.600> and

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
more fun than I've ever had and

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.320 
more fun than I've ever had and
hopefully<00:02:54.980> that<00:02:55.130> comes<00:02:55.340> through<00:02:55.640> because<00:02:55.970> I

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
hopefully that comes through because I

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.140
