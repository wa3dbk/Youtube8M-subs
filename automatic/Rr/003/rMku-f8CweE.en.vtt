00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.490 
think Mac vanilla pigment or any kind of
like<00:02:22.220> shimmery<00:02:22.700> vanilla<00:02:23.390> color<00:02:23.810> will<00:02:24.260> work

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.170 
like shimmery vanilla color will work
you<00:02:24.530> don't<00:02:24.800> have<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.130> use<00:02:25.250> all<00:02:25.459> that<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.000> map

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
you don't have to use all that the map

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.259 
you don't have to use all that the map
to<00:02:26.390> 22<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:28.569> just<00:02:29.569> applying<00:02:30.080> that<00:02:31.209> as<00:02:32.209> a

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
to 22 and just applying that as a

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.509 
to 22 and just applying that as a
highlight<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.110> just<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.470> blend<00:02:33.950> out<00:02:34.280> those

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
highlight and just to blend out those

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.670 
highlight and just to blend out those
colors<00:02:34.940> now<00:02:35.450> this<00:02:35.660> one<00:02:35.870> doesn't<00:02:36.380> look<00:02:36.500> quite

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
colors now this one doesn't look quite

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.650 
colors now this one doesn't look quite
as<00:02:36.769> dark<00:02:37.190> but<00:02:37.940> that's<00:02:38.180> because<00:02:38.330> I<00:02:38.510> have<00:02:38.630> a

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
as dark but that's because I have a

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.809 
as dark but that's because I have a
window<00:02:39.050> like<00:02:39.200> right<00:02:39.650> here<00:02:40.040> on<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.310> side<00:02:40.550> and

window like right here on the side and

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.680 
window like right here on the side and
it<00:02:41.720> just<00:02:41.989> kind<00:02:42.200> of<00:02:42.260> lightens<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:43.069> look<00:02:43.459> on<00:02:43.760> the
