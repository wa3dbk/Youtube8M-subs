00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 you can say to erviti on my part is a 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.410
 extraordinary player that we were 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.300
 talking about that says fernando we're going to 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.450
 do one thing fernando look i have 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.460
 two headphones I'm going to pass 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.800
 let him put it on and he's listening to you 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.170
 the extraordinary player who today 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.090
 broke we talked with him fernando no 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.650
 greet you erviti health members do not 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.189
 I was telling miguel silva to do 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.330
 the report that your task today has been 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.980
 extraordinary because not only did you leave 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.410
 over the most important player 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.399
 they had them but they gave many hands 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.350
 and when playing 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.989
 played with riquelme a first time 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.079
 exceptional to tell you that you 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.480
 said bianchi good 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.280
 Carlos asked me for a very simple function 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.579
 is that the game did not interest him that much 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.979
 I play like he does not play 88 of 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.379
 rival team believed that the team of 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:58.679
 them a lot was based on the game of 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.869
 Pauline at a show that was not 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.879
 they are used but as always 

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:04.289
 I say is not the most important thing is the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.990
 team and one tries to do what the 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:08.729
 technician asks you to work but there 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.770
 is the extraordinary thing that a player of 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.200
 your conditions of your abilities that 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.000
 you are to build the game have that 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.340
 sacrifice that asks you in a 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.380
 certain thing and ball do and in addition 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.030
 you have the rest to play that's what 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.039
 good and for me the extraordinary thing of a 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.179
 player like you is fernando that the 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.799
 things that one says have them that 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:27.090
 demonstrate on the court I can 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.170
 fill your mouth saying that the team is 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.610
 important that always the most important 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.280
 is the equipment but if at the time I 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.509
 They ask for different function is not try 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.220
 fulfill it surely serves nothing 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.259
 so I prefer to talk inside the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.120
 cadence as appropriate and always 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.340
 thinking about the benefit of voice 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.310
 they played a very good first half 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.800
 thought they did not block it they drowned it 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.780
 they let him play and they had room to 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.400
 you when everyone around here 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.240
 I thought it was going to be a waterspout 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.610
 Corinthian mouth reduced it to current as 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.030
 He tied up and could not play there. 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.470
 really this victory if we do not 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.150
 we did that, surely we were going up 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.680
 to overcome and we would enter by 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.480
 Everywhere is a great team with 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.190
 great players we had to 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.280
 make a perfect match like what 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.680
 we did very carefully and thanks to 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.150
 God came out very good very well today they have 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.650
 appeared the great players who 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.110
 has no mouth because they came in the 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.390
 local championship fallen but both in the 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.340
 leg like today mouth can 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.870
 stay calm that has players 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.030
 of a large span of a large 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.390
 professionalism and they gave again 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.010
 a lesson we are happy we have 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.680
 exceeded what we were doing and that 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.750
 was what we wanted, Miguel completes the 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.850
 note chau allowing to greet him 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.030

 thank you to send a big greeting to 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.160

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.750
