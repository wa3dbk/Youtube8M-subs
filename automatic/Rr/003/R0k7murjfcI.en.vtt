Jabra<00:00:25.500> SP<00:00:25.859> 700<00:00:26.400> speakerphone<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.480> pretty<00:00:27.900> much

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
Jabra SP 700 speakerphone so pretty much

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.599 
Jabra SP 700 speakerphone so pretty much
it's<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.230> speakerphone<00:00:28.529> bluth<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.220> enabled<00:00:29.550> for

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
it's a speakerphone bluth is enabled for

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.460 
it's a speakerphone bluth is enabled for
your<00:00:29.910> car<00:00:30.150> but<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.140> little<00:00:31.320> different

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
your car but it's a little different

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.810 
your car but it's a little different
than<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.710> ones<00:00:31.859> you're<00:00:31.949> gonna<00:00:32.040> see<00:00:32.309> elsewhere

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
than the ones you're gonna see elsewhere

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.600 
than the ones you're gonna see elsewhere
for<00:00:33.780> several<00:00:34.079> reasons<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> first<00:00:34.860> one<00:00:35.399> being

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
for several reasons the first one being

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.000 
for several reasons the first one being
its<00:00:36.030> noise<00:00:36.239> cancelling<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.960> echo<00:00:37.559> canceling

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
its noise cancelling and echo canceling

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.139 
its noise cancelling and echo canceling
so<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.280> kills<00:00:38.430> all<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.640> background<00:00:39.000> noise<00:00:39.120> and

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
so it kills all the background noise and

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.540 
so it kills all the background noise and
it<00:00:39.450> kills<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.920> speakerphone<00:00:40.920> echo<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.489> you

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
it kills that speakerphone echo so you

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.680 
it kills that speakerphone echo so you
won't<00:00:41.700> get<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.850> trouble<00:00:41.940> when<00:00:42.300> people<00:00:42.329> know

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
won't get in trouble when people know

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.670 
won't get in trouble when people know
that<00:00:42.780> you're<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.020> they're<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:43.320> speakerphone

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
that you're on they're on speakerphone

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.650 
that you're on they're on speakerphone
the<00:00:44.640> other<00:00:44.789> thing<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.149> does<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.450> has<00:00:45.629> a

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
the other thing that it does is it has a

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.010 
the other thing that it does is it has a
built-in<00:00:46.020> FM<00:00:46.320> transmitter<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.789> if<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.719> have

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
built-in FM transmitter so if you have

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.740 
built-in FM transmitter so if you have
let's<00:00:49.649> say<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.860> Bluetooth<00:00:50.430> phone<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.000> if<00:00:51.510> it's

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
let's say a Bluetooth phone and if it's

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.639 
let's say a Bluetooth phone and if it's
a2dp<00:00:52.680> enabled<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.120> take<00:00:55.020> your<00:00:55.140> music<00:00:55.260> and

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
a2dp enabled you can take your music and

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.500 
a2dp enabled you can take your music and
blast<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.129> over<00:00:56.280> your<00:00:56.399> spirit<00:00:56.670> speakers<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.390> in

the<00:00:57.629> car<00:00:57.840> through<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.410> or<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:59.430> can<00:00:59.550> also

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
the car through this or you can also

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.889 
the car through this or you can also
talk<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.180> speaker<00:01:00.420> phone<00:01:00.600> through<00:01:00.870> bluetooth

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
talk on speaker phone through bluetooth

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.740 
talk on speaker phone through bluetooth
to<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.649> phone<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.190> output<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.510> know<00:01:03.600> the

pretty<00:01:14.549> important<00:01:14.970> now<00:01:15.360> there's<00:01:15.570> two<00:01:15.720> ways<00:01:15.750> to

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
pretty important now there's two ways to

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.510 
pretty important now there's two ways to
charge<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.290> thing<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:17.100> gives<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.340> both

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.510 
charge this thing and it gives you both
methods<00:01:18.060> one<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.390> with<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.780> USB<00:01:19.259> cable<00:01:19.950> very

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
methods one is with a USB cable very

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.280 
methods one is with a USB cable very
simple<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.090> then<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.689> other<00:01:21.840> one<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
simple and then the other one is the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.929 
simple and then the other one is the
power<00:01:22.470> adapter<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.220> case<00:01:23.369> your<00:01:23.490> never

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
power adapter so in case your never

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.130 
power adapter so in case your never
leaves<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.270> car<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.540> don't<00:01:24.630> never<00:01:24.810> take<00:01:25.020> it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
leaves the car you don't never take it

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.840 
leaves the car you don't never take it
out<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.890> your<00:01:26.009> power<00:01:26.189> adapter<00:01:26.369> which<00:01:26.670> is

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
out this is your power adapter which is
