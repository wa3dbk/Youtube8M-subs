00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.820
 four times with children 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.180
 that also you to the channel because I bring you 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:18.770
 the next a boxing that is the one of 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.720
 another clock is the polygon road take out the 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.640
 same as the previous one or what was the 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.009
 space of leeds is from the clocks of 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.919
 tokyo flash of bread that I already trolero that 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.990
 Japanese company from Japan 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.759
 or else the obvious as I said good as 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.329
 than the previous clock that we have it for 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.760
 here and this other what our hormones 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.280
 friends tokyoflash is edition see what 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.800
 it's called polygon in the model here is 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.530
 the way to read the clock here in the 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.120
 instructive how is all this not 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.830
 forget all the watches with 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.380
 instructive because this is a 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:55.240
 little bit more complicated here is the 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.240
 watch and let's get it out 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.820
 but the truth is that he is very very father 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.850
 It is also made of stainless steel 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.520
 extendable this is flexible too 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.940
 they can also move it should be 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.010
 several sizes and this one will shine more 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.200
 that the other whom color does not like is 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.330
 black color this is what your color is like 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.760
 silver or acb color shines a lot more 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.220
 same in the back more and it 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.250
 Come up, know how to laugh and help me 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.390
 ay sb because the back has the 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.370
 name of usaid for you and has a polygon 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.700
 which is the model of the clock 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.130
 to read the time of the clock what has 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.630
 what to do is what is done here is reached 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.150
 see I hope that if it's new it puts a 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.880
 picture here there are just two 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.590
 tiny little triangles like crashing 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.400
 one with another where the one collides with the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.710
 other 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.470
 there it marks the clock time therefore 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.080
 Now he's dialing 10 if 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.450
 they were here we have marked the 987 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.700
 so not now we are here 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.500
 encompassing 10 after there is another 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.020
 triangle down here by that is 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.080
 polygon for new shapes and there's no 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.280
 another here below that at this moment is 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.500
 dialing 20 in the two minutes go by 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.770
 10 councilors do not go from 5 in 5 as 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.600
 we are usually used 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.270
 then it's spanning 20 so 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.760
 we would already have 10 plus 20 from here 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.549
 down 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.519
 but to know exactly electoral 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:31.760
 that we go in this part of the center has 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:34.040
 another number that at this moment I think that 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.579
 is the 5 you get to see there by the 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:41.209
 s5 lines if those 5 and this is marking 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:43.519
 the 5 therefore we have 10 20 5 boys 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:48.500
 that's how you see the time of this rodent 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:51.349
 and you write like the original of those 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.109
 boys and of them outside in what is 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.290
 very father talk to you one back 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.290
 uy 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:06.019
 The steel extensibles completely 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.910
 this one is polished therefore it shines very 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.750
 ChingÃ³n feels very resistant 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.239
 flexible as I was saying this if you 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.680
 they are overweight as I do not have 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.390
 no problem because I speak they have 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.480
 an extensible and fits perfectly 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.769
 another voice it does not look great 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.569
 I had to remove him you have to put this 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.190
 came just to the extent the other than a 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.170
 little bit big then there's no problem 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.510
 that you're not going to be left not in fact 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.980
 on the website that is here below them 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.630
 I'm going to leave the air in the link and they can 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.120
 enter and there he tells you exactly 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.269
 clock measures how much this costs 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.040
 It costs 129 dollars and the shipping is already 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.110
 including shipping from japan and it's 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.569
 included I had been asked about the 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.910
 taxes that if taxes are paid 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.069
 notice that they do not charge you taxes because 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.760
 because when they send it they have good 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:58.489
 with a sheet next to it on the sheet says that 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.500
 the reindeer is worth 10 dollars then enter 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.470
 to run taxes is the thing of 10 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.500
 hours 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:08.050
 therefore you avoid the problem 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.530
 of immigration taxes and without 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.530
 no problem we do not know what is 129 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.419
 dollars in this case I had also had 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.310
 asked for discounts and kids and we 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.019
 Our friends gave a discount 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.690
 doctor that a flan plate we were awarded 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.760
 the $ 10 discount therefore 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.490
 it is terrain that would cost in place 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.229
 120 dollars 119 dollars if you 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.199
 enter the discount code 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.340
 in that I leave you with the description with 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.710
 that code 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.360
 it's a coupon when you buy it 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.190
 they will discount the 10 dollars 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.840
 you can also give it laics or by day 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.400
 on facebook back us four 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.830
 dollars and looking for the shipment that is 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.260
 You have free lamented a bargain given by 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.889
 these watches that are completely worth the 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:54.139
 very original grief very nice design 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.370
 the mint I loved thinking 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.250
 use my body discount coupon 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.570
 to go buy me one because if there 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.610
 one that I like a lot and I do not 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.250
 they sent then what am I going to have to 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.470
 using that acute is another thing that 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.770
 they wanted in town this is that the 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.900
 designs are exclusive because exclusive 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.580
 good because to start the crazy people 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.050
 design from scratch everything you see here 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.630
 It is designed specifically for 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.510
 doing it starts to teach from scratch 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.760
 and once the chair has been made 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.220
 those that are thought to do in that 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.930
 end moment it stops making 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.540
 watches for when to have the 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.100
 exclusivity of these and it does not come back 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.050
 to produce that model what does it mean 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.639
 with this that this model when 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.740
 sell all watches of this model 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.590
 they do not do it anymore and you go to 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.530
 have a model that is exclusive and is not 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.540
 of series or kids then the truth is 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.490
 an excellent gift for king is a 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.620
 excellent choice is not at all clear and 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.479
 they are unique watches that you are not going to 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.430
 find on another side of very good 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.680
 quality feel very good quality 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.240
 does not feel anything fragile in the batteries 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.020
 the hatches here in mexico without 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.509
 problems 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.919
 and well they repair themselves in 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:03.650
 case of anything and have greater 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:06.139
 guarantee of really getting into the page
