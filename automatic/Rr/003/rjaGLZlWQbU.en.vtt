00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.379
 Hello, welcome to Todd's kitchen. Today's recipe is almost guaranteed 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:05.830
 Please be the most picky picky. 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.809
 This is a lovely dinner recipe and I am sure you will like it. So, with me, because I am today 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.809
 My version of the cottage cake sweet potato. 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.849
 We are going to start cooking our blade steaks. 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.430
 I am here in the media, in the high temperature cooking pot. 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.359
 Give it a quick grease 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.480
 I have cut our blade into a bite-sized piece of steak, so put these into the pan. 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.820
 We will continue to stir up for about five minutes. 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.550
 Until the meat is cooked, all the way through 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.090
 Once the meat is cooked, all the way through, we intend to put it in the heat, but just put it into meat 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.130
 Sealed in the container, and we started browsing the next step on the page. 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.610
 Casserole in a pot 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.410
 Put the oil in the pot 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.300
 Then, add the onion I have chopped 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.620
 2 celery 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.450
 We are minced 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.070
 , cook for a minute or two 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.840
 Just to soften the onions 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.840
 Once the onion has softened, add 200 grams of tomatoes. 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.500
 Then a quarter cup of red wine 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.070
 Now, if you don't want to use wine in the dish, it's fine. 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.140
 Instead, some chicken soup is used. 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.900
 So just by mixing 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.000
 Now cook it and let it cook for about 10 minutes until it is low. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.350
 Reduce liquid by half 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.210
 What, what will be done, is to concentrate those cute tastes. 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.220
 So the liquid we have to return has been reduced 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.870
 Our steak pot 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:50.870
 Then pour in our chicken soup 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.030
 Then add some salt 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.030
 And some peppers 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.980
 Give a good sensation through 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.540
 If the water that has grown up is boiled, I am going to put it in a medium calorie low now. 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.970
 We will let these two and a half hours 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.989
 But after the first half hour, we have to place our carrots 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.809
 During this time, we have to give it a good sensation every ten to fifteen minutes. 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:19.739
 So put the lid on it 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.069
 So it has been an hour, this smell 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.349
 wonderful 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.949
 So now put in our chopped carrots 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:31.219
 Stir, in 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:35.029
 Now put the lid on and let it lick another half an hour 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:39.909
 It’s about half an hour, I have a hot water in the pot. 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.829
 I have our sweet potato peeled off what I did and made it into small pieces 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.289
 Carefully placed into the water 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.949
 We will let this 熬 fifteen minutes just until 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:52.259
 Its beautiful and tender 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:56.589
 So if it has been two and a half hours, this smell is again 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.669
 Unbelievable. So what are we going to do now? 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:03.399
 Grab all the solids out and just miss them and put them in one 

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:08.339
 In another container, we have to seal it up. 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:12.529
 What we have to do is to return this liquid to boiling 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:15.489
 What we want to do is reduce the liquid by half. 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.010
 Now you will be wondering why we are not just pouring out 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.399
 Half of the liquid 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:22.619
 The reason is that we want to preserve the taste, so boiled water 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.870
 We will have less liquid but still have all the flavor 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.170
 The brought back liquid has been boiled, which takes about 5 minutes. 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.049
 To cut in half 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.329
 We drain the sweet potato and pour it into a stirred container 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.349
 And softened butter and our parsley, I roughly chopped 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.039
 Now using potato mash 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:43.419
 I am going to marry me. 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.679
 Just until they are fully integrated 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:51.919
 The liquid has been reduced by half, so that the current IM is going to return the meat 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.569
 pot 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.499
 We are going to cook for about one to two minutes. 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:59.449
 Just like this meat, warm a little bit 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.759
 Next, I have a baking tray 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:02.559
 Now we want 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:03.879
 Fall in our 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:09.589
 Lovely meat mixture 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:13.349
 Most importantly, our chopped sweet potatoes 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:14.279
 And justice 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:17.309
 Spread out evenly 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:20.889
 Don't let it be neat, you want it to sort the garbage of society 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.110
 Now, where we are going, go through the preheating oven 230 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.839
 Twenty minutes Celsius 

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:32.559
 I just took it out in the oven and filled the smell of this room. 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:33.990
 wonderful 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.000
 Now it's really a bit prepared, but with a separate smell, it's worth it 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Let us give this a try 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.029
 What will I tell you? 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:51.139
 The meat melts in my mouth 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.790
 The taste is really something you must try. 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.069
 I took the time to prepare, is it worth it? 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:04:59.990
 It every minute 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.080
 But I can say that all honesty 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.949
 The taste of this recipe is simple and delicious. 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.190
 Really not hard food preparation 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.240
 So give it a go because I promise you won't 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.319
 regret 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:15.240
