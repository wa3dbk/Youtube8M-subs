00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.500
 hello everyone welcome for a new 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.210
 episode of the monsters garage 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.830
 today we are at the clusaz and 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.000
 you will see that here the specialty 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.000
 it's easter to raclette 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.289
 at 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.300
 1 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.070
 butcher the holes fashioned every meter 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.570
 square of track with extreme 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.080
 accuracy under the most conditions 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.670
 extreme 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.540
 only a groomer is a seasoned pilot 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.540
 are able to 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.760
 it's in the alpine resort of 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.770
 Clusaz nestled at 2600 meters above sea level 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.190
 that we took orders from a 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.960
 track in buli this model made by 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.910
 the German casse bauer is a marvel 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.190
 of modern technology 9 meters long 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.960
 11 tons and a titanic thrust 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.220
 it's abominable snow machines is 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.470
 driven by a 6-cylinder diesel 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.360
 Original mercedes this block of 500 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.910
 gorges horses a gigantic couple 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.590
 of 2200 newtons meters which allows 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.070
 this groomer to climb real 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.500
 walls up to 50 degrees tilt 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:22.759
 then the work consists of adam and the 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.190
 ski slopes or that the skier is a 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.070
 hard funds so early in the season it's 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.050
 a preparation of fresh snow 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.960
 so there and we have bumps are there the 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.979
 snow that accumulates in the hollows it 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.520
 there are risks of avalanche so 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.340
 necessarily 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.890
 you have to be careful 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.750
 anna a groomer breaks down into three 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.070
 parts at the front a bubbling blade 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.079
 allows to level the ground 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.759
 cut the bumps and fill in snow 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.770
 the least well- stocked parts at 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.060
 center the caterpillars they are connected 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.560
 between them by flexible bands in 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.939
 rubber that allows us to marry 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.860
 at best the role yesterday on each 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.630
 bar of tiny carbide dots 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.549
 of tungsten on the same principle as 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.170
 studded tires on the back 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.280
 the strawberry is the most 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.289
 important of a groomer 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.479
 it is she who regenerates the snow and he 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.250
 give its final rendering according to 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.660
 the hardness of the snow the pilot manages the 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.759
 ground pressure via cylinders 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.440
 hydraulics which allows to ventilate more 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.880
 or least the most frozen parts in 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.650
 end of the chain we find the apron 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.269
 which gives the striated appearance that skiers 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.120
 will find the next day at the opening 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.799
 tracks the extreme conditions of the 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.709
 high mountains are almost painless to 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.060
 cockpit edge 360 Â° led lighting 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.160
 deicing liquid integrates with 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.900
 wipers anti avalanche beacons and 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.730
 emergency radio allow women 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.470
 hours these isolated workers to evolve 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.910
 with maximum comfort and 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.110
 security 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.690
 security it is also a question 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.370
 with the capstan winch a progress 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.190
 gigantic that makes sure on 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.350
 tracks with very strong declination with 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.000
 his four tons of traction and his 360 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.470
 degree of action it allows the groomer to 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.859
 make sure a distance of 1000 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.780
 meters 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:52.790
 the station of la clusaz counts a good 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.090
 hundred anchor points dedicated to this 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.090
 effect 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.180
 3 it is installed on back tray of 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.760
 the Meuse 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.890
 it is positioned roughly in the center 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.080
 of the machine and he's going to help us to 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.760
 climb it will hold us downhill 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.590
 to always have some grip on 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.760
 level of caterpillars for not patina 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:16.590
 to not deteriorate the 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:21.000
 make me way to bar am all ears 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:28.349
 you horns yesterday morning I'm not from 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:31.409
 bullshit there no go it's great at 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:34.409
 west you go there on a rope she does 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:36.829
 awesome ah yeah you wonder me that 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.489
 ready to drink the cup and patterns 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.950
 groomer it's a running cost 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.390
 of 150 euros per hour it must be said that 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.069
 the diesel that drives it sips in 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.920
 average 22 liters an hour and that the 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.739
 territory to cover represents 84 track 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.389
 about 220 km over six months 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.280
 of activity the groomers of the clusaz 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:55.049
 consume on average 300 thousand liters 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.730
 of diesel a cost that impacts 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.299
 of course the price of your package 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.299
 of this crime
