bargaining a cantar attention that that

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.249 
bargaining a cantar attention that that
was<00:01:27.150> an<00:01:27.270> issue<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.869> district

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
was an issue for the district

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.100 
was an issue for the district
understandably<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.970> negotiated<00:01:30.780> this

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
understandably so and we negotiated this

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.780 
understandably so and we negotiated this
review<00:01:31.770> panel<00:01:32.189> process<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:33.030> order<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:34.790> prevent

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
review panel process in order to prevent

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.370 
review panel process in order to prevent
the<00:01:36.000> district<00:01:36.390> from<00:01:36.659> having<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.020> jump<00:01:37.170> through

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
the district from having to jump through

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.990 
the district from having to jump through
a<00:01:37.409> number<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.799> Hoops<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.250> dismiss<00:01:38.729> a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
a number of Hoops to dismiss a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.609 
a number of Hoops to dismiss a
probationary<00:01:39.900> teacher

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
probationary teacher

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.499 
probationary teacher
and<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.340> our<00:01:41.729> review<00:01:42.149> panel<00:01:44.090> has<00:01:45.090> three

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
and so our review panel has three

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.599 
and so our review panel has three
teachers<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.289> three<00:01:46.469> administrators<00:01:47.219> on<00:01:47.429> it

we'll see a lot of teachers experience a
culture<00:05:20.370> shock<00:05:20.550> and<00:05:20.850> so<00:05:21.360> a<00:05:21.389> designation<00:05:21.900> of

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
culture shock and so a designation of

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.680 
culture shock and so a designation of
partially<00:05:22.500> effective<00:05:22.740> there<00:05:23.190> is<00:05:24.030> a<00:05:24.150> signal

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690

that there's something wrong and they

that there's something wrong and they
