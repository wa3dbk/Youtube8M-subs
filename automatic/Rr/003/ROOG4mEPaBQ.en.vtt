00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:12.150
 hi toni how are you fine thanks diego 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.370
 a question you know is made by the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.560
 man is thrown into space and turns from 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.900
 useful way around the earth is 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.110
 superman 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.260
 Hahaha 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.850
 what makes you so funny that 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.210
 correct answer is a satellite 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.210
 artificial 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.640
 carambola tone where we are we are 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.649
 outside the Earth's atmosphere this is 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.750
 more than 100 kilometers above 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.940
 the average level of the sea is to say that 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.559
 we are in space space is a 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.780
 different environment than we are 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.309
 accustomed on earth so 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.309
 we will need space suits 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.649
 pray what is that 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.809
 it's an artificial satellite 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.140
 the satellites are classified by their 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.540
 size your application and your type of orbit 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.570
 due to its size, there are events 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.580
 satellites is now the size of your 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.790
 hand but there are also peaks 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.180
 satellites nano satellites microsatellite 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.509
 mini satellite medium and macro satellites 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.659
 satellites I can not believe it's so 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:32.049
 enormous by its application can be for 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.990
 military meteorological communications 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.750
 among other applications by its orbit 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.580
 it can be circular how easy is this 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.530
 classification since as its name what 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.929
 indicates forms a circle around the 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.450
 earth and if I told you to spin around 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.670
 from the earth forming an ellipse what 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.580
 type of orbit would be that is very easy 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.069
 would be an elliptical orbit and if by its 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.679
 tilt goes through the poles would be a 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.780
 orbit with polar tilt and if it has 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.700
 a tilt of 0 degrees and goes through 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.990
 the equator would have an inclination 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.299
 equatorial 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.820
 finally if its angle of inclination 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.099
 was greater than equatorial but smaller than 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.450
 the polar inclination that tilt 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:16.940
 it would be would be would be tilted right you 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.860
 You realize you learn quick and easy 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.500
 because there are satellites to different 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.150
 distances with respect to land and 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.310
 that within the classification of 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.410
 satellites is the height one the most 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.780
 close is from low orbit or also 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.520
 called leo is two thousand kilometers from 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.830
 the land above the mean sea level 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.470
 the second satellite is in an orbit 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.060
 mean or also called meo is more 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.490
 10,000 kilometers above the level 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.260
 middle of the sea and finally the orbit 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.900
 geosynchronous 8 and the orbit 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.390
 geostationary or also called geo it 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.640
 they find 36,000 kilometers above 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.680
 mean sea level now that you know 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.930
 about satellites you know not all 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.680
 the satellites are for 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.560
 telecommunications and that exist 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.280
 different according to their classification if that 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.280
 I 'm clear 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.930
 back at home under the protection of 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.360
 the earth's atmosphere but still 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.150
 I have some doubts as to why it is so 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.980
 important to build satellites the 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.530
 technology used in satellites 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.660
 is in extreme conditions and can be 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.610
 applied in technology that is used in 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.830
 ground since the conditions are less 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.910
 extreme is why it applies to 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.910
 all these devices 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.549
 as the one that reaches the satellites at 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.709
 space then we need something that has 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.109
 much strength to carry it so a 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.269
 device propelled by reaction by the 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.340
 expulsion of the gases generated in a 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.700
 combustion chamber is suitable 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.799
 that could be for a launch vehicle 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.260
 better known as rocket and in the 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.650
 rockets there are also different types 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.719
 of rockets like with the satellites by 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.019
 Of course there are different types of 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:19.709
 fuels and releases and you could 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.340
 explain them of course but in another 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.860
 day 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:27.050
 right now we'd better run because of 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.050
 that this rocket is about to take off 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.990
 if it was close 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.180
 for today it was enough we see each other until 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.130
 the next tell us in the part of 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.050
 down your doubts questions or topics of 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.050
 interest and give little hand up the video 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.139
 Y 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.139
 two 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.790
 two
