 time not with the things on me 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:55.599
 is the fault of an Internet provider 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:58.769
 do not hold me to his fleet on one 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.769

 I have already mentioned that 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.730
 Escape the face and, above all, is 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.860

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.640

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.320
 also thought but no no no 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:54.300
 clearly gives an internet provider the 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:56.760
 guilty yes, do not do anything meant broken 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.440

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.550
