00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
 hi to all these toys and today 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.149
 I showed you what is in 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.149
 my iphone 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.080
 So here we are on the iphone 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.220
 so you have been several to me 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.600
 ask you to remake a small 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.670
 video about the apps I'm using 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.570
 on my iphone so the voice if this 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.160
 little video 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.930
 so there is this iphone is divided into 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.980
 two pages so first page of 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.930
 really more apps I use 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.210
 a lot and second page the one that 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.380
 I use a little less so message that 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.180
 allows you to send messages or 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.640
 wordpress that allows you to edit 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.140
 articles view statistics checker 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.540
 comments and where from the site 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.670
 photos and videos so photo and device 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.930
 photo that allows to simply b to see 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.150
 photos and take pictures 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.670
 youtube no need to present it if 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.830
 weather clock video plans and notes and 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.300
 native applications of the iphone which 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.490
 had who are really very very good 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.570
 done and that amply suffice for me to 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.820
 everything that needs to be done 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.710
 twitter and facebook social networks 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.480
 in which I am present so if 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.440
 you still follow me, do not hesitate 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.170
 not to go there you'll know a lot 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.659
 more the birds and engadget so 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.180
 American media especially what is 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.790
 high tech who leaves a super good 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.869
 quality so I'm that so it's in 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.909
 english so less it makes work 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.700
 English and it's really really 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.770
 very very practical itunes and the app store 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.230
 banne apple's shops 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.510
 reminder settings and schedule is 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.190
 between that there is a nice style so the 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.960
 social network of the photos so that was 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.790
 inverted I am very very present on 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.500
 which do not hesitate to follow me all 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.360
 links are in the description and below 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.000
 phone safari and music 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.770
 whose fairly basic applications all 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.659
 the phones on the second page on 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.549
 comes with google + so the network 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.950
 social from google so who 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.460
 work pretty well the queen at 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.380
 say again 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.909
 then we arrive with others so the 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.770
 applications folder really they 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.030
 do not serve anything on the iphone of 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.920
 native apps that we can not 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.870
 not delete such as contacts 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.729
 facetime dictaphone game calendars 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.619
 center stock market kiosk face book and 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.220
 compass because for example contact 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.810
 facetime 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.659
 we find all this in the expectations 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.430
 phone or the bah stock market it's not the 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.140
 more important because book no longer the 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.069
 kiosk either so we go then we 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.659
 arrives with managed school that the 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.459
 high school apps that allows you to have 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.110
 information that teachers 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.019
 put the notes the averages the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.730
 homework and where the cinema so has 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.120
 allocated the kinepolis so allocinÃ© for 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.740
 videos that make line hype all 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.310
 chokes and kinepolis since this is the 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.590
 only cinema 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.599
 if they are the only cinema that 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.120
 to Nimes and so it allows to have the 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.290
 release dates the schedules and 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.940
 especially when are they 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.069
 beautiful posters whose schedules 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.349
 then with sfr my drop account at 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.000
 let me chick and my account is 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.099
 make overtaking of the same package 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.489
 if I almost never see 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:48.280
 so especially the 3g and the 4g mac forever 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.250
 to a generation so two applications 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.379
 to fill us the news apple 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.780
 so in French this time and they 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.310
 so say it's the app that 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.739
 allows to manage the facebook pages 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.000
 the apple store ksa if the apple store the 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.590
 store itself which allows 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.030
 to buy products that allows 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.700
 especially in putting them in the apple 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.049
 physical store to pay via his iphone 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.569
 so that's good but in practice 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.400
 messenger is the facebook messenger 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.079
 so it's just the application apart 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.610
 stop cat it's the small apply to 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.680
 the small application that allows 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.900
 to send videos or photos of 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.540
 one to ten seconds and roots and seconds 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.910
 delete instantly so that's enough 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.829
 fun in the news we have the world and the 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.019
 figaro then are applications that 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.340
 I use a lot because for me to be at 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.130
 current of the news is primordial 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.090
 since at least we are not we are not 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.440
 there what holds back what is 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.819
 happened I'm not aware then that 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.160
 here it is in all the main 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.720
 real-time information and that's fine 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.609
 practice he is going staged so that's 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.470
 the application of the group believe digital 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:49.090
 studio that is a creator or rather a 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.880
 SEO audiovisual company 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.040
 producers in terms of youtube video 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.720
 and where so where I belong and 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.849
 is the application here is allows me 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.230
 to see all and all the news 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.819
 garageband bourg no need to present 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.620
 locate my iphone is the application 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.959
 for me you have to be the first 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.579
 installed since it allows for 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.560
 locate your iphone that is lost at home 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.970
 self in the street when it's Florent me 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.349
 that's really handy and that's 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.519
 works great 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.959
 is a small two so it's small 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.720
 disney's game had the crocodile or 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.829
 they must bring him water 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.380
 it's a nice little puzzle 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.820
 so the visual looks like it's 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.740
 really a thing for them really 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.669
 kids but but it relaxes five minutes 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.200
 in a waiting room where we have 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.950
 really nothing to do and we do not capture 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.840
 no internet 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.139
 picture frame it just allows to 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.300
 put several pictures on the same the 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.530
 same image so it's handy in 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.880
 instagram for example when we want 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.110
 to make three or four pictures in one 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.440
 square we take this little application 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.060
 here we go 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.490
 mcdo france for those who follow me on 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.960
 instagram you surely guessed that 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.760
 I am a follower of mcdo home 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.520
 I have so often and so it allows me to 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.620
 see what right now at mcdo and 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.420
 especially to be able to order from 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.310
 the app and coming off remove 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.260
 directly in the restaurant in malta 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.940
 barnes cat ladies is the application 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.750
 that no longer presents that just allows 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.190
 of d2 guess the music that went 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.180
 cost for example on a computer at the 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.760
 TV or radio 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.770
 and to finish clumsy ninja so that's 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.820
 the little game that came out there 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.980
 always two there are just a few 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.810
 days that can evolve a 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.610
 little ninja so a ninja who rather 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.290
 stupid ie he does not know himself 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.480
 beat who knows nothing and the goal 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.520
 it's good to train and for 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.960
 that he becomes more than a ninja to say himself 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.160
 more than jackie chan or what you 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.290
 want you can see that it's 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.580
 really not the top of the top of the top of the top 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.020
 here to applications 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.790
 but it's just that it's a 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.560
 iphone 16 gigabyte I have a lot of 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.970
 music and a lot of videos and also 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.140
 a lot of pictures so it takes 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.490
 a lot of room and so she and 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.770
 some applications that stays well 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.600
 that's what puts what I use the 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.160
 most often the rest of the 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.350
 apps is on my ipad so 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.180
 at least I'm a bit of both and then 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.520
 that's if we compare the 25th is 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.590
 the iphone 5 that I had until now 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.820
 well we can see that these are 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.110
 exactly the same applications as 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.510
 I use last year where that 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.160
 I use this this year with this 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.240
 iphone 5 aces of which there is no big 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.919
 change between last year and 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.000
 this year before finishing for those 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.520
 who wonders when are they going 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.050
 come back next big next 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.700
 product testing and especially when is this 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.410
 what will happen the ipad tests that 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.630
 have not been tested yet 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.890
 the air does not look like or the ipad mini does not 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.360
 do not worry, this is a 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.900
 way it must happen very 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.400
 shortly 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.200
 I do not have the exact date yet 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.720
 I can only tell you that it will happen 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.490
 one day you just have to be patient I you 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.800
 look at corner 60 on twitter facebook and 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.810
 instagram is of course google + for 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.630
 know everything but when you know the 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:32.120
 because of that you will understand everything so 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.740
 do not worry so here's thanks to 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.880
 all of re viewing this video ago 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.290
