of a distinct ring pattern which is

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.229 
of a distinct ring pattern which is
where<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.350> gets<00:00:55.410> its<00:00:55.590> name<00:00:55.850> we're<00:00:56.850> doing<00:00:57.090> right

where it gets its name we're doing right
now<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.510> what<00:00:57.840> we've<00:00:57.930> been<00:00:58.020> doing<00:00:58.170> during<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
now and what we've been doing during the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.549 
now and what we've been doing during the
day<00:00:58.829> today<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.489> lime<00:01:00.480> sulfur<00:01:00.719> dipping<00:01:01.199> all<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
day today is lime sulfur dipping all the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.820 
day today is lime sulfur dipping all the
cats<00:01:02.690> even<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.750> cat<00:01:03.899> set<00:01:04.170> don't<00:01:04.439> show<00:01:04.619> any

cats even the cat set don't show any
lesions<00:01:05.010> we're<00:01:05.339> trying<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.729> do<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.060> which<00:01:06.720> is

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
lesions we're trying to do that which is

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.840 
lesions we're trying to do that which is
why<00:01:07.350> their<00:01:07.590> cages<00:01:07.950> look<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> horror<00:01:08.760> show

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
why their cages look like a horror show

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.640 
why their cages look like a horror show
right<00:01:09.180> now<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.900> why<00:01:10.049> they<00:01:10.200> also<00:01:10.350> look

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
right now and this is why they also look

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.550 
right now and this is why they also look
kind<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.130> yellow<00:01:11.340> them<00:01:11.900> so<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.140> lime<00:01:13.380> sulfur

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
kind of yellow them so the lime sulfur

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.170 
kind of yellow them so the lime sulfur
dip<00:01:13.799> has<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.010> kind<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.369> bad<00:01:14.490> odor<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.939> and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
dip has a kind of a bad odor to it and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.960 
dip has a kind of a bad odor to it and
and<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.830> also<00:01:16.979> yellows<00:01:17.400> let's<00:01:17.610> get<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> little

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
and it also yellows let's get a little

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.490 
and it also yellows let's get a little
bit<00:01:18.740> it's<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.890> wholly<00:01:20.250> treat<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.729> poly<00:01:21.500> going

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
bit it's not wholly treat of poly going

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.719 
bit it's not wholly treat of poly going
to<00:01:22.590> treat<00:01:22.740> them<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:23.070> ringworm<00:01:23.340> but<00:01:23.610> it's

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
to treat them for ringworm but it's

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.550 
to treat them for ringworm but it's
going<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.939> work<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.450> give<00:01:24.630> us<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.840> little<00:01:24.960> bit

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
going to work to give us a little bit

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.590 
going to work to give us a little bit

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
coverage and rumor so we're working with

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.660

the Bureau of in will help right down to

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.490 
the Bureau of in will help right down to
determine<00:01:54.090> what<00:01:54.689> we<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:55.020> with<00:01:55.110> these<00:01:55.229> cats

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
determine what we can do with these cats

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.050 
determine what we can do with these cats
and<00:01:55.829> whether<00:01:55.979> we<00:01:56.039> need<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.340> board<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.700> here

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
and whether we need to board you here

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.130 
and whether we need to board you here
until<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.659> certain<00:01:58.170> point<00:01:59.420> or<00:02:00.420> if<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:00.690> can<00:02:00.840> give

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
until a certain point or if we can give

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.389 
until a certain point or if we can give
those<00:02:01.229> other<00:02:01.440> shelters<00:02:01.830> that<00:02:01.950> don't<00:02:02.130> have

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
those other shelters that don't have

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.309 
those other shelters that don't have
this<00:02:02.520> high<00:02:02.670> risk<00:02:02.940> of<00:02:03.240> having<00:02:03.539> work<00:02:03.840> ringworm

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
this high risk of having work ringworm

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:05.660 
this high risk of having work ringworm
in<00:02:04.439> their<00:02:04.560> building<00:02:04.860> or<00:02:05.069> have<00:02:05.189> isolation

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
in their building or have isolation

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.559 
in their building or have isolation
facilities<00:02:06.119> right<00:02:07.020> now<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.229> do<00:02:07.560> not<00:02:07.679> have

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
facilities right now we do not have

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.430 
facilities right now we do not have
isolation<00:02:09.569> facility<00:02:09.630> that<00:02:10.080> would<00:02:10.170> really<00:02:10.319> be

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
isolation facility that would really be

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.550 
isolation facility that would really be
effective<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:11.190> keeping<00:02:11.310> them<00:02:11.640> from<00:02:12.560> from

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
effective in keeping them from from

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.630 
effective in keeping them from from
spreading<00:02:13.920> ring<00:02:14.069> work<00:02:14.190> throughout<00:02:14.489> our

spreading ring work throughout our

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.260 
spreading ring work throughout our
building<00:02:14.970> so

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
building so

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.760 
building so
as<00:02:16.390> much<00:02:16.600> as<00:02:16.720> we<00:02:16.840> would<00:02:16.960> hate<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.290> make<00:02:17.590> that

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
as much as we would hate to make that

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.500 
as much as we would hate to make that
decision<00:02:17.980> we<00:02:18.250> we<00:02:18.670> have<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.150> determine<00:02:19.360> whether

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
decision we we have to determine whether

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.560 
decision we we have to determine whether
we<00:02:19.780> can<00:02:19.960> go<00:02:20.350> forward<00:02:20.560> them<00:02:20.770> or<00:02:20.860> not<00:02:21.570> and

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
we can go forward them or not and

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.900 
we can go forward them or not and
ideally<00:02:22.840> we've<00:02:23.110> been<00:02:23.230> moving<00:02:23.320> another<00:02:23.950> job

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
ideally we've been moving another job

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.680 
ideally we've been moving another job
facility<00:02:25.630> they<00:02:25.870> can<00:02:26.020> handle<00:02:26.230> that

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
facility they can handle that

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:36.430 
facility they can handle that
today

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.140 

they<00:02:37.440> probably<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.950> highest<00:02:38.340> volume<00:02:38.820> shelter

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
they probably the highest volume shelter

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.370 
they probably the highest volume shelter
in<00:02:39.300> all<00:02:39.420> new<00:02:39.600> england<00:02:40.820> so<00:02:41.960> we<00:02:42.960> can<00:02:43.110> never<00:02:43.200> have

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
in all new england so we can never have

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.820 
in all new england so we can never have
enough<00:02:43.560> foster<00:02:43.860> homes<00:02:44.210> we<00:02:45.210> see<00:02:45.390> about<00:02:46.050> 3,700

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
enough foster homes we see about 3,700

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.000 
enough foster homes we see about 3,700
calves<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.130> year<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.580> our<00:02:47.670> building<00:02:48.710> many<00:02:49.710> of

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.700 
calves a year to our building many of
which<00:02:50.070> are

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.860 

so<00:03:05.490> I<00:03:05.520> would<00:03:05.790> say<00:03:05.819> that<00:03:05.940> concert<00:03:06.420> homes<00:03:06.600> is<00:03:06.720> our

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
so I would say that concert homes is our

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
so I would say that concert homes is our
