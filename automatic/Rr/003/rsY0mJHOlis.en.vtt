vehicles and as you have seen it's a
very<00:04:57.090> straightforward<00:04:57.780> process<00:04:57.930> so<00:04:58.830> all<00:04:59.099> we

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
very straightforward process so all we

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.860 
very straightforward process so all we

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
ask is that sometimes you may be

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.930 
ask is that sometimes you may be
requested<00:05:01.440> to<00:05:01.470> do<00:05:01.740> your<00:05:02.009> bit<00:05:02.190> to<00:05:02.370> help
