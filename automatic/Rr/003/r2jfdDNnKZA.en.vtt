going to do is put our yeast in a bowl
while<00:02:16.780> I'm<00:02:17.020> turning<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:17.650> I'm<00:02:17.830> going<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.280> slowly

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
while I'm turning it I'm going to slowly

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.240 
while I'm turning it I'm going to slowly
add<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:20.620> water<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.989> sort<00:02:22.989> of<00:02:23.140> let<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.920> yeast

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
add the water and sort of let the yeast

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:34.380 
add the water and sort of let the yeast
melt<00:02:28.950> I'm<00:02:29.950> also<00:02:30.160> going<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.519> add<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:31.269> sugar<00:02:33.390> in

I'm<00:02:50.380> going<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.650> slowly<00:02:51.069> start<00:02:51.730> adding<00:02:52.410> the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
I'm going to slowly start adding the

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:06.090 
I'm going to slowly start adding the
flour<00:02:54.750> not<00:02:55.750> too<00:02:55.959> slow

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
turning the ball around okay so my ball

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.080 
turning the ball around okay so my ball
of<00:03:21.040> dough<00:03:21.310> is<00:03:21.610> starting<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.150> look<00:03:22.300> pretty<00:03:22.600> good

I've<00:03:28.090> worked<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:29.020> for<00:03:29.520> about<00:03:31.410> five<00:03:32.410> minutes<00:03:32.710> I

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
I've worked it for about five minutes I

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.250 
I've worked it for about five minutes I
would<00:03:33.250> say<00:03:34.590> at<00:03:35.590> this<00:03:35.860> point<00:03:36.840> I'm<00:03:37.840> going<00:03:38.020> to<00:03:38.080> add

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
the salt after working the dough for a

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.370 
the salt after working the dough for a
while<00:03:41.920> it<00:03:42.460> gets<00:03:42.670> easier<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:44.700> softer<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:47.230> work

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
while it gets easier and softer to work

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.990 
while it gets easier and softer to work
on<00:03:48.930> all<00:03:49.930> right<00:03:50.200> that<00:03:50.590> was<00:03:50.710> a<00:03:50.740> workout<00:03:51.280> okay<00:03:51.940> so

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
on all right that was a workout okay so

amount of flour I wouldn't change your

which<00:04:47.230> would<00:04:47.560> be<00:04:47.770> about<00:04:48.250> an<00:04:48.490> hour<00:04:48.580> and<00:04:48.790> a<00:04:48.820> half

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
which would be about an hour and a half

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.230 
which would be about an hour and a half
or<00:04:49.420> two<00:04:49.480> hours<00:04:50.080> at<00:04:50.290> the<00:04:50.710> very<00:04:50.920> least<00:04:51.130> here<00:04:52.120> we

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
or two hours at the very least here we

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.930 
or two hours at the very least here we
go<00:04:52.390> our<00:04:52.750> pizza<00:04:53.290> dough<00:04:53.320> has<00:04:53.710> finally<00:04:54.250> risen<00:04:54.490> two

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
go our pizza dough has finally risen two

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.860 
go our pizza dough has finally risen two
hours<00:04:55.300> later<00:04:55.830> this<00:04:56.830> is<00:04:57.180> obviously<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.480> one<00:04:58.630> I

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
hours later this is obviously the one I

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.060 
hours later this is obviously the one I
did<00:04:59.200> by<00:04:59.560> hand

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
did by hand

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.510 
did by hand
I<00:05:00.990> should<00:05:01.990> have<00:05:02.140> sprinkled<00:05:02.740> some<00:05:03.040> flour

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
I should have sprinkled some flour

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.620 
I should have sprinkled some flour
underneath<00:05:04.000> it<00:05:04.570> because<00:05:05.020> it<00:05:05.200> sticked<00:05:05.590> to<00:05:06.340> the

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
underneath it because it sticked to the

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.240 
underneath it because it sticked to the
pot<00:05:07.630> a<00:05:07.810> little<00:05:08.020> but<00:05:08.350> it's<00:05:08.500> fine<00:05:08.740> and<00:05:09.040> whatever

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
pot a little but it's fine and whatever

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.740 
pot a little but it's fine and whatever
it<00:05:09.490> doesn't<00:05:09.670> matter

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
it doesn't matter

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:19.270 
it doesn't matter
the<00:05:12.620> way<00:05:12.830> to<00:05:12.890> store<00:05:13.490> it<00:05:13.760> now<00:05:15.040> is<00:05:16.750> to<00:05:17.950> put<00:05:18.950> it<00:05:19.100> in

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
the way to store it now is to put it in

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.530 
the way to store it now is to put it in
some<00:05:19.850> saran<00:05:20.420> wrap<00:05:20.750> and<00:05:22.000> put<00:05:23.000> it<00:05:23.090> in<00:05:23.180> the<00:05:23.270> fridge

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
some saran wrap and put it in the fridge

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.250 
some saran wrap and put it in the fridge
and<00:05:24.020> pull<00:05:24.890> it<00:05:25.070> out<00:05:25.310> an<00:05:26.120> hour<00:05:26.390> before<00:05:26.900> you<00:05:27.020> use

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
and pull it out an hour before you use

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.050 
and pull it out an hour before you use
it<00:05:27.290> so<00:05:27.830> it<00:05:27.980> has<00:05:28.160> a<00:05:28.190> chance<00:05:28.580> to<00:05:28.730> rise<00:05:29.180> again

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
it so it has a chance to rise again

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:38.740 
it so it has a chance to rise again
before<00:05:32.060> you<00:05:32.150> actually<00:05:32.390> bake<00:05:32.780> it<00:05:36.730> and<00:05:37.730> in<00:05:38.600> this
