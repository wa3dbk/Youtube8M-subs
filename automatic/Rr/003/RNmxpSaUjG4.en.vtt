00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.920
 another thing in the case of phenolic foam 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.509
 this one that comes out very easily 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.630
 is seeing 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.090
 so you have to do is just 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:26.670
 take what you will use for example if 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:28.830
 I will use three feet hypothesis that you 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.850
 use more 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.000
 You're not going to take it all and you can 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.329
 die if you will use 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.520
 then you will soak with two 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.800
 or three minutes to the water and then you go 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.950
 choose this water and let it dry 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.050
 a little and then you can then use 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.949
 a little something to stick the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.899
 center 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.370
 if what you bought one see that mine 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:03.030
 did not come 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:05.549
 mourinho is how it has today but will 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.430
 important service is that it has the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.150
 necessary for the tip to remain 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.420
 on here 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.880
 then I'd rather fuck with him already 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.700
 muglia saw it only purpose the plate 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.310
 do not like remembering to put 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:31.490
 sauce only the amount that was 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:31.490
 use 6 4 6 7 8 9 and 10 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:45.170
 They use 12 not be able to refuse 13 tone 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.840
 right then you worry me that down 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:53.230
 wetland in rainfall is low when 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:59.150
 water you then leave with 1 2 or 3 - 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:06.070
 English phenolic foam is the block the block 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:06.070
 Right goal there and rock he calls it
