hey guys this is wat from ASOS and today
when<00:00:08.160> he<00:00:08.220> give<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.460> quick<00:00:08.670> hands-on<00:00:09.179> on<00:00:09.480> the

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
when he give you a quick hands-on on the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.999 
when he give you a quick hands-on on the
new<00:00:09.719> transformer<00:00:10.559> pad<00:00:11.900> tf300<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.650> something

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
new transformer pad tf300 so something

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.310 
new transformer pad tf300 so something
that<00:00:14.190> really<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.179> follow-up<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
that really is the follow-up to the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.429 
that really is the follow-up to the
original<00:00:16.609> transformer<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:18.300> was<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.570> TF<00:00:18.900> 401

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
original transformer that was the TF 401

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.599 
original transformer that was the TF 401
and<00:00:19.710> i'm<00:00:19.830> going<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:19.980> give<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.130> guys<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> quick

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
and i'm going to give you guys a quick

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.880 
and i'm going to give you guys a quick
look<00:00:20.850> at<00:00:21.029> some<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.449> specs<00:00:22.260> on<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.650> thing

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
look at some of the specs on this thing

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.740 
look at some of the specs on this thing
some<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.519> different<00:00:23.760> ports<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.449> lilia

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
some of the different ports and lilia

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.660 
some of the different ports and lilia
what's<00:00:25.109> new<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.560> what's<00:00:25.619> different<00:00:25.859> versus

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
what's new and what's different versus

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.910 
what's new and what's different versus
the<00:00:26.880> original<00:00:27.240> transformer<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.779> also<00:00:27.930> versus

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the original transformer it also versus

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.519 
the original transformer it also versus
the<00:00:29.039> transformer<00:00:29.699> prime<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:31.199> really<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
the transformer prime and really the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.889 
the transformer prime and really the
main<00:00:31.710> difference<00:00:32.189> on<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.460> tf300<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
main difference on the tf300 is on the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.270 
main difference on the tf300 is on the
back<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.380> that's<00:00:34.469> where<00:00:34.649> we<00:00:34.680> get<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.010> really

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
back and that's where we get this really

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.700 
back and that's where we get this really
nice<00:00:35.719> concentric<00:00:36.719> circle<00:00:37.200> designer<00:00:37.530> of

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
nice concentric circle designer of

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.590 
nice concentric circle designer of
course<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> back<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.670> plastic<00:00:39.420> but

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
course the back of this is plastic but

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.970 
course the back of this is plastic but
it<00:00:40.050> does<00:00:40.230> take<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.469> lot<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.829> design

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
it does take a lot of the design

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.860 
it does take a lot of the design
inspiration<00:00:41.670> from<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.940> zenbook<00:00:42.149> also<00:00:42.719> from

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
inspiration from the zenbook also from

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.200 
inspiration from the zenbook also from
the<00:00:42.960> Prime<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:44.370> plastic<00:00:44.789> case<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.090> going

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
the Prime and that plastic case is going

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.450 
the Prime and that plastic case is going
to<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> lot<00:00:45.570> better<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:46.140> your<00:00:46.320> gps<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.280> your

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
to be a lot better for your gps and your

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.639 
to be a lot better for your gps and your
Wi-Fi<00:00:47.820> signal<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.390> really<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.809> something<00:00:49.530> that

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
Wi-Fi signal so really is something that

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.549 
Wi-Fi signal so really is something that
comes<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:50.039> quite<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.399> handy<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.199> do<00:00:52.199> have<00:00:52.500> one

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
comes in quite in handy I do have one

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.580 
comes in quite in handy I do have one
speaker<00:00:53.190> here<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> right-hand<00:00:53.879> side<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
speaker here on the right-hand side and

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.689 
speaker here on the right-hand side and
beyond<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.649> everything<00:00:56.190> else<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.520> pretty

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
beyond that everything else is pretty

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.369 
beyond that everything else is pretty
much<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> same<00:00:57.390> as<00:00:57.600> what<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.780> had<00:00:58.020> on<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
much the same as what you had on the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.959 
much the same as what you had on the
previous<00:00:58.410> tablet<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.309> do<00:00:59.460> have<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.670> same

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
previous tablet so you do have the same

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.760 
previous tablet so you do have the same
keyboard<00:01:00.300> docking<00:01:00.780> mechanism<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.440> bottom

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
keyboard docking mechanism on the bottom

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.789 
keyboard docking mechanism on the bottom
on<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:03.210> other<00:01:03.329> side<00:01:03.570> here<00:01:03.780> I've<00:01:03.899> got<00:01:04.140> one

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
on the other side here I've got one

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.910 
on the other side here I've got one
micro<00:01:05.700> SD<00:01:06.180> card<00:01:06.450> slot<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:07.229> supports<00:01:07.770> up<00:01:07.890> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
micro SD card slot this supports up to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.679 
micro SD card slot this supports up to
32<00:01:08.400> gigabytes<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.090> really<00:01:09.240> great<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.510> add

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
32 gigabytes so it's really great to add

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.140 
32 gigabytes so it's really great to add
a<00:01:09.720> lot<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.930> video<00:01:10.170> or<00:01:10.470> music<00:01:11.400> if<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.790> got<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> lot

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
a lot of video or music if you got a lot

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.520 
a lot of video or music if you got a lot
of<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.360> kind<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.570> thing<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.869> your<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.470> your

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
storage next you have a micro HDMI slot

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.620 
storage next you have a micro HDMI slot
and<00:01:17.189> with<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.820> actually<00:01:18.210> export

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
and with this you can actually export

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.530 
and with this you can actually export
even<00:01:19.350> 1080p<00:01:19.979> video<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.430> your<00:01:20.729> TV<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.390> that's

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
even 1080p video to your TV so that's

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.230 
even 1080p video to your TV so that's
also<00:01:21.750> quite<00:01:22.110> handy<00:01:23.060> beyond<00:01:24.060> that

everything's pretty similar about the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.219 
everything's pretty similar about the
volume<00:01:26.100> knob<00:01:26.400> all<00:01:26.610> your<00:01:27.420> power<00:01:27.659> buttons<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
you do have a 1.2 megapixel camera on

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.960 
you do have a 1.2 megapixel camera on
the<00:01:37.470> front<00:01:37.619> here<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.579> really<00:01:38.700> great<00:01:38.880> for

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
the front here this is really great for

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.420 
the front here this is really great for
skype<00:01:39.420> being<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.810> kind<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.020> thing<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
skype being that kind of thing but the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.670 
skype being that kind of thing but the
real<00:01:41.670> camera<00:01:42.090> power<00:01:42.299> comes<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.200> back<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
real camera power comes on the back and

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.770 
real camera power comes on the back and
that's<00:01:43.920> what<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.189> do<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.700> 8<00:01:44.970> megapixel

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.420 
that's what we do have this 8 megapixel
camera<00:01:46.110> it's<00:01:46.649> actually<00:01:46.920> quite<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.189> wide

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
camera it's actually quite a wide

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.090 
camera it's actually quite a wide
aperture<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:48.090> 2.2<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.740> going<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> be

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
aperture of 2.2 so this is going to be

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.889 
aperture of 2.2 so this is going to be
quite<00:01:50.759> handy<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:51.299> even<00:01:51.570> low<00:01:51.689> light

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
quite handy for even low light

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.190 
quite handy for even low light
conditions<00:01:52.850> dimensions<00:01:53.850> was<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.329> 2<00:01:54.689> 300<00:01:55.110> is

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
conditions dimensions was the 2 300 is

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.310 
conditions dimensions was the 2 300 is
about<00:01:55.439> one<00:01:55.740> point<00:01:55.950> 40<00:01:56.670> pounds<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:58.200> about

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
about one point 40 pounds and just about

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.889 
about one point 40 pounds and just about
0.3<00:01:59.159> 9<00:01:59.369> inches<00:01:59.880> thick<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.600> actually

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
0.3 9 inches thick so it's actually

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.109 
0.3 9 inches thick so it's actually
incredibly<00:02:01.140> thin<00:02:01.770> for<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.979> tablet<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.520> if<00:02:03.030> I

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
incredibly thin for a tablet and if I

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.590 
incredibly thin for a tablet and if I
compare<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.100> transformer<00:02:05.100> prime<00:02:05.600> and

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
compare it to the transformer prime and

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600 
compare it to the transformer prime and
see<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:07.350> isn't<00:02:07.590> really<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.950> lot<00:02:08.399> of

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
see that there isn't really a lot of

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.850 
see that there isn't really a lot of
difference<00:02:09.000> here<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.420> time<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.840> about<00:02:09.989> 0.3<00:02:10.649> 3

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
difference here that time is about 0.3 3

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.820 
difference here that time is about 0.3 3
inches<00:02:11.129> so<00:02:11.340> it's<00:02:11.459> almost<00:02:11.640> exactly<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.239> same

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
inches so it's almost exactly the same

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.950 
inches so it's almost exactly the same
and<00:02:12.950> if<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.520> can<00:02:13.640> hear<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.880> weight<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.330> can't

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
and if I can hear the weight I can't

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.060 
and if I can hear the weight I can't
really<00:02:15.050> tell<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.380> difference<00:02:15.410> I<00:02:15.740> know<00:02:15.800> that

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
really tell the difference I know that

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.000 
really tell the difference I know that
the<00:02:16.610> chief<00:02:16.790> Gator<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.240> about<00:02:17.560> 0.1<00:02:18.560> pounds

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
the chief Gator it is about 0.1 pounds

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.410 
the chief Gator it is about 0.1 pounds
heavier<00:02:19.280> but<00:02:19.490> you<00:02:19.670> can't<00:02:19.880> really<00:02:20.060> tell<00:02:20.270> any

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
heavier but you can't really tell any

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.120 
heavier but you can't really tell any
kind<00:02:20.570> of<00:02:20.600> difference<00:02:20.900> holding<00:02:21.290> them<00:02:21.410> so<00:02:21.620> it's

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
kind of difference holding them so it's

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.360 
kind of difference holding them so it's
a<00:02:22.220> really<00:02:22.370> nice<00:02:22.580> size<00:02:22.850> and<00:02:23.240> not<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.050> huge<00:02:24.410> not<00:02:25.340> a

huge difference versus the fine but a

come<00:03:17.120> into<00:03:17.239> play<00:03:17.450> if<00:03:17.630> you<00:03:17.840> need<00:03:18.110> extra<00:03:18.440> storage

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
come into play if you need extra storage

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.040 
come into play if you need extra storage
but<00:03:19.790> by<00:03:20.060> far<00:03:20.269> in<00:03:20.390> my<00:03:20.570> opinion<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.930> most

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
but by far in my opinion the most

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.990 
but by far in my opinion the most
important<00:03:21.890> thing<00:03:22.040> about<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.340> transformer<00:03:22.880> we

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
important thing about the transformer we

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.729 
important thing about the transformer we
haven't<00:03:23.209> talked<00:03:23.360> about<00:03:23.420> yet<00:03:23.720> is<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:24.260> keyboard

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
haven't talked about yet is the keyboard

haven't talked about yet is the keyboard
docking<00:03:25.340> station<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.570> I'll<00:03:27.170> show<00:03:27.350> you<00:03:27.380> guys

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
docking station and I'll show you guys

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.410 
docking station and I'll show you guys
how<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.890> works<00:03:28.070> here<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:29.000> double<00:03:29.209> it<00:03:29.269> just

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
how it works here the double it just

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.020 
how it works here the double it just
stops<00:03:29.630> right<00:03:30.110> into<00:03:30.320> place<00:03:30.470> I<00:03:30.680> can<00:03:30.980> snap<00:03:31.790> it<00:03:31.940> in

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
stops right into place I can snap it in

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.470 
stops right into place I can snap it in
and<00:03:32.630> it<00:03:32.840> locks<00:03:33.080> really<00:03:33.440> nicely<00:03:33.590> here<00:03:33.890> so

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
and it locks really nicely here so

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.960 
and it locks really nicely here so
basically<00:03:35.480> now<00:03:35.600> what<00:03:35.780> it's<00:03:35.870> doing<00:03:35.930> is<00:03:36.320> about<00:03:36.650> a

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
basically now what it's doing is about a

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.250 
basically now what it's doing is about a
tablet<00:03:37.970> that<00:03:38.180> sounds<00:03:38.540> ran<00:03:38.690> into<00:03:38.840> basically<00:03:39.230> a

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
tablet that sounds ran into basically a

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.890 
tablet that sounds ran into basically a
full<00:03:39.560> notebook<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:41.180> keyboard<00:03:41.690> is

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
full notebook and the keyboard is

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.770 
full notebook and the keyboard is
actually<00:03:42.230> going<00:03:42.350> to<00:03:42.470> charge<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:44.269> tablet<00:03:44.690> as

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
actually going to charge the tablet as

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.030 
actually going to charge the tablet as
well<00:03:44.810> so<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.200> tablet<00:03:45.440> has<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:45.560> 10<00:03:45.800> hour<00:03:45.920> battery

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
well so the tablet has a 10 hour battery

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.280 
well so the tablet has a 10 hour battery
life<00:03:46.340> but<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.239> keyboard<00:03:47.450> has<00:03:47.750> an<00:03:47.870> extra

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
life but the keyboard has an extra

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.320 
life but the keyboard has an extra
battery<00:03:48.470> that<00:03:48.980> gives<00:03:49.040> me<00:03:49.340> an<00:03:49.550> additional<00:03:50.000> five

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
battery that gives me an additional five

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.390 
battery that gives me an additional five
hours<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:51.080> I'll<00:03:51.560> actually<00:03:51.680> charge<00:03:52.160> the

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
hours and I'll actually charge the

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.949 
hours and I'll actually charge the
tablet<00:03:52.790> if<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.060> tablets<00:03:53.390> low<00:03:53.570> so<00:03:53.780> it's<00:03:53.900> a

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
tablet if the tablets low so it's a

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.240 
tablet if the tablets low so it's a
really<00:03:54.140> good<00:03:54.320> feature<00:03:54.590> to<00:03:54.680> have<00:03:54.769> you<00:03:54.980> can<00:03:55.100> see

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
really good feature to have you can see

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.190 
really good feature to have you can see
now<00:03:55.370> that<00:03:55.400> it's<00:03:55.700> charging<00:03:56.090> it<00:03:56.330> it's<00:03:56.900> a<00:03:56.959> really

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
now that it's charging it it's a really

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.920 
now that it's charging it it's a really
great<00:03:57.760> additional<00:03:58.760> benefit<00:03:59.239> of<00:03:59.390> having<00:03:59.570> the

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
great additional benefit of having the

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.900 
great additional benefit of having the
keyboard<00:04:00.290> docking<00:04:00.530> station<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:01.580> you<00:04:01.670> can<00:04:01.790> see

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
keyboard docking station so you can see

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.729 
keyboard docking station so you can see
I<00:04:01.940> have<00:04:02.000> a<00:04:02.180> full<00:04:02.570> keyboard<00:04:02.720> now<00:04:03.080> i've<00:04:03.350> got<00:04:03.560> a

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
I have a full keyboard now i've got a

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.360 
I have a full keyboard now i've got a
touch<00:04:03.980> pad<00:04:04.250> I've<00:04:04.820> got<00:04:05.150> most<00:04:05.810> keys<00:04:06.140> and<00:04:06.530> also

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
touch pad I've got most keys and also

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.720 
touch pad I've got most keys and also
got<00:04:07.580> a<00:04:08.200> lot<00:04:09.200> of<00:04:09.230> extra<00:04:09.680> ports<00:04:10.010> too<00:04:10.340> so<00:04:10.519> you<00:04:10.610> can

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
got a lot of extra ports too so you can

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.870 
got a lot of extra ports too so you can
see<00:04:10.880> this<00:04:11.450> looks<00:04:11.780> a<00:04:12.080> lot<00:04:13.040> better<00:04:13.250> looks<00:04:13.580> really

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
see this looks a lot better looks really

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.159 
see this looks a lot better looks really
like<00:04:14.060> a<00:04:14.330> full<00:04:15.200> notebook<00:04:15.620> and<00:04:15.980> I've<00:04:16.640> got<00:04:16.850> a<00:04:17.169> USB

like a full notebook and I've got a USB

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.949 
like a full notebook and I've got a USB
2.0<00:04:18.620> port<00:04:19.190> here<00:04:19.370> I<00:04:19.609> can<00:04:20.150> add<00:04:20.330> a<00:04:20.359> wireless<00:04:20.540> mouse

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
2.0 port here I can add a wireless mouse

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.560 
2.0 port here I can add a wireless mouse
there<00:04:21.289> or<00:04:21.560> even<00:04:21.620> external<00:04:22.370> hard<00:04:22.550> drive<00:04:22.789> and

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
there or even external hard drive and

there or even external hard drive and
I've<00:04:23.660> also<00:04:23.810> got<00:04:24.080> now<00:04:24.229> a<00:04:24.260> full<00:04:24.680> SD<00:04:24.950> card<00:04:25.520> reader

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
I've also got now a full SD card reader

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.520 
I've also got now a full SD card reader
that<00:04:26.180> I<00:04:26.270> can

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
that I can

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.190 
that I can
add<00:04:26.590> even<00:04:26.860> more<00:04:26.980> storage<00:04:27.820> with<00:04:28.150> so<00:04:28.840> really<00:04:29.170> a

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
add even more storage with so really a

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.110 
add even more storage with so really a
lot<00:04:29.440> of<00:04:29.650> options<00:04:30.100> are<00:04:30.250> added<00:04:30.610> with<00:04:30.940> the

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
lot of options are added with the

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.170 
lot of options are added with the
keyboard<00:04:32.370> obviously<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.460> most<00:04:33.580> important

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
keyboard obviously the most important

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.390 
keyboard obviously the most important
option<00:04:34.600> is<00:04:34.720> now<00:04:34.870> I've<00:04:35.139> got<00:04:35.380> a<00:04:35.650> lot<00:04:36.370> more

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
option is now I've got a lot more

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.879 
option is now I've got a lot more
productivity<00:04:37.120> so<00:04:37.510> I<00:04:37.750> thought<00:04:37.990> is<00:04:38.200> going<00:04:38.740> to

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
productivity so I thought is going to

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.409 
productivity so I thought is going to
create<00:04:39.250> a<00:04:39.340> document<00:04:39.580> for<00:04:39.940> example<00:04:40.030> I<00:04:40.389> have

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
create a document for example I have

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.020 
create a document for example I have
Polaris<00:04:40.990> Office<00:04:41.169> here<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:42.400> Polaris<00:04:42.880> I

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
Polaris Office here and the Polaris I

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.180 
Polaris Office here and the Polaris I
can<00:04:43.210> create<00:04:43.510> Word<00:04:44.050> Excel<00:04:44.380> or<00:04:44.889> PowerPoint

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
can create Word Excel or PowerPoint

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.580 
can create Word Excel or PowerPoint
equivalents<00:04:46.060> that<00:04:46.690> will<00:04:46.840> actually<00:04:46.930> work<00:04:47.139> in

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
equivalents that will actually work in

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.190 
equivalents that will actually work in
microsoft<00:04:48.250> office<00:04:48.550> so<00:04:49.120> I<00:04:49.360> could<00:04:49.900> create<00:04:50.139> a

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
microsoft office so I could create a

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.320 
microsoft office so I could create a
spreadsheet<00:04:50.470> and<00:04:51.370> I<00:04:51.430> could<00:04:51.610> save<00:04:51.880> this<00:04:52.090> and

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
spreadsheet and I could save this and

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.750 
spreadsheet and I could save this and
then<00:04:52.480> open<00:04:52.840> it<00:04:52.930> in<00:04:53.110> MS<00:04:53.770> office<00:04:53.889> on<00:04:54.340> my<00:04:54.430> desktop

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
then open it in MS office on my desktop

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.230 
then open it in MS office on my desktop
at<00:04:55.000> home<00:04:55.030> I<00:04:55.389> can<00:04:56.169> also<00:04:56.260> go<00:04:56.620> in<00:04:56.800> and<00:04:56.950> create

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
at home I can also go in and create

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.060 
at home I can also go in and create
documents<00:04:58.240> using<00:04:58.419> something<00:04:59.380> called<00:04:59.560> super

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
documents using something called super

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.350 
documents using something called super
note<00:05:00.220> and<00:05:00.400> super<00:05:00.640> no<00:05:00.760> it's<00:05:00.910> really<00:05:01.180> cool

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
note and super no it's really cool

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.440 
note and super no it's really cool
because<00:05:02.460> for<00:05:03.460> example<00:05:03.490> you<00:05:03.820> could<00:05:04.030> do<00:05:04.180> your

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
because for example you could do your

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.159 
because for example you could do your
math<00:05:04.840> homework<00:05:04.870> with<00:05:05.350> this<00:05:06.300> could<00:05:07.300> you<00:05:07.540> draw

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
math homework with this could you draw

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:14.100 
math homework with this could you draw
my<00:05:08.320> fractions<00:05:08.890> all<00:05:09.160> kind<00:05:09.370> of<00:05:09.430> things<00:05:09.520> but<00:05:13.110> so

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
my fractions all kind of things but so

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.200 
my fractions all kind of things but so
if<00:05:14.919> you<00:05:15.100> my<00:05:15.190> math<00:05:15.370> homework<00:05:15.400> actually<00:05:15.940> go<00:05:16.060> back

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
if you my math homework actually go back

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.700 
if you my math homework actually go back
and<00:05:16.419> delete<00:05:16.540> each<00:05:16.900> of<00:05:17.110> these<00:05:17.200> characters

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
and delete each of these characters

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.640 
and delete each of these characters
individually<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:19.390> way<00:05:19.510> i<00:05:19.540> inputted<00:05:20.020> them<00:05:20.260> or

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
individually the way i inputted them or

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.740 
individually the way i inputted them or
I<00:05:20.710> could<00:05:21.220> you<00:05:21.790> know<00:05:21.820> input<00:05:22.270> them<00:05:22.419> all<00:05:22.600> at<00:05:22.720> once

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
I could you know input them all at once

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.870 
I could you know input them all at once
and<00:05:23.229> then<00:05:23.620> delete<00:05:24.040> them<00:05:24.220> all<00:05:24.340> on<00:05:24.460> so<00:05:24.760> it's

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
and then delete them all on so it's

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.430 
and then delete them all on so it's
really<00:05:25.030> cool<00:05:25.270> feature<00:05:25.540> you<00:05:26.139> could<00:05:26.290> also

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
really cool feature you could also
