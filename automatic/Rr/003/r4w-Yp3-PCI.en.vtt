there<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.820> these<00:01:57.810> people<00:01:58.340> want<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.460> improve

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
there to these people want to improve

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.060 
there to these people want to improve
their<00:02:00.000> English<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.659> they're<00:02:01.229> eager<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.619> do<00:02:01.860> so

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
their English and they're eager to do so

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.969 
their English and they're eager to do so
and<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.729> think<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:04.020> number<00:02:04.320> one<00:02:04.500> thing<00:02:04.530> to

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
and I think that the number one thing to

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.319 
and I think that the number one thing to
being<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.219> good<00:02:05.369> teacher<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.850> having<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.180> good

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
being a good teacher is having a good

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.990 
being a good teacher is having a good
attitude<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:07.380> smile<00:02:08.129> goes<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.849> long<00:02:09.149> way<00:02:09.420> with

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
attitude a smile goes a long way with

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.830 
attitude a smile goes a long way with
job<00:02:10.470> coming<00:02:11.470> into<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:12.100> session<00:02:12.310> on<00:02:12.520> time<00:02:12.840> being

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
job coming into a session on time being

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.310 
job coming into a session on time being
excited<00:02:14.740> and<00:02:15.130> being<00:02:16.000> instructive<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:17.050> think

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
excited and being instructive I think

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.970 
excited and being instructive I think
are<00:02:17.560> just<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.430> three<00:02:18.700> biggest<00:02:19.180> things<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.980> I

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
are just the three biggest things and I

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.830 
are just the three biggest things and I
think<00:02:21.280> it's<00:02:21.400> important<00:02:21.820> to<00:02:21.910> say<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.120> you

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
think it's important to say that you

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.180 
think it's important to say that you
don't<00:02:23.050> have<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.350> be<00:02:23.530> afraid<00:02:23.710> to<00:02:23.980> be

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
don't have to be afraid to be

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.410 
don't have to be afraid to be
instructive<00:02:24.820> you<00:02:25.510> should<00:02:25.780> be<00:02:25.990> able<00:02:26.740> to<00:02:27.390> tell<00:02:28.390> a

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
instructive you should be able to tell a

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.550 
instructive you should be able to tell a
student<00:02:28.690> when<00:02:29.020> they're<00:02:29.170> doing<00:02:29.350> something

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
student when they're doing something

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.230 
student when they're doing something
wrong<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.100> should<00:02:30.280> be<00:02:30.370> able<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.760> correct<00:02:30.910> them

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
wrong you should be able to correct them

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.970 
wrong you should be able to correct them
effectively<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.230> mean<00:02:32.440> you<00:02:32.500> don't<00:02:32.590> have<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:32.830> be

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
effectively I mean you don't have to be

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.670 
effectively I mean you don't have to be
like<00:02:33.130> mean<00:02:33.310> about<00:02:33.550> it<00:02:33.610> but<00:02:34.030> um<00:02:34.240> you<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.470> should

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
like mean about it but um you you should

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.110 
like mean about it but um you you should
feel<00:02:35.830> free<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.100> correct<00:02:36.459> them<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:36.670> mean<00:02:36.880> that's

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
feel free to correct them I mean that's

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.550 
feel free to correct them I mean that's
that's<00:02:37.480> what<00:02:37.630> they're<00:02:37.780> paying<00:02:37.990> for<00:02:38.140> that's

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
that's what they're paying for that's

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.530 
that's what they're paying for that's
the<00:02:38.800> service<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.400> they<00:02:39.550> want<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.390> think

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
the service that they want so I think

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.090 
the service that they want so I think
that's<00:02:40.840> also<00:02:40.990> an<00:02:41.200> important<00:02:41.590> part<00:02:41.709> of<00:02:41.830> being<00:02:42.010> a

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
that's also an important part of being a

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.860 
that's also an important part of being a
good<00:02:42.250> teacher<00:02:42.489> is<00:02:42.730> being<00:02:43.060> instructive<00:02:43.630> and

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
good teacher is being instructive and

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.410 
good teacher is being instructive and
knowing<00:02:44.230> when<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.070> step<00:02:45.400> in<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:45.940> correct<00:02:46.120> a

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
knowing when to step in and correct a

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.699 
knowing when to step in and correct a
student<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.739> then<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.790> last<00:02:49.380> helpful<00:02:50.380> hint<00:02:50.560> I

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
student and then the last helpful hint I

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.990 
student and then the last helpful hint I
would<00:02:50.920> say<00:02:51.280> for<00:02:51.760> being<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.239> good<00:02:52.480> teacher<00:02:52.780> is

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
would say for being a good teacher is

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.340 
would say for being a good teacher is
mapping<00:02:55.000> out<00:02:55.239> a<00:02:55.300> trajectory<00:02:55.900> for<00:02:56.200> your

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
mapping out a trajectory for your

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.670 
mapping out a trajectory for your
student<00:02:56.709> so<00:02:57.010> when<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:57.940> start<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.870> session<00:02:59.260> I<00:02:59.440> like

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
student so when I start a session I like

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.760 
student so when I start a session I like
to<00:02:59.890> start<00:03:00.250> off<00:03:00.400> by<00:03:00.459> saying<00:03:00.730> okay<00:03:01.300> like<00:03:01.770> judging

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
to start off by saying okay like judging

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
to start off by saying okay like judging
from<00:03:03.070> what<00:03:03.340> you've<00:03:03.459> said<00:03:03.670> in<00:03:03.760> your

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
from what you've said in your

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.420 
from what you've said in your
introduction<00:03:04.360> I<00:03:04.840> think<00:03:05.380> that<00:03:05.650> this<00:03:06.070> is<00:03:06.280> what

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
introduction I think that this is what

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.949 
introduction I think that this is what
we<00:03:06.580> should<00:03:06.790> do<00:03:06.970> with<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.209> time<00:03:07.420> we<00:03:07.570> have<00:03:07.750> today

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
we should do with the time we have today

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.920 
we should do with the time we have today
and<00:03:08.290> then<00:03:08.860> at<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.190> end<00:03:09.340> of<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.640> session

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
and then at the end of the session

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.810 
and then at the end of the session
giving<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:11.020> quick<00:03:11.230> synopsis<00:03:11.620> like<00:03:12.220> oh<00:03:12.430> this<00:03:12.670> is

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
giving a quick synopsis like oh this is

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.550 
giving a quick synopsis like oh this is
what<00:03:13.000> we<00:03:13.120> did<00:03:13.300> today<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.870> then<00:03:14.290> this<00:03:14.410> is

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
what we did today and then this is

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.729 
what we did today and then this is
really<00:03:14.680> important<00:03:15.280> is<00:03:16.260> planning<00:03:17.260> what<00:03:17.590> you're

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
really important is planning what you're

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.440 
really important is planning what you're
gonna<00:03:17.860> do<00:03:18.130> next<00:03:18.340> with<00:03:18.610> that<00:03:18.760> student<00:03:19.000> saying

what I want to do next time when we
speak<00:03:23.110> next<00:03:23.380> time<00:03:23.650> because<00:03:24.370> that<00:03:24.640> encourages

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
speak next time because that encourages

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.699 
speak next time because that encourages
them<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.660> come<00:03:25.840> back<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:26.320> site<00:03:26.560> it

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
them to come back to this site it

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.560 
them to come back to this site it
encourages<00:03:27.250> them<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.430> purchase<00:03:27.730> your<00:03:28.060> session

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
encourages them to purchase your session

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.310 
encourages them to purchase your session
and<00:03:29.260> it<00:03:29.830> also<00:03:29.980> shows<00:03:30.459> them<00:03:30.730> that<00:03:31.320> they're

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
and it also shows them that they're

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.050 
and it also shows them that they're
going<00:03:32.650> to<00:03:32.769> benefit<00:03:33.130> from<00:03:33.190> schema<00:03:33.640> talk<00:03:33.820> in<00:03:33.970> the

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
going to benefit from schema talk in the

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.310 
going to benefit from schema talk in the
long<00:03:34.299> run<00:03:34.480> which<00:03:34.660> i<00:03:34.780> think<00:03:34.840> is<00:03:35.110> really

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
long run which i think is really

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.620 
long run which i think is really
important<00:03:35.769> you<00:03:35.830> need<00:03:35.980> to<00:03:36.010> make<00:03:36.280> it<00:03:36.730> clear<00:03:37.060> how

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
important you need to make it clear how

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.750 
important you need to make it clear how
schema<00:03:38.080> top<00:03:38.290> can<00:03:38.620> help<00:03:38.829> them<00:03:39.010> improve<00:03:39.220> over

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
schema top can help them improve over

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.720 
schema top can help them improve over
time<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.360> by<00:03:41.230> just<00:03:41.860> giving<00:03:42.190> like<00:03:42.340> a<00:03:42.370> little

grade and nothing helped me learn

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.370 
grade and nothing helped me learn
concepts<00:04:56.900> better<00:04:57.080> than<00:04:57.500> explaining<00:04:57.950> them<00:04:58.250> and

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
concepts better than explaining them and

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.500 
concepts better than explaining them and

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
your words explain things that you

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.760 
your words explain things that you
haven't<00:05:14.240> had<00:05:14.450> to<00:05:14.630> explain<00:05:14.990> in<00:05:15.140> a<00:05:15.200> long<00:05:15.380> time<00:05:15.590> it

haven't had to explain in a long time it

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.230 
haven't had to explain in a long time it

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.840 
really keeps you on your toes I've
gotten<00:05:17.780> questions<00:05:17.990> between<00:05:18.680> about<00:05:19.370> what's

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
gotten questions between about what's

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.590 
gotten questions between about what's
the<00:05:19.970> difference<00:05:20.000> between<00:05:21.700> should<00:05:22.700> could<00:05:23.330> and

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
the difference between should could and

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.230 
the difference between should could and
would<00:05:23.840> I've<00:05:24.410> never<00:05:25.370> had<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:25.700> think<00:05:25.730> about<00:05:25.940> that

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
would I've never had to think about that

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.520 
would I've never had to think about that
before<00:05:26.420> but<00:05:26.780> actually<00:05:27.050> having<00:05:27.320> to<00:05:27.410> think

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
before but actually having to think

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.380 
before but actually having to think
about<00:05:27.710> that<00:05:28.010> analytically<00:05:28.610> was<00:05:28.820> was<00:05:29.360> a

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
about that analytically was was a

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.540 
about that analytically was was a
challenge<00:05:29.840> and<00:05:30.110> I<00:05:30.200> think<00:05:30.410> that<00:05:30.590> schema<00:05:31.340> talk

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
challenge and I think that schema talk

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.370 
challenge and I think that schema talk
really<00:05:31.790> helps<00:05:32.120> you<00:05:32.270> think<00:05:32.570> in<00:05:32.720> a<00:05:32.810> in<00:05:33.080> a

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
really helps you think in a in a

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.630 
really helps you think in a in a
different<00:05:33.410> way<00:05:33.950> than<00:05:34.190> you<00:05:34.310> would<00:05:34.460> normally

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
different way than you would normally

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.330 
different way than you would normally
think<00:05:35.150> on<00:05:35.360> a<00:05:35.390> day<00:05:35.600> to<00:05:35.660> day<00:05:35.870> basis<00:05:36.290> and<00:05:36.590> I<00:05:37.070> think

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
think on a day to day basis and I think

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.850 
think on a day to day basis and I think
that<00:05:38.050> analytical<00:05:39.050> type<00:05:39.200> of<00:05:39.380> thinking<00:05:39.680> is

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
that analytical type of thinking is

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.980 
that analytical type of thinking is
really<00:05:40.160> helpful<00:05:40.460> when<00:05:40.820> you're<00:05:41.390> trying<00:05:41.660> to

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
really helpful when you're trying to

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.680 
really helpful when you're trying to
break<00:05:42.170> into<00:05:42.410> the<00:05:42.680> job<00:05:43.100> world<00:05:43.400> especially<00:05:44.240> when

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
break into the job world especially when

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.170 
break into the job world especially when
it<00:05:44.780> comes<00:05:44.990> to<00:05:45.170> interviews<00:05:45.710> and<00:05:45.980> and<00:05:46.250> case

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
it comes to interviews and and case

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.230 
it comes to interviews and and case
studies<00:05:47.570> and<00:05:47.810> things<00:05:48.020> like<00:05:48.200> that<00:05:48.260> that

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
studies and things like that that

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.840 
studies and things like that that
experience<00:05:50.240> is<00:05:50.420> really<00:05:50.660> beneficial<00:05:51.200> and<00:05:51.850> not

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
experience is really beneficial and not

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.940 
experience is really beneficial and not
only<00:05:52.970> that<00:05:53.300> but<00:05:53.570> I<00:05:53.840> think<00:05:53.960> an<00:05:54.320> important<00:05:54.770> part

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
only that but I think an important part

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.620 
only that but I think an important part
of<00:05:55.100> working<00:05:55.430> for<00:05:55.610> schema<00:05:55.820> talk<00:05:56.090> is<00:05:56.270> that<00:05:56.420> it

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
of working for schema talk is that it

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.970 
of working for schema talk is that it
helps<00:05:56.780> you<00:05:57.200> train<00:05:58.130> to<00:05:58.400> meet<00:05:58.550> new<00:05:58.760> people<00:05:59.980> I've

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
about anything from the weather to the

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.070 
about anything from the weather to the
stock<00:06:23.750> market<00:06:24.230> to<00:06:24.680> your<00:06:25.430> studies<00:06:26.300> everything

and every anything in between

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.659 
and every anything in between
and<00:06:28.670> I<00:06:29.360> think<00:06:29.420> schema<00:06:29.960> talk<00:06:30.169> really<00:06:30.919> helps<00:06:31.430> you

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
and I think schema talk really helps you

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:33.250 
and I think schema talk really helps you
acclimate<00:06:32.630> to<00:06:32.660> those

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:33.260 
acclimate to those

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.230 
acclimate to those
of<00:06:33.380> situations<00:06:34.100> it<00:06:34.370> it<00:06:34.670> keeps<00:06:34.880> you<00:06:35.090> on<00:06:35.120> your

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
of situations it it keeps you on your

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.430 
of situations it it keeps you on your
toes

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
toes

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.130 
toes
it<00:06:36.950> teaches<00:06:37.490> you<00:06:37.670> how<00:06:37.700> to<00:06:38.140> communicate

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:39.140 
it teaches you how to communicate

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.530 
it teaches you how to communicate
effectively<00:06:39.650> in<00:06:40.370> a<00:06:40.670> situation<00:06:41.240> that<00:06:41.420> really

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 
effectively in a situation that really

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.080 
effectively in a situation that really
that<00:06:42.050> really<00:06:42.230> usually<00:06:42.470> is<00:06:42.800> awkward<00:06:43.250> meeting

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
that really usually is awkward meeting

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.850 
that really usually is awkward meeting
new<00:06:44.300> people<00:06:44.330> is<00:06:44.690> never<00:06:45.460> easy<00:06:46.460> at<00:06:46.970> first

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
new people is never easy at first

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.000 
new people is never easy at first
so<00:06:49.250> schema<00:06:49.970> talk<00:06:50.240> is<00:06:50.510> definitely<00:06:51.440> a<00:06:51.710> learning
