00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
by absorbing it a lot better

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.469 
by absorbing it a lot better
it<00:01:00.559> also<00:01:00.710> has<00:01:00.949> fantastic<00:01:01.370> thermo<00:01:01.999> qualities

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:02.479 
it also has fantastic thermo qualities

this<00:01:45.740> is<00:01:45.920> increases<00:01:46.789> the<00:01:46.939> surface<00:01:47.149> area<00:01:47.420> of

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
this is increases the surface area of

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.480 
this is increases the surface area of
the<00:01:47.780> actual<00:01:48.020> stitch<00:01:48.259> in<00:01:48.409> itself<00:01:48.799> giving<00:01:49.369> it

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
the actual stitch in itself giving it

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.980 
the actual stitch in itself giving it
more<00:01:49.640> strength<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:50.299> obviously<00:01:50.570> prevents<00:01:50.869> any

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
more strength and obviously prevents any

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.270 
more strength and obviously prevents any
ripping<00:01:51.259> or<00:01:51.380> tearing<00:01:51.530> when<00:01:51.950> you're<00:01:52.039> trying<00:01:52.159> to

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
ripping or tearing when you're trying to

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.819 
ripping or tearing when you're trying to
put<00:01:52.429> the<00:01:52.460> wetsuit<00:01:52.909> on<00:01:53.380> further<00:01:54.380> up<00:01:54.619> we<00:01:54.740> have

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
put the wetsuit on further up we have

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.740 
put the wetsuit on further up we have
these<00:01:54.950> preformed<00:01:55.579> sections<00:01:56.000> on<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.299> elbows

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
these preformed sections on the elbows

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.719 
these preformed sections on the elbows
this<00:01:57.320> just<00:01:57.530> reduces<00:01:57.649> any<00:01:58.070> resistance<00:01:58.549> when

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
this just reduces any resistance when

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:59.770 
this just reduces any resistance when
you've<00:01:58.850> actually<00:01:58.939> got<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.240> suit<00:01:59.420> on<00:01:59.539> so<00:01:59.570> you

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
you've actually got the suit on so you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.830 
you've actually got the suit on so you
can<00:01:59.899> move<00:01:59.990> your<00:02:00.049> arms<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.469> lot<00:02:00.590> more<00:02:00.770> freely<00:02:01.159> and

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
can move your arms a lot more freely and

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.859 
can move your arms a lot more freely and
prevents<00:02:02.840> any<00:02:02.899> like<00:02:03.200> I<00:02:03.229> said<00:02:03.439> resistance<00:02:04.869> okay

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
prevents any like I said resistance okay

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.270 
prevents any like I said resistance okay
so<00:02:06.020> taking<00:02:06.259> a<00:02:06.350> look<00:02:06.380> at<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.649> leg<00:02:06.799> sections

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
so taking a look at the leg sections

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.100 
so taking a look at the leg sections
then<00:02:07.520> there<00:02:08.210> are<00:02:08.270> these<00:02:08.360> knee<00:02:08.509> pads<00:02:08.780> on<00:02:08.960> the

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
then there are these knee pads on the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.719 
then there are these knee pads on the
front<00:02:09.410> here<00:02:09.679> it's<00:02:09.950> just<00:02:10.100> made<00:02:10.220> of<00:02:10.310> a<00:02:10.369> slightly

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
front here it's just made of a slightly

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.570 
front here it's just made of a slightly
thicker<00:02:11.150> more<00:02:11.390> abrasive<00:02:11.810> material<00:02:12.379> on<00:02:12.580> the

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
thicker more abrasive material on the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.699 
thicker more abrasive material on the
ankles<00:02:13.970> again<00:02:14.269> we<00:02:14.420> have<00:02:14.599> this<00:02:14.750> graphite<00:02:15.230> seal

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
ankles again we have this graphite seal

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:16.960 
ankles again we have this graphite seal
system

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
system

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.760 
system
obviously<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.390> shiny<00:02:17.630> era<00:02:17.900> neoprene<00:02:18.500> just

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
obviously the shiny era neoprene just

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.860 
obviously the shiny era neoprene just
creates<00:02:19.520> a<00:02:19.610> better<00:02:19.760> contact<00:02:20.240> between<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.720> in

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
creates a better contact between you in

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.810 
creates a better contact between you in
the<00:02:20.960> wet<00:02:21.110> so<00:02:21.380> again<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.040> prevent<00:02:22.280> any<00:02:22.430> flushing

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
the wet so again to prevent any flushing

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.270 
the wet so again to prevent any flushing
a<00:02:23.110> leg<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.230> themselves<00:02:24.590> are<00:02:24.740> actually<00:02:24.830> pre

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
a leg of themselves are actually pre

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.920 
a leg of themselves are actually pre
shaped<00:02:25.550> as<00:02:25.790> well<00:02:25.970> this<00:02:26.450> makes<00:02:26.660> them<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.840> lot

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
shaped as well this makes them a lot

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.900 
shaped as well this makes them a lot
easier<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.410> actually<00:02:27.440> put<00:02:27.920> on<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.370> there's

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
easier to actually put on and there's

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.850 
easier to actually put on and there's
also<00:02:29.030> less<00:02:29.240> resistance<00:02:29.840> when<00:02:30.080> you're<00:02:30.260> trying

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
also less resistance when you're trying

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.100 
also less resistance when you're trying
to<00:02:30.920> move<00:02:31.040> in<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.280> wetsuit<00:02:31.610> as<00:02:31.730> well<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:32.210> lowers

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
to move in the wetsuit as well so lowers

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.980 
to move in the wetsuit as well so lowers
your<00:02:33.200> fatigue<00:02:33.470> well<00:02:33.740> dive<00:02:33.950> in<00:02:34.160> okay<00:02:34.930> on<00:02:35.930> the

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
your fatigue well dive in okay on the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.540 
your fatigue well dive in okay on the
back<00:02:36.110> of<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.290> wetsuit<00:02:36.740> then<00:02:36.920> Mario's<00:02:37.430> have

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
back of the wetsuit then Mario's have

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.250 
back of the wetsuit then Mario's have
included<00:02:37.910> this<00:02:38.030> back<00:02:38.240> protection<00:02:38.810> system

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
included this back protection system

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.870 
included this back protection system
this<00:02:39.920> is<00:02:40.070> just<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.310> slightly<00:02:40.520> thickened

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
this is just a slightly thickened
