like<00:00:57.150> half<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.690> football<00:00:57.870> team<00:00:58.350> was<00:00:58.680> there

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
like half the football team was there

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.070 
like half the football team was there
and<00:00:59.220> actively<00:00:59.670> involved<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.300> ridding<00:01:00.960> on
