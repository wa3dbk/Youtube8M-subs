stove<00:02:07.810> C<00:02:08.530> as<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:08.739> can<00:02:08.860> see<00:02:09.039> on<00:02:09.129> the<00:02:09.220> box<00:02:09.459> here

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
stove C as you can see on the box here

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.619 
stove C as you can see on the box here
your<00:02:11.379> stove<00:02:12.129> actually<00:02:12.640> sits<00:02:13.030> on<00:02:13.269> the<00:02:13.390> ground

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
your stove actually sits on the ground

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.440 
your stove actually sits on the ground
or<00:02:13.930> on<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.140> table<00:02:14.319> and<00:02:14.680> then<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.940> braided

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
or on the table and then that braided

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.530 
or on the table and then that braided
steel<00:02:16.870> hose<00:02:17.489> connects<00:02:18.489> to<00:02:18.700> your<00:02:18.879> propane<00:02:19.330> Bob

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
so this is a lot more sturdy because

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.140 
so this is a lot more sturdy because
it's<00:02:22.870> lower<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.379> ground<00:02:23.819> so<00:02:24.819> here's<00:02:25.030> the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
it's lower to the ground so here's the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.059 
it's lower to the ground so here's the
