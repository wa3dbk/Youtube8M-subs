 smartphone or tablet or maybe phablet 5 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.340
 or 10 inches and maybe 6 in huge 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.190
 the assortment of getting confused is very easy 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.849
 the middle ground is very difficult to catch 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.849
 she is still there 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.800
 Hello everyone, Katya and you are watching 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.080
 video review of technology from the company allo in 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.300
 which I will introduce you to the bottom one of 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:30.510
 two and with three 7-inch tablet 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:33.120
 amines a 07 03 sep 07 03 07 00 2 of them 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.010
 can be safely attributed to the category of large 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.290
 phablets you can call them 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.250
 and for convenience we will call them as a 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.530
 shake 35 let's start the traditional design 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.760
 the easiest tablet in terms of 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.980
 a3 design 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.649
 matt black plastic monolithic not 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.170
 removable back panel with a little speaker 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.940
 more interesting plastic sweater back 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.789
 the panels are also black only 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.890
 semi-matt + camera and flash under 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.350
 removable panel are two slots 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.059
 under sim card and slot for micro sd 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.890
 all five look different 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.619
 more interesting texture of small 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.560
 squares iridescent 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.799
 it was lighting similar to digital 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.259
 camouflage looks very cool here too 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.840
 there is a camera true without flash and removable 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.680
 the panel under which the slots for 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.049
 two simok 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.750
 and micro sd LCD about frontal design 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.390
 panels say nothing this is a tablet and. 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.759
 the only thing different from a three 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.640
 tablet models si bring 5 so this 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.450
 the presence of conversational dynamics 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:40.580
 the dimensions of the devices are from rim 194 to 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:45.350
 118 and 11 6 millimeters citrine 188 5 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:48.650
 on 100 85 and on 11 millimeters and 5 188 on 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.660
 108 and by 11 millimeters by the way to all 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.310
 three models are perfect covers 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.770
 keyboard nomi thanks to them can 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.250
 turn the tablet into a small but proud 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.190
 netbook 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.220
 Well, let's talk about the performance of a3 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.759
 equipped with a 2-core rockchip processor 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.420
 rk 3188 operating at a frequency of 1 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.690
 gigahertz 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.870
 RAM 512 megabytes all three 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.840
 hides its core dual core mtk mt 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.730
 83 12d 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.820
 running at 1 and 3 gigahertz 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.890
 RAM also 512 megabytes 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.320
 all five thinks dual core processor 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.850
 mtk 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:30.739
 mt880 32 7 with a frequency of 1 and 3 gigahertz 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.350
 RAM had one more 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.239
 gigabyte the whole trinity is equipped with video from 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.610
 measles tilly mali 400 mb 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.650
 maybe the hardest games are 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.170
 The tablet is not on the shoulder with most 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.019
 most hit games they cope very 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.610
 easy all three devices have 8 gigabytes 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.120
 memory and memory card support 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.430
 micro sd format up to 16 gigs 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.480
 Naturally the whole triple equipped wai 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.470
 fay modules 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.720
 bluetooth and gps only have ce-5 mustache 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.830
 323 such models there is no ti5 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.950
 support 3g 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.680
 c3 only supports 2g a3 in general 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.730
 SIM card slots 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.980
 batteries in all three tablets 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.940
 capacious enough to hold out all 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.920
 day in hard mode use a3 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.430
 2200 milliampere hours all three two thousand 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.670
 500 milliampere hours aussi 5 2800 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.120
 miliamper hours let's talk about displays all 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.879
 three displays have the same resolution 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.190
 1024 by 600 at identical density 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.980
 pixels at 160 dpi 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.549
 the only difference is in the matrices and shake 3 have 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.829
 titty matrix of the 5th ps axis in the case of a3 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:43.370
 if three would like a little more angles 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.620
 review and color saturation ty5 me in 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.959
 Overall suits both in viewing angles so 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.180
 and by color talking about these cameras 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.190
 tablets can say the following are those who 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.510
 want to be deadly photographers 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.209
 buy SLRs 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.459
 and those who want to become the stars of instagram 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.310
 buy camera phones whose value 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.739
 exceeds the total value of all our 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.930
 3 tablets a3 equipped only 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.639
 front camera at 0 3 megapixels 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.310
 which shoots photos and videos in 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:12.799
 640 by 480 resolution 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.470
 for video, all three will be fine 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.150
 already equipped with two cameras and a flash 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.060
 front camera is the same as in 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.270
 models and 30 3 megapixels photos and videos 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.280
 comes out with a resolution of 640 by 480 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.160
 main 2 megapixel shoots 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:32.090
 1600 resolution to 1200 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.520
 and the video resolution of 1280 by 720 all 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.750
 five also equipped with two cameras true 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.120
 already without flash 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.840
 frontal on 0 3 megapixels main 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.810
 on 2 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:46.880
 Frontal gives a photo in 720 resolution 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:50.000
 on 432 and the video is all in the same 640 by 480 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.840
 primary takes a photo in 1920 resolution 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.600
 at 1150 2 and video at 1280 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.430
 720 worth noting that all cameras are not 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.139
 replete with shooting modes they're in 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.360
 standard settings 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.810
 the whole trinity is running 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.940
 android 4 4 2 today fell into my hands 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.979
 immediately three tablets they all seem to be 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.860
 similar but it is only at first glance 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.960
 different design different characteristics 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.930
 support for two sim cards makes a model and si 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.630
 three and se-5 just an ultimatum device 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.510
 It seems to be both a tablet and a phone and a budget 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.280
 cost a3 good for its simplicity 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.050
 This device is perfect for those 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.000
 who would want a small price tag 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.550
 get acquainted with the operating system 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.090
 android what else caught so design 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:37.910
 5 this digital who just captivated me with 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.520
