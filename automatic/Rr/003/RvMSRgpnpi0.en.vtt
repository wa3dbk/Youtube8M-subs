too thick well it just dumps him off
it's<00:00:10.889> more<00:00:11.070> water<00:00:11.280> whatever<00:00:11.849> it's<00:00:12.210> two

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
ingredients you know um so I don't you

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.140 
ingredients you know um so I don't you
know<00:00:17.400> everybody<00:00:17.730> has<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.880> different

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
know everybody has a different

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.380 
know everybody has a different
consistency<00:00:18.390> they<00:00:18.840> like<00:00:19.050> but<00:00:19.830> generally<00:00:20.490> you

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
consistency they like but generally you

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.700 
consistency they like but generally you
want<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.689> mix<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.260> it's<00:00:22.410> going<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.560> take

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
want to mix it and it's going to take

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.529 
want to mix it and it's going to take
about<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.949> day<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:24.560> homogenized<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.760> you're

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
about a day to homogenized so and you're

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.509 
about a day to homogenized so and you're
going<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.720> want<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.109> you're<00:00:29.070> going<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.340> want<00:00:29.460> to

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
going to want to you're going to want to

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.770 
going to want to you're going to want to
use<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.849> before<00:00:30.510> it's<00:00:31.019> ready<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:32.390> a<00:00:33.390> lot<00:00:33.660> of

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
use it before it's ready and a lot of

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.720 
use it before it's ready and a lot of
times<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.170> will<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.469> go<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.280> clump<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
times it will just go and clump in the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.250 
times it will just go and clump in the
middle<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.239> maybe<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.540> want<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.750> stir<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.020> or

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
middle so maybe you want to stir it or

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.510 
middle so maybe you want to stir it or
if<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.380> have<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.500> thing<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.040> shake<00:00:38.340> it

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
if you have a thing like this shake it

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.190 
if you have a thing like this shake it
or<00:00:38.640> whatever<00:00:38.910> just<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.360> every<00:00:39.840> once<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.110> a

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
or whatever just it every once in a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.479 
or whatever just it every once in a
while<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:40.920> going<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.100> take<00:00:41.219> about<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.430> day

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
while but it's going to take about a day

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.209 
while but it's going to take about a day
before<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.540> ready<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.719> use<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.260> I've<00:00:44.070> had<00:00:44.190> a

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
before it's ready to use but I've had a

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.810 
before it's ready to use but I've had a
step<00:00:44.520> mix<00:00:44.760> for<00:00:45.090> months<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.489> it's<00:00:47.489> pretty<00:00:47.670> good

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
step mix for months so it's pretty good

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.670 
step mix for months so it's pretty good
and<00:00:47.969> then<00:00:48.059> what<00:00:48.239> consistency<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.289> know<00:00:49.379> Donna

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
and then what consistency you know Donna

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.700 
and then what consistency you know Donna
depends<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:51.149> know<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.780> it's<00:00:52.199> kind<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
depends you know that it's kind of the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.450 
depends you know that it's kind of the
consistency<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:54.000> like<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.660> use<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.170> guess

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
consistency that I like to use I guess

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.020 
consistency that I like to use I guess
so<00:00:56.489> whatever<00:00:57.590> whatever<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.920> think<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.730> like

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
so whatever whatever you think you like

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.670 
so whatever whatever you think you like
just<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.570> kind<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.809> got<00:01:00.930> experimental

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
just you just kind of got experimental

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.380 
just you just kind of got experimental
and<00:01:02.219> that's<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.460> beauty<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.180> tissue

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
and that's the beauty of like the tissue

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.270 
and that's the beauty of like the tissue
and<00:01:03.570> stuff<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.500> back<00:01:04.710> up<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.129> that

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
and stuff is you can back up with that

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.399 
and stuff is you can back up with that
make<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> practice<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.119> stuff<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:07.320> you

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
make the practice and stuff and if you

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.420 
make the practice and stuff and if you
ruin<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> paper<00:01:07.890> doesn't<00:01:08.159> make<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> difference

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
ruin a paper doesn't make a difference

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.280 
ruin a paper doesn't make a difference
so<00:01:09.890> when<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:10.920> back<00:01:11.490> oh<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.760> want<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> surface

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
so when I back oh you want a surface

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.870 
so when I back oh you want a surface
this<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.409> not<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.920> best<00:01:14.100> thing<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.700> because

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
this is not the best thing to do because

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.749 
this is not the best thing to do because
it's<00:01:15.180> got<00:01:15.330> these<00:01:15.450> ribs<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.189> if<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.310> see<00:01:17.520> on

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
it's got these ribs and if you see on

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.940 
it's got these ribs and if you see on
the<00:01:17.880> paper<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.420> did<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.470> see

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the paper that I did you can see

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.270 
the paper that I did you can see
something<00:01:20.909> ribbing<00:01:21.330> there<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:22.290> get<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.799> but

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
something ribbing there you get this but

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.149 
something ribbing there you get this but
once<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.030> start<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.570> what's<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.560> that's

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
once you start it what's that that's

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.789 
once you start it what's that that's
cool<00:01:26.490> some<00:01:26.759> models<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:28.049> might<00:01:28.229> want<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.590> yeah

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
cool some models you might want it yeah

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.060 
cool some models you might want it yeah
but<00:01:29.130> just<00:01:29.610> prescribe<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.060> good<00:01:31.070> okay

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
but just prescribe that good okay

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.490 
but just prescribe that good okay
alright<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.090> don't<00:01:33.420> go<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.840> class<00:01:34.110> all

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
alright so I don't go to this class all

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.800 
alright so I don't go to this class all
right<00:01:34.650> well<00:01:34.950> theory<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:36.030> goes<00:01:36.360> away<00:01:36.570> though

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
right well theory on it goes away though

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.030 
right well theory on it goes away though
once<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.290> pull<00:01:37.530> because<00:01:37.710> you're<00:01:37.890> going<00:01:37.979> to

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
once you pull because you're going to

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.350 
once you pull because you're going to
start<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.310> white<00:01:38.430> bowl<00:01:38.610> again<00:01:38.880> or<00:01:39.090> I'll<00:01:39.180> take

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
start to white bowl again or I'll take

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.030 
start to white bowl again or I'll take
that<00:01:39.509> muscle<00:01:39.930> stuff<00:01:40.229> away<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:40.770> not<00:01:40.860> that

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
that muscle stuff away so it's not that

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.830 
that muscle stuff away so it's not that
big<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.189> deal

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
big a deal

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.899 
big a deal
so<00:01:42.840> when<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.049> back<00:01:43.259> coat<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.740> start<00:01:44.700> from<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
so when I back coat I start from the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.440 
so when I back coat I start from the
center<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.710> I<00:01:46.880> usually<00:01:47.880> get<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.060> good<00:01:48.270> amount

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
center and I usually get a good amount

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.950 
center and I usually get a good amount
and<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:49.200> I'll<00:01:49.290> kind<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.590> work<00:01:50.720> out<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
and then I'll kind of work out to the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.749 
and then I'll kind of work out to the
edges<00:01:52.200> or<00:01:52.680> out<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.920> corners<00:01:55.159> and<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.430> just

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
edges or out to the corners and you just

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.100 
edges or out to the corners and you just
want<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.060> make<00:01:57.180> sure<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.719> paper<00:01:57.960> is

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
want to make sure that the paper is

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.499 
want to make sure that the paper is
pretty<00:01:58.469> well<00:01:58.710> saturated<00:01:59.180> so<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.240> don't<00:02:00.420> get

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
pretty well saturated so you don't get

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.830 
pretty well saturated so you don't get
the<00:02:00.659> paper<00:02:00.840> weapon<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.619> know<00:02:02.360> either<00:02:03.360> you

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
the paper weapon for you know either you

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.510 
the paper weapon for you know either you
know<00:02:03.960> if<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.530> if<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.890> ask<00:02:05.009> Michael<00:02:05.369> he'll

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
know if you if you ask Michael he'll

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.459 
know if you if you ask Michael he'll
tell<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.820> do<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.060> because<00:02:06.320> so<00:02:07.320> the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
tell you to do that because so the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.990 
tell you to do that because so the
reason<00:02:07.740> is

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
reason is

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.910 
reason is
the<00:02:08.360> moisture<00:02:08.720> comes<00:02:08.960> into<00:02:09.229> it<00:02:09.380> then<00:02:09.590> the

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
the moisture comes into it then the

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.160 
the moisture comes into it then the
paper<00:02:10.130> expands<00:02:11.800> but<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:14.540> know<00:02:14.690> you're

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
paper expands but you know you're

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.510 
paper expands but you know you're
getting<00:02:15.410> it<00:02:15.530> wet<00:02:15.680> right<00:02:15.860> now<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.280> it's<00:02:16.370> going

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
getting it wet right now and it's going

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.590 
getting it wet right now and it's going
to<00:02:16.610> expand<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.450> method<00:02:17.690> that<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:17.930> use

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
to expand and the method that I use

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.870 
to expand and the method that I use
you'll<00:02:20.600> see<00:02:20.900> why<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:22.130> kind<00:02:22.370> of<00:02:22.520> doesn't

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
you'll see why that kind of doesn't

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.330 
you'll see why that kind of doesn't
matter<00:02:23.060> so<00:02:23.750> much<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:27.680> good<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.010> pretty<00:02:28.310> good

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
matter so much so good it pretty good

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.520 
matter so much so good it pretty good
and<00:02:28.750> pretty<00:02:29.750> good<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.200> know<00:02:30.320> they<00:02:30.500> just

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
and pretty good and you know they just

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.870 
and pretty good and you know they just
kind<00:02:30.800> of<00:02:30.860> go<00:02:31.040> out<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.310> edges<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:31.790> then

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
kind of go out to the edges and then

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.850 
kind of go out to the edges and then
kind<00:02:32.150> of<00:02:32.180> fill<00:02:32.420> in<00:02:32.450> these<00:02:32.630> gaps<00:02:32.690> just<00:02:33.260> kind<00:02:33.830> of

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
kind of fill in these gaps just kind of

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.570 
kind of fill in these gaps just kind of
what<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.010> do<00:02:34.660> everybody<00:02:35.660> has<00:02:36.080> their<00:02:36.320> own

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
what I do everybody has their own

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.890 
what I do everybody has their own
technique<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:40.760> can<00:02:40.880> see<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.570> was<00:02:41.720> like

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
technique and you can see so it was like

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.840 
technique and you can see so it was like
really<00:02:42.050> wrinkly<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.740> now<00:02:42.860> that<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.670> moisture

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
really wrinkly and now that the moisture

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.400 
really wrinkly and now that the moisture
is<00:02:44.150> starting<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.570> set<00:02:44.810> in<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.080> stuff<00:02:45.290> like

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
is starting to set in and stuff like

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.900 
is starting to set in and stuff like
that<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:45.680> see<00:02:45.890> it's<00:02:46.010> getting<00:02:46.250> late<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:46.640> you

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
that you see it's getting late so you

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.460 
that you see it's getting late so you
like<00:02:47.060> less<00:02:47.240> of<00:02:47.420> us<00:02:47.540> start<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.080> flatten<00:02:48.410> out

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
like less of us start to flatten out

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.540 
like less of us start to flatten out
that's<00:02:49.310> really<00:02:49.550> why<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:50.080> don't<00:02:51.080> let<00:02:51.290> it<00:02:51.410> first<00:02:51.650> I

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
that's really why I don't let it first I

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:00.220 
that's really why I don't let it first I
kind<00:02:53.060> of<00:02:53.120> haven't<00:02:53.650> had<00:02:55.060> any<00:02:56.060> big<00:02:56.360> problems<00:02:59.230> so

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
kind of haven't had any big problems so

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.160 
kind of haven't had any big problems so
so<00:03:01.220> it's<00:03:01.370> pretty<00:03:01.550> good<00:03:01.790> in<00:03:01.940> saturated<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:02.690> now

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
so it's pretty good in saturated and now

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.530 
so it's pretty good in saturated and now
a<00:03:03.500> lot<00:03:04.160> of<00:03:04.280> times<00:03:04.459> if<00:03:04.730> you<00:03:04.850> just<00:03:05.030> if<00:03:05.240> you<00:03:05.300> just

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
a lot of times if you just if you just

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.970 
a lot of times if you just if you just
left<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.840> this<00:03:06.110> or<00:03:06.380> whatever<00:03:06.500> you<00:03:06.740> know<00:03:06.830> if<00:03:06.890> you

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
left it this or whatever you know if you

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.330 
left it this or whatever you know if you
flatten<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.430> out<00:03:07.520> and<00:03:07.880> everything<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:09.500> found

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
flatten it out and everything I found

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.210 
flatten it out and everything I found
that<00:03:10.790> as<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:11.510> will<00:03:11.720> dry<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.440> will<00:03:12.709> shrink<00:03:13.040> up

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
that as it will dry it will shrink up

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.320 
that as it will dry it will shrink up
and<00:03:13.280> then<00:03:13.970> when<00:03:14.090> it<00:03:14.180> does<00:03:14.360> if<00:03:14.660> it's<00:03:15.290> not<00:03:15.470> stuck

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
and then when it does if it's not stuck

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.560 
and then when it does if it's not stuck
to<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:18.170> surface<00:03:19.130> then<00:03:19.820> it<00:03:19.940> will<00:03:20.150> shrink<00:03:20.330> in<00:03:20.450> on

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
to the surface then it will shrink in on

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.509 
to the surface then it will shrink in on
a<00:03:20.600> war<00:03:20.900> but<00:03:21.050> it<00:03:21.140> won't<00:03:21.260> be<00:03:21.350> very<00:03:21.500> good<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:21.980> the

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
a war but it won't be very good so the

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.449 
a war but it won't be very good so the
technique<00:03:22.850> that<00:03:22.880> I<00:03:23.060> use<00:03:23.360> it<00:03:23.600> once<00:03:23.870> it's<00:03:24.459> once

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
technique that I use it once it's once

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.580 
technique that I use it once it's once
it's<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.880> kind<00:03:26.390> of<00:03:26.420> fully<00:03:26.630> saturated<00:03:27.200> there<00:03:27.440> or

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
it's a kind of fully saturated there or

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.320 
it's a kind of fully saturated there or
whatever<00:03:27.709> once<00:03:28.130> you've<00:03:28.220> painted<00:03:28.400> it<00:03:28.610> I<00:03:28.790> just

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
whatever once you've painted it I just

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.420 
whatever once you've painted it I just
go<00:03:29.450> ahead<00:03:29.660> and<00:03:29.780> lift<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:30.050> up<00:03:30.140> and<00:03:30.380> then<00:03:30.739> it's

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
go ahead and lift it up and then it's

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.509 
go ahead and lift it up and then it's
awkward<00:03:31.880> and<00:03:32.209> we'll<00:03:32.360> do<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.570> like<00:03:32.720> this<00:03:32.870> but

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
awkward and we'll do it like this but

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.810 
awkward and we'll do it like this but
kind<00:03:34.519> of<00:03:34.610> just<00:03:34.790> go<00:03:35.570> and<00:03:36.400> flip<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.610> right<00:03:37.760> over

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
kind of just go and flip it right over

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.070 
kind of just go and flip it right over
like<00:03:38.120> that<00:03:39.580> so<00:03:40.580> and<00:03:40.910> then<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.090> just<00:03:41.269> go<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:41.660> kind

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
like that so and then I just go and kind

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.410 
like that so and then I just go and kind
of<00:03:42.140> start<00:03:42.410> from<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.590> same<00:03:42.860> thing<00:03:43.850> here<00:03:44.209> you

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
of start from the same thing here you

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.720 
of start from the same thing here you
don't<00:03:44.900> really<00:03:45.049> need<00:03:45.380> much<00:03:45.730> methylcellulose

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
don't really need much methylcellulose

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.400 
don't really need much methylcellulose
at<00:03:46.880> this<00:03:47.000> point<00:03:47.799> but<00:03:49.209> kind<00:03:50.209> of<00:03:50.269> just<00:03:50.930> work<00:03:51.170> out

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
at this point but kind of just work out

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.199 
at this point but kind of just work out
some<00:03:52.400> of<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.519> bubbles<00:03:52.850> like<00:03:53.060> this

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.559 

I<00:04:00.019> found<00:04:01.019> that<00:04:01.260> this<00:04:02.060> doing<00:04:03.060> that<00:04:03.090> this<00:04:03.359> way

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
I found that this doing that this way

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.649 
I found that this doing that this way
will<00:04:06.739> allow<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:08.370> paper<00:04:08.640> to<00:04:09.030> stick<00:04:09.359> to<00:04:09.540> the

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
will allow the paper to stick to the

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.569 
will allow the paper to stick to the
surface<00:04:09.840> very<00:04:10.319> well<00:04:11.629> and<00:04:13.040> so<00:04:14.040> once<00:04:14.400> it<00:04:14.549> is

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
surface very well and so once it is

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:20.810 
surface very well and so once it is
drying<00:04:15.060> it<00:04:15.530> won't<00:04:18.079> it<00:04:19.079> won't<00:04:19.320> pull<00:04:20.190> and

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
drying it won't it won't pull and

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.629 
drying it won't it won't pull and
distort<00:04:21.329> so<00:04:21.750> you'll<00:04:21.900> have<00:04:22.139> good<00:04:22.949> service<00:04:23.220> and

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
distort so you'll have good service and

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:24.980 
distort so you'll have good service and
you<00:04:23.699> can<00:04:23.880> put<00:04:24.000> a<00:04:24.060> little<00:04:24.150> more<00:04:24.270> on<00:04:24.449> the<00:04:24.570> back<00:04:24.780> if

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
you can put a little more on the back if

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.510 
you can put a little more on the back if
you<00:04:25.050> want<00:04:25.139> I<00:04:25.560> just<00:04:25.740> kind<00:04:26.039> of<00:04:26.070> keep<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.310> brush

I'm sure so I have one as well
um<00:04:51.930> I<00:04:52.590> have<00:04:53.009> one<00:04:53.039> of<00:04:53.250> those<00:04:53.340> I<00:04:53.729> just<00:04:54.570> had<00:04:55.560> I've

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
um I have one of those I just had I've

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.029 
um I have one of those I just had I've
tried<00:04:56.220> it<00:04:56.400> this<00:04:57.389> works<00:04:57.690> this<00:04:58.590> works<00:04:58.770> really

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
tried it this works this works really

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:00.409 
tried it this works this works really
well<00:04:59.250> because<00:04:59.430> I<00:04:59.550> can<00:04:59.699> just<00:04:59.789> kind<00:05:00.150> of<00:05:00.180> get<00:05:00.330> in

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
well because I can just kind of get in

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.810 
well because I can just kind of get in
there<00:05:00.509> but<00:05:00.990> you<00:05:01.260> know<00:05:01.380> I<00:05:01.680> guess<00:05:02.280> my<00:05:02.400> technique

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
there but you know I guess my technique

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.189 
there but you know I guess my technique
is<00:05:02.970> as<00:05:03.180> you<00:05:03.300> can<00:05:03.449> see<00:05:03.599> it<00:05:03.690> kind<00:05:03.870> of<00:05:03.900> go<00:05:04.020> to<00:05:04.110> the

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
is as you can see it kind of go to the

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:08.589 
is as you can see it kind of go to the
corners<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:04.800> then<00:05:05.490> might<00:05:05.699> work<00:05:06.080> work<00:05:07.080> in

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
corners and then might work work in

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.930 
corners and then might work work in
similar<00:05:09.599> to<00:05:09.750> how<00:05:09.900> I<00:05:09.930> did<00:05:10.260> it<00:05:10.729> on<00:05:11.729> the<00:05:11.880> other

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
similar to how I did it on the other

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.060 
similar to how I did it on the other
side<00:05:12.500> look<00:05:13.500> make<00:05:13.830> sure<00:05:13.860> that<00:05:14.159> you<00:05:14.280> don't<00:05:14.400> have

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
side look make sure that you don't have

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.260 
side look make sure that you don't have
any<00:05:17.070> bubbles<00:05:18.000> look<00:05:18.300> and<00:05:19.370> then<00:05:20.370> that's<00:05:20.789> really

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
any bubbles look and then that's really

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.409 
any bubbles look and then that's really
it<00:05:22.199> right<00:05:22.590> there<00:05:22.830> so<00:05:23.250> that<00:05:24.060> if<00:05:24.210> you're<00:05:24.389> just

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
it right there so that if you're just

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.810 
it right there so that if you're just
doing<00:05:24.750> one<00:05:24.990> a<00:05:25.020> single<00:05:25.289> sheet<00:05:25.620> you're<00:05:26.490> pretty

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
doing one a single sheet you're pretty

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.189 
doing one a single sheet you're pretty
much<00:05:26.909> done

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
much done

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:32.540 
much done
and<00:05:28.349> then<00:05:29.340> you<00:05:29.460> can<00:05:29.580> just<00:05:29.729> let<00:05:29.940> it<00:05:30.060> sit<00:05:31.099> um<00:05:32.099> it

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
and then you can just let it sit um it

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.830 
and then you can just let it sit um it
actually<00:05:32.789> cooked<00:05:33.150> for<00:05:33.300> you<00:05:33.419> actually<00:05:33.539> dry
