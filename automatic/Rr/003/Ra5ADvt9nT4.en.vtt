00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
in natural wood flooring after wanting

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.010 
in natural wood flooring after wanting
tickets<00:00:25.610> through<00:00:25.939> what<00:00:26.150> we've<00:00:26.689> installed

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
tickets through what we've installed

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.250 
tickets through what we've installed
here<00:00:27.290> so<00:00:27.710> we're<00:00:28.550> putting<00:00:28.730> showing<00:00:29.150> a<00:00:29.330> stain

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
here so we're putting showing a stain

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.120 
here so we're putting showing a stain
maple<00:00:31.329> although<00:00:32.329> it's<00:00:32.509> a<00:00:32.720> stain<00:00:33.350> product<00:00:33.920> it's

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
maple although it's a stain product it's

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.130 
maple although it's a stain product it's
actually<00:00:34.430> it's<00:00:34.790> a<00:00:34.970> civic<00:00:35.390> resolution<00:00:35.870> state

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
actually it's a civic resolution state

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.810 
actually it's a civic resolution state
it's<00:00:36.440> not<00:00:36.530> a<00:00:36.590> solid<00:00:37.040> state<00:00:37.310> so<00:00:37.550> there's<00:00:37.700> going

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
it's not a solid state so there's going

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.060 
it's not a solid state so there's going
to<00:00:37.910> be<00:00:37.970> some<00:00:38.570> color<00:00:38.780> variation<00:00:39.380> even<00:00:39.860> in<00:00:39.980> this

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
to be some color variation even in this

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.720 
to be some color variation even in this
game<00:00:40.280> floor<00:00:40.640> as<00:00:40.940> you<00:00:41.570> can<00:00:41.690> see<00:00:41.870> here<00:00:42.520> you<00:00:43.520> see

little bit later than another box you're

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.180 
little bit later than another box you're
going<00:01:02.899> to<00:01:02.960> have<00:01:03.019> a<00:01:03.079> line<00:01:03.289> in<00:01:03.469> your<00:01:03.500> floor<00:01:03.920> as

going to have a line in your floor as
you<00:01:04.670> can<00:01:04.790> see<00:01:04.910> here<00:01:05.089> we<00:01:05.300> sort<00:01:05.600> of<00:01:05.660> try<00:01:06.230> to<00:01:06.260> mix

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
you can see here we sort of try to mix

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.650 
you can see here we sort of try to mix
up<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.100> floors<00:01:07.400> so<00:01:07.940> I<00:01:07.970> usually<00:01:08.270> like<00:01:08.360> to<00:01:08.420> work

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
up the floors so I usually like to work

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.570 
up the floors so I usually like to work
out<00:01:08.780> of<00:01:08.960> two<00:01:09.290> or<00:01:09.440> three<00:01:09.650> boxes<00:01:09.860> at<00:01:10.160> one<00:01:10.310> time

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
out of two or three boxes at one time

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.000 
out of two or three boxes at one time
just<00:01:11.300> spreading<00:01:11.990> out<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.170> pieces<00:01:12.470> taking<00:01:12.950> a

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
just spreading out the pieces taking a

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.830 
just spreading out the pieces taking a
look<00:01:13.130> at<00:01:13.250> what<00:01:13.370> we<00:01:13.520> have<00:01:13.730> to<00:01:14.270> make<00:01:14.420> sure<00:01:14.450> that

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
look at what we have to make sure that

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.370 
look at what we have to make sure that
we<00:01:14.930> don't<00:01:15.050> have<00:01:15.350> lines<00:01:16.040> in<00:01:16.310> your<00:01:16.340> floor<00:01:17.380> unless

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
we don't have lines in your floor unless

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.590 
we don't have lines in your floor unless
you<00:01:18.740> have<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:18.950> solid<00:01:19.400> state<00:01:19.820> floor<00:01:20.270> almost

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
you have the solid state floor almost

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.450 
you have the solid state floor almost
painted<00:01:21.260> floor<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:21.800> there<00:01:22.040> are<00:01:22.160> some<00:01:22.310> out

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
painted floor and there are some out

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.550 
painted floor and there are some out
there<00:01:22.490> you're<00:01:23.270> going<00:01:23.510> to<00:01:23.600> have<00:01:23.780> slight<00:01:24.320> color

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
there you're going to have slight color

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.170 
there you're going to have slight color
variation<00:01:25.070> that's<00:01:25.250> one<00:01:25.430> of<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.580> two<00:01:26.030> natural

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
variation that's one of the two natural

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.880 
variation that's one of the two natural
product<00:01:26.720> is<00:01:26.810> going<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.050> be<00:01:27.170> color<00:01:27.380> variation

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
product is going to be color variation

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.670 
product is going to be color variation
when<00:01:28.670> you're<00:01:28.820> working<00:01:28.970> with<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:29.720> naturally

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
when you're working with a naturally

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.430 
when you're working with a naturally
stained<00:01:31.100> or<00:01:31.430> an<00:01:31.610> actual<00:01:31.790> clear<00:01:32.450> coated<00:01:33.110> floor

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
stained or an actual clear coated floor

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.100 
stained or an actual clear coated floor
like<00:01:33.980> I<00:01:34.010> say<00:01:34.340> ever<00:01:34.460> read<00:01:34.730> Oh<00:01:34.760> a<00:01:35.090> white<00:01:35.630> oak<00:01:35.660> and

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
like I say ever read Oh a white oak and

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.560 
like I say ever read Oh a white oak and
hickory<00:01:36.500> that<00:01:37.340> has<00:01:37.490> a<00:01:37.520> clear<00:01:37.850> coat<00:01:38.060> stain<00:01:38.390> on

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
hickory that has a clear coat stain on

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.050 
hickory that has a clear coat stain on
history<00:01:39.140> facts<00:01:39.560> color<00:01:40.190> variation<00:01:40.790> it's<00:01:40.940> gonna

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
history facts color variation it's gonna

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.410 
history facts color variation it's gonna
be<00:01:41.150> NASA<00:01:41.360> you<00:01:41.960> can<00:01:42.080> have<00:01:42.230> middle<00:01:42.530> streaking

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
be NASA you can have middle streaking

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.510 
be NASA you can have middle streaking
just<00:01:44.420> even<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.690> way<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:45.020> grains<00:01:45.530> are<00:01:45.830> cut<00:01:46.130> or

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
just even the way the grains are cut or

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.010 
just even the way the grains are cut or
different<00:01:46.940> cups<00:01:47.120> of<00:01:47.300> the<00:01:47.360> grains<00:01:47.570> will<00:01:47.780> be

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
different cups of the grains will be

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.990 
different cups of the grains will be
different<00:01:48.260> color<00:01:48.590> variation<00:01:49.100> so<00:01:49.640> it's<00:01:49.790> very

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
different color variation so it's very

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.030 
different color variation so it's very
importantly<00:01:50.540> working<00:01:50.960> on<00:01:51.110> those<00:01:51.770> type<00:01:52.010> of

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
importantly working on those type of

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.120 
importantly working on those type of
floors<00:01:52.400> use<00:01:52.880> a<00:01:52.910> bigger<00:01:53.330> a<00:01:53.690> bigger<00:01:54.260> sample<00:01:54.740> set

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
floors use a bigger a bigger sample set

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.220 
floors use a bigger a bigger sample set
you<00:01:55.670> probably<00:01:55.970> use<00:01:56.180> seven<00:01:56.570> or<00:01:56.660> eight<00:01:56.750> boxes

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
you probably use seven or eight boxes

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.350 
you probably use seven or eight boxes
spread<00:01:57.650> out<00:01:57.800> all<00:01:57.980> over<00:01:58.010> the<00:01:58.520> floor<00:01:58.760> and<00:01:59.030> you'll

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
spread out all over the floor and you'll

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.150 
spread out all over the floor and you'll
