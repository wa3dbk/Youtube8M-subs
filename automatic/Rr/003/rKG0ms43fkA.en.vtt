think<00:02:43.110> it's<00:02:43.260> supposed<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.500> be<00:02:43.620> if<00:02:44.840> so<00:02:45.840> what<00:02:45.990> I

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
think it's supposed to be if so what I

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.470 
think it's supposed to be if so what I
heard<00:02:46.320> if<00:02:46.880> Superman<00:02:47.880> was<00:02:48.060> rushing<00:02:48.390> or
