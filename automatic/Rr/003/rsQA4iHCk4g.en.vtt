00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
and kind of marking them so that when he

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.730 
and kind of marking them so that when he
shot<00:01:57.450> was<00:01:57.659> all<00:01:57.780> bent<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.140> he<00:01:58.229> bent<00:01:58.439> them<00:01:58.619> as

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
shot was all bent and he bent them as

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.830 
shot was all bent and he bent them as
well<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.430> when<00:01:59.610> he<00:01:59.850> shuffled<00:02:00.570> he

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
well so that when he shuffled he

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.990 
well so that when he shuffled he
shuffled<00:02:01.350> certain<00:02:01.829> cards<00:02:02.159> at<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.310> top<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:02.850> he

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
shuffled certain cards at the top so he

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.700 
shuffled certain cards at the top so he
shuffled<00:02:03.420> maybe<00:02:03.600> average<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.200> top<00:02:04.469> or<00:02:04.649> he

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
shuffled maybe average to the top or he

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.190 
shuffled maybe average to the top or he
shuffled<00:02:05.390> sprawl<00:02:06.390> back<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.659> judgment<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
shuffled sprawl back of judgment to the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.960 
shuffled sprawl back of judgment to the
bottom<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.039> they<00:02:08.280> couldn't<00:02:08.520> draw<00:02:08.759> very

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
bottom so that they couldn't draw very

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.350 
bottom so that they couldn't draw very
well<00:02:09.030> whether<00:02:09.509> or<00:02:09.629> not<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.050> true

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
well whether or not this is true

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.270

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.170 
and he want every single one and that's
the<00:03:17.110> question<00:03:17.410> of<00:03:17.470> all<00:03:17.680> I<00:03:17.890> mean<00:03:18.489> he's<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.940> good

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
the question of all I mean he's a good

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.330 
the question of all I mean he's a good
player<00:03:19.300> and<00:03:19.750> he's<00:03:19.930> always<00:03:20.110> been<00:03:20.350> good<00:03:20.530> so<00:03:20.980> he

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
player and he's always been good so he

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.010 
player and he's always been good so he
could<00:03:21.610> do<00:03:21.880> that<00:03:22.060> but<00:03:22.510> he<00:03:22.660> does<00:03:22.840> it

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
could do that but he does it

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.330 
could do that but he does it
consistently<00:03:23.530> as<00:03:23.650> well<00:03:23.830> so<00:03:24.010> it's<00:03:24.130> kind<00:03:24.160> of

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
consistently as well so it's kind of

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.940 
consistently as well so it's kind of
like<00:03:24.489> whether<00:03:25.270> or<00:03:25.330> not<00:03:25.480> you<00:03:25.600> cheated<00:03:26.020> but<00:03:26.500> did

like whether or not you cheated but did

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.390 
like whether or not you cheated but did
he<00:03:27.250> Windows<00:03:28.230> truthfully<00:03:29.260> did<00:03:29.650> he<00:03:29.830> not<00:03:30.130> cheat

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
he Windows truthfully did he not cheat

really quick
yeah<00:03:37.750> supposedly<00:03:38.380> as<00:03:38.920> they<00:03:39.100> were<00:03:39.220> leaving<00:03:39.370> the

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
yeah supposedly as they were leaving the

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.820 
yeah supposedly as they were leaving the
venue<00:03:39.790> on<00:03:40.030> Sunday<00:03:40.390> they<00:03:41.050> noticed<00:03:41.440> him<00:03:41.560> filling

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
venue on Sunday they noticed him filling

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.210 
venue on Sunday they noticed him filling
out<00:03:41.950> a<00:03:41.980> form<00:03:42.310> and<00:03:43.080> he<00:03:44.080> was<00:03:44.530> filling<00:03:44.950> out<00:03:45.040> some

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
out a form and he was filling out some

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.680 
out a form and he was filling out some
kind<00:03:45.400> of<00:03:45.430> form<00:03:45.640> he<00:03:45.730> had<00:03:45.880> judges<00:03:46.239> around<00:03:46.450> him

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
kind of form he had judges around him

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.449 
kind of form he had judges around him
watching<00:03:47.020> and<00:03:47.140> fill<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.380> out<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:47.770> I<00:03:47.800> think<00:03:48.280> he

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
watching and fill it out so I think he

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.130 
watching and fill it out so I think he
