00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:09.680
 Well, today 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.450
 excavated yesterday was on Friday logically 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.580
 and well yesterday I stayed rumba with 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.090
 some friends some co-workers 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.490
 We had a super super bad right now because 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.500
 I'm with a little bit of a headache 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.900
 but then I have to enlist less 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.580
 to go to classes then I decided 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.769
 record them a little bit and then try the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.269
 new camera that they buy that is good 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.790
 to test the resolution and up 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.100
 then I will take them with me to the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.780
 university and then then from the 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.020
 university I have to go through the moon 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.600
 looking for the tripod because as you know 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.640

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.000

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.530
 I looked for it like crazy but I do not know what 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.200
 can find in your body is very 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.820

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.820

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.990

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.409

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.409
 they arrived 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.290
 but egalitarian 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.700
 It's never good then I'm here in the house 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.280

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.570

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.770

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.900
 You can use these parties because 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:06.180

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:09.689

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.560
 has the technique of pechito for example 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.110
 you have floral pattern and so your 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.180
 person the monkey for children who can 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.340
 use for your money but I liked it 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.830
 to save the camera that is super 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.810
 super tiny and we can give you another 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.810

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.610
 well they sent me this backpack 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.430
 but then you have a compartment for 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.620
 that you can save your note pencils 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.500
