00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
lid not a lot of blushes do that they

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.550 
lid not a lot of blushes do that they
tend<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.650> be<00:03:41.739> kind<00:03:42.190> of<00:03:42.280> more<00:03:43.090> like<00:03:43.560> this

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
tend to be kind of more like this

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.349 
tend to be kind of more like this
obviously<00:03:44.919> isn't<00:03:45.099> a<00:03:45.250> blush<00:03:45.459> but<00:03:45.729> you<00:03:46.000> can<00:03:46.150> see

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
obviously isn't a blush but you can see

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.899 
obviously isn't a blush but you can see
it's<00:03:46.479> like<00:03:46.659> clear<00:03:47.250> that's<00:03:48.250> how<00:03:48.400> I<00:03:48.430> find<00:03:48.729> that<00:03:48.849> a

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
it's like clear that's how I find that a

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.210 
it's like clear that's how I find that a
lot<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.329> blush<00:03:50.049> containers<00:03:50.650> are<00:03:50.799> so<00:03:50.949> that<00:03:51.069> you

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
lot of blush containers are so that you

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.240 
lot of blush containers are so that you
can<00:03:51.370> see<00:03:51.639> it

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
can see it

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.759 
can see it
they<00:03:54.250> have<00:03:54.400> a<00:03:54.430> mirror<00:03:54.849> and<00:03:55.030> they<00:03:55.569> match<00:03:55.870> so<00:03:56.739> I

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
they have a mirror and they match so I

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.589 
they have a mirror and they match so I
think<00:03:57.220> that's<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.459> really<00:03:57.669> cute<00:03:57.940> concept<00:03:58.449> I

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.750 
think that's a really cute concept I
don't<00:03:58.780> know<00:03:58.840> maybe<00:03:59.109> it's<00:03:59.319> just<00:03:59.379> me<00:03:59.530> I<00:03:59.799> also

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
Sephora but they have some really bright

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.029 
Sephora but they have some really bright
colors<00:04:42.270> which<00:04:43.270> I<00:04:43.479> love<00:04:43.810> because<00:04:44.169> I<00:04:44.349> find<00:04:44.860> that

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
colors which I love because I find that

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.360 
colors which I love because I find that
those<00:04:45.190> look<00:04:45.460> really<00:04:45.490> nice<00:04:45.970> on<00:04:46.330> all<00:04:46.810> skin<00:04:47.080> tones

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
those look really nice on all skin tones

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.839 
those look really nice on all skin tones
I<00:04:48.690> find<00:04:49.690> that<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.900> brighter<00:04:50.169> they<00:04:50.349> are<00:04:50.849> this

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
I find that the brighter they are this

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.540 
I find that the brighter they are this
sheer<00:04:52.360> that<00:04:52.630> you<00:04:52.750> put<00:04:52.990> them<00:04:53.139> on<00:04:53.349> the<00:04:54.069> easier

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
sheer that you put them on the easier

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.180 
sheer that you put them on the easier
they<00:04:54.789> are<00:04:54.819> to<00:04:54.970> go<00:04:55.240> on<00:04:55.569> all<00:04:56.050> skin<00:04:56.380> tones<00:04:56.590> I<00:04:56.889> find

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
they are to go on all skin tones I find

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.170 
they are to go on all skin tones I find
that<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:59.080> more<00:04:59.319> dull<00:04:59.740> colors<00:05:00.310> can<00:05:00.699> kind<00:05:00.970> of

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
that the more dull colors can kind of

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.899 
that the more dull colors can kind of
just<00:05:01.810> not<00:05:01.990> work<00:05:02.199> as<00:05:02.380> well<00:05:02.560> with<00:05:02.949> skin<00:05:03.220> tones<00:05:03.490> so

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:03.909 
just not work as well with skin tones so

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:06.899 
just not work as well with skin tones so
I<00:05:04.120> like<00:05:04.419> using<00:05:04.780> bright<00:05:04.990> blushes<00:05:05.639> very<00:05:06.639> very

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
I like using bright blushes very very

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:08.370 
I like using bright blushes very very
sheer<00:05:07.270> because<00:05:07.569> I<00:05:07.630> find<00:05:07.870> that<00:05:07.960> I<00:05:08.080> get<00:05:08.289> the<00:05:08.349> most

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
sheer because I find that I get the most

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.010 
sheer because I find that I get the most
versatility<00:05:08.889> I<00:05:09.069> do<00:05:09.220> so<00:05:09.880> the<00:05:10.240> Tarte<00:05:10.539> ones<00:05:10.750> are
