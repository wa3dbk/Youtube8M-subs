00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.210 

so<00:02:18.099> we<00:02:18.370> had<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.580> local<00:02:19.090> guy<00:02:19.239> who<00:02:19.660> showed<00:02:20.260> us<00:02:20.470> how

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
firstly it was the hardest part of it

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.699 
firstly it was the hardest part of it
too<00:02:27.730> because<00:02:28.209> you<00:02:28.360> need<00:02:28.629> to<00:02:28.660> do<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.140> very<00:02:29.590> fast

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
too because you need to do it very fast

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.800 
and you have to keep your balance at all
the<00:02:32.920> time

dangerous<00:02:50.700> thing<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.890> wave<00:02:53.099> or

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
dangerous thing is that the wave or

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.339 
dangerous thing is that the wave or
other<00:02:53.580> people<00:02:53.970> can<00:02:54.180> hit<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.599> with<00:02:55.170> their

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
sporty and active and and we thought

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.360 
sporty and active and and we thought
well<00:04:25.320> it<00:04:25.950> doesn't<00:04:26.340> look<00:04:26.370> difficult<00:04:28.040> but<00:04:29.040> when

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
well it doesn't look difficult but when

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.180 
well it doesn't look difficult but when
we<00:04:29.460> got<00:04:29.520> here<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.300> we<00:04:30.960> realized<00:04:31.410> but<00:04:31.650> actually

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
we got here and we realized but actually

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.050 
we got here and we realized but actually
it's<00:04:32.730> not<00:04:33.450> as<00:04:33.750> that<00:04:34.140> easy<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:35.040> it's<00:04:35.610> not<00:04:35.700> easy

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
it's not as that easy and it's not easy

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.270 
it's not as that easy and it's not easy
as<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.480> looks<00:04:36.720> like<00:04:36.930> even<00:04:37.200> sitting<00:04:37.830> on<00:04:37.950> board

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
as it looks like even sitting on board

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.620 
as it looks like even sitting on board
it's<00:04:38.669> definitely<00:04:39.390> not<00:04:39.780> easy<00:04:41.300> we<00:04:42.300> probably

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
it's definitely not easy we probably

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.350 
it's definitely not easy we probably
would<00:04:42.960> be<00:04:43.080> able<00:04:43.230> to<00:04:43.430> you<00:04:44.430> know<00:04:44.520> search

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
would be able to you know search

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.000 
would be able to you know search
