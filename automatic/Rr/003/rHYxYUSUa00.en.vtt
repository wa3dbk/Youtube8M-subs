00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.780 
the thing about it it goes through knots
as<00:02:43.420> well<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:44.680> sure<00:02:44.830> ends<00:02:45.010> up<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.280> nos<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:45.670> then

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
as well it sure ends up the nos and then

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:55.040 
as well it sure ends up the nos and then
it's<00:02:45.940> easy<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.830> take<00:02:47.830> out<00:02:47.980> those<00:02:48.129> fair<00:02:48.400> knots

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.770 

see<00:02:56.050> it's<00:02:56.680> looser<00:02:57.099> now<00:02:59.160> one<00:03:00.160> more<00:03:00.370> time<00:03:00.780> I'm

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
see it's looser now one more time I'm

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:23.119 
see it's looser now one more time I'm
real<00:03:02.380> close<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:04.410> slowly<00:03:05.410> go<00:03:05.800> down

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:29.399 

and<00:03:24.129> then<00:03:24.340> use<00:03:24.519> my<00:03:24.549> life<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.000> this<00:03:25.299> car<00:03:28.379> take<00:03:29.379> it

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:29.409 
and then use my life to this car take it

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:35.520 
and then use my life to this car take it
through<00:03:29.799> it<00:03:32.099> it<00:03:33.099> is<00:03:33.370> so<00:03:33.700> much<00:03:33.909> easier<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:35.290> comb

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
through it it is so much easier to comb

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.059 
through it it is so much easier to comb
my<00:03:35.560> hair<00:03:38.159> so<00:03:39.159> here's<00:03:39.610> all<00:03:39.909> that<00:03:40.709> just<00:03:41.709> horrible

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
my hair so here's all that just horrible

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.490 
my hair so here's all that just horrible
ends<00:03:42.519> and<00:03:42.790> then<00:03:43.480> here's<00:03:43.810> what<00:03:43.959> I<00:03:43.989> want<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.349> it

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
ends and then here's what I want to it

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.559 
ends and then here's what I want to it
but<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:47.829> would<00:03:48.609> like<00:03:48.790> this<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.180> that<00:03:49.239> is<00:03:49.390> not

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
but I would like this and that is not

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.509 
but I would like this and that is not
completely<00:03:49.840> straight<00:03:50.260> if<00:03:50.620> it<00:03:50.799> has<00:03:50.920> texture<00:03:51.280> to

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
completely straight if it has texture to

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.479 
completely straight if it has texture to
it<00:03:51.549> and<00:03:52.170> then<00:03:53.170> you<00:03:53.290> finish<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.650> other<00:03:53.769> side

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
it and then you finish the other side

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:02.759 
it and then you finish the other side
I<00:03:54.519> need<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.120> clip<00:04:00.569> and<00:04:01.569> then<00:04:02.049> I<00:04:02.290> take<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.620> other

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
I need a clip and then I take the other

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:09.310 
I need a clip and then I take the other
part<00:04:02.980> of<00:04:03.099> the<00:04:03.250> twist

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.480 

and<00:04:10.320> slowly<00:04:10.830> go<00:04:11.190> down<00:04:11.660> and<00:04:12.660> I'm<00:04:13.260> holding<00:04:13.490> the

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
and slowly go down and I'm holding the

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:22.820 
and slowly go down and I'm holding the
ends<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:21.510> I'm<00:04:21.780> gonna<00:04:21.900> try<00:04:22.080> to<00:04:22.140> get<00:04:22.350> closer<00:04:22.680> to

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
ends and I'm gonna try to get closer to

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:41.969 
ends and I'm gonna try to get closer to
the<00:04:23.100> end<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.030> room

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.330 

and<00:04:42.979> because<00:04:43.220> this<00:04:43.340> is<00:04:43.460> a<00:04:43.490> smaller<00:04:43.910> section

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
and because this is a smaller section

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.790 
and because this is a smaller section
you<00:04:46.340> could<00:04:46.580> only<00:04:46.789> do<00:04:47.060> one<00:04:47.360> or<00:04:47.389> two<00:04:47.509> passes<00:04:47.870> and

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.640 

to<00:04:51.800> be<00:04:51.949> honest<00:04:52.310> I<00:04:52.460> really<00:04:52.490> like<00:04:53.000> this<00:04:53.210> because

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
to be honest I really like this because

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.550 
to be honest I really like this because
better<00:04:54.650> than<00:04:54.889> using<00:04:55.160> a<00:04:55.220> blow<00:04:55.400> dryer<00:04:56.560> because

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
better than using a blow dryer because

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.670 
better than using a blow dryer because
it's<00:04:58.280> sort<00:04:58.610> of<00:04:58.759> like<00:04:58.819> heat<00:04:59.690> training<00:05:00.229> because

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
it's sort of like heat training because

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.309 
it's sort of like heat training because
it<00:05:00.949> is<00:05:01.130> loosening<00:05:01.729> up<00:05:01.849> my<00:05:02.030> hair<00:05:02.360> texture<00:05:03.009> but<00:05:04.009> I

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319 
it is loosening up my hair texture but I

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.300 
it is loosening up my hair texture but I
think<00:05:06.319> I'm<00:05:06.410> still<00:05:06.560> gonna<00:05:06.620> do<00:05:06.740> this<00:05:06.889> like<00:05:07.099> once

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
think I'm still gonna do this like once

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.159 
think I'm still gonna do this like once
a<00:05:07.490> year<00:05:07.699> for<00:05:07.759> like<00:05:08.120> uhm<00:05:09.280> trimming<00:05:10.280> my<00:05:10.370> ends<00:05:11.169> so

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
a year for like uhm trimming my ends so

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.930 
a year for like uhm trimming my ends so
you<00:05:12.560> can<00:05:12.710> see<00:05:12.830> this<00:05:12.949> with<00:05:13.099> a<00:05:13.130> bigger<00:05:13.639> section

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
you can see this with a bigger section

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.969 
you can see this with a bigger section
and<00:05:14.750> then<00:05:15.020> just<00:05:15.259> twist<00:05:15.530> it<00:05:15.710> down<00:05:16.330> and<00:05:17.979> because

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
and then just twist it down and because

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.730 
and then just twist it down and because
of<00:05:19.009> the<00:05:19.220> Carol's<00:05:19.580> Daughter<00:05:19.639> um<00:05:20.500> blow<00:05:21.500> dry
