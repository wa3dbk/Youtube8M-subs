00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
and stuff doesn't always add up so I

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.530 
and stuff doesn't always add up so I
don't<00:04:36.900> know<00:04:37.200> exactly<00:04:37.320> why<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:37.860> is<00:04:38.100> if<00:04:38.820> I<00:04:39.300> were

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
don't know exactly why it is if I were

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.060
