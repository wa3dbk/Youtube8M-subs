so in this video we're gonna cover the

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.759 
so in this video we're gonna cover the
steps<00:00:14.150> it<00:00:14.390> takes<00:00:14.540> to<00:00:14.720> take<00:00:15.110> a<00:00:15.140> character<00:00:15.620> that

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:15.769 
steps it takes to take a character that

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.080 
steps it takes to take a character that
has<00:00:15.830> been<00:00:16.040> successfully<00:00:16.520> Auto<00:00:16.670> rigged<00:00:16.849> and

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
has been successfully Auto rigged and

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.030 
has been successfully Auto rigged and
apply<00:00:17.630> a<00:00:17.660> motion<00:00:17.930> pack<00:00:18.170> to<00:00:18.290> it<00:00:18.410> using<00:00:18.650> Nixon

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.040

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
Viet a fuse character or our character

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.070 
Viet a fuse character or our character
of<00:00:24.500> your<00:00:24.619> own<00:00:24.710> design<00:00:25.750> you're<00:00:26.750> gonna<00:00:26.840> hit<00:00:27.020> the

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
of your own design you're gonna hit the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.490 
of your own design you're gonna hit the
apply<00:00:27.320> animation<00:00:27.740> button<00:00:28.180> and<00:00:29.470> in<00:00:30.470> the

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
apply animation button and in the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.610 
apply animation button and in the
applying<00:00:31.039> act<00:00:31.250> animation<00:00:32.440> instead<00:00:33.440> of

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
applying act animation instead of

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.650 
applying act animation instead of
selecting<00:00:34.070> a<00:00:34.460> singular<00:00:34.910> animation<00:00:35.480> we're

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
selecting a singular animation we're

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.360 
selecting a singular animation we're
actually<00:00:35.930> going<00:00:36.320> to<00:00:36.410> be<00:00:36.559> selecting<00:00:37.040> a<00:00:37.100> motion

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
actually going to be selecting a motion

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.990 
actually going to be selecting a motion
pack<00:00:37.690> so<00:00:38.690> instead<00:00:39.589> of<00:00:39.850> selecting<00:00:40.850> one<00:00:40.970> of

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
pack so instead of selecting one of

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.070 
pack so instead of selecting one of
these<00:00:41.120> guys<00:00:41.269> we're<00:00:41.479> going<00:00:41.570> to<00:00:41.629> go<00:00:41.690> up<00:00:41.809> here<00:00:41.989> at

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
the top and we're gonna select one of

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.969 
the top and we're gonna select one of
our<00:00:43.430> six<00:00:43.670> motion<00:00:43.940> packs<00:00:44.089> available<00:00:44.239> so<00:00:45.229> I<00:00:45.799> want

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:45.979 
our six motion packs available so I want

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:50.530 
our six motion packs available so I want
to<00:00:46.010> take<00:00:46.159> the<00:00:46.280> basic<00:00:46.699> shooter<00:00:46.940> here<00:00:49.540> it's

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
to take the basic shooter here it's

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.640 
to take the basic shooter here it's
going<00:00:50.629> to<00:00:50.720> take<00:00:50.839> a<00:00:50.870> little<00:00:51.019> bit<00:00:51.170> longer<00:00:51.350> to

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
going to take a little bit longer to

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.680 
going to take a little bit longer to
load<00:00:51.949> up<00:00:52.129> a<00:00:52.280> motion<00:00:52.760> pack<00:00:53.030> because<00:00:53.360> a<00:00:53.390> motion

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
load up a motion pack because a motion

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.509 
load up a motion pack because a motion
pack<00:00:53.809> Matalin<00:00:54.260> contains<00:00:54.620> all<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.040> animations

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
pack Matalin contains all the animations

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.539 
pack Matalin contains all the animations
for<00:00:55.699> the<00:00:55.850> pack<00:00:56.030> it<00:00:56.210> also<00:00:56.390> contains<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:57.650> logic

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:58.549 
for the pack it also contains the logic

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:01.359 
for the pack it also contains the logic
behind<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.239> pack<00:00:59.420> so<00:00:59.890> when<00:01:00.890> you<00:01:00.979> download<00:01:01.339> a

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:01.369 
behind the pack so when you download a

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:03.280 
behind the pack so when you download a
motion<00:01:01.640> pack<00:01:01.790> you<00:01:02.150> get<00:01:02.479> the<00:01:02.629> animations<00:01:03.170> and

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
motion pack you get the animations and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.780 
motion pack you get the animations and
you<00:01:03.409> get<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:03.650> logic<00:01:03.920> behind<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.309> animations

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
you get the logic behind the animations

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.910 
you get the logic behind the animations
to<00:01:05.000> have<00:01:05.210> it<00:01:05.330> successfully<00:01:05.900> work<00:01:06.110> right<00:01:06.799> away

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
to have it successfully work right away

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.080 
to have it successfully work right away
inside<00:01:07.280> of<00:01:07.400> unity<00:01:08.770> so<00:01:09.770> here<00:01:09.920> we<00:01:10.010> are<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:10.280> once

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
inside of unity so here we are and once

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.340 
inside of unity so here we are and once
