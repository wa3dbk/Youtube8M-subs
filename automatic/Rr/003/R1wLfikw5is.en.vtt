00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.019
 good girl you also teach like 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.240
 I work daily because I already 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:10.219
 I've asked a few and already 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.690
 I used this to ask with the three of 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.690
 avon 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.690
 Y 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.340
 is always super well they 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.529
 simply with a pencil and pepper 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.820
 very much and good then to finish 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:31.340
 use the email beautiful vale bueno es 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.720
 very easy, the first thing I do to me 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.720
 I paint the water and it's worth 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.260
 quite 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.550
 and good with the other eye I do the same 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:01.120
 I have them painted, they ask me almost 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.730
 always the fence above is very easy 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.510
 we always take the pencil with enough 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.310
 tip 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.980
 to try to be a thin line 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.620
 possible in my case I do not do it that way with 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.280
 the tip in this case was taken out but 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:19.600
 that 's the least and without fear let's go 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.600
 making a chubby line of 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.610
 to half a centimeter approximately a 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.090
 little bit less 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.189
 4 mm 5 mm 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.010
 I do not know if you can see the width of the 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.650
 stripe 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.170
 down I do the same a more finite stripe 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.909
 OK 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.909
 I always get dicked too down 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.720
 and good always in peak 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.840
 what there is 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.840
 in the piba here in the end 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.080
 then I always spend a little bit my finger 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.060
 to blur what is the part of 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.060
 down and with the other eye to me not 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.259
 the pencils that pigment to me is what 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.259
 more I like there are people who do not like 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.800
 meanwhile but I like it very black 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.570
 and well I have the eye painted then 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.570
 I take my mascara 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.330
 and I have a video out there of how it 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.580
 applied 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.430
 of how it is applied correctly if what 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.640
 do you wanna see 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.719
 is that pretty good help does not apply 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.840
 and quickie 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:49.060
 as we always put the think of this 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.920
 posture and we're going 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.280
 in the eyelashes we give the last 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.870
 entire 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.870
 and then the tips are worth 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.950
 and with the other and in the back m2 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.550
 and with the other eye, we do the same 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.320
 We combed all the eyelashes whole and 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.590
 afterwards so that we stay more 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.010
 long well combed because we give ourselves the 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.010
 tips 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.790
 and down 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.230
 and see how it has left me 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.570
 hospitals is very easy but some 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.580
 asked and as he does not see it until the 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.950
 good video because I hope everything has 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.100
 liked and a huge message and up 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.100
 then
