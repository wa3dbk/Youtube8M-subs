00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240 

I<00:00:03.259> think<00:00:04.259> it's<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.410> problem<00:00:04.620> that's<00:00:04.830> on<00:00:05.009> every

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
I think it's a problem that's on every

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.130 
I think it's a problem that's on every
college<00:00:05.460> campus<00:00:05.759> right<00:00:06.120> now<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.450> I<00:00:06.509> think<00:00:07.049> the

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
college campus right now and I think the

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.629 
college campus right now and I think the
biggest<00:00:07.319> thing<00:00:07.529> our<00:00:07.890> responsibility<00:00:08.580> as

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
biggest thing our responsibility as

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.459 
biggest thing our responsibility as
coaches<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.179> educate<00:00:09.300> our<00:00:09.660> guys<00:00:09.840> on<00:00:10.080> on

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
coaches is to educate our guys on on

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.910 
coaches is to educate our guys on on
what<00:00:11.509> the<00:00:12.509> dangers<00:00:12.870> are<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.170> that's<00:00:13.620> what<00:00:13.769> we

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
what the dangers are and that's what we

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.259 
what the dangers are and that's what we
continue<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.340> do<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.759> think<00:00:14.820> that's<00:00:15.059> the

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
continue to do and I think that's the

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.970 
continue to do and I think that's the
biggest<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:16.170> know<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.350> biggest<00:00:16.529> thing<00:00:16.710> but

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
biggest you know the biggest thing but

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.080 
biggest you know the biggest thing but
it<00:00:17.190> wasn't<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.670> know<00:00:17.760> that's<00:00:17.910> not<00:00:18.029> a

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
it wasn't you know that's not a

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.640 
it wasn't you know that's not a
revelation<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.750> think<00:00:18.960> when<00:00:19.080> anybody<00:00:19.380> saw<00:00:19.529> that

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
revelation I think when anybody saw that

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.050 
revelation I think when anybody saw that
article<00:00:19.830> but<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.250> think<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.670> biggest<00:00:20.850> thing

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
article but I think the biggest thing

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.820 
article but I think the biggest thing
for<00:00:21.270> us<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.869> think<00:00:22.080> our<00:00:22.170> responsibility<00:00:22.769> as

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
for us and I think our responsibility as

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.160 
for us and I think our responsibility as
coaches<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.310> your<00:00:23.939> coach<00:00:24.119> at<00:00:24.269> 18<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.660> 23<00:00:24.990> year

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
coaches is your coach at 18 to 23 year

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.740 
coaches is your coach at 18 to 23 year
old<00:00:25.260> kids<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.680> they're<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.750> mistake

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
old kids that they're in a mistake

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.679 
old kids that they're in a mistake
making<00:00:28.050> phase<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.949> their<00:00:29.070> lives<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.359> think

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
making phase of their lives and I think

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.110 
making phase of their lives and I think
no<00:00:31.199> one<00:00:31.230> goes<00:00:31.619> through<00:00:31.800> life<00:00:32.040> without<00:00:32.730> making

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
no one goes through life without making

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.280 
no one goes through life without making
a<00:00:33.180> mistake<00:00:33.329> but<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.719> think<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.989> biggest<00:00:34.170> thing

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
a mistake but I think the biggest thing

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.200 
a mistake but I think the biggest thing
is<00:00:34.410> do<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.680> learn<00:00:34.890> from<00:00:35.040> your<00:00:35.160> mistakes<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.670> so

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
is do you learn from your mistakes so so

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.670 
is do you learn from your mistakes so so
I<00:00:36.239> believe<00:00:36.600> our<00:00:36.750> job<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.230> what<00:00:37.590> our

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
I believe our job and what our

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
responsibility is just to educate these

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.799 
responsibility is just to educate these
kids<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.540> not<00:00:40.350> just<00:00:41.160> don't<00:00:41.460> do<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.790> because<00:00:41.910> if

is central nervous system readiness ie

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.700 
is central nervous system readiness ie
your<00:01:39.030> brain<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.750> if<00:01:39.900> we<00:01:40.020> had<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.290> many<00:01:40.410> kids

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
your brain and if we had that many kids

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.060 
your brain and if we had that many kids
doing<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.750> we<00:01:42.750> wouldn't<00:01:42.960> be<00:01:43.020> 34<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.560> 6<00:01:43.770> and

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
doing it we wouldn't be 34 and 6 and

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.350 
doing it we wouldn't be 34 and 6 and
because<00:01:44.310> it's<00:01:44.460> not<00:01:44.580> just<00:01:44.820> about<00:01:44.910> doing<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.300> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
because it's not just about doing it the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.000 
because it's not just about doing it the
day<00:01:45.480> before<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.780> game<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.410> about<00:01:46.530> practice

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
day before a game it's about practice

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.200 
day before a game it's about practice
and<00:01:47.190> we<00:01:47.250> win<00:01:47.460> because<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.850> how<00:01:47.940> hard<00:01:48.060> we

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
and we win because of how hard we

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.550 
and we win because of how hard we
practice<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.660> I<00:01:48.720> see<00:01:48.900> our<00:01:48.990> kids<00:01:49.200> every<00:01:49.380> day<00:01:49.470> in

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
practice and I see our kids every day in

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.470 
practice and I see our kids every day in
practice<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.340> if<00:01:50.460> we<00:01:50.610> saw<00:01:50.790> signs<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.330> you

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
practice and if we saw signs of it you

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.240 
practice and if we saw signs of it you
know<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.600> haven't<00:01:51.930> seen<00:01:52.140> signs<00:01:52.410> of<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.650> but<00:01:53.160> if

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
know I haven't seen signs of it but if

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.710 
know I haven't seen signs of it but if
we<00:01:53.370> do<00:01:53.520> see<00:01:53.730> signs<00:01:53.910> and<00:01:54.210> again<00:01:54.390> because<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.660> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
we do see signs and again because of the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.000 
we do see signs and again because of the
state<00:01:54.930> law<00:01:55.080> we<00:01:55.260> have<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.410> have<00:01:55.560> probable<00:01:55.950> cause

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
to test them I wish we didn't have to

have probable cause if we have random I
could<00:01:59.130> answer<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.370> question<00:01:59.730> right<00:01:59.760> now<00:01:59.850> and

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
could answer that question right now and

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.460 
could answer that question right now and
say<00:02:00.180> exactly<00:02:00.300> what<00:02:00.660> that<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:01.050> but<00:02:01.230> we<00:02:01.320> don't

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
say exactly what that is but we don't

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.990 
say exactly what that is but we don't
have<00:02:01.620> the<00:02:01.770> data<00:02:01.950> because<00:02:02.490> we<00:02:02.520> can't<00:02:02.820> test

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
have the data because we can't test

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.270 
have the data because we can't test
every<00:02:03.180> kid<00:02:03.330> on<00:02:03.360> our<00:02:03.420> team<00:02:03.480> but<00:02:04.290> when<00:02:04.800> I<00:02:04.890> when<00:02:05.130> we

every kid on our team but when I when we

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.560 
every kid on our team but when I when we

talk to people the people we brought in
it<00:02:06.690> you<00:02:06.810> know<00:02:06.900> again<00:02:07.230> a<00:02:07.290> single<00:02:07.560> determining

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
it you know again a single determining

it you know again a single determining

different things and it all starts from

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.540 
different things and it all starts from
your<00:02:12.930> brain<00:02:13.110> if<00:02:13.650> we<00:02:13.770> had<00:02:13.860> 60<00:02:14.160> percent<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.490> our

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
kids doing that we wouldn't be 34 in six

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.240

in<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.530> last<00:02:16.560> three<00:02:16.800> years<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.070> play<00:02:17.190> in

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
in the last three years and play in

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.570 
in the last three years and play in
three<00:02:17.430> straight<00:02:17.580> PCs<00:02:17.970> games<00:02:19.370> I'd<00:02:20.370> love<00:02:20.520> to

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
three straight PCs games I'd love to

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.890 
three straight PCs games I'd love to
because<00:02:20.970> I'd<00:02:21.090> like<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.300> give<00:02:21.420> everybody<00:02:21.660> the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
because I'd like to give everybody the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.360 
because I'd like to give everybody the
answer<00:02:22.140> instead<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.650> being<00:02:22.830> in<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.010> dark<00:02:23.190> and

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
answer instead of being in the dark and

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.160 
answer instead of being in the dark and
telling<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.700> what<00:02:23.820> I<00:02:23.850> think<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.239> is<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.510> can't

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
telling you what I think it is I can't

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.420 
telling you what I think it is I can't
tell<00:02:25.320> you<00:02:25.380> exactly<00:02:25.470> what<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.980> number<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.220> but

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
tell you exactly what the number is but

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.670 
tell you exactly what the number is but
I<00:02:26.520> couldn't<00:02:26.760> tell<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:26.940> it's<00:02:27.660> this<00:02:27.900> because<00:02:28.560> we

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
I couldn't tell you it's this because we

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.229 
I couldn't tell you it's this because we
tested<00:02:29.010> all<00:02:29.100> 105<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:29.850> can<00:02:29.970> tell<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.150> how

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
tested all 105 and I can tell you how

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.120 
tested all 105 and I can tell you how
many<00:02:30.420> what<00:02:31.140> our<00:02:31.230> percentage<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.739> but<00:02:31.860> we<00:02:31.950> can't

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
many what our percentage is but we can't

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.500 
many what our percentage is but we can't
do<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.880> know<00:02:32.970> we<00:02:33.120> deal<00:02:33.300> with<00:02:33.330> the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
do that so you know we deal with the

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.550 
do that so you know we deal with the
rules<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.780> we<00:02:33.900> got<00:02:34.050> but<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.260> think<00:02:34.470> the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
rules that we got but I think the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.470 
rules that we got but I think the
biggest<00:02:34.739> thing<00:02:34.920> for<00:02:34.980> us<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.820> educational

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
biggest thing for us is the educational

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.630 
biggest thing for us is the educational
component<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.989> it<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.290> not<00:02:38.070> killing<00:02:38.430> kids

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
component to it and not killing kids

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.420 
component to it and not killing kids
that<00:02:39.030> don't<00:02:39.360> do<00:02:39.510> something<00:02:39.750> because<00:02:40.250> if<00:02:41.250> you

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
that don't do something because if you

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.920 
that don't do something because if you
get<00:02:41.580> caught<00:02:41.790> here's<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.120> ramifications<00:02:42.750> it's

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
get caught here's the ramifications it's

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.140 
get caught here's the ramifications it's
the<00:02:43.020> same<00:02:43.200> thing<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.860> know<00:02:43.980> they've<00:02:44.790> got<00:02:45.030> to

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
the same thing you know they've got to

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.610 
the same thing you know they've got to
learn<00:02:45.300> from<00:02:45.360> mistakes<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:46.050> others<00:02:46.290> but<00:02:46.500> it's

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
learn from mistakes of others but it's

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.840 
learn from mistakes of others but it's
you<00:02:47.100> know<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.250> put<00:02:47.459> your<00:02:47.580> head<00:02:47.670> in<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.820> sand
