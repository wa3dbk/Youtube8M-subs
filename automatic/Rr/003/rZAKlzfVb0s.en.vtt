00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.020 
so this is a really simple way to do it
you<00:04:10.590> know<00:04:10.709> I<00:04:10.739> like<00:04:11.099> to<00:04:11.129> take<00:04:11.400> shortcuts<00:04:11.700> when<00:04:12.000> I

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
you know I like to take shortcuts when I

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.940 
you know I like to take shortcuts when I
cook<00:04:12.299> well<00:04:12.870> if<00:04:13.049> you<00:04:13.140> have<00:04:13.260> two<00:04:13.439> pieces<00:04:13.680> of

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
cook well if you have two pieces of

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.259 
cook well if you have two pieces of
plastic<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.430> you<00:04:14.579> just<00:04:14.760> put<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.150> other

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
plastic and you just put the other

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.490 
plastic and you just put the other
plastic<00:04:15.480> and<00:04:15.750> we're<00:04:15.870> actually<00:04:15.989> using<00:04:16.229> a

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
plastic and we're actually using a

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.740 
plastic and we're actually using a
plastic<00:04:16.739> bag<00:04:17.220> instead<00:04:17.669> of<00:04:17.789> saran<00:04:18.509> wrap

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
plastic bag instead of saran wrap

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.990 
plastic bag instead of saran wrap
because<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.709> plastic<00:04:20.100> is<00:04:20.220> just<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.519> lot<00:04:20.669> easier

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
because the plastic is just a lot easier

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.939 
because the plastic is just a lot easier
to<00:04:21.269> manage<00:04:21.449> and<00:04:21.900> so<00:04:22.470> she's<00:04:22.740> actually

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
to manage and so she's actually

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:24.650 
to manage and so she's actually
preparing<00:04:23.639> the<00:04:23.729> pupusas<00:04:24.180> and<00:04:24.389> she<00:04:24.539> keeps

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
preparing the pupusas and she keeps

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.330 
preparing the pupusas and she keeps
laying<00:04:24.960> them<00:04:25.139> out<00:04:25.229> because<00:04:25.650> our<00:04:25.770> skillets<00:04:26.160> not

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
laying them out because our skillets not

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.930 
laying them out because our skillets not
big<00:04:26.520> enough

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
big enough

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.330 
big enough
