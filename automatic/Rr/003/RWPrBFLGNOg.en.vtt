00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.469
 back in hit to hit edition 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.469
 special from the veins 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.090
 from blow to blow are two fighters and 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.920
 So many times have you seen many gentlemen 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.519
 of in a few more minutes they are 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.220
 supporting me webber I would like to 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:38.129
 nothing to listen to your forecasts before 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:43.700
 let all this vortex of people and 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.700
 comments as imagined 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.510
 convince us how you have to do it 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.680
 year by year in the fight that you put your 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.600
 program like I'm ring that even though I 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.230
 I imagine missing two warriors will look 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:06.930
 press the combat and it seems to me that 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.729
 Higher technical artistic quality of a 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.250
 long fight of a fight before the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.940
 defender round mayweather favor a 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.190
 win by knockout 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.460
 before the sixth round where it shows 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.920
 for me that the pagan warrior does not have 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.050
 the credentials to go up and to 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.280
 this case defeat historic mossorÃ³ 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.630
 like you as a difficult fight for 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.820
 both as I said but harder 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.200
 for the warrior ghost like that 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.360
 of the same problem but if the ghost 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.850
 does not penetrate the guard and the 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.410
 these combinations we do not know how to how 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.270
 certain forms have been prepared in 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.890
 how much more speed the pressure but 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.570
 If they demand more generous work, more 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.940
 speed comes being pushing the 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.520
 wizard combination of blows with 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.290
 speed thanks important points if 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.780
 I make it very difficult for him to miss more 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.850
 as david says in new quarrels 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.510
 He won this opportunity for winning 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:02.200
 to the event with mayweather style 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.000
 then it's a big fight yes but to me 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.320
 point of view to the problem you can not by 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.510
 knockout by decision 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.910
 by points because it is not a form and 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.500
 good is a fighter fighter is not a 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.100
 fighter who has stuck very strong 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.100
 apart 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.860
 the problem is that the accumulation of 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.410
 blows also annihilates 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.800
 you have to see how much he suffered in the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.150
 last episode determining what is it 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.580
 what happens is that the physical world of 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:34.299
 outline of the best then not 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:36.700
 call him the first to the ninth round this 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.920
 is being the expression used well 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.110
 those last rounds waiting at cost 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.239
 of the short and connecting you 11 missing 9 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.120
 importance that coincided its maximum 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.319
 effort and could not really see it a 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.319
 bad with the night 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.640
 years 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.200
 Tender huelva lens to flake 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.019
 that we're going to start seeing the first 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.999
 exercises the impact of time on 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.579
 mayweather is also a good next 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:09.200
 because there is no one invincible there 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.659
 miracles agree where the 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.750
 counters 39 years very well prepared 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:16.750
 distinctly very well 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.799
 as regards the preparation of the 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.799
 care 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:43.359
 48 that you do not have but you can spend 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:43.359
 now a lot of tension in the warrior 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:55.010
 away from my mind the one that presents me 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:58.010
 it smells but it broke like glass 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.010
 completely
