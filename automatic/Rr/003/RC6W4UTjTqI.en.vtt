after we finish to isolation room and
then<00:05:08.340> we<00:05:08.370> can<00:05:08.640> go<00:05:08.790> back<00:05:09.000> to<00:05:09.270> a<00:05:09.630> compatible<00:05:10.200> we

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
then we can go back to a compatible we

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.290 
then we can go back to a compatible we
might<00:05:10.470> say<00:05:10.620> we're<00:05:10.770> going<00:05:10.920> to<00:05:11.070> squat<00:05:11.460> or<00:05:11.760> hex
