 Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.040
 bj City woo 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:34.070
 The Audi q7 's massive size is very large 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:39.230
 The length is 5m. The wheelbase is over 4m. 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:42.020
 Hugh Seven Volkswagen Group platform has pl 70 Iran 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.040
 But more Touareg or Cayenne writing handing skeleton 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:50.630
 The vehicle body length and wheelbase is 30cm closer jjip 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:56.270
 The other two brothers had over three rows of seats . 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:59.329
 q7 Audi is the largest dinosaur in the entire lineup. 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.450
 q7 went through face lift last year 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:07.970
 It was not up to changing the existing framework . 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:12.619
 I was able to emphasize the look of the family on Audi, 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:17.690
 In the 21st century, Audi continues to be the most advanced automotive industry in terms of emotional quality 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:21.590
 led lighting is a Paris daytime led lights, etc. 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:24.229
 I 've been writing on all the models from below to a4 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:29.539
 This q7 is no exception. 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:35.509
 The headlamps were only kept in that mold, 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:37.849
 Each of the left and right eyes has 14 each, another 12 blinks, and only 52 faces 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.170
 More and more LEDs 

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:44.179
 31 amp LED, but also planted the previous frame to keep the plates Caution 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.410
 The panel is cut out deeply. 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:51.890
 So it looks more like back than before. 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:55.039
 We also care for the interior while going through the face lift. 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.220
 The quality of the world-class emotional quality remains. 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:01.520
 I did not neglect the detail because it was big. 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:06.319
 I heard a sophisticated design hidden corners 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:11.000
 The nail- touch switch even boasts a moist touch of plastic pen 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:12.380
 Audi's unique pathological perfectionism is more emphasized in such a big car 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.080
 It's possible 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.340
 q7 We have three seats. 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.230
 By the way, this is a design that clearly shows the left and right sides, 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.579
 Cleanse is six people. 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:30.330
 This adult front and rear sliding, as well as angle of the backrest can be tilted 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:35.790
 You can not afford the luggage space . It's vast. 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.780
 There is a luggage space at 2,000 l. The prototype is q7 3.0 tdi Quattro 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:43.200
 is 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.370
 The engine is v3 3.0l tdi 140 horsepower tdi is turbo diesel direct 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.810
 It means 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.920
 At first glance, 240 horsepower can be a challenge to attract 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.650
 There is 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:57.030
 But the core of diesel engines is torque 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:00.090
 This engine has a maximum torque grows Yeah of 56.2 meters below 7 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.650
 If the tolerance weights are well above the tonnage 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:08.459
 It only accelerates to 100 km / h in 8.5 seconds . 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.459
 Unlike the big prejudice, the running performance is cool 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:16.709
 I am constantly conscious of size and weight. 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:19.170
 It's also because of the speedy feeling of the bullish figures 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:24.600
 In sports mode where contribution is lowered 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:27.450
 Even if the engine will not accelerate much like ear smooth water heureudeut 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.600
 Diesel birds also spend hide the traces 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.830
 Boasts a comfortable and smooth driving sensation 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.810
 However wallow in a bad way because dreadlocks slightly elongated wheelbase n 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.340
 I'm careful 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.340
 I can cut the floor to 100 . 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.249
 The q7 is a porsche that mimics a sports car, 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.830
 With Cayenne 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:54.110
 The approach is different from the car. 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.940
 It is somewhat similar in concept to Touareg , but seats in three rows and larger 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.330
 I did 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:04.540
 The Audi q7 is a versatile SUV 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:07.750
 It is the most fun to see smoothly for the purpose of development 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.240
 The cool scale is spacious and comfortable 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.280
 The corner finish is meticulous 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:19.710
 Audi q7 can not mimic other sub- san ministry gets much 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.710
 Price is 92.5 million won 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.430
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.070
 Ah
