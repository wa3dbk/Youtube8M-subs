00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.220
 This amnesia is today 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:09.240
 8 Today, 8 May of 6 days 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:14.150
 It is Golden Week last day 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:18.050
 8a What kind of Golden Week did you all spend? 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:23.720
 8 Today is a bit like that twin 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:26.010
 8 live mr my line 4 mr on that 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.770
カ ー ス カ ー yeah 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.140
 8 soon 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:35.470
 Nde condition has become worse 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.920
 8 Yes I already know that 8 is actually large 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.920
 And 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:52.420
 In guy wore at the time of this car and r 32 of was riding the old days also to tell the truth gtr 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.719
 r 32 gt r fd 3 s 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.310
 It is Dr.'ve been Noritsui the a building 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:02.120
 Ma's r 32 is that 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.770
 As you all know, it's that one size 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.260
 that 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:13.390
 Well that's 32 gtr's time from the beginning of 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.050
 I was attached to the three-piece meter of that genuine Noah of the maker of 8 normal 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.380
 Also 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:23.680
 That genuine meter is that 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.729
 I can't read either Toyota's accurate information roughly, so now I'm watching this live 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.670
 To be 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:32.760
 32 gt hard even at the end to put 83 consecutive meters of that outside 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.440
 That genuine that 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:44.610
 It is a guy who put it there because the meter of 3 stations has not entered 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:49.470
 And this is a bit pre- handed, but if you try to put out 8 cd 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.640
 Right now I 'm a little bit good, but that one 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:58.300
 I have symptoms that go out and go out 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:00.220
 It's coming out and the elderly people are a little 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.770
 Well 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:08.530
 Long time ago 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:12.490
 I bought this at the time of the Impreza Rokuen I got on this Alpine 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:17.500
 8 I think I'll fix it once 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.770
 8 This seems to be 8 Impressor 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.590
 Legacy 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:30.810
 It is a guy who has been walking for 8 years 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:32.220
 If it happens that you still have it, it's still relatively new here , or if it's open to you here 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:39.060
 I think that 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:42.580
 And that fact is that I went to work from 7 am in the morning to 4 am in the evening. 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:50.010
 But at the station some shops on the way back 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:55.920
 To You're Well when the fitted with a in addition, since we have that asked the wiring kit 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:03:00.780
 I would like to Kano report the situation the king of sound in the roster 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:07.290
 Well I think that alpine is kinda knowing person, but I think that kinda 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:08.590
 Well overall sound but I know array Nde cone is hard is using the normal speaker 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.470
 Even if 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.030
 OK 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.520
 I think that I want to change to this in a 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.820
 8 is a ne gw-Fitr 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:28.350
 8 I am working on nursing care 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:32.250
 It is quite easy to see that some of the staff members have left for another super hard Haa shift. 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:37.590
 I think I can not report even if attached a little 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:44.690
 I would like to find a time for Ea and report to Edo 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:51.460
 I am sorry in the video about greetings saying that it changes brightly eight castes today . 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.460
 Well then that's easy, but today I'm sorry about this
