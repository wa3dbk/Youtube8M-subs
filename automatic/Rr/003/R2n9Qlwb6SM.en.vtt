so<00:04:33.040> we<00:04:33.160> would<00:04:33.370> have<00:04:33.460> liked<00:04:33.640> to<00:04:33.730> see<00:04:34.000> and<00:04:34.210> so

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
so we would have liked to see and so

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.030 
so we would have liked to see and so
they<00:04:34.840> do<00:04:34.960> feel<00:04:35.170> a<00:04:35.200> little<00:04:35.290> bit<00:04:35.410> cheaply<00:04:35.740> made

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
they do feel a little bit cheaply made

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.550 
they do feel a little bit cheaply made
we<00:04:36.730> also<00:04:36.880> have<00:04:37.150> a<00:04:37.360> brightness<00:04:37.960> control<00:04:38.410> or

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
we also have a brightness control or

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.830 
we also have a brightness control or
contrast<00:04:39.040> key<00:04:39.280> we<00:04:39.460> have<00:04:39.640> a<00:04:39.670> previous<00:04:40.300> key<00:04:40.660> or<00:04:40.810> a

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
contrast key we have a previous key or a

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.720 
contrast key we have a previous key or a
back<00:04:41.050> button<00:04:41.230> it<00:04:41.530> power<00:04:41.770> on<00:04:41.950> and<00:04:42.100> off<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:42.460> also

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
back button it power on and off and also

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.370 
back button it power on and off and also
a<00:04:42.850> next<00:04:43.270> button<00:04:43.540> when<00:04:43.990> we're<00:04:44.110> going<00:04:44.260> through

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
a next button when we're going through

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.230 
a next button when we're going through
different<00:04:44.710> applications<00:04:45.190> and<00:04:45.340> then<00:04:45.610> men<00:04:46.030> and

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
different applications and then men and

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.760 
different applications and then men and
Memo<00:04:46.930> applications

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
Memo applications

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.040 
Memo applications
so<00:04:48.250> overall<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.670> sharp<00:04:48.880> o<00:04:49.000> is<00:04:49.150> a<00:04:49.270> 290<00:04:49.750> isn't

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
so overall the sharp o is a 290 isn't

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.480 
so overall the sharp o is a 290 isn't
too<00:04:50.140> much<00:04:50.290> of<00:04:50.410> a<00:04:50.470> surprise<00:04:50.620> in<00:04:51.100> terms<00:04:51.310> of

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
too much of a surprise in terms of

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.310 
too much of a surprise in terms of
application<00:04:51.670> again<00:04:52.420> it<00:04:52.540> has<00:04:52.690> that<00:04:52.900> converter

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
application again it has that converter

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.990 
application again it has that converter
which<00:04:53.800> works<00:04:54.040> fairly<00:04:54.190> well<00:04:54.370> but<00:04:54.700> it<00:04:54.790> has<00:04:54.820> a

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
which works fairly well but it has a

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.730

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
experience isn't good enough for you

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.720 
experience isn't good enough for you
then<00:05:59.470> maybe<00:05:59.620> you<00:05:59.740> should<00:05:59.890> consider<00:05:59.980> the<00:06:00.370> oz2

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:00.730 
then maybe you should consider the oz2

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.880 
then maybe you should consider the oz2
90<00:06:01.270> series<00:06:01.450> otherwise<00:06:01.990> we<00:06:02.290> would<00:06:02.410> really

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
90 series otherwise we would really

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.500 
90 series otherwise we would really
recommend<00:06:03.100> you<00:06:03.400> get<00:06:03.610> to<00:06:03.820> consider<00:06:04.150> looking<00:06:04.300> at

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
recommend you get to consider looking at

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.660 
recommend you get to consider looking at
a<00:06:04.540> very<00:06:05.020> basic<00:06:05.260> smartphone<00:06:05.890> because<00:06:06.100> they<00:06:06.220> can

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 
a very basic smartphone because they can

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.340 
a very basic smartphone because they can
do<00:06:06.760> basically<00:06:07.090> the<00:06:07.210> same<00:06:07.480> features<00:06:07.990> that<00:06:08.020> this

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
do basically the same features that this
