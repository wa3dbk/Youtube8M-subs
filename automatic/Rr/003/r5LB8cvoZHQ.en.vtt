this<00:00:08.849> cool<00:00:09.179> Lego<00:00:09.480> vacuum<00:00:09.960> cleaner<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.469> I

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
this cool Lego vacuum cleaner and I

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.129 
this cool Lego vacuum cleaner and I
think<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.250> looks<00:00:11.429> pretty<00:00:11.670> realistic<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.870> did

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
think it looks pretty realistic I did

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.539 
think it looks pretty realistic I did
the<00:00:13.259> best<00:00:13.410> job<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.950> could<00:00:14.250> with<00:00:14.400> the

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
the best job that I could with the

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.779 
the best job that I could with the
pieces<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.719> have<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.770> needed<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.640> keep

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
pieces that I have and I needed to keep

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.660 
pieces that I have and I needed to keep
it<00:00:17.910> minifigure<00:00:18.420> scale<00:00:18.750> too<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.310> has<00:00:20.640> a

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
it minifigure scale too so it has a

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.120 
it minifigure scale too so it has a
handle<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.869> does<00:00:22.170> even<00:00:22.439> have<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> color

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
handle and it does even have a color

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.740 
handle and it does even have a color
piece<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.490> represent<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> area<00:00:24.330> all<00:00:24.539> that

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
piece to represent the area all that

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.589 
piece to represent the area all that
stuff<00:00:25.500> goes<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.340> minifigure<00:00:26.849> scale<00:00:27.180> so

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
stuff goes and it is minifigure scale so

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.330 
stuff goes and it is minifigure scale so
I<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:27.840> just<00:00:27.960> take<00:00:28.170> my<00:00:28.380> brick<00:00:29.099> check

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
I can just take my brick check

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.189 
I can just take my brick check
minifigure<00:00:29.820> here<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.179> she<00:00:30.900> can<00:00:31.050> actually

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
minifigure here and she can actually

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.860 
minifigure here and she can actually
hold<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.430> handle<00:00:33.300> here

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
hold on to this handle here

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.080 
hold on to this handle here
wait<00:00:34.620> that's<00:00:34.920> not<00:00:35.250> going<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> work<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:35.940> it

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
wait that's not going to work but it

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.440 
wait that's not going to work but it
actually<00:00:36.329> bends<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.890> she<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.309> actually<00:00:38.940> push

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
actually bends so she can actually push

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
bottom and she can actually do some

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.010 
bottom and she can actually do some
vacuuming<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.430> let's<00:00:44.820> get<00:00:45.000> started<00:00:45.390> alright

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
vacuuming so let's get started alright

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
build the Lego vacuum cleaner if you

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.830 
build the Lego vacuum cleaner if you
don't<00:00:50.550> have<00:00:50.670> some<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.940> these<00:00:51.000> pieces<00:00:51.270> don't

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
don't have some of these pieces don't

worry I will be showing you how to make

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.369 
worry I will be showing you how to make
some<00:00:53.489> ultimate<00:00:54.270> versions<00:00:54.719> using<00:00:55.050> different

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
some ultimate versions using different

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.470 
some ultimate versions using different
pieces<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.070> tutorial<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.699> guys<00:00:57.270> can

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
pieces in the tutorial and you guys can

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.760 
pieces in the tutorial and you guys can
use<00:00:57.600> whatever<00:00:57.750> colored<00:00:58.199> pieces<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.680> you

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
use whatever colored pieces that you

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.549 
use whatever colored pieces that you
would<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.730> you<00:01:00.120> will<00:01:00.270> need<00:01:00.449> two<00:01:00.930> 1<00:01:01.379> by<00:01:01.500> 2

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
would like so you will need two 1 by 2

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.710 
would like so you will need two 1 by 2
plates<00:01:02.190> one<00:01:03.180> 1<00:01:03.420> by<00:01:03.750> 2<00:01:03.809> jumper<00:01:04.470> plate<00:01:05.090> 1<00:01:06.090> 2<00:01:06.510> by<00:01:06.659> 2

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
here you can use this so I can just take

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.039 
here you can use this so I can just take
this<00:03:01.390> off<00:03:01.739> here<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.299> put<00:03:04.299> this<00:03:04.540> on<00:03:04.810> like<00:03:07.049> that

this off here and put this on like that

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.560 
this off here and put this on like that
it<00:03:08.860> does<00:03:09.190> stay<00:03:09.400> upright<00:03:09.700> doesn't<00:03:10.239> move<00:03:10.360> as

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.750 
smoothly as the with the inverted tile
piece<00:03:13.600> but<00:03:14.200> it'll<00:03:14.590> work<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:14.980> then<00:03:15.489> if<00:03:15.640> you

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
piece but it'll work and then if you

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.330

can easily replace it with this tap
piece<00:03:21.579> I<00:03:21.850> don't<00:03:22.690> think<00:03:22.900> it<00:03:23.019> looks<00:03:23.230> as<00:03:23.470> good<00:03:23.890> but

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
piece I don't think it looks as good but

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.270 
piece I don't think it looks as good but
it<00:03:24.310> still<00:03:24.640> works<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.269> a<00:03:25.959> minifigure<00:03:26.380> can

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
it still works and a minifigure can

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.400 
it still works and a minifigure can
still<00:03:27.640> hold<00:03:28.060> on<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.269> it<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:29.620> then

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
still hold on to it and then

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.400 
still hold on to it and then
