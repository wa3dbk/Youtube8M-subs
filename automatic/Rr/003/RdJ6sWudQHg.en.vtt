just citing restaurants you do have so
many<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.119> Louisville<00:01:06.450> why<00:01:06.660> come<00:01:06.899> here<00:01:06.929> what's

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:07.289 
many in Louisville why come here what's

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:10.880 
many in Louisville why come here what's
unique<00:01:07.649> here<00:01:07.880> well<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.090> think<00:01:09.360> we're<00:01:09.539> a<00:01:09.890> more

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
unique here well I think we're a more

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.190 
unique here well I think we're a more
seasonal<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.729> more<00:01:11.910> local<00:01:12.390> than<00:01:12.600> any<00:01:12.960> other

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
seasonal and more local than any other

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.660 
seasonal and more local than any other
place<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.770> some<00:01:14.039> things<00:01:14.070> are<00:01:14.340> really<00:01:14.460> off

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
place so some things are really off

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.480 
place so some things are really off
limits<00:01:15.140> we<00:01:16.140> don't<00:01:16.289> have<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.590> dish<00:01:16.920> that's<00:01:16.950> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
limits we don't have a dish that's a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.510 
limits we don't have a dish that's a
seafood<00:01:17.880> dish<00:01:18.090> that's<00:01:19.220> you<00:01:20.220> know<00:01:20.340> just

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
seafood dish that's you know just

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.010 
seafood dish that's you know just
happens<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.030> on<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.300> menu<00:01:21.450> we've<00:01:21.720> decided

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
happens to be on the menu we've decided

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.600 
happens to be on the menu we've decided
not<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.740> until<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.159> can<00:01:23.369> figure<00:01:23.490> out

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
not to do that until we can figure out

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.320 
not to do that until we can figure out
how<00:01:23.789> to<00:01:23.850> source<00:01:24.240> local<00:01:25.110> aquaculture<00:01:25.649> products

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
how to source local aquaculture products

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.169 
how to source local aquaculture products
so<00:01:27.710> we're<00:01:28.710> not<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.039> pure<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.580> won't<00:01:30.000> have

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
so we're not so pure that we won't have

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.330 
so we're not so pure that we won't have
chocolate<00:01:30.630> or<00:01:30.750> coffee<00:01:31.050> or<00:01:31.319> whatever<00:01:31.860> but

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
chocolate or coffee or whatever but

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.340 
chocolate or coffee or whatever but
there<00:01:32.700> there<00:01:33.000> won't<00:01:33.210> be<00:01:33.300> any<00:01:33.479> maned<00:01:33.840> issues

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
there there won't be any maned issues

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.469 
there there won't be any maned issues
principal<00:01:35.310> ingredient<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.970> something<00:01:36.329> other

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
principal ingredient is something other

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.080 
principal ingredient is something other
than<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:37.530> from<00:01:38.040> here<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.700> really<00:01:39.000> a

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
than here from here so it's really a

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.399 
than here from here so it's really a
celebration<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.780> things<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.290> have

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
celebration of things that we have

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.550 
celebration of things that we have
locally<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.360> think<00:01:42.360> people<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.200> know<00:01:43.320> can

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
locally so I think people you know can

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.160 
locally so I think people you know can
go<00:01:43.740> astray<00:01:44.130> when<00:01:44.670> they<00:01:44.909> go<00:01:45.420> somewhere<00:01:45.600> else<00:01:45.810> to

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
go astray when they go somewhere else to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.630 
go astray when they go somewhere else to
buy<00:01:46.530> their<00:01:46.770> things<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.250> end<00:01:47.460> up<00:01:47.610> with

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
buy their things and end up with

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.520 
buy their things and end up with
something<00:01:47.939> that's<00:01:48.180> religious<00:01:48.630> not<00:01:49.170> as<00:01:49.320> good

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
something that's religious not as good

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.230 
something that's religious not as good
authentic<00:01:50.310> experience<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:50.880> coming<00:01:51.090> here<00:01:51.180> if

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240
