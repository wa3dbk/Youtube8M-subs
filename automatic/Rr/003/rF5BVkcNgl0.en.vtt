guns<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.500> gear<00:00:13.650> channel<00:00:14.130> we're<00:00:14.759> gonna<00:00:14.849> talk

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
guns and gear channel we're gonna talk

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.950 
guns and gear channel we're gonna talk
about<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:16.020> Bravo<00:00:16.560> Company<00:00:17.119> gunfighter<00:00:18.119> 1911

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
about the Bravo Company gunfighter 1911

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.349 
about the Bravo Company gunfighter 1911
built<00:00:19.289> exclusively<00:00:20.039> by<00:00:20.220> Wilson<00:00:20.609> combat<00:00:21.000> and

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
built exclusively by Wilson combat and

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.380 
built exclusively by Wilson combat and
we're<00:00:21.810> gonna<00:00:21.930> share<00:00:22.410> our<00:00:22.830> impressions<00:00:23.580> of

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
we're gonna share our impressions of

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.349 
we're gonna share our impressions of
shooting<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.250> well-fitted<00:00:26.250> custom<00:00:26.699> 1911

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
shooting a well-fitted custom 1911

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.240 
shooting a well-fitted custom 1911
because<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.900> noticeably<00:00:28.470> different<00:00:28.980> than

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
because it is noticeably different than

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.240 
because it is noticeably different than
shooting<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.910> standard<00:00:30.510> out-of-the-box<00:00:31.439> 1911

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
shooting a standard out-of-the-box 1911

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.740 
shooting a standard out-of-the-box 1911
would<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.550> not<00:00:32.700> agree<00:00:32.730> Mike<00:00:33.120> yeah<00:00:33.450> I'd<00:00:33.630> agree

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
would you not agree Mike yeah I'd agree

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.420 
would you not agree Mike yeah I'd agree
I<00:00:33.899> mean<00:00:34.110> just<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.680> way<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.980> recoil<00:00:35.340> impulse

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
I mean just the way the recoil impulse

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.590 
I mean just the way the recoil impulse
is<00:00:35.760> going<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.969> be<00:00:36.059> different<00:00:36.329> because<00:00:36.390> it's

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
is going to be different because it's

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.420 
is going to be different because it's
not<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> jacket<00:00:37.469> if<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.710> will<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.219> those<00:00:38.309> of

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
not a jacket if you will for those of

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.319 
not a jacket if you will for those of
you<00:00:38.520> guys<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.640> have<00:00:38.850> shot<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.030> you'll<00:00:39.210> note

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
you guys that have shot it you'll note

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.400 
you guys that have shot it you'll note
I'm<00:00:39.450> talking<00:00:39.660> about<00:00:39.690> but<00:00:39.930> for<00:00:40.140> those<00:00:40.290> that

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
I'm talking about but for those that

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.220 
I'm talking about but for those that
haven't<00:00:40.710> as<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.760> slide<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.329> coming<00:00:42.899> back<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
haven't as that slide is coming back and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.810 
haven't as that slide is coming back and
going<00:00:43.350> forward<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:43.890> doing<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> very

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
going forward it's doing so on a very

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.970 
going forward it's doing so on a very
smooth<00:00:45.180> level<00:00:45.600> plane<00:00:45.840> which<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.710> rails

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
smooth level plane which is the rails

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.799 
smooth level plane which is the rails
that<00:00:47.160> obviously<00:00:47.610> are<00:00:47.760> hand-fitted<00:00:48.270> at<00:00:48.510> Wilson

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
that obviously are hand-fitted at Wilson

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.540 
that obviously are hand-fitted at Wilson
combat<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.289> that's<00:00:49.440> gonna<00:00:49.620> make<00:00:49.950> for<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.430> much

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
combat so that's gonna make for a much

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.340 
combat so that's gonna make for a much
smoother<00:00:51.030> recoil<00:00:51.420> impulse<00:00:51.539> while<00:00:52.199> you're

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
smoother recoil impulse while you're

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.049 
smoother recoil impulse while you're
firing<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.680> gun<00:00:52.829> makes<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.340> big<00:00:53.579> difference

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
firing the gun makes a big difference

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.330 
firing the gun makes a big difference
especially<00:00:54.989> if<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.530> ever<00:00:55.680> get<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.890> chance<00:00:56.219> to

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
especially if you ever get a chance to

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.340 
especially if you ever get a chance to
shoot<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.550> gun<00:00:56.789> like<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.329> versus<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.140> box

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
shoot a gun like this versus the box

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.080 
shoot a gun like this versus the box
cock<00:00:58.680> 1911<00:00:59.430> you'll<00:00:59.550> notice<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.000> immediately

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
cock 1911 you'll notice it immediately

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.049 
cock 1911 you'll notice it immediately
with<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> same<00:01:01.199> ammo<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:02.010> recoil<00:01:02.460> impulse<00:01:02.609> is

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
with the same ammo the recoil impulse is

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.240 
with the same ammo the recoil impulse is
much<00:01:03.300> more<00:01:03.570> linear<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.860> hear<00:01:05.070> people

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
much more linear it's in you hear people

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.859 
much more linear it's in you hear people
say<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.790> gun<00:01:06.060> writers<00:01:06.360> have<00:01:06.510> even<00:01:06.689> talked

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
say this gun writers have even talked

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.630 
say this gun writers have even talked
about<00:01:06.960> how<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.350> feels<00:01:07.530> like<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.130> slides<00:01:08.430> on

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
about how it feels like the slides on

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.850 
about how it feels like the slides on
ball<00:01:08.850> bearings<00:01:09.030> all<00:01:09.780> right<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.140> first<00:01:10.380> up<00:01:10.619> I'll

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
ball bearings all right so first up I'll

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.859 
ball bearings all right so first up I'll
do<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> build<00:01:11.400> drill<00:01:11.640> I'm<00:01:11.880> good<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.330> steel<00:01:12.630> and

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
do a build drill I'm good on steel and

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.300 
do a build drill I'm good on steel and
then<00:01:12.960> we'll<00:01:13.110> let<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.590> all<00:01:14.189> right

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
then we'll let you have that all right

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:24.860 
then we'll let you have that all right
all<00:01:14.490> right

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.630 

what<00:01:25.870> with<00:01:25.990> that<00:01:26.020> let's<00:01:26.680> say<00:01:26.860> so<00:01:26.920> good<00:01:27.430> deal

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
what with that let's say so good deal

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.310 
what with that let's say so good deal
brother<00:01:27.850> we'll<00:01:28.090> get<00:01:28.270> you<00:01:28.420> up<00:01:28.600> all<00:01:28.990> right<00:01:31.320> big

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
brother we'll get you up all right big

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:41.160 
brother we'll get you up all right big
shots<00:01:32.560> on<00:01:32.740> steel<00:01:32.980> let's<00:01:33.190> see<00:01:33.280> how<00:01:33.370> we<00:01:33.490> do<00:01:40.170> all

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
shots on steel let's see how we do all

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.450 
shots on steel let's see how we do all
right<00:01:41.200> no<00:01:41.590> doubt<00:01:41.740> about<00:01:41.890> it<00:01:42.040> when<00:01:42.310> you're

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
right no doubt about it when you're

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.890 
right no doubt about it when you're
actually<00:01:42.580> firing<00:01:43.030> that<00:01:43.300> and<00:01:43.510> you<00:01:43.570> feel<00:01:43.780> the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
actually firing that and you feel the

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.110 
actually firing that and you feel the
recoil<00:01:44.080> impulse<00:01:44.440> it's<00:01:44.979> definitely<00:01:45.460> smooth

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
recoil impulse it's definitely smooth

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.969 
recoil impulse it's definitely smooth
and<00:01:46.420> it<00:01:46.600> tracks<00:01:46.840> back<00:01:46.960> on<00:01:47.229> target<00:01:47.590> really<00:01:47.770> well

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
and it tracks back on target really well

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.950 
and it tracks back on target really well
yeah<00:01:48.460> and<00:01:48.580> you<00:01:48.700> know<00:01:48.850> one<00:01:49.390> thing<00:01:49.600> that<00:01:49.630> some

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
yeah and you know one thing that some

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.300 
yeah and you know one thing that some
people<00:01:49.990> tend<00:01:50.440> to<00:01:50.500> overlook<00:01:50.860> is<00:01:51.040> you<00:01:51.130> know<00:01:51.280> a

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
people tend to overlook is you know a

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.330 
people tend to overlook is you know a
steel<00:01:51.910> frame<00:01:52.240> light<00:01:52.840> rail<00:01:53.170> 1911<00:01:53.920> does<00:01:54.100> have<00:01:54.310> a

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
steel frame light rail 1911 does have a

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.980 
steel frame light rail 1911 does have a
little<00:01:54.610> bit<00:01:54.729> more<00:01:54.910> weight<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:55.210> it<00:01:55.420> so<00:01:55.720> it<00:01:55.810> is

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
little bit more weight to it so it is

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.660 
little bit more weight to it so it is
softens<00:01:56.530> recall<00:01:56.950> just<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:57.190> little<00:01:57.400> bit<00:01:57.490> more

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
softens recall just a little bit more

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.520 
softens recall just a little bit more
yep<00:01:58.000> it's<00:01:58.150> gonna<00:01:58.210> add<00:01:58.420> a<00:01:58.450> couple<00:01:59.080> ounces<00:01:59.200> right

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
yep it's gonna add a couple ounces right
