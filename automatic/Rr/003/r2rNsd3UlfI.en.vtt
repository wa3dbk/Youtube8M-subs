recommend that everyone goes out and

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.519 
recommend that everyone goes out and
buys<00:00:28.410> one<00:00:28.970> if<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.240> use<00:00:30.480> frogs<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.289> if<00:00:31.439> you

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
buys one if you use frogs and if you

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.030 
buys one if you use frogs and if you

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
haven't tried them yet this frog is

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.630 
haven't tried them yet this frog is
great<00:00:35.579> because<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:36.180> super<00:00:36.750> soft<00:00:37.520> you<00:00:38.520> know

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
great because it's super soft you know

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.420 
great because it's super soft you know
it's<00:00:38.910> just<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.690> realistic<00:00:40.410> if<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:41.160> aren't

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
it's just so realistic if you aren't

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.490 
it's just so realistic if you aren't
careful<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.420> soft<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.170> can<00:00:43.350> easily

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
careful it's so soft that you can easily

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.990 
careful it's so soft that you can easily
poke<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> hole<00:00:44.040> through<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.460> with<00:00:44.670> your<00:00:44.820> hook

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
poke a hole through it with your hook

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.360 
poke a hole through it with your hook
that's<00:00:45.809> one<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.230> disadvantages<00:00:46.410> if<00:00:47.250> you

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
that's one of the disadvantages if you

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.770 
that's one of the disadvantages if you
get<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> snag<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.120> might<00:00:48.270> poke<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.510> hole<00:00:48.600> through

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
get a snag it might poke a hole through

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.139 
get a snag it might poke a hole through
it<00:00:48.989> but<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.950> know<00:00:49.980> for<00:00:50.430> six<00:00:50.700> bucks<00:00:50.820> apiece

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
it but you know for six bucks apiece

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.020 
it but you know for six bucks apiece
this<00:00:51.840> isn't<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.620> budget<00:00:53.129> breaker<00:00:53.370> unlike

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030
