00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.390

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.880

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.640
 already filmed so to speak and indeed 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.970
 with a make-up in hip medlock 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.680
 that's the whole thing 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.420
 and if you want to do that 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.710
 want to know how it works or simply 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.430
 just want to know how I did that 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.059
 have 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.559
 then just stay with one 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.750
 matter and one 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.129
 I'm doing something against the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.899
 greasy and dry skin 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.510
 Of course, a nice make up is a must 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.520
 also a nice skin there my skin from 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.039
 nature but not so immaculate 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.039
 I use a base first 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.170
 and then I use a make 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.170
 up in my skin tone 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.159
 Something helps against dark circles 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.159
 higher concealer 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.439
 a transparent powder and a 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:34.659
 prevent liquid brush annoying 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.659
 shine in the face and fix the mecca 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:43.009
 with a slip brush and a bronze 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.009
 you can conjure contours 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.710
 a fresh russian after tampere ribbon 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.090
 with an eyeshadow base become oily 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.090
 primed songs 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:12.520
 Now it's up to my two eyeshadows 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.380
 pallets with a flat eyeshadow 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:21.790
 I wear the lightest brush 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:23.980
 Eyeshadow under the bows on the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.260
 Skin tone comes directly underneath 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.260
 on the immovable song 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:39.170
 I use the gray eyeshadow pencil 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:44.080
 as colored bates with a short 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.080
 Brushes are smoothed out hard edges 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.819
 that comes through the next brush 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.819
 Rich silver on moving lid 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:09.170
 with the help of the terrain brush comes that 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.170
 anthracite in the lid fold 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.920
 with the flat brush is blinded 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:35.620
 white eyeshadow as well as a fleeting one 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:35.620
 lips brush open your eyes in winkl 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:46.520
 came with a raised eyebrow, the 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:50.380
 little haired brushed hair 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:54.550
 brush and the dark brown eyeshadow 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.550
 fill in the eyebrows 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.489
 with the same brush and the black 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.980
 I draw a soft one stroke 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.770
 dark silver 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:23.940
 comes again under the eye a white 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:28.620
 one on the waterline opens that 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:33.290
 Eye visually with the mascara of mine 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.290
 I trust my upper hand 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.669
 and lower picture edge 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.470
 lipstick and lip gloss surrendered 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.470
 together the perfect lip color 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.660
 and then really only the missing 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.190
 matching jewelry with which you can be 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.740
 face the additionally still such a 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.720
 can find a bit and then mine is 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.130
 I actually finished already 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.350
 he thinks it's really nice then 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.300
 and the degree of difficulty 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.460
 not necessarily that high right now 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.680
 means I dare you to that 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.420
