not<00:00:59.480> good<00:00:59.780> for<00:01:00.230> sports<00:01:00.470> why<00:01:00.920> because<00:01:01.430> you<00:01:01.550> have

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
not good for sports why because you have

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
use the first pull is controlled so you

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.920 
use the first pull is controlled so you
don't<00:01:07.250> distort<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:07.640> second<00:01:07.940> pole<00:01:08.090> that's<00:01:08.750> how

heavy stuff 400 pounds a heavy weight
but<00:02:10.470> they<00:02:10.619> don't<00:02:10.860> go<00:02:11.009> down<00:02:11.039> slow<00:02:11.489> with<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.819> they

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
but they don't go down slow with it they

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.170 
but they don't go down slow with it they
go<00:02:12.269> down<00:02:12.450> fast<00:02:12.690> with<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.640> never<00:02:14.640> lower<00:02:14.880> bar

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
go down fast with it never lower bar

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.610 
go down fast with it never lower bar
slowly<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:16.670> mentioned<00:02:17.670> yesterday<00:02:17.760> we<00:02:18.319> no<00:02:19.319> depth

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
slowly I mentioned yesterday we no depth

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.860

jumps<00:02:19.980> work<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:21.000> you're<00:02:21.150> moving<00:02:21.299> to<00:02:21.540> speed<00:02:21.750> of

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
jumps work so you're moving to speed of

second<00:02:23.940> we<00:02:24.750> know<00:02:24.930> they<00:02:25.079> work<00:02:25.260> right<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:25.890> why

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
second we know they work right so why

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.569 
second we know they work right so why
would<00:02:26.220> anyone<00:02:26.489> lower<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:27.030> barbell<00:02:27.420> slowly<00:02:28.579> and

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
would anyone lower a barbell slowly and

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.140 
would anyone lower a barbell slowly and
sports<00:02:30.030> there's<00:02:30.299> no<00:02:30.420> reason<00:02:31.970> if<00:02:32.970> a

look<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.310> talked<00:02:38.519> about<00:02:38.579> yes<00:02:38.850> they<00:02:39.000> over<00:02:39.180> speed

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:39.389 
look I talked about yes they over speed

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:45.810 
look I talked about yes they over speed
is<00:02:39.480> centuries

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.080

need to come to my gym and they're going

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.050 
need to come to my gym and they're going
to<00:02:54.890> see<00:02:54.980> some<00:02:55.130> big<00:02:55.250> heavy<00:02:55.430> weights<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.790> lift<00:02:55.940> it

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
to see some big heavy weights to lift it

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.570 
to see some big heavy weights to lift it
real<00:02:56.300> fast<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.920> but<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:57.950> want<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.250> talk<00:02:58.370> about

stuff like us

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.670 
stuff like us
you're<00:03:17.030> basically<00:03:17.270> one<00:03:17.660> two<00:03:17.840> three<00:03:18.110> you<00:03:18.590> know

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
you're basically one two three you know

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.050 
you're basically one two three you know
will<00:03:18.800> you<00:03:18.830> get<00:03:19.040> around<00:03:19.250> three<00:03:19.490> one<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.700> 90

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
will you get around three one a 90

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.990 
another record but stop so if you look
at<00:03:27.770> that<00:03:27.920> you're<00:03:28.130> looking<00:03:28.370> at<00:03:28.490> three<00:03:28.670> lists<00:03:28.880> a

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
at that you're looking at three lists a

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.120 
at that you're looking at three lists a
week<00:03:29.150> or<00:03:29.330> 12<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.660> month<00:03:29.840> now

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.830 
week or 12 a month now
here's<00:03:31.640> what<00:03:31.850> you<00:03:32.000> have<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.209> do<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.570> this<00:03:32.660> is

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
here's what you have to do and this is

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.990 
here's what you have to do and this is
why<00:03:32.959> it<00:03:33.080> fits<00:03:33.230> into<00:03:33.470> sports<00:03:33.800> because<00:03:34.670> you're

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
why it fits into sports because you're

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.670 
why it fits into sports because you're
doing<00:03:35.270> 80<00:03:35.510> list<00:03:35.810> of<00:03:35.930> most<00:03:36.080> for<00:03:36.230> explosive

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
doing 80 list of most for explosive

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.260 
doing 80 list of most for explosive
power<00:03:36.830> and<00:03:37.130> that's<00:03:37.640> what<00:03:37.760> you're<00:03:38.000> trying<00:03:38.209> to

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
power and that's what you're trying to

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.720 
power and that's what you're trying to
achieve<00:03:38.390> right<00:03:38.720> at<00:03:38.930> 12<00:03:39.410> for<00:03:39.560> max<00:03:39.740> effort<00:03:39.980> the

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
achieve right at 12 for max effort the

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.910 
achieve right at 12 for max effort the
rest<00:03:40.970> of<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.209> time<00:03:41.420> is<00:03:41.690> developed<00:03:42.260> into

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
squat but my bench never moved for three

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.670 
squat but my bench never moved for three
years<00:04:05.300> when<00:04:05.450> I<00:04:05.480> broke<00:04:05.690> my<00:04:05.810> back<00:04:05.989> I<00:04:06.019> started

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
years when I broke my back I started

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
years when I broke my back I started
reading<00:04:06.860> about<00:04:06.890> the<00:04:07.130> books<00:04:07.340> and<00:04:07.489> started

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
reading about the books and started

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.310 
reading about the books and started
reading<00:04:07.820> about<00:04:07.940> their<00:04:08.209> loading<00:04:08.390> then<00:04:09.110> you

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
reading about their loading then you

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.600 
reading about their loading then you
know<00:04:09.410> this<00:04:09.590> is<00:04:09.709> no<00:04:09.860> bench<00:04:10.100> shirt<00:04:10.250> then<00:04:10.519> I

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
know this is no bench shirt then I

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.810 
know this is no bench shirt then I
benched<00:04:10.910> for<00:04:11.060> 84<00:04:11.510> for<00:04:11.900> 94<00:04:12.440> 96<00:04:12.830> and<00:04:13.100> I<00:04:13.459> still

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
benched for 84 for 94 96 and I still

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.640 
benched for 84 for 94 96 and I still
thought<00:04:14.030> it<00:04:14.180> was<00:04:14.300> a<00:04:14.330> fluke<00:04:14.630> even<00:04:15.560> though<00:04:15.620> I

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
thought it was a fluke even though I

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.229 
thought it was a fluke even though I
hadn't<00:04:16.010> got<00:04:16.100> anywhere<00:04:16.340> in<00:04:16.459> three<00:04:16.669> years<00:04:17.030> in

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
hadn't got anywhere in three years in

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.360 
hadn't got anywhere in three years in
the<00:04:17.330> bench<00:04:17.570> I<00:04:17.840> still<00:04:18.590> thought<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:18.830> was<00:04:19.040> a<00:04:19.070> fluke

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
the bench I still thought it was a fluke

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.699 
the bench I still thought it was a fluke
so<00:04:20.209> I<00:04:20.239> got<00:04:20.450> my<00:04:20.600> other<00:04:20.720> guys<00:04:20.959> to<00:04:21.140> do<00:04:21.260> it<00:04:21.380> and<00:04:21.590> then

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
so I got my other guys to do it and then

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.620 
so I got my other guys to do it and then
I<00:04:21.739> found<00:04:22.010> it<00:04:22.130> wasn't<00:04:22.460> fluke<00:04:22.669> and<00:04:22.880> we<00:04:23.240> started

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
I found it wasn't fluke and we started

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.030 
I found it wasn't fluke and we started
training<00:04:23.870> I<00:04:23.990> talked<00:04:24.290> to<00:04:24.410> someone<00:04:24.650> dim<00:04:24.890> with

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040
