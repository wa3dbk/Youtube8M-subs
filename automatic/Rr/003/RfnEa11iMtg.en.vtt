thought<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.729> AXI<00:01:48.210> toy<00:01:48.390> would<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.659> one<00:01:48.869> of

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
thought this AXI toy would be one of

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.630 
thought this AXI toy would be one of
those<00:01:49.110> toys<00:01:49.320> where<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:49.799> wind<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.250> up<00:01:50.430> and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
those toys where you just wind it up and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.830 
those toys where you just wind it up and
then<00:01:50.729> when<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.939> let<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.180> go<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.479> would<00:01:51.600> just

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
then when you let it go it would just

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.319 
then when you let it go it would just

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
walk by itself but that's obviously not

you can't see what card you're getting

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.380 
you can't see what card you're getting
because<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:11.799> see<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.069> back<00:02:12.250> of<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:12.549> but<00:02:13.120> there

because you see the back of it but there

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.789 
because you see the back of it but there
are<00:02:13.510> some<00:02:13.720> times<00:02:13.930> when<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.200> packages<00:02:14.650> get

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
are some times when the packages get

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.320 
are some times when the packages get
lazy<00:02:15.069> they<00:02:15.400> actually<00:02:15.700> flip<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.090> card

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
lazy they actually flip the card

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.089 
lazy they actually flip the card
accidentally<00:02:16.959> or<00:02:17.110> maybe<00:02:17.290> on<00:02:17.440> purpose<00:02:17.769> and

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
accidentally or maybe on purpose and

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.710 
accidentally or maybe on purpose and
well<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:18.909> can<00:02:19.060> see<00:02:19.239> what<00:02:19.330> card<00:02:19.599> you're

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
well you can see what card you're

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.600 
well you can see what card you're
getting<00:02:19.870> so<00:02:20.290> be<00:02:20.860> on<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:20.980> lookout<00:02:21.370> for<00:02:21.430> that

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
getting so be on the lookout for that

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.949 
getting so be on the lookout for that
kind<00:02:21.909> of<00:02:21.970> thing<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.239> guess<00:02:22.269> if<00:02:22.750> you're

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
kind of thing I guess if you're
