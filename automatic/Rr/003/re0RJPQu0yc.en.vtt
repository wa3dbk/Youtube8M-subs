00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
options you all you need to swipe up

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.639 
options you all you need to swipe up
from<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.760> bottom<00:00:38.850> like<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.930> show<00:00:40.620> that

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
from the bottom like that show that

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.770 
from the bottom like that show that
again<00:00:40.829> just<00:00:41.129> swipe<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.520> bezel<00:00:41.730> up<00:00:42.030> if<00:00:42.629> you

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
again just swipe on the bezel up if you

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.770 
again just swipe on the bezel up if you
swipe<00:00:43.110> from<00:00:43.410> right<00:00:43.739> here<00:00:44.460> up<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:45.360> works<00:00:45.570> too

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
swipe from right here up it works too

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.119 
swipe from right here up it works too
but<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.289> find<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.559> easier<00:00:46.800> swiping<00:00:47.100> from

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
but I just find it easier swiping from

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.190 
but I just find it easier swiping from
the<00:00:47.309> bezel<00:00:47.579> up<00:00:47.700> because<00:00:48.360> sometimes<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.960> swipe

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the bezel up because sometimes you swipe

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.590 
the bezel up because sometimes you swipe
a<00:00:49.440> little<00:00:49.950> bit<00:00:50.070> from<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> bottom<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.270> doesn't

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
a little bit from the bottom it doesn't

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.650 
a little bit from the bottom it doesn't
get<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.780> like<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:53.149> swiping<00:00:54.149> from<00:00:54.180> paid<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
get it like that swiping from paid to

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.779 
get it like that swiping from paid to
page<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.199> from<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.920> side<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.340> side<00:00:56.489> just<00:00:56.550> like

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
page is from the side to side just like

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.299 
page is from the side to side just like
that<00:00:57.090> if<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.899> swipe<00:00:58.170> down<00:00:58.379> nothing<00:00:59.219> really

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
that if you swipe down nothing really

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.010 
that if you swipe down nothing really
happens<00:00:59.789> your<00:01:00.059> notification<00:01:00.570> center<00:01:00.780> almost

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
but I feel like this shouldn't be free

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.720 
but I feel like this shouldn't be free
they<00:02:31.740> should<00:02:31.890> maybe<00:02:31.980> put<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.280> ninety-nine

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730

or something like that and 199 but I

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.860 
or something like that and 199 but I
mean<00:02:37.770> it's<00:02:38.130> not<00:02:38.280> bad<00:02:38.520> for<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:38.850> free<00:02:39.060> app<00:02:39.240> but

maybe a couple weeks later you buy the

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.080 
maybe a couple weeks later you buy the
outline<00:03:19.830> maybe<00:03:20.160> like<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.400> month<00:03:20.580> or<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:20.940> you're

gonna have the whole ab baat there won't

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.130 
gonna have the whole ab baat there won't
be<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.590> big<00:03:22.800> of<00:03:22.860> a<00:03:22.950> deal<00:03:23.750> but<00:03:24.750> I<00:03:24.810> just<00:03:25.080> think

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
be that big of a deal but I just think

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.500 
be that big of a deal but I just think
it's<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.380> little<00:03:25.470> expensive<00:03:25.980> especially<00:03:26.510> 199

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
it's a little expensive especially 199

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.080 
it's a little expensive especially 199
per<00:03:28.050> each<00:03:28.230> little<00:03:28.500> thing<00:03:28.560> 99<00:03:29.310> cents<00:03:29.880> i<00:03:29.970> can

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
per each little thing 99 cents i can

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.780 
per each little thing 99 cents i can
understand<00:03:30.510> but<00:03:30.720> 199<00:03:31.260> two<00:03:31.650> bucks<00:03:31.890> for<00:03:32.160> to

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
understand but 199 two bucks for to

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.870 
understand but 199 two bucks for to
learn<00:03:32.970> how<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.209> write<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:34.220> mean<00:03:35.220> that's<00:03:35.640> a<00:03:35.790> low

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
learn how to write I mean that's a low

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.820 
learn how to write I mean that's a low
expensive<00:03:36.360> in<00:03:36.450> my<00:03:36.540> opinion<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:37.350> if<00:03:37.680> you're

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
expensive in my opinion so if you're

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.920 
expensive in my opinion so if you're
looking<00:03:37.920> for<00:03:38.070> this<00:03:38.280> app<00:03:38.720> sketching<00:03:39.720> app<00:03:39.810> you

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
looking for this app sketching app you

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.330 
looking for this app sketching app you
might<00:03:39.989> want<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:40.200> pass<00:03:40.380> this<00:03:40.410> one<00:03:40.709> up<00:03:40.769> it's<00:03:41.220> not

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
might want to pass this one up it's not

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.940 
might want to pass this one up it's not
bad<00:03:41.580> the<00:03:42.060> quality<00:03:42.390> looks<00:03:42.480> great<00:03:42.870> but<00:03:43.500> you<00:03:43.769> just

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
bad the quality looks great but you just

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.690 
bad the quality looks great but you just
can't<00:03:44.160> really<00:03:44.430> do<00:03:44.670> much<00:03:44.700> um<00:03:45.230> but<00:03:46.310> you<00:03:47.310> know<00:03:47.340> I

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
can't really do much um but you know I

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.160 
can't really do much um but you know I
guess<00:03:48.090> that's<00:03:48.269> how<00:03:48.330> it<00:03:48.360> goes<00:03:48.480> with<00:03:48.780> free<00:03:48.989> apps

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
guess that's how it goes with free apps

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.870 
guess that's how it goes with free apps
so<00:03:49.860> if<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.010> guys<00:03:50.130> like<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.400> little<00:03:50.670> mini
