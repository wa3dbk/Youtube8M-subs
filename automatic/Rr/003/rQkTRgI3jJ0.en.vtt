a really good gameplay so please check
that<00:03:49.530> out<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:49.950> was<00:03:50.130> just<00:03:50.459> one<00:03:50.670> of<00:03:50.760> my<00:03:50.820> best<00:03:51.060> and

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
that out it was just one of my best and

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.090 
that out it was just one of my best and
I<00:03:51.930> was<00:03:52.410> actually<00:03:52.500> pretty<00:03:52.739> close<00:03:52.950> to

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
I was actually pretty close to

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.550 
I was actually pretty close to
assertions<00:03:53.370> from<00:03:53.610> Moab<00:03:54.030> but<00:03:54.329> I<00:03:54.600> really<00:03:55.049> if<00:03:55.440> I

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
assertions from Moab but I really if I

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.050 
assertions from Moab but I really if I

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
did continue the street there wasn't

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.720 
did continue the street there wasn't
enough<00:03:57.329> people<00:03:57.780> or<00:03:58.019> to<00:03:58.320> kill<00:03:58.560> so<00:03:58.860> whatever<00:03:59.640> it

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
enough people or to kill so whatever it

that<00:04:01.590> was<00:04:01.709> pretty<00:04:01.980> badass<00:04:02.310> but<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:03.440> forgot<00:04:04.440> what

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
that was pretty badass but I forgot what

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.930 
that was pretty badass but I forgot what
I<00:04:04.590> was<00:04:04.709> saying<00:04:04.739> oh<00:04:04.950> yeah<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:05.100> black<00:04:05.400> ops<00:04:05.549> 2<00:04:05.790> the

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
maps I really hope I don't know like I

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.640 
maps I really hope I don't know like I
really<00:04:09.120> hope<00:04:09.329> they<00:04:09.570> are<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:09.810> lot<00:04:10.200> better<00:04:10.470> you

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650

in<00:04:13.260> general<00:04:13.620> what<00:04:13.739> they're<00:04:13.920> so<00:04:14.160> bad<00:04:14.400> they

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
in general what they're so bad they

in general what they're so bad they
theythey<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:16.169> don't<00:04:16.440> know<00:04:16.500> maybe<00:04:16.769> because<00:04:16.919> it's

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
theythey I don't know maybe because it's

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.130 
theythey I don't know maybe because it's
sledgehammer<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.479> they<00:04:18.690> don't<00:04:18.780> really<00:04:18.989> know

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
sledgehammer and they don't really know

sledgehammer and they don't really know
how<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.380> design<00:04:19.560> their<00:04:19.950> maps<00:04:20.250> probably

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
how to design their maps probably

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.130 
how to design their maps probably
properly<00:04:21.510> um<00:04:22.080> I<00:04:22.470> don't<00:04:23.370> know<00:04:24.120> is<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:24.300> me<00:04:24.419> or<00:04:24.570> in

modern<00:04:25.530> 143<00:04:26.039> are<00:04:26.310> there<00:04:26.520> like<00:04:26.729> it's<00:04:27.060> there

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
modern 143 are there like it's there

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.640 
modern 143 are there like it's there
aren't<00:04:27.790> really<00:04:28.150> any<00:04:28.330> levels<00:04:28.810> to<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.140> map<00:04:29.380> I

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
aren't really any levels to the map I

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.110 
aren't really any levels to the map I
think<00:04:29.950> I<00:04:30.010> mentioned<00:04:30.220> this<00:04:30.400> a<00:04:30.640> while<00:04:30.670> back<00:04:30.880> but

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
think I mentioned this a while back but

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.300 
think I mentioned this a while back but
there<00:04:31.570> aren't<00:04:31.720> really<00:04:31.870> levels<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.130> map

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
there aren't really levels to the map

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.110 
there aren't really levels to the map
like<00:04:33.580> high<00:04:33.850> spots<00:04:34.320> such<00:04:35.320> as<00:04:35.350> you<00:04:35.800> know<00:04:36.120> you

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
like high spots such as you know you

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.510 
like high spots such as you know you
know<00:04:37.210> and<00:04:37.420> black<00:04:37.720> ops<00:04:37.930> model<00:04:38.410> 142<00:04:38.680> cod4<00:04:39.310> well

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
know and black ops model 142 cod4 well

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.920 
know and black ops model 142 cod4 well
that<00:04:39.640> were<00:04:39.760> they<00:04:39.940> all<00:04:40.060> had<00:04:40.270> maps<00:04:40.540> where<00:04:40.750> there

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
that were they all had maps where there

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.780 
that were they all had maps where there
are<00:04:41.080> you<00:04:41.560> know<00:04:41.650> different<00:04:41.860> levels<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.610> map

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
are you know different levels to the map

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.430 
are you know different levels to the map
which<00:04:42.970> is<00:04:43.060> really<00:04:43.240> which<00:04:43.450> is<00:04:43.480> what<00:04:43.720> I<00:04:43.750> like<00:04:44.110> I'm

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
which is really which is what I like I'm

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.350 
which is really which is what I like I'm
like<00:04:45.250> crash<00:04:45.520> there's<00:04:45.850> that<00:04:45.940> really<00:04:46.180> tall

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
like crash there's that really tall

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.600 
like crash there's that really tall
building<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:47.860> know<00:04:47.950> just<00:04:48.220> about<00:04:48.280> in<00:04:48.460> every

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610
