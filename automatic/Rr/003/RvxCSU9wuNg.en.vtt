connected to two in the antenna that you

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.420 
connected to two in the antenna that you

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
an Italian right here this one is the 10

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.179 
an Italian right here this one is the 10
of<00:01:56.700> their<00:01:56.820> usefulness<00:01:57.680> instead<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.950> plugging

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
of their usefulness instead of plugging

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.620 
of their usefulness instead of plugging
into<00:01:59.430> my<00:01:59.640> computer<00:01:59.820> i<00:02:00.330> am<00:02:00.900> using

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
into my computer i am using

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.420 
into my computer i am using
for<00:02:01.780> cable<00:02:02.170> like<00:02:02.320> this<00:02:02.500> one<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:02.890> i<00:02:03.070> plug<00:02:03.310> it

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
for cable like this one and i plug it

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.730 
for cable like this one and i plug it
straight<00:02:03.520> into<00:02:03.670> my<00:02:03.969> router<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.750> then<00:02:05.350> this

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
straight into my router and then this

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.679 
straight into my router and then this
one<00:02:05.799> receives<00:02:06.310> all<00:02:06.490> these<00:02:06.640> TV<00:02:06.939> signals<00:02:07.420> and

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
one receives all these TV signals and

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.620 
one receives all these TV signals and
then<00:02:08.729> streams<00:02:09.729> them<00:02:09.970> through<00:02:10.269> my<00:02:10.420> home

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
then streams them through my home

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.509 
then streams them through my home
network<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:11.230> my<00:02:11.349> computer<00:02:11.709> and<00:02:11.980> in<00:02:12.160> this<00:02:12.280> case

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
network to my computer and in this case

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.580 
network to my computer and in this case
I<00:02:12.880> watching<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.569> on<00:02:13.690> my<00:02:13.810> laptop<00:02:13.959> it<00:02:14.380> doesn't

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
I watching it on my laptop it doesn't

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.509 
I watching it on my laptop it doesn't
have<00:02:14.680> any<00:02:14.860> wires<00:02:15.280> as<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.580> can<00:02:15.730> see<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:18.340> can

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
have any wires as you can see and I can

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.160 
have any wires as you can see and I can
watch<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:18.819> anywhere<00:02:19.239> in<00:02:19.360> my<00:02:19.450> house<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.019> so

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
watch it anywhere in my house and so

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.650 
watch it anywhere in my house and so
let's<00:02:20.380> take<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.590> look<00:02:20.739> at<00:02:20.800> how<00:02:20.950> this<00:02:21.069> looks<00:02:21.660> so

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
let's take a look at how this looks so

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.030 
let's take a look at how this looks so
on<00:02:22.810> my<00:02:22.930> computer<00:02:23.319> if<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.440> want<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.709> watch<00:02:23.800> now

for example the local ABC affiliate i
use<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.700> itv<00:02:28.120> software<00:02:28.630> as<00:02:28.810> previously

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
use the itv software as previously

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.949

now<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.530> receives<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.160> there<00:02:34.349> that<00:02:35.349> looks

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
now it receives it and there that looks

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.140 
now it receives it and there that looks
very<00:02:35.620> delicious<00:02:36.069> and<00:02:36.489> it<00:02:36.549> looks<00:02:36.730> also<00:02:36.940> like<00:02:37.120> a

very delicious and it looks also like a
great<00:02:37.420> signal<00:02:37.690> because<00:02:38.080> it's<00:02:38.260> HD<00:02:40.530> picture

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
great signal because it's HD picture

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.220 
great signal because it's HD picture
let's<00:02:42.250> watch<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:42.610> in<00:02:42.670> full<00:02:42.730> screen<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.450> get

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
let's watch it in full screen and get

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.470 
let's watch it in full screen and get
really<00:02:44.620> really<00:02:44.769> angry<00:02:44.890> here<00:02:45.489> but<00:02:46.209> this<00:02:46.330> is

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
really really angry here but this is

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.180 
really really angry here but this is
centrally<00:02:47.049> how<00:02:47.170> it<00:02:47.290> works<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:47.709> stream<00:02:48.040> it

centrally how it works you stream it

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.890 
centrally how it works you stream it
through<00:02:48.459> your<00:02:48.610> home<00:02:48.760> network<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:49.540> watch<00:02:49.750> it

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
through your home network you watch it

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.360 
through your home network you watch it
on<00:02:50.080> your<00:02:50.230> computer<00:02:50.319> and<00:02:50.650> then<00:02:50.890> you<00:02:51.040> can<00:02:51.220> use

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
on your computer and then you can use

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.990 
on your computer and then you can use
everything<00:02:52.239> that<00:02:52.630> a<00:02:53.099> itv<00:02:54.099> would<00:02:54.250> offer<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.549> if

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
everything that a itv would offer you if

everything that a itv would offer you if
you<00:02:55.090> had<00:02:55.209> a<00:02:55.239> local<00:02:55.599> solution<00:02:55.989> can<00:02:56.170> also<00:02:56.319> use

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
you had a local solution can also use

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.699 
you had a local solution can also use
over<00:02:56.799> the<00:02:56.890> networks<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:57.400> can<00:02:57.459> pause<00:02:58.299> the

solution<00:05:27.840> to<00:05:27.900> take<00:05:28.080> this<00:05:28.229> over-the-air<00:05:28.800> TV

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
solution to take this over-the-air TV

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.310 
solution to take this over-the-air TV
everywhere<00:05:30.060> in<00:05:30.330> your<00:05:30.539> house<00:05:30.720> in<00:05:31.020> your<00:05:31.050> home

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
network and then of course if you all

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.000 
network and then of course if you all
don't<00:05:33.810> want<00:05:34.020> to<00:05:34.080> be<00:05:34.169> within<00:05:34.320> a<00:05:34.470> 10<00:05:34.680> all<00:05:34.860> the

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
don't want to be within a 10 all the

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.830 
don't want to be within a 10 all the
time<00:05:35.190> maybe<00:05:35.370> you<00:05:35.490> want<00:05:35.669> to<00:05:35.760> watch<00:05:35.880> TV<00:05:36.180> life<00:05:36.600> to

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
time maybe you want to watch TV life to

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.870 
time maybe you want to watch TV life to
be<00:05:36.990> on<00:05:37.289> your<00:05:37.410> computer<00:05:37.860> curling<00:05:38.340> up<00:05:38.430> in<00:05:38.580> bed<00:05:38.610> at

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
be on your computer curling up in bed at

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.279 
be on your computer curling up in bed at
night<00:05:38.940> you<00:05:39.600> don't<00:05:39.780> want<00:05:39.900> to<00:05:39.960> connect<00:05:40.200> an

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
night you don't want to connect an

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.560 
night you don't want to connect an
antenna<00:05:40.680> to<00:05:40.890> that<00:05:41.039> thing<00:05:41.280> I<00:05:41.490> think<00:05:42.300> that's<00:05:42.450> a

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
antenna to that thing I think that's a

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.909 
antenna to that thing I think that's a
great<00:05:42.600> solution<00:05:42.960> for<00:05:43.140> that<00:05:43.289> as<00:05:43.470> well<00:05:43.500> it<00:05:43.740> gives

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
great solution for that as well it gives

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.710 
great solution for that as well it gives
you<00:05:44.130> just<00:05:44.250> a<00:05:44.400> lot<00:05:44.610> more<00:05:44.640> freedom<00:05:45.120> cable

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
you just a lot more freedom cable

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.450 
you just a lot more freedom cable
freedom<00:05:46.140> and<00:05:46.350> that's<00:05:46.710> what<00:05:46.919> really<00:05:47.100> this<00:05:47.310> is

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
freedom and that's what really this is

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.840 
freedom and that's what really this is
all<00:05:47.580> about<00:05:47.700> right<00:05:48.090> and<00:05:48.560> hence<00:05:49.560> said<00:05:49.860> that<00:05:50.160> we

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
all about right and hence said that we

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.400 
all about right and hence said that we
would<00:05:50.970> like<00:05:51.150> to<00:05:51.270> hear<00:05:51.390> from<00:05:51.450> you<00:05:51.810> how<00:05:52.050> you<00:05:52.110> deal
