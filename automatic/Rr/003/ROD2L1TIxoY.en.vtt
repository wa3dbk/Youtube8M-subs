00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:05.110
 who were neighbors of the neighborhood of the city of Medellin 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.980
 reservation system for now 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.739
 that's the sevilla 

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:09.769
 this regime 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.859
 the modification of the aesthetic body composition 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:14.109
 on this occasion 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:18.669
 Well, as we mentioned last week, we are going to try makro 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:20.499
 has added the supplements 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:21.679
 that are used 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:23.169
 loss of body fat 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.319
 It really is one of the most frequent questions I receive in the post office 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:29.659
 electronic and personal consultation 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.659
 what are the most effective foods to be able to 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.360
 those blessed this operation the network 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.320
 people 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.410
 same inside everything can be used 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.880
 in this case you can remove the otegi fat with the well of the human body 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.690
 Well, it's in these nutritional moments 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.800
 in this case we have to go 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.510
 I wanted the vastness 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.130
 loss of fat that a person can achieve 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.190
 in record time dt m of the many feeding that this person since 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.190
 but nevertheless 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.609
 can you help 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.080
 or we can light a cross with the use of certain supplements 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.219
 In fact, this time we are going to apply the segment in two parts 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:14.240
 On that first occasion, let's talk about the issue of dengue 

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:18.420
 supplements that carry body fat known as the other two 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.610
 specifically we're going to talk about energy 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.360
 and good here tomorrow 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.469
 we will continue with the contain 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.150
 Castile 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.360
 and other stimulants that facilitate 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.480
 Being able to perform physical activity or promote the order 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.360
 antisocial 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.100
 today we are going to start with 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.460
 know why the mobilization 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.440
 the marks the initial formation 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.090
 the secundary effects 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.610
 and three years after using 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.150
 as they say around with the hand in the background waist to trust 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.329
 a nutritional supplement follows 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.329
 they had a side effect but also on the other hand 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.040
 reality and the function of what they can earn 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.090
 and what not 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.200
 let's start by talking about them name will give type of traffics 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.510
 Bulk indicates 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.249
 fat transporters 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:14.869
 and good the principality the most used is a supplement known as in each 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:15.499
 entity 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:17.689
 or canteen were getting married to meet 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.289
 or against as such 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:21.729
 images of the buildings 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:22.979
 the carmencita 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:25.900
 we can even classic with a follow-up 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.440
 since it is formed by 2 to 0 to 0 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.349
 remember that in the previous week 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.239
 we talk about proteins and that amino acids 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.539
 they were the structural blocks that will form the proteins 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:38.439
 good in particular in this case 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.829
 the amount that must be achieved 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.740
 it is part of the amino acids that we buy 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.399
 in any genre 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.189
 of animal origin containing proteins such as 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.339
 the podium closed 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:51.939
 these amino acids 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:56.019
 a group of amino acids stuck together in a parsley 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.199
 it is an interim designation 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:00.250
 in this case then good 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.479
 someone can say yes I will 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:05.419
 If we already have a diet rich in proteins 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:09.079
 which contain these amino acids by our body forms the amount 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.259
 but nevertheless 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:14.699
 in recent investigations as can be demonstrated for 20 years ago 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:15.739
 you can find 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.589
 in sports nutrition scientific journals 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:21.469
 or exercise physiology 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:25.420
 It's people who were using the Chinese Internet as 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.949
 nutritional supplement 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:28.059
 in this case 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:30.459
 the reality is that my personal experience 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.119
 it can be a city 

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:36.590
 an extra for your comprehensive fat loss plan that should include 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.319
 a diet with five types of food 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.609
 dietary fiber 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.320
 the count 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.619
 same amount enough 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:47.200
 their essential fats 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.259
 It is logical 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:51.249
 consumed city detected the best schedules 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:55.729
 perform cardiovascular exercise but there is not all this junk support 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:56.659
 it had to be 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:59.089
 done enough intensity 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:02.480
 and a series of other variables has some form 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.949
 are necessary for me to examine it if it can not work 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:09.269
 any type of illegality without using some 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.919
 the new generation 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.549
 but the one that will help us 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.219
 but good in this case the allowed 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:19.659
 are grouped shown that in a way we can see it as the transporter 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:22.049
 statement so that it can be burned 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.210
 that really real terms is to say 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.740
 rusty ebenezer 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.360
 we started doing cardiovascular exercise weight training 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:34.239
 our body require xiaobo we call it energetic strokes 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:40.259
 free fatty acids what good that what interests us the most 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.029
 or in this case you could use tires 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:47.379
 and has become voiceless and what really is 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:50.520
 the main source of energy in his team game went up 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.050
 we do a type of physical activity 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.040
 and towards the south of the city 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.229
 the ichea run jumping the rope 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.439
 It is a simple task 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:03.439
 a really intense workout with weights 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.990
 the citizens of the regions in this case 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.159
 what we know as burning fat 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:11.210
 but in this case Argentina 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.699
 can help us in some way in which Adriana Sanchez
