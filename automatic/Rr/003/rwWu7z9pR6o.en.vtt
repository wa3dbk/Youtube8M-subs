00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:13.060
 introduce the class was supposed to 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.610
 multimedia notebook or already 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:19.480
 a bit 16 courses 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:23.230
 but what was that with us? 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:27.090
 have a piece of work with various man vom 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.609
 fold de support employees still krems 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.770
 and then here's a little one 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.350
 setup instructions speak like you get the device 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.329
 The first time they start up they take about 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.269
 in addition to a under 7 explanation with in it 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.829
 the touch gestures still explains the guests 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.179
 you have to say yes to the touchpad 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.850
 my touch display but unfortunately not 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:47.789
 In it he still decides the device 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.109
 how to use the battery, etc 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:57.999
 that knows from the beginning and 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:01:00.449
 of course not 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:03.579
 played cable 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:09.330
 I think about my standard 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.330
 Power supply from HP we have 90 watts 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.759
 components and of course the power cord 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:20.250
 is tangling with it discusses 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:24.040
 your three colleagues cable quite simply 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:28.240
 to the local itself like with her now 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.549
 built the circle 7 36 32 so already 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.070
 big quad core processor from the 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.610
 third generation we have a 15 6 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.630
 inch hd display pronounces 1366 x 768 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.789
 pixel 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.429
 we have a 500 gigabyte hard disk 1 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:46.630
 gb RAM and last but not least 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:49.149
 a radeon hd 76 70 as a graphics card 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.690
 bit of graphics power is enough 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.850
 Of course, others still speak out 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.979
 to the connections we have here once 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.990
 on the left side the vgh at the end 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.830
 still the air outlet for the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.069
 cooling system 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.000
 we have the hdmi-port 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:07.180
 Network connection available 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.979
 twice usb 3.0 is here one more 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.370
 separate ports via headphones and 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.500
 Microphone output and input are however 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.870
 separated from each other 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.569
 we have here once 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.480
 sd card slot for sd cards micro sd 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:25.769
 cards and so on at the basic 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.120
 nothing else and then on the 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.519
 right side have even a 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.470
 kensington lock here the connection for 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:36.120
 the power adapter and two more usb-2 0-port 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.560
 her belly on the side the status leds 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.500
 speaks the device is turned on 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.140
 working disk degree of the two 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.659
 dismissed with her side attached and 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.989
 Of course, the dvd drive here you can 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:50.400
 just watch a movie of the 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.060
 back also have nothing further here 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.620
 down only once the big battery and 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.720
 Eventually, however, do not get involved 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.370
 Cooling system I am looking for loudspeakers right 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.900
 lures the choice with a keyboard one 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.690
 keyboard and touchpad and so on 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.849
 We will have a full size here 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.810
 keyword speak including the 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:15.810
 number block from league one block with 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:24.120
 inside quite normal keyboard and 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:26.519
 We do not need to have one 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.919
 relatively large touchpad but with 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.269
 visually not big is it is 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.319
 but so roughened a bit 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.769
 Feels like being here with your finger 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.520
 it immediately go where him the touchpad 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.110
 is 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:46.430
 already a few gestures here you can 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.430
 also wonderful with control the whole 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.140
 orlando sample click 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:01.580
 or not yes that had the model 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.580
 Now just when you 're up here 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.340
 I do not know exactly why I have one 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.160
 small recess and touchpad is it 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.370
 does not really make sense of somehow 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.700
 more 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.650
 In any case, even remote keys 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.110
 individual keys ultimately and 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.880
 not somehow integrated or have so 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.860
 we also often that the keys just 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.970
 Institutes themselves are integrated here 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.970
 do not stop in that case 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.060
 the sn keys are obviously here 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.139
 reversed so speaks the 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.349
 usually we have the number 1 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.930
 function keys f1 to f12 reached the 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:39.849
 They only about the fasting combination 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.860
 instead of moderate, the special function is the 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.389
 Display advertising clear the 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.759
 multimedia functions are quieter here 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:50.560
 and all that is the standard prove 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:51.580
 is financial knowledge but directs my 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.220
 Approach was great 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.970
 the ds will at least be the keys 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.800
 regular use the keyboard is yes 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.720
 but this is alright so you notice that 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.580
 pressure point sounds a bit 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.970
 rickety 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:09.509
 now it pushes has just always so 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:13.180
 a bit of plastic plastic 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:14.710
 you realize that you are here now 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.070
 no expensive knowledge device in front of him 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.060
 next to it is already multimedia models 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.349
 has to speakers of michael 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.800
 they are complete up here 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:22.750
 installed 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.210
 as he also gave me a dolby advanced 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.770
 audio and of course altec lansing 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.810
 Of course, you also have to speak with speakers 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.750
 to mention because we just something 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.810
 better hear even higher quality 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.199
 have speakers and potential in the 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.199
 power power 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.400
 we still have the webcam with about 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.840
 the display next to the night the microphone 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.190
 So that everything is already governing 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.479
 could start directly with skype 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.590
 example, that already here in front 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:57.979
 Lastly, about the FC Chelsea custom 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.150
 to guess at windows 8 a touchscreen 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.889
 have not behaved in the behavior now 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.360
 it is not consumed so that means 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.520
 Everything is only about the common 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.930
 I now find mouse gestures in person 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.460
 but not so bad because the touchpad 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.440
 So also multitouch is capable 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.819
 say scroll left to right goes completely 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.509
 normal with two fingers on 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:18.389
 touchpad just otherwise , here too 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:19.139
 normal gestures that you do not give us 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:23.210
 reachable 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.210
 that you stop here and just 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:28.889
 forget the apps or resp 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:30.180
 the programs can hold so what 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:32.940
 you just use everything about that 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.199
 experience gesture on the touchpad so that's it 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:38.060
 Windows 8 not so bad as many 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:38.060
 always think the same 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:48.160
 that one has just then the whole 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:50.500
 so can use to our company 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.320
 gibson I can not say anymore 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.540
 I also hear a very favorable 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:59.940
 device for the equipment quite cheap 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.940
 However, it does not say that at all 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.860
 but this promotion absolutely makes 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.510
 nothing because as I said in itself everything 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.300
 rather , we were shown to the device 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:12.850
 does not really stop to say 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.990
 quite favorable directed price that 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.850
 Definitely worth a mention 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.730
 ultimately here with the technical 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:22.540
 data so ksn with strong ati 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:25.150
 Graphics reasonably the graphic one can 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.190
 will already start something and think 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:31.590
 also enjoy it for a long time 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.590
 Good then until next time
