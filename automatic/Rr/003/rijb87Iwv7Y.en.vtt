records for the the use of sequins and a
portrait<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.229> don't<00:02:10.530> think<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.070> that's

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
portrait and I don't think that that's

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.740 
portrait and I don't think that that's
been<00:02:11.430> done<00:02:11.490> like<00:02:11.880> this<00:02:12.120> before

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.880 
so I'm pretty confident that he will get
recognized<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:18.090> awarded<00:02:18.210> for<00:02:18.840> his<00:02:18.990> work<00:02:19.200> it's

recognized and awarded for his work it's

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.300 
recognized and awarded for his work it's
very<00:02:20.130> very<00:02:20.430> strong<00:02:20.820> I<00:02:21.120> did<00:02:22.020> talk<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.980> honey

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
very very strong I did talk to honey

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.180 
very very strong I did talk to honey
about<00:02:23.490> certain<00:02:24.120> areas<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.920> might<00:02:25.920> have<00:02:26.160> a

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
about certain areas that might have a

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.380 
about certain areas that might have a
little<00:02:26.400> bit<00:02:26.550> of<00:02:26.790> open<00:02:28.100> open<00:02:29.100> area<00:02:29.760> between<00:02:29.970> the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
little bit of open open area between the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.750 
little bit of open open area between the
sequins<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.230> then<00:02:31.950> he<00:02:32.100> explained<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.610> me<00:02:32.730> that

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
sequins and then he explained to me that

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.850 
sequins and then he explained to me that
they're<00:02:33.060> glued<00:02:33.360> down<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:34.020> thought<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.710> they

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
they're glued down I thought that they

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.400 
they're glued down I thought that they
were<00:02:34.920> put<00:02:35.730> with<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.970> push<00:02:36.240> pin<00:02:36.510> but<00:02:37.260> they're

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
were put with a push pin but they're

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.200 
were put with a push pin but they're
glued<00:02:37.710> and<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.220> would<00:02:38.310> be<00:02:38.430> very<00:02:38.580> difficult<00:02:38.850> to

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
glued and it would be very difficult to

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.750 
glued and it would be very difficult to
start<00:02:39.600> pulling<00:02:39.990> those<00:02:40.140> off<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.220> think<00:02:41.400> when

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
start pulling those off so I think when

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.030 
start pulling those off so I think when
you<00:02:41.790> did<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:42.300> going<00:02:42.660> from<00:02:42.810> top<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.170> bottom<00:02:43.410> he

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
you did this going from top to bottom he

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.090 
you did this going from top to bottom he
learned<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.700> lot<00:02:44.940> as<00:02:45.630> he<00:02:45.690> progressed<00:02:46.320> down<00:02:46.590> and

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
learned a lot as he progressed down and

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.970 
learned a lot as he progressed down and
he<00:02:47.700> used<00:02:48.000> kind<00:02:48.360> of<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.510> grid-like<00:02:48.810> structure<00:02:49.650> to

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
he used kind of a grid-like structure to

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.550 
he used kind of a grid-like structure to
progressiveness
