00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.930
 trick first of all 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.790
 the challenge consisted of 250 deaths with 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.770
 a precision weapon of your achieved that 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.740

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.470
 go ok of your achieve or not of the map ok 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.720
 good you have to do 250 deaths where 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.970
 they are going to take it out because you get into infinity 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.800
 player swat etcetera not where you want 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.900
 but you have to do 250 deaths 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.160
 no no no no headshot i do not remember is 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.569
 that the line did not even remember 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.790
 Distortion pending even 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.319
 I knew that I had won this but good 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.970
 they are deaths then you can get into 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.470
 anyone decal any list of 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:28.080
 game no longer and take them out then you there 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.120
 many who thought that posting 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.280
 to take out is to mess with friends to 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.739
 the games and there they took out not like that 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.870
 can gentlemen do not do that then what 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.120
 advice I can give you before entering 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.800
 obviously if it tells you the two hundred 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.570
 deaths with a secondary weapon 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.570
 suppose that the next challenge is 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.730
 Monday day base from Sunday to Monday between 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.620
 the early morning then what should 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.200
 to do is play with the bag that is a 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.030
 secondary weapon then start practicing 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.870
 the new death with pure pistolita 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.909
 start practicing 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.750
 practice so that when the 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:02.730
 challenge the challenge they put at 12 no 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.980
 is that they killed themselves like on the 1st of 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.400
 the morning hours from us from 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.890
 mexico more or less then what 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.360
 what they should do is not the challenges 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.739
 they start running there, it's going to look like 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.569
 time for the challenge to end 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.829
 remaining the weekly challenge that there is 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.209
 is going to say when time is left so that 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.040
 start once the counter reaches 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.480
 zero because that already means that 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.370
 they are counting all the kills you do 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.930
 no and here I had the frenzy 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.579
 killer but good that's not what 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.280
 important in the study only that more 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.500
 it's not like they stressed but good 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.940
 gentlemen then that once you have 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.190
 to be aware of when the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.260
 challenge is going to start ok when you see 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.060
 a minute because you lack so 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.500
 you go to the game so that when you're 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.700
 playing you starts to tell you not 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.609
 wait for zero to start 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.650
 search for good ok starts at 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.959
 warm gentlemen as I say one or two 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.480
 days before get warm up in what you 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.159
 ask for the challenge if it asks for 100 deaths 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.690
 using invisibility one or two days 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.849
 before it can be invisibility for 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.519
 get used to it and make it much more 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.260
 easy ok what I want is that I do not know 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.379
 stop I do not know 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.329
 sound gentlemen do not be impressed 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.879
 As I said at the beginning I did not come to 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:13.470
 show off to them nothing I came to bring you the 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:14.849
 advice ok now because it is to happen 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.340
 gentlemen there are many people who call me 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.900
 Geeks and gives me social and so on 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.860
 incidence and the 200 who take it out 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.580
 like at 12 o'clock at night I more or less 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.919
 I get sacked like 20 20 kills per game 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.800
 then as in 67 games more or less 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.350
 not that it will be like in 10 games 15 20 15 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.169
 departures more or less what you get that would be 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.970
 like 15 games is equal to ten 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.340
 minutes let's suppose each game as 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.720
 these 50 minutes divided I would leave you 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.490
 like in three hours or so ok 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.410
 more or less like you would in three hours 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.750
 you get practically twelve o'clock at night 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.480
 at three in the morning, you already got it 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.040
 then many are doing but is that 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.510
 I have to go to school at one 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.130
 Well first of all we are already 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.600
 vacation at least the majority I already 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.490
 I'm on vacation and I went out the year 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.630
 spent on vacation or that then already 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.820
 many of you will already be 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.650
 vacation then do not look for pretexts 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.420
 that school and I do not know what and if 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.580
 you have school then to sacrifices 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.290
 papyrhin to sacrifices I had say 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.300
 that he was not sleeping against him because he had to 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.330
 go to school early and add better 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.520
 I do not sleep, not then is that not then 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.530
 in orientation a geek or anything like that 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.900
 to get you out to earn you something in 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.250
 what is the infiniti challenge and 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.930
 well I 'm not running for the 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.070
 truck nor am I running for anything 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.010
 because I do not have time to play 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.500
 I honestly do not have the time I do not have 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.600
 the time ok then if I had the 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.210
 maybe he was among the 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.470
 first not in patota to get out the one 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.090
 playing all day for those who do not 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.550
 I have the time and I do not like to play 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.889
 many many hours per day I do not 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.190
 my streaks hurt and so on 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.260
 and good gentlemen 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.030
 those are the tips that I was going to 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.100
 take out before staying in the challenge 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.570
 get warm up the moment you see that 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.980
 already going to start the challenge go to the 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.510
 split when you'll see 30 missing 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.700
 seconds go to a game so that 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.680
 start counting within the game 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.750

 truck instead of putting us gentlemen of 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.180
