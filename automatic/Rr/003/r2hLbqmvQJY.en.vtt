00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
 chapter 8 

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:07.970
 and Jesus went to the Mount of Olives and 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.219
 in the morning he returned to the temple and all the 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.160
 town came to him and sitting he them 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.020
 taught then the scribes and 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.750
 Pharisees brought him a woman 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.779
 caught in adultery and putting her in 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.640
 mean she was told teacher this woman has 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.550
 been surprised in the very act of 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.310
 adultery and in the law he sent us moses 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.669
 stone such women you, well, what 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.430
 you say more this they said tempting him to 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.440
 be able to accuse him but Jesus inclined 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.440
 towards the ground he wrote on the ground with 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.570
 finger and how they insisted on asking 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.000
 he straightened up and told them the one 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.760
 you are without sin be the first 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.560
 in throwing the stone against it and 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.470
 leaning back towards the ground 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.040
 He kept writing on the ground but they 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.110
 hearing this accused by his conscience 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.930
 they went out one by one starting from the 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.940
 older until the last ones and it remained 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.640
 only jesus and the woman who was in 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.200
 medium 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.170
 straightening Jesus and not seeing anyone 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.360
 but the woman said woman where 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.950
 there are those who accused you none 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:19.790
 she condemned she said no sir then 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.300
 jesus told him nor I condemn you go and no 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.330
 kids more 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.150
 again Jesus spoke to them saying I am 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.310
 the light of the world whoever follows me will not 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.250
 will walk in darkness but will have the 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.770
 light of life then the Pharisees will 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.490
 they said you give testimony about you 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.680
 same your testimony is not true 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.930
 Jesus answered and told them although I give 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.300
 testimony about myself my 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.700
 testimony is true because I know of 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.800
 Where have I come from and where do I go but 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.630
 you do not know where I come from or 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.910
 where do i go 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.300
 you judge according to the flesh I do not 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.270
 I judge nobody and if I judge my judgment is 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.120
 true because I am not alone but I 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.010
 and the one that the father sent me and in you 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.980
 law is written that the testimony of 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.290
 two men is true I am the one 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:14.140
 I bear witness of myself and the father 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.500
 who sent me testify of me they 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.920
 They told him where is your father answered 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.710
 jesus neither you know me nor my father 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.330
 If I knew my father too 6 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.670
 you will know 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.700
 these words Jesus spoke in the place 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.800
 of the offerings teaching in the temple and 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.370
 nobody caught him because there was still no 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.760
 your time has arrived 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.769
 again Jesus said to them I'm going and I 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.920
 I will seek jce but in our sin 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.940
 you will die where I am going, you will not 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.980
 you can come then said the Jews 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.610
 perhaps he will kill himself that says to 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.159
 where I go you can not come and 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.500
 he told you you are from below 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.590
 I am from above you are from this 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.230
 I'm not from this world, that's why I 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.239
 I said that you will die in your sins 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.480
 because if you do not believe that I am in 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:13.260
 your sins will die then you 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.420
 You said who you are then Jesus them 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.090
 He said what from the beginning I have 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.549
 said many things I have to say and 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.519
 judge of you but the one who sent me 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.609
 is true and I what I heard from him 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.549
 this spoke to the world but they did not understand 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:32.159
 who told them about the father told them 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.500
 Jesus when you have raised the son 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:37.530
 of man then you will know that I 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.720
 I am and that I do nothing by myself but 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.490
 that according to what the father taught me, I speak 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.160
 because the one who sent me with me 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:48.040
 The father has not left me alone because I 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.610
 I always do what he likes talking 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.920
 of these things many believed in him 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.810
 Jesus then said to the Jews that 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.180
 they had believed in him if you 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.610
 remain in my word 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.070
 you will be truly my disciples and 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.670
 you will know the truth and the truth will make you 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:09.040
 free answered Abraham's lineage 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.970
 we are and have never been slaves of 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.730
 nobody as you say you will be free Jesus 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.799
 he answered them from certain true 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.250
 I say that everyone who does sin 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.890
 slave is of sin and the slave is not 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.890
 remain in the house forever the child if 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.060
 it stays forever so if the children 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.120
 freedom 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.310
 you will be truly free I know you are 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.530
 descendants of abraham but seek 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.140
 kill me because my word does not fit 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.840
 in you I speak what I have seen 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.450
 close to the father and you do what 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.250
 you have heard near your father 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.400
 they answered and they told our father 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.650
 it's abraham jesus told them if you were 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.350
 sons of abraham the works of abraham 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.930
 you would do but now try to kill me 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.570
 man that I have spoken the truth to you 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.210
 which I heard from God did not do this 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.670
 abraham you do the works of 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.160
 your father then told him 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:11.180
 we are not born of fornication 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.670
 a father we have that is god jesus 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.450
 then he told them if your father was 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.730
 God 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.070
 I would certainly love Jce because I from 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.820
 God, I came out and I came because I have not 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.710
 come from myself but he sent me 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.650
 because you do not understand my language because 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.810
 you can not hear my word you 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.570
 you are from your father the devil and the 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.850
 wishes of your father you want to do the 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.890
 homicidal acid from the beginning and not 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.710
 has remained in the truth because no 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.990
 there is truth in him when he speaks lies of 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.540
 he speaks because he is a liar and father 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.450
 lying and me because I tell the truth 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.139
 you do not believe me who of you I network 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.300
 argue of sin 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.719
 Well, if I tell the truth because you 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:57.449
 I do not believe that God is 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:06:00.650
 words of God hey for this you are not 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:02.939
 you because you are not god 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.939
 the Jews responded then and 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:08.270
 they said we do not say well that you 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:11.310
 You are a Samaritan and you have a demon 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.979
 Jesus replied I do not have a demon 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.740
 before, honor my father and you 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:20.099
 dishonor jce but I'm not looking for my glory 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.779
 there are those who seek it and judge for certain 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:25.349
 true I tell you that he who keeps my 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:27.810
 word never of death then the 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:30.330
 Jews told him now we know that 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.580
 you have demon abraham died and the 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.340
 prophets and you say the one who keeps my 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.379
 word will never suffer death are you 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.589
 perhaps greater than our father abraham the 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:44.069
 which died and the prophets died who 

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:46.349
 you make yourself answered Jesus yes 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:49.199
 I glorified myself my glory 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:51.330
 nothing is my father is the one who glorifies me 

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:54.659
 what you say is your 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.770
 god but you do not know him anymore 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:57.539
 I know him 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.300
 if I said I do not know him, it would be 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:02.689
 Liar like you but I know him 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.939
 and I keep your word 

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:08.139
 abrahán your father enjoyed that 

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:11.389
 I had to see my day and saw it and enjoyed it 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:14.229
 then the Jews told him not yet 

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:17.779
 You are 50 years old and you have seen abraham 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:21.189
 Jesus told certain verily 

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:23.959
 I say before abraham was I am 

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:26.509
 Then they took stones to throw themselves 

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:28.909
 but Jesus hid and left the 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:32.079
 temple and going through in the middle of 

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:32.079
 they left
