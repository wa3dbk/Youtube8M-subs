on to this rail um most people don't go
down<00:01:49.920> here<00:01:50.130> you'll<00:01:50.310> probably<00:01:50.520> only<00:01:50.670> go<00:01:50.880> down

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
down here you'll probably only go down

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.179 
down here you'll probably only go down
here<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.479> go<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:52.170> over<00:01:52.470> here<00:01:52.710> something<00:01:53.100> I

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
here to go like over here something I

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.359 
here to go like over here something I
get<00:01:53.369> apart<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.930> guess<00:01:54.930> right<00:01:55.140> years<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.710> anyway

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
get apart I guess right years on anyway

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.940 
get apart I guess right years on anyway

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
into the glitch is actually really

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.559 
into the glitch is actually really
effective<00:03:26.889> only<00:03:27.430> downside<00:03:27.970> is<00:03:28.000> there's<00:03:28.389> no
