00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.000

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.000
 today 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:14.190
 today franco felipe brings us a version 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.430
 from satan a fast and strong cocktail 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.970
 let's go with the ingredients an ounce of 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.570
 whiskey an ounce of branding an ounce of 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.810
 vodka an ounce of gin an ounce of cream 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.340
 of cocoa an ounce of grenadine and cinnamon 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.719
 then let's take the checker 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.719
 add vodka let's add gin 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.760
 all equal parts 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.590
 and we are going to add white rum 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.630
 what I am doing here that is the 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.930
 mixture of all strong liquors in 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.329
 what is called to be true a great 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.059
 to be is a mixture of living alcohols that 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.820
 you really have so many alcohols 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.590
 you do not really understand the tasting or the taste 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.720
 that you are that these people that you are 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.750
 having then really do not matter 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.040
 here was if it matters clear or healthy it does not 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.430
 I want you to understand me the anti 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.380
 technicality does not mean if it matters but in 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.000
 reality is not determinant 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.979
 can make a satan without having the 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.140
 vodka yes if you can not do it since 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.810
 have a brand be powerful if I do 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.250
 understand was going to generate the same aroma and 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.960
 the same Saturday but they can make one 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.479
 they can make a satan in cream 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.750
 cocoa can not do it and without grenadine 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.460
 - because it would not give them the aroma and 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.240
 the taste that we are looking for me 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.240
 they understand up there 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.670
 well here I will inflict heat 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.470
 directly to the shaker already in this 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.620
 moment is ready 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.340
 that was at a certain moment we're going to 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.340
 take the glass 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.870
 let's take the cocoa cream 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.530
 when it is already hot, add 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.530
 the grenadine 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.930
 now because it's called satan 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.360
 you will wonder why I am 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.190
 dripping and why is it watering 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.319
 but because its aromatize the cup and the 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.970
 heated outside is very important 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.450
 whenever the cup moves a little 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.450
 outside 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.780
 i 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.780
