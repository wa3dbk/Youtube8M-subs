00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.890
 tutorial on their infinite producers to 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.110
 villagers so this is a tutorial that I 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.860
 follow up on the request in my last 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.870
 video of let's play so bah listen I 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.760
 I'll answer any comments I 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.500
 I 'm sorry I just made your nickname 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.449
 so it's very simple I 'm just going 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.779
 you do the translation of the tutorial 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.859
 in English so for their producers to 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.130
 final he played you need three 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.580
 things 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.759
 you need three block villagers 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.440
 and therefore wears doors a few doors 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.469
 So therefore we will start out 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.739
 a platform of four by four we 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.760
 will then put barriers around 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.710
 so as those ci opts so nothing 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.590
 simpler so that's the prison for 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:55.800
 the villagers so very simple 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.640
 So here we are then we will put 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.500
 two villagers 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.820
 so after to put the villages where 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.609
 just use card fads 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.910
 So you make you put the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.680
 tracks 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.150
 in fact you will put the masne card 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.229
 and you will move the same map and the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.310
 villager will fall in 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.080
 finally he'll be caught in the same 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.000
 neighborhood after you take it here 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.619
 you pity leumann map the little path 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.939
 to come out and then you go out before 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.400
 that he has time to stop himself so 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.990
 it's relatively simple the best by 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.900
 against it is to fart the corners so 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.350
 it is later to be able to 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.420
 go out 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.340
 so once you've done that you 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:32.729
 go 1 2 3 4 4 blocks above so 1 2 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.630
 3 4 and so here we will make a new 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.320
 threshold of 4 by 4 therefore recalls two 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:43.020
 three men and two executives on this floor 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.240
 we will put doors so me 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.470
 just for the orange decor 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.960
 I loved it like that but we can not 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.000
 put exactly as you want it 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.290
 just put doors on 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.840
 each of the blocks so hop like that no 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:05.759
 but like that so here I have my sixteen 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.799
 then wears then I go on his 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.229
 doors put blocks so like 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:15.030
 above are we there by cons 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:21.450
 can hire fully so we close 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:24.150
 the little prison hop like that so that's it 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.709
 we have all clogged and here we go 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.019
 simply put a villager 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.220
 take simpler then a little 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.739
 thing I did not do that I would have 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.739
 had to do is put sites too 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.180
 but that's already co lantern or could 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.680
 put as a roof so we want in 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.610
 to put 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:47.250
 shit you have to squeeze qd they have to 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.160
 unlock up so why put some 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.609
 jack o'lantern because we need 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.900
 so here I put the doors 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.880
 so here I have my doors everywhere I have 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.950
 missed the toothache and there I have two 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.359
 villagers who are below so here 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.970
 we're going back to the jack o lantern 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.480
 to prevent mobs from coming 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.810
 attack the villager who is at the top 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.600
 up is here so below you have your 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.829
 villager is actually that of joy 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.000
 lille will make noise in the doors 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:20.280
 and in fact it goes when there are doors 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.260
 you multiply the number of doors with 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.850
 a block at the top so buy it block at 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.620
 above by 0.35 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.290
 it gives you the name of that town 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.519
 you'll have total but by doing that 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.170
 so by putting all the doors 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.269
 four blocks above with judgment of the 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.889
 to play in the villagers below 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.099
 you will reproduce infinitely 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:41.390
 So there I think the particles are 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.849
 so here I have all the particles 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.159
 so in fact we should see soon 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.379
 animations the villager here does not have 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.819
 seem to want to actually open the 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.920
 doors but in fact it will open the 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.459
 doors like that and so the villagers 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.280
 will simply duplicate themselves with 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.780
 sees himself there he started so the 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.139
 villagers will start to see the 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:07.040
 little hearts to duplicate themselves then just 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:10.540
 for him to survive 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.239
 hop we keep when that's hop 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.720
 so we'll put this here salah is so 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:20.180
 by reproducing this model there you stay 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.829
 you stayed an hour f k you have a 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.360
 fifty or even a hundred 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.820
 villager 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.410
 so it's very simple so here is 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.000
 it was all for this little tutorial very 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.889
 simple I can stay two hours and 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.490
 quarter for you show you see who 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.990
 already begins to love himself so here is so 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.849
 you can like this little video 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.289
 commented here are the hearts that 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:41.750
 arrive they started doing some 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.180
 small so thanks for watching you 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.830
