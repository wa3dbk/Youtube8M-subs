better<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.800> best<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.269> way<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.600> like

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
better and best is the way that I like

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.170 
better and best is the way that I like
to<00:00:24.990> look<00:00:25.109> at<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.470> because<00:00:25.640> burl<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.730> great

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
to look at it because burl is great

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.839 
to look at it because burl is great
these<00:00:27.810> two<00:00:28.050> pieces<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> top<00:00:28.949> are<00:00:29.310> like<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
these two pieces on the top are like a

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.790 
these two pieces on the top are like a
cluster<00:00:30.300> log<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:31.019> clusters<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.329> burl<00:00:33.559> and<00:00:34.559> so

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
cluster log it's clusters of burl and so

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.410 
cluster log it's clusters of burl and so
obviously<00:00:35.280> where<00:00:35.550> there's<00:00:35.730> no<00:00:35.940> burl

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
barking Cluj ins like this maple right

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.999 
barking Cluj ins like this maple right
here<00:01:58.399> will<00:01:59.399> have<00:01:59.700> inclusions<00:02:00.409> maybe<00:02:01.409> not<00:02:01.740> as

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
here will have inclusions maybe not as

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.260 
here will have inclusions maybe not as
large<00:02:02.450> bar<00:02:03.450> conclusions<00:02:04.079> as<00:02:04.259> large<00:02:04.560> as<00:02:04.799> this

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
large bar conclusions as large as this

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
inclusions now this is not a science

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.369 
inclusions now this is not a science
because<00:02:34.920> nobody<00:02:35.730> can<00:02:35.940> really<00:02:36.150> look<00:02:36.599> into<00:02:37.200> the

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
because nobody can really look into the

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.500 
because nobody can really look into the
burl<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.860> tell<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.849> if<00:02:39.000> there's<00:02:39.180> going<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.420> be

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
burl and tell you if there's going to be

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
inclusions or no inclusions it's just

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.410 
inclusions or no inclusions it's just
based<00:02:43.290> on<00:02:45.680> observation<00:02:46.680> over<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.610> years<00:02:48.090> of

one if I were to cut this cap off it

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:02.720 
one if I were to cut this cap off it
should<00:02:56.730> be<00:02:57.329> a<00:02:58.190> solid<00:02:59.660> white<00:03:00.739> burl<00:03:01.739> with<00:03:02.220> no

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
brown bark inclusions or voids just

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.080 
brown bark inclusions or voids just
because<00:03:06.629> of<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.870> characteristic<00:03:07.860> of<00:03:08.090> the

this all of this burl the bark has been

this all of this burl the bark has been
pressure<00:03:18.299> washed<00:03:18.690> off<00:03:20.030> so<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.420> exposes

so<00:03:25.200> if<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.280> are<00:03:26.400> buying<00:03:26.700> burl<00:03:27.359> in<00:03:27.660> bulk<00:03:28.880> and

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
so if you are buying burl in bulk and

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.569 
so if you are buying burl in bulk and
you<00:03:32.359> are<00:03:33.359> buying<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:33.810> with<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.349> bark<00:03:34.620> on<00:03:34.859> it<00:03:35.220> is

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
you are buying it with the bark on it is

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.490 
you are buying it with the bark on it is
harder<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.150> tell<00:03:36.660> whether<00:03:37.109> you<00:03:37.319> have

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
harder to tell whether you have

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.259 
harder to tell whether you have
inclusions<00:03:38.099> or<00:03:38.220> not<00:03:38.400> but<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.239> still<00:03:39.569> can<00:03:39.900> tell

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
inclusions or not but you still can tell

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.240 
inclusions or not but you still can tell
because<00:03:42.269> of<00:03:42.690> just<00:03:43.139> the<00:03:43.200> shape<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:43.950> burles

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
because of just the shape of the burles

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.170 
because of just the shape of the burles
if<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:45.359> has<00:03:45.540> lobes<00:03:46.049> that<00:03:46.560> like<00:03:47.310> this<00:03:47.519> has<00:03:47.730> lobes

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
if it has lobes that like this has lobes

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.960 
if it has lobes that like this has lobes
on<00:03:48.599> it<00:03:48.900> if<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.620> has<00:03:49.769> lobes<00:03:50.130> you're<00:03:50.519> more<00:03:50.700> likely

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
on it if it has lobes you're more likely

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.509 
on it if it has lobes you're more likely
to<00:03:51.150> have<00:03:51.329> bark<00:03:51.690> inclusion<00:03:51.900> if<00:03:52.560> you<00:03:53.130> just<00:03:53.310> have

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
to have bark inclusion if you just have

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.830 
to have bark inclusion if you just have
this<00:03:53.700> one<00:03:54.060> real<00:03:54.540> continuous<00:03:55.440> nice<00:03:55.919> cap

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
this one real continuous nice cap

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.170 
this one real continuous nice cap
there's<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:58.319> better<00:03:58.889> chance<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.639> have<00:03:59.790> no

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
there's a better chance to have no

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.659 
there's a better chance to have no
inclusions<00:04:00.799> for<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:01.889> most<00:04:02.099> part<00:04:02.340> this<00:04:02.459> is

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
inclusions for the most part this is

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:07.819 
inclusions for the most part this is
great<00:04:03.389> a<00:04:04.459> maple<00:04:05.459> burl<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:06.450> expect<00:04:07.349> to<00:04:07.410> pay<00:04:07.650> the

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
most for this type of burl I would say

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.539 
most for this type of burl I would say
good<00:04:13.290> better<00:04:14.280> best<00:04:15.590> however<00:04:16.590> if<00:04:16.919> you<00:04:17.370> are<00:04:17.489> a
