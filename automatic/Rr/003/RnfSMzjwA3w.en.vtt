00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.470
 we do one thing 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.189
 we have traditionally been very 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:14.289
 construction practically nothing 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:16.969
 tells the source I think that 

00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:19.559
 all this is our trump but since I am very 

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:21.589
 will absolutely like the judges 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:23.879
 so ahead of time on the net it all 

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:25.339
 can not advertise 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:27.550
 and then after there three four program 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.429
 I realized that the inhabitants of Sweden were wrong 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.769
 less remains 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.760
 holy in general especially 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.240
 football is his side investors 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.240
 because there is a necessary measure 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.150
 after this region 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.220
 water 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.220
 I think that we are not alone with the wifeâ€™s team. 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.060
 figure skating and that's it 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.100
 measures aimed with the whole team zone on 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.540
 then to show more figure 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.940
 skating 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.920
 the smallest 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.080
 but 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.070
 I stay 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.380
 trolls on ice and other opportunity 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.030
 ride on rate exactly 18 i 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.410
 then when representatives 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.290
 scotland yard support programs and 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.450
 so on but but I think that all the same some 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.240
 that figure skating is exactly what 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.240
 I think 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.050
 what will be enough 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.430
 someone noticed he 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.300
 Pavel Sidorov 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.970
 you fall, the more so what to do next 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.090
 fall this year Gazprom oil 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.870
 you come 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.150
 if 300 people evaluate what you 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.150
 do everything that remains after such 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.450
 step logical conclusion that at the time thanks for 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.100
 everything 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.010
 Here are the allowances on September 1 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.880
 how good is the sixth climate 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.200
 now these marks are 5 10 and 20 years old 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.200
 last debt 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.680
 plowed arch and performance evaluation 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.899
 audiobook administrations said 1 78 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.200
 loop is our common achievement 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.980
 I think it does not deserve 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.030
 for me declared us was great 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.020
 by surprise 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.020
 d 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.600
 you would be better if you seem 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.730
 so we can 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.970
 could buy a house there try again 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.060
 completion
