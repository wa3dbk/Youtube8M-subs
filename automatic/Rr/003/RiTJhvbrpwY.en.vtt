look like spray paint there are slot I'm

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.960 
look like spray paint there are slot I'm
seeing<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.150> good<00:02:11.300> bit<00:02:11.510> of<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:12.170> eex<00:02:12.890> hoppers<00:02:13.460> with

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
seeing a good bit of a eex hoppers with

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.230 
seeing a good bit of a eex hoppers with
some<00:02:14.330> spray<00:02:14.630> paint<00:02:14.690> on<00:02:15.170> they're<00:02:15.470> all<00:02:15.590> big<00:02:15.860> and

some spray paint on they're all big and

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.900 
some spray paint on they're all big and
smaller<00:02:17.920> that's<00:02:18.920> why<00:02:19.190> let's<00:02:19.340> try<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.760> go<00:02:19.850> for

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
smaller that's why let's try and go for

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.060 
smaller that's why let's try and go for
so<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:20.360> think<00:02:20.480> I<00:02:21.070> kind<00:02:22.070> of<00:02:22.190> achieved<00:02:22.580> it

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
so I think I kind of achieved it

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.560 
so I think I kind of achieved it
