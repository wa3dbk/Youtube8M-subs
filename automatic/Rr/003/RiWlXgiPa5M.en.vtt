okay this is a short demo of an
amplifier<00:00:05.310> that<00:00:05.339> I'm<00:00:05.609> thinking<00:00:05.759> about

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
amplifier that I'm thinking about

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.830 
amplifier that I'm thinking about

modifications the modifications you can
find<00:00:30.330> them<00:00:30.480> on<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.599> Internet<00:00:31.019> they're<00:00:31.439> called

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
find them on the Internet they're called

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.459 
find them on the Internet they're called
transit<00:00:32.130> fidelity<00:00:32.700> mods<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.200> they<00:00:34.200> kind<00:00:34.410> of

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
transit fidelity mods and they kind of

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.200 
transit fidelity mods and they kind of
just<00:00:34.590> bring<00:00:34.770> out<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.040> best<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.579> this

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
just bring out the best in this

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.000 
just bring out the best in this
amplifier<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.879> it's<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.940> two<00:00:39.090> el34<00:00:40.010> amplifier

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010

about<00:00:41.640> 45<00:00:42.090> watts<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:43.050> I'm<00:00:44.040> going<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.219> start

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
about 45 watts so I'm going to start

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.060 
about 45 watts so I'm going to start
with<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.910> volume<00:00:45.629> around<00:00:45.719> -<00:00:46.110> I'm<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.890> bright

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.799 
with the volume around - I'm the bright
channel<00:00:47.430> there's<00:00:47.610> two<00:00:47.850> challenges<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.629> base

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
channel there's two challenges of a base

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.869 
channel there's two challenges of a base
channel<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> bright<00:00:49.440> channel<00:00:49.770> I'm<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
channel on a bright channel I'm in the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.209 
channel on a bright channel I'm in the
bright<00:00:51.059> channel<00:00:51.539> with<00:00:51.750> volume<00:00:52.199> into<00:00:52.500> trouble

bright channel with volume into trouble
at<00:00:53.340> about<00:00:53.550> eight<00:00:53.820> base<00:00:54.750> at<00:00:54.960> about<00:00:55.140> three

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
at about eight base at about three

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.880 
at about eight base at about three
mid-range<00:00:57.090> at<00:00:57.239> seven<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.379> presence<00:00:58.800> at

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
mid-range at seven and the presence at

mid-range at seven and the presence at
about<00:00:59.100> eight<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.670> those<00:01:00.120> which<00:01:00.449> get

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:24.770 

Oh

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.140 

okay<00:01:25.780> bring<00:01:26.260> the<00:01:26.320> volume<00:01:26.500> up<00:01:26.710> a<00:01:26.770> little<00:01:26.800> bit

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
okay bring the volume up a little bit

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.180 
okay bring the volume up a little bit
now<00:01:28.150> I<00:01:28.450> am<00:01:28.720> plugged<00:01:29.410> into<00:01:29.770> a<00:01:31.710> t12<00:01:32.710> cabinet

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
now I am plugged into a t12 cabinet

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.000 
now I am plugged into a t12 cabinet
which<00:01:33.490> is<00:01:33.850> pointed<00:01:34.810> sideways<00:01:35.110> because<00:01:35.500> if<00:01:35.890> I

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
which is pointed sideways because if I

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.470 
which is pointed sideways because if I
pointed<00:01:36.400> straight<00:01:36.610> at<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.790> camera<00:01:37.180> it<00:01:37.360> will

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
pointed straight at the camera it will

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.740 
pointed straight at the camera it will
really<00:01:38.350> distort<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:39.400> microphone<00:01:39.850> so<00:01:40.420> I'm

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
really distort the microphone so I'm

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.090 
really distort the microphone so I'm
going<00:01:40.900> to<00:01:40.930> keep<00:01:41.080> it<00:01:41.260> pointed<00:01:41.590> this<00:01:41.710> way<00:01:41.770> for

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
going to keep it pointed this way for

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.160 
going to keep it pointed this way for
now<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.890> brought<00:01:45.370> the<00:01:45.550> volume<00:01:46.150> up<00:01:46.330> to<00:01:46.690> about

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
now and I brought the volume up to about

00:01:47.170 --> 00:02:10.499 
now and I brought the volume up to about
fives<00:01:47.470> what<00:01:48.310> you<00:01:48.400> get

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.570 

okay<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.319> control<00:02:11.950> all<00:02:12.250> worked<00:02:12.489> very

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
okay the control all worked very

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.490 
okay the control all worked very
smoothly<00:02:13.120> it's<00:02:13.450> not<00:02:13.660> like<00:02:13.870> a<00:02:13.900> lot<00:02:14.410> of

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
smoothly it's not like a lot of

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.460 
smoothly it's not like a lot of

90%<00:02:18.099> of<00:02:18.129> the<00:02:18.220> volume<00:02:18.489> this<00:02:18.580> one's<00:02:18.790> pretty

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
90% of the volume this one's pretty

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.750 
90% of the volume this one's pretty
smooth<00:02:19.360> all<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.140> way<00:02:20.290> from<00:02:20.650> from<00:02:21.129> 0<00:02:21.459> all<00:02:21.640> the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
smooth all the way from from 0 all the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.520 
smooth all the way from from 0 all the
way<00:02:21.849> up<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.269> 10<00:02:22.510> I'm<00:02:22.660> gonna<00:02:22.780> bring<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.019> up<00:02:23.230> I'm

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
way up to 10 I'm gonna bring it up I'm

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.390 
way up to 10 I'm gonna bring it up I'm
up<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:23.950> about<00:02:24.099> 8<00:02:25.090> here<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.810> we'll<00:02:26.290> have<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:27.130> lot

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
up to about 8 here and we'll have a lot

00:02:27.400 --> 00:03:02.260 
up to about 8 here and we'll have a lot
more<00:02:27.430> hair<00:02:27.760> this<00:02:27.970> time

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.430 

okay<00:03:03.270> let's<00:03:03.600> take<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.200> up<00:03:04.440> all<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.160> way<00:03:05.310> and

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
okay let's take it up all the way and

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:35.040 
okay let's take it up all the way and
change<00:03:07.440> pickups

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.120 

No

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.880 

yeah

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:55.589 

ah

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.680 

anyway<00:03:56.599> great<00:03:57.260> amplifier<00:03:58.270> had<00:03:59.270> for<00:03:59.510> a<00:03:59.540> long

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
anyway great amplifier had for a long

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.120 
anyway great amplifier had for a long
time<00:04:00.280> thinking<00:04:01.280> about<00:04:01.489> getting<00:04:01.819> rid<00:04:01.940> of<00:04:01.970> it
