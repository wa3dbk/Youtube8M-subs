anyways the way to obtain the Evelyn
it's<00:00:42.350> pretty<00:00:43.350> similar<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.280> katana<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
it's pretty similar to the katana and

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.080 
it's pretty similar to the katana and
the<00:00:45.300> rapier<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:47.190> still<00:00:47.489> follow<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.850> same

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the rapier you still follow the same

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.869 
the rapier you still follow the same
route<00:00:48.300> here<00:00:48.780> uh<00:00:50.329> yeah<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:52.579> that's<00:00:53.579> pretty

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
route here uh yeah and that's pretty

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.279 
route here uh yeah and that's pretty
much<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.570> follow<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.899> same<00:00:55.079> route

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
much it you just follow the same route

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.810 
much it you just follow the same route
um<00:00:55.500> it's<00:00:56.100> not<00:00:57.090> as<00:00:57.300> far<00:00:57.690> as<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.140> katana<00:00:58.820> and
