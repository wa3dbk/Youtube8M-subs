game called minecraft is a game I just

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.140 
game called minecraft is a game I just
started<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.230> it's<00:00:07.379> super<00:00:07.980> fun<00:00:08.220> freakin<00:00:09.000> love

started and it's super fun freakin love

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.230 
started and it's super fun freakin love
it<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.800> I've<00:00:10.800> been<00:00:10.860> playing<00:00:11.309> around<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.910> little

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
it and I've been playing around a little

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.349 
it and I've been playing around a little
something<00:00:12.780> called<00:00:12.809> he's<00:00:16.970> I've<00:00:17.970> been<00:00:18.119> playing

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
something called he's I've been playing

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.660 
something called he's I've been playing
with<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.480> little<00:00:18.690> something<00:00:18.960> called<00:00:18.990> on

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
with a little something called on

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.269 
with a little something called on
redstone<00:00:21.080> this<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.230> creation<00:00:22.529> mode<00:00:22.859> and

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
redstone this is creation mode and

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.279 
redstone this is creation mode and
redstone<00:00:24.119> was<00:00:24.210> really<00:00:24.480> difficult<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.930> use<00:00:24.960> it

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
redstone was really difficult to use it

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.019 
redstone was really difficult to use it
so<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.740> basically<00:00:26.099> kind<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.580> power<00:00:26.789> source

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
so it basically kind of a power source

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.300 
so it basically kind of a power source
and<00:00:27.269> an<00:00:27.510> energy<00:00:27.960> screen<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.130> to

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
and an energy screen and you have to

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.030 
and an energy screen and you have to
connect<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:30.230> things<00:00:31.230> like<00:00:31.289> Pistons<00:00:31.710> endure

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
connect it to things like Pistons endure

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.600 
connect it to things like Pistons endure
them<00:00:32.369> really<00:00:33.270> difficult<00:00:33.600> anyway<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.320> is

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
them really difficult anyway so this is

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.130 
them really difficult anyway so this is
just<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.760> regular<00:00:35.969> kind<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.480> looking<00:00:36.719> innocent

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
just a regular kind of looking innocent

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.590 
just a regular kind of looking innocent
library<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.980> back<00:00:38.160> end<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.489> gone<00:00:38.640> but

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
library but the back end is gone but

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.709 
library but the back end is gone but
I'll<00:00:40.050> fill<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.469> ideally<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.610> an<00:00:42.329> example

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
I'll fill it ideally this is an example

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.450 
I'll fill it ideally this is an example
of<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.140> door<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.710> made<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.070> door<00:00:44.280> is

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
of the door I just made and the door is

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.709 
of the door I just made and the door is
a<00:00:44.489> secret<00:00:45.710> bookshelf<00:00:46.730> door<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:48.510> what<00:00:48.629> you

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
a secret bookshelf door like what you

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.240 
a secret bookshelf door like what you
seen<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.020> move<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> quantum<00:00:49.770> book<00:00:50.039> and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
seen it move to the quantum book and

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.760 
seen it move to the quantum book and
then<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> bookshelf<00:00:51.260> swivels<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.469> there's<00:00:52.649> a

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
then the bookshelf swivels and there's a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.189 
then the bookshelf swivels and there's a
secret<00:00:53.100> passageway<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.660> decided<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.170> really

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
secret passageway so I decided I really

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.810 
secret passageway so I decided I really
wanted<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.649> build<00:00:55.829> one<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.070> those<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.520> there's

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
wanted to build one of those and there's

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.790 
wanted to build one of those and there's
actually<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.270> few<00:00:57.480> already<00:00:57.629> online<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.500> they

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
actually a few already online but they

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.160 
actually a few already online but they
aren't<00:00:59.250> as<00:00:59.340> cool<00:00:59.640> as<00:00:59.789> mine<00:01:00.000> because<00:01:00.239> mine<00:01:00.359> uses

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
aren't as cool as mine because mine uses

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.920 
aren't as cool as mine because mine uses
way<00:01:01.559> more<00:01:01.590> Pistons<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.489> ones<00:01:03.300> online<00:01:03.480> only

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
way more Pistons the ones online only

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.070 
way more Pistons the ones online only
use<00:01:04.260> four<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.890> mine<00:01:05.070> uses<00:01:05.580> twelve<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.810> here

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
use four and mine uses twelve so here

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.600 
use four and mine uses twelve so here
I'm<00:01:07.170> gonna<00:01:07.290> do<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.860> basically<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.490> to

I'm gonna do it so basically you do to

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.410 
I'm gonna do it so basically you do to
take<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.790> redstone<00:01:09.119> torch<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:10.110> right<00:01:10.380> there

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
take a redstone torch it's right there

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.530 
take a redstone torch it's right there
and<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> door<00:01:12.720> thanks<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.060> basically<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.450> a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
and the door thanks and basically in a

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.620 
and the door thanks and basically in a
flush<00:01:15.900> bookshelf<00:01:16.590> sucked<00:01:17.100> into<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.549> walls<00:01:17.759> it

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
flush bookshelf sucked into the walls it

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.690 
flush bookshelf sucked into the walls it
makes<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.900> flush<00:01:19.170> perfect<00:01:19.680> passageway<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
makes a flush perfect passageway and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.160 
makes a flush perfect passageway and
then<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.030> close<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> passageway<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.990> just

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
then to close the passageway you just

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:31.999 
then to close the passageway you just
get<00:01:22.290> rid<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.500> torch<00:01:30.799> alright<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:31.920> that's

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
get rid of torch alright so that's

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.530 
get rid of torch alright so that's
basically<00:01:32.430> I'm<00:01:32.610> gonna<00:01:32.939> show<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.180> how<00:01:33.329> it's

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
basically I'm gonna show you how it's

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.670 
basically I'm gonna show you how it's
basically<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> timing<00:01:34.140> yet<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.530> get

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
basically the timing yet and you get

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.350 
basically the timing yet and you get
cool<00:01:34.860> passageways<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.970> back<00:01:36.150> here<00:01:36.360> so

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
cool passageways in the back here so

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.670 
cool passageways in the back here so
first<00:01:39.360> I'm<00:01:39.570> gonna<00:01:39.689> show<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:40.049> how<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.380> door

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
first I'm gonna show you how the door

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.039 
first I'm gonna show you how the door
mechanism<00:01:40.920> works<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.909> have<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.570> little<00:01:42.810> mini

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
mechanism works I have a little mini

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.670 
mechanism works I have a little mini
model<00:01:43.470> over<00:01:43.770> here<00:01:45.110> you're<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.140> gonna<00:01:46.409> focus

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
model over here you're just gonna focus

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.160 
model over here you're just gonna focus
do<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.009> want<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.220> try<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.460> create<00:01:47.790> it

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
do you want to try and create it

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.450 
do you want to try and create it
basically<00:01:49.170> what<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.799> there's<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.070> power

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
basically what it is is there's a power

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.920 
basically what it is is there's a power
source<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:52.500> stream<00:01:53.329> there's<00:01:54.329> three

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
source that the stream there's three

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.700 
source that the stream there's three
Pistons

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
Pistons

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.310 
Pistons
this<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.520> only<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:56.909> layer<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.360> one<00:01:57.570> side<00:01:57.840> so

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
this is only one layer in one side so

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.450 
this is only one layer in one side so
there's<00:01:58.560> only<00:01:58.649> three<00:01:59.420> and<00:02:00.420> then<00:02:00.600> there's

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
there's only three and then there's

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.760 
there's only three and then there's
those<00:02:02.460> thingies<00:02:02.759> which<00:02:03.630> slow<00:02:04.020> down<00:02:04.259> how

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
those thingies which slow down how

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.469 
those thingies which slow down how
quickly<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.460> goes<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.850> have<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.149> at<00:02:06.360> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
quickly it goes and I have it at the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.100 
quickly it goes and I have it at the
fourth<00:02:06.719> tape<00:02:08.060> so<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.119> basically<00:02:09.300> power

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
fourth tape so you basically power

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.980 
fourth tape so you basically power
source

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
source

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.840 
source
and<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.790> bookshelf<00:02:13.600> pulls<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.560> then<00:02:14.850> and

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
and the bookshelf pulls in and then and

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.340 
and the bookshelf pulls in and then and
then<00:02:16.620> because<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.740> are<00:02:17.920> set<00:02:18.100> back<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:19.350> second

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
then because you are set back the second

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.080 
then because you are set back the second
test<00:02:20.560> set<00:02:20.740> of<00:02:20.830> Pistons<00:02:21.010> pulls<00:02:21.580> both<00:02:21.880> the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
test set of Pistons pulls both the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.270 
test set of Pistons pulls both the
bookshelf<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.660> then<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:23.230> piston<00:02:23.560> up<00:02:23.680> pulled

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
bookshelf and then the piston up pulled

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.580 
bookshelf and then the piston up pulled
it<00:02:24.370> back<00:02:24.460> and<00:02:24.520> then<00:02:24.760> when<00:02:24.880> you<00:02:24.940> push<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.330> again

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
it back and then when you push it again

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.470 
it back and then when you push it again
it<00:02:26.590> goes<00:02:26.620> reverse<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:27.550> these<00:02:27.700> two<00:02:27.940> push<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.330> out

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
it goes reverse so these two push it out

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.840 
it goes reverse so these two push it out
and<00:02:28.780> then<00:02:29.170> this<00:02:29.680> one<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.040> powered<00:02:30.220> second<00:02:30.640> and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
and then this one is powered second and

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.890 
and then this one is powered second and
pushes<00:02:31.270> that<00:02:31.420> amount<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:33.510> that's<00:02:34.510> basically

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
pushes that amount so that's basically

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.490 
pushes that amount so that's basically
how<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.110> door<00:02:35.410> works<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:37.230> then<00:02:38.230> I<00:02:38.260> have

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
how the door works and then I have

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.430 
how the door works and then I have
basically<00:02:39.490> four<00:02:40.060> of<00:02:40.240> these<00:02:40.450> little<00:02:40.750> setups<00:02:41.110> so

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
basically four of these little setups so

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.860 
basically four of these little setups so
two<00:02:42.010> layers<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:42.340> it's<00:02:42.700> too<00:02:42.850> tall<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.360> then<00:02:43.540> one

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
two layers so it's too tall and then one

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.020 
two layers so it's too tall and then one
finder<00:02:44.440> side<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:45.130> amazing<00:02:45.690> for<00:02:46.690> space<00:02:47.350> like

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
finder side so amazing for space like

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.280 
finder side so amazing for space like
now<00:02:49.030> I'm<00:02:49.090> gonna<00:02:49.240> show<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.450> out<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.690> little<00:02:49.960> log

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
now I'm gonna show you out a little log

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.640 
now I'm gonna show you out a little log
the<00:02:51.220> torch<00:02:51.850> placement<00:02:52.330> works<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:53.350> here's<00:02:53.590> a

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
the torch placement works so here's a

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.040 
the torch placement works so here's a
little<00:02:53.950> mock<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:55.950> bookshelves<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:58.050> right

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
little mock of the bookshelves and right

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.050 
little mock of the bookshelves and right
here<00:02:59.380> is<00:02:59.530> my<00:02:59.710> stream<00:03:00.130> that<00:03:00.490> connects<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:00.970> the

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
here is my stream that connects to the

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.810 
here is my stream that connects to the
door<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:03.600> when<00:03:04.600> you<00:03:04.690> place<00:03:04.990> a<00:03:05.200> torch<00:03:05.820> the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
door and when you place a torch the

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:14.300 
door and when you place a torch the
screen<00:03:07.060> turns<00:03:07.330> off<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:08.830> way<00:03:09.210> change<00:03:10.210> our<00:03:10.390> log

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.200 

place<00:03:15.310> torching<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.850> screen

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
place torching the screen

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.300 
place torching the screen
yeah<00:03:16.330> so<00:03:16.690> basically<00:03:17.380> how<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.710> works<00:03:17.920> is

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
yeah so basically how that works is

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.640 
yeah so basically how that works is
beneath<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.390> torch<00:03:19.630> under<00:03:19.960> the<00:03:20.260> floor<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.530> have

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
beneath the torch under the floor I have

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.640 
beneath the torch under the floor I have
a<00:03:20.680> piston<00:03:21.160> and<00:03:21.720> when<00:03:22.720> I<00:03:22.780> place<00:03:22.990> the<00:03:23.020> torch<00:03:23.350> it

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
a piston and when I place the torch it

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.570 
a piston and when I place the torch it
powers<00:03:24.220> that<00:03:24.490> block<00:03:24.730> with<00:03:25.030> powers<00:03:25.300> the<00:03:25.450> piston

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
powers that block with powers the piston

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.050 
powers that block with powers the piston
so<00:03:28.110> while<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.320> piston<00:03:30.040> is<00:03:30.130> not<00:03:30.310> powered<00:03:30.730> you

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
so while the piston is not powered you

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.450 
so while the piston is not powered you
can<00:03:31.180> see<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.420> stream<00:03:31.750> is<00:03:32.220> streaming<00:03:33.220> float

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
can see the stream is streaming float

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.150 
can see the stream is streaming float
like<00:03:34.140> there's<00:03:35.140> energy<00:03:35.380> flowing<00:03:35.860> through<00:03:35.950> it

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
like there's energy flowing through it

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.990 
like there's energy flowing through it
but<00:03:37.150> when<00:03:37.390> I<00:03:37.630> place<00:03:37.960> the<00:03:37.990> torch<00:03:38.590> a<00:03:38.980> block<00:03:39.790> is

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
but when I place the torch a block is

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.800 
but when I place the torch a block is
placed<00:03:40.150> in<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.540> way<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:42.510> current<00:03:43.510> is<00:03:43.630> cut

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
placed in the way and the current is cut

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.890 
placed in the way and the current is cut
off<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:45.160> block<00:03:45.400> basically<00:03:45.640> gets<00:03:46.480> in<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.750> way

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
off the block basically gets in the way

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.500 
off the block basically gets in the way
and<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.230> current<00:03:47.500> doesn't<00:03:47.860> go<00:03:48.040> through<00:03:48.510> but

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
and the current doesn't go through but

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.780 
and the current doesn't go through but
then<00:03:49.690> when<00:03:49.810> I<00:03:49.870> get<00:03:49.930> rid<00:03:50.170> of<00:03:50.290> it<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:51.430> block<00:03:51.610> is

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
then when I get rid of it the block is

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.640 
then when I get rid of it the block is
pulled<00:03:51.970> back<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.510> crunch<00:03:52.840> both<00:03:53.200> scream<00:03:53.500> so

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
pulled back and crunch both scream so

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
pulled back and crunch both scream so
that's<00:03:53.800> how<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:53.950> little<00:03:54.220> course<00:03:54.430> placement

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
that's how the little course placement

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:01.320 
that's how the little course placement
works<00:03:55.650> now<00:03:56.650> basically<00:03:57.160> it<00:03:57.960> tell<00:03:58.960> anything
