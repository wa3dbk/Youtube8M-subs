00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.920
 hello youtube friends this time 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:12.349
 I'm going to show you how to make the rue 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:17.130
 this phone that is the alcatel idol 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:19.290
 6033 or known as alcatel ultra les 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.960
 I'm going to leave a link in the description 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.560
 of the program that we are going to need the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:32.360
 which is called virus is version 1.4 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.360
 points 2 good then we start 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.530
 The first thing we are going to do this is the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.390
 program that we are going to occupy is the virus 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.760
 The first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:48.079
 install it I have it here 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.079
 I am going to download it 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.850
 we are going to execute your program very 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.769
 little one nothing else weighs 5.1 megabytes the 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.909
 detail of the program is that it is in 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:08.060
 Chinese so if you do not know 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.220
 Well, this language is going to be a 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.539
 bit difficult but good really not 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.700
 it is so difficult 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:17.500
 well here we open the program 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.500
 to click on the first option 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.900
 then he will ask us the route where 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.540
 we want to install here the only thing that 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.280
 let's do is three options are 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.700
 that appear we're going to always grab the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.820
 second option we click once we give 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.470
 click again we click again and it 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.119
 the program will be installing us 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.119
 then he will ask us 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.770
 if we want to finish and open the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.430
 program at that time the program will 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:53.510
 You will open here what follows after 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:56.860
 to do this is that you connect 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.510
 the phone in debug usb mode 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.180
 let's do this we go here to 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.350
 options 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.720
 we are going to adjustments 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.580
 we go down 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.580
 where it says about the phone 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.670
 we see advanced settings 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.340
 and in advanced settings we check that 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.650
 is labeled where it says debugging 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:26.590
 usb once this is already labeled 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.100
 Now if you come out and when 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.810
 the truth I already have here as you 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:37.440
 can see on my phone 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.190
 the root icon and I'm even 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.790
 using applications applications 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.260
 root 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:51.280
 already delete several junk applications that 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.590
 the phone had and well you guys 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.659
 already they will be able in a given moment then 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.569
 customize your phone look here is 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:01.000
 the option of superior that is the one that I 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.400
 select and here you can see 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.290
 the whole series of programs that I 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.349
 as a root user, I gave him 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.810
 permission I do not at this time 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.370
 do because I have already rooted and 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.580
 I'll explain why I'm not going to 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.950
 do again 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.380
 when we are here in this window and already 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.230
 with our debug usb enabled 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.380
 we connect the phone to the computer 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:29.030
 by means of usb cable and the only thing that 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:32.160
 we are going to do is press this button 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.820
 will start loading software and 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.650
 later the phone will restart 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:41.430
 once the phone restarts 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.829
 let's have a root application 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.260
 china on the phone in our phone 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.849
 it will already be rooted but obviously not 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.000
 let's understand anything about this 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:54.660
 Chinese application that we are going to do in 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.840
 this case what I did was 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:01.730
 enter the google market 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:06.489
 to the play store 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.489
 and search superuser 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.870
 superior that is here and this law this 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.130
 yes 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:23.820
 then after installing this 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:27.840
 you can uninstall the superego being Chinese 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:31.020
 that will appear to you if the only thing 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.240
 I did was install this and update it 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.120
 to let me uninstall the 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:40.200
 application in china that's all that 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:44.970
 you have to do to install 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:47.269
 the root yes if you have doubts if your 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.269
 phone stayed 

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:50.269
 rooted 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.670
 Well, the only thing they should do 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.270
 is to download this application is called 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.130

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.330
 I will download and install it is a 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.330
 very small application 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.950
 and this application will allow us 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:15.030
 verify that effectively your phone 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.030
 be rooted 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.260
 ok let's give here verify for 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.260
 verify root access 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.840
 we give permission again because it is a 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.050
 application that also needs access 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.050
 root 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.710
