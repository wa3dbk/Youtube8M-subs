00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.959
 she made the difference of the i5 processor 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:10.690
 with a mips processor 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.869
 the main difference of ip3 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:13.969
 it was so 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.999
 is that in the meantime does not believe in 34 years 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:19.199
 he has 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.039
 in the bedroom with her real 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.160
 also you should not have more than what he sees dr what else he has 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.800
 it has a function called 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.409
 cloudy goals 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:34.650
 keirrison then began a very important victory what is 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.050
 took goals 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.760
 will also be created within the classroom 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.070
 It's in favor of dating. 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.210
 I take a crowd who makes a fact that they want to stay 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.519
 This is the same path Brazil has put 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.530
 now let's evaluate how well they did 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.860
 he is going to put 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.870
 Apple, whatever. 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.340
 That's what he does 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.850
 another objective is to remove the 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.210
 the Portuguese title is a half of speed 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.630
 ie whether a real processor with police officers another 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.480
 actor said he was ahead of the real conservative 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.670
 it increases its performance reaching 2 with the boavista on the spot is the time of 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.750
 performance 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.899
 above 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.490
 dudu considered the limit 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.060
 however it already has some differences have to do with the press 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.960
 teaching 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.190
 or ip3 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.090
 it has two cores 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.980
 and works with 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.360
 he believes he has four floors working with four but two cores 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.100
 they are not 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.840
 it's official reaction they're not real 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.180
 they are actually 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.950
 excited 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.549
 Imagine who would have imagined it but then 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.190
 he believes and works with slowness in the truth we have to admit he goes 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.700
 stay and abdullah 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.150
 he believes that the foreseen 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.740
 for 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.310
 and no wonder no other suitcase for 32 kate in 2008 4 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:12.470
 will understand 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.719
 Crazy people 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.459
 Head I understood this is a fight that is gay 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.889
 now this year 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:19.599
 and this is the teaching 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.859
 he is more seated 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.799
 it has four cores 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.729
 up to now four groups 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:26.839
 a CA 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:32.649
 nor does the federal prescription occur so far after we talk about stj vitrectomy 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:39.829
 95 and also has the difference and in the whole group stated we did not take shock 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.579
 cairo 1 to 1 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.140
 speed if in case you need 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.149
 he will use 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:51.629
 Whatever you need to do eric automatically 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.640
 When you need us, it's more than 20 thousand of the processor. 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.140
 they will not do this speed increase without you 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:06.969
 it will not force processors because I saw it colloquy 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:09.489
 without agreement with the secretary Ribamar 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.969
 in rome and in paris 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:16.630
 know when you get more human chmp know or get back from the processor 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.099
 but I will not lie 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.639
 you're at risk of burning a little higher in history 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:25.159
 designed to do this 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.949
 that is the idea of ​​what people 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:29.189
 at 6 the bill 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.719
 It was done for that, so repeat that. 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:36.139
 are the engineers 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.939
 to manufacture one that make the whole island has wingspan 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:42.469
 eliana structures everything 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:43.349
 design 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.559
 for someone to have this function so increase 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:49.969
 of your speed 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.479
 to work faster 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.360
 this part does not 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.549
 I think she acknowledges that this does not 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:02.239
 let's stop the acting and rodrigo rezende core processor i5 2 yet 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:02.790
 today 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.900
 they are saying that considering the contributions between days 4 and 19 320 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.530
 open tv caught wake says doctor 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.419
 these numbers drawn win 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.470
 the unforeseen computer 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.840
 in 5 to 5 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.900
 valduga 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.100
 this Thursday has 55 reais 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.940
 in five 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.419
 two points in six with 4GB of memory 320mm 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.249
 silas is 20 years old fourteen in English 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:35.139
 in high definition 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.669
 already on the ball in play
