 creteil leads 1 0 a little surprise soon 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.729
 the beginning of the match and the tfc 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.960
 find themselves in trouble and stay on 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.549
 a very severe defeat 5 1 in laval 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.380
 a defeat that puts an end to a beautiful 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.909
 series of 4 games without defeat 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.009
 the cristolians are in the process of 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.290
 catch up but watch out for the reaction 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.509
 Touraine with the Ivorian striker

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.619
 on a 4-0 defeat on the field 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.460
 of auxerre after a series of five 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.780
 matches without defeat 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.549
 the mountains do not want them 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.619
 to doubt and return quickly to the match 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.950
 but watch out for this exit in the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.430
 feet of nicolas belvito a risk 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.430
 huge 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:56.759
 and it seems a penalty kick a penalty that 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.920
 seems logical but that didier falcone 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.920
 the referee of the match will not grant 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.149
 then turn back well in the match 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.550
 with andy delort 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.110

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:23.940
 creteil leads 1 0 in the second half turn 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:25.890
 accelerated to try to come back with 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.349
 this pressing performed very high 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.180
 maybe a fault not reported on 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.540
 center and the immediate recovery of andy 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.610
 delort 51st minute 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.860
 equalization for rounds a goal everywhere 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.530
 this is the sixth goal of the season 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.450
 the former striker of ac ajaccio a 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:48.480
 very nice achievement that allows the tfc 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.519
 to get better in this match but creel 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.440
 did not say his last word with a 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.850
 new balloon in the surface the 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.900

 fun dryers and 20 years old dryades cima 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.030
 the Malagasy attacker of créteil 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.760
 and it's not quite over with 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.280
 this possibility recessed typing 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.780
 and it's in superb hotman shot

 prevail 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.970
 tours that insists on coming back 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.280
 at least at home with the point of 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.930
 no, but this is not the case action 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.680
 saved by the goalkeeper second chance 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.770

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.600

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.690
 both teams come out of a defeat 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.390
 heavy and it's creteil that is in the process 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.220
 to recover the best even if towers 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.040
 insists to the end with this strike 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.650

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.140
