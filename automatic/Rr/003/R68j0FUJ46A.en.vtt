00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
pressure at all I didn't think at least

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.550 
pressure at all I didn't think at least
on<00:02:43.090> from<00:02:43.450> my<00:02:43.690> experience<00:02:43.810> with<00:02:44.290> them<00:02:44.410> I've

they do the job definitely you get a ton

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:58.949 
they do the job definitely you get a ton
of<00:02:57.549> traction<00:02:57.849> with<00:02:58.090> them<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.599> get<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.840> move

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
of traction with them you get to move

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.680 
of traction with them you get to move
laterally<00:02:59.379> very<00:03:00.250> very<00:03:00.489> well<00:03:00.670> in<00:03:00.790> them<00:03:00.910> as<00:03:01.540> far

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
laterally very very well in them as far

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.199
