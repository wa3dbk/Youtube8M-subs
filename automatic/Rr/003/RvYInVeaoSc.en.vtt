00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.700
 all the characters are very cartoon 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.770
 similar to artists who are voiced 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.159

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.389
 in the world at all 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.039
 so 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:04.909

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.649
 corner but once your dogs 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:08.929
 let's say 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:10.110

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.249
 It's hard now 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:16.369
 for example, here we have this story 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:18.229
 purely 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:19.090
 and she 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.659
 first character 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:22.929
 he has some sort of 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:25.649
 before that they speak a little higher 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:27.649
 opened a release account loses 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:30.129

 some kind of character and their 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:33.509
 need to decide 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:35.689
 ahead of the development of everything now very 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.369
 many problems that's great 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:39.319
 this evening which no matter how a 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.849
 those who do not just voice their 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.259
 characters can be called 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:43.959
 cartoon creators 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.079
 animators in many cases 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.029
 repelled exactly that actor 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:48.189
 microphone improvisation 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.659

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.899
 the presence of women and wonderful moving 

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:06.219
 start there bark report in this that is 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:07.769
 considering phantom 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.979

 the good old days are back 

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:24.819
 soviet animation 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:26.580
 then it was reasonable characters voiced 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.550
 such masters scenes like papan leonov 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.080

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.720
 and the future was 219 guided 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.580
 when
