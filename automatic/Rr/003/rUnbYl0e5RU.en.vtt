00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.380 

good<00:00:01.979> morning<00:00:02.460> this<00:00:02.700> is<00:00:02.760> Anita<00:00:03.300> and<00:00:03.750> today<00:00:04.710> is

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390 
good morning this is Anita and today is

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.610 
good morning this is Anita and today is
the<00:00:06.390> 13th<00:00:07.230> of<00:00:07.440> August<00:00:07.950> 2011<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:09.170> I'm<00:00:10.170> going<00:00:10.440> to

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
the 13th of August 2011 and I'm going to

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.660 
the 13th of August 2011 and I'm going to
look<00:00:10.920> at<00:00:11.190> how<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.759> propagate<00:00:12.210> African<00:00:13.049> violet

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
look at how to propagate African violet

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.580 
look at how to propagate African violet
because<00:00:14.670> someone<00:00:15.150> had<00:00:15.299> asked<00:00:15.719> me<00:00:15.839> how<00:00:16.260> should

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
because someone had asked me how should

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.450 
because someone had asked me how should
I<00:00:16.680> make<00:00:16.859> my<00:00:17.220> plant<00:00:17.779> into<00:00:18.779> many<00:00:18.960> plants<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:20.220> I'll

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
I make my plant into many plants so I'll

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.130 
I make my plant into many plants so I'll
show<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.670> something<00:00:20.970> that's<00:00:21.390> worked<00:00:21.660> for<00:00:21.810> me

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
show you something that's worked for me

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.009 
show you something that's worked for me
and<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:23.189> find<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.630> can<00:00:24.810> propagate

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
and you find that you can propagate

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.080 
and you find that you can propagate
African<00:00:25.710> violets<00:00:25.890> right<00:00:26.430> from<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.060> very

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
African violets right from the very

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.080 
African violets right from the very
plant<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.900> have<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.529> we<00:00:29.340> do<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.760> by

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
plant that you have and we do that by

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.139 
plant that you have and we do that by
cutting<00:00:30.359> away<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:31.230> lower<00:00:31.769> lower<00:00:32.369> layer<00:00:32.910> of

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
cutting away the lower lower layer of

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.680 
cutting away the lower lower layer of
leaves<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.380> identify<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:35.190> plant<00:00:35.579> what<00:00:36.540> is

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
leaves so you identify a plant what is

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.420 
leaves so you identify a plant what is
an<00:00:36.809> African<00:00:37.230> plant<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.620> does<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.860> consist<00:00:38.219> of

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
an African plant what does it consist of

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.020 
an African plant what does it consist of
so<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.390> has<00:00:39.600> an<00:00:39.780> inner<00:00:40.110> layer<00:00:40.550> like<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> small

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
so it has an inner layer like a small

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.840 
so it has an inner layer like a small
leaves<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.230> see<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> inner<00:00:43.770> core<00:00:44.070> then

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
leaves you can see the inner core then

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.350 
leaves you can see the inner core then
it<00:00:44.969> has<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> second<00:00:45.750> layer<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.430> leaf<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.700> then<00:00:48.329> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
it has a second layer of leaf and then a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.410 
it has a second layer of leaf and then a
third<00:00:48.800> so<00:00:49.800> here<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.879> actually<00:00:51.090> two

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
third so here we have actually two

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.740 
third so here we have actually two
plants<00:00:51.840> one<00:00:52.110> here<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:53.039> can<00:00:53.219> see<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:54.120> second

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
plants one here you can see and second

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.680 
plants one here you can see and second
one<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:54.960> here<00:00:55.399> so<00:00:56.399> small<00:00:56.670> inner<00:00:57.090> leaves<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
one is here so small inner leaves and

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.630 
one is here so small inner leaves and
then<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.170> second<00:00:58.559> layer<00:00:58.710> another<00:00:59.280> third

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
then the second layer another third

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.139 
then the second layer another third
layer<00:01:00.559> similarly<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:02.070> look<00:01:02.100> at<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.609> one<00:01:02.850> here

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
layer similarly we look at this one here

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.490 
layer similarly we look at this one here
this<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.439> one<00:01:04.830> I've<00:01:05.070> started<00:01:05.580> with<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> leaf

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
this is the one I've started with a leaf

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.200 
this is the one I've started with a leaf
so<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> mother<00:01:08.159> leaf<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:09.060> see

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
so here is the mother leaf you can see

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.570 
so here is the mother leaf you can see
that<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.689> then<00:01:10.500> from<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.920> came<00:01:11.159> several

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
that and then from it came several

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.480 
that and then from it came several
babies<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> growth<00:01:13.830> for<00:01:14.130> over

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
babies and this is a growth for over

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.910 
babies and this is a growth for over
about<00:01:14.670> two<00:01:14.909> three<00:01:15.150> months<00:01:15.299> now<00:01:15.680> so<00:01:16.680> let's

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
about two three months now so let's

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.700 
about two three months now so let's
identify<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:18.090> number<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:19.020> plants<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.680> have

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
identify the number of plants we have

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.300 
identify the number of plants we have
here

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
here

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.840 
here
here<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.090> one<00:01:21.890> see<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.040> inner<00:01:23.280> leaves<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
here is one see the inner leaves and

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:38.140 
here is one see the inner leaves and
then<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.000> outer<00:01:24.330> leaf<00:01:24.799> one<00:01:27.290> two<00:01:31.280> three<00:01:37.009> four

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
then the outer leaf one two three four

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.560 
then the outer leaf one two three four
so<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.540> four<00:01:39.930> baby<00:01:40.740> plants<00:01:41.250> now<00:01:42.180> actually

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
so we have four baby plants now actually

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.410 
so we have four baby plants now actually
something<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.740> found<00:01:44.100> also<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.909> my<00:01:45.149> other

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
something that I found also on my other

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.819 
something that I found also on my other
African<00:01:46.140> violet<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.740> one<00:01:46.890> I've<00:01:47.070> been<00:01:47.630> growing

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
African violet the one I've been growing

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.010 
African violet the one I've been growing
lots<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:50.040> flowers<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.759> please<00:01:51.630> take<00:01:51.810> these

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
lots of flowers on please take these

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.460 
lots of flowers on please take these
away<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:54.000> look<00:01:54.420> at<00:01:54.570> do<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.869> remember<00:01:55.320> this

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
away and look at do you remember this

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.620 
away and look at do you remember this
once<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.009> maroon<00:01:56.340> plant<00:01:56.670> which<00:01:56.880> had<00:01:57.060> flowers

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
once the maroon plant which had flowers

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.200 
once the maroon plant which had flowers
and<00:01:58.020> parts<00:01:58.350> okay<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.399> what<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.820> did

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
and parts okay so what I did

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.929 
and parts okay so what I did
periodically<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.409> do<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:02.100> cut<00:02:02.640> away<00:02:02.759> the

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
periodically and I do is cut away the

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.899 
periodically and I do is cut away the
lowest<00:02:03.270> layer<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.719> leaves<00:02:04.110> which<00:02:04.710> usually<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
lowest layer of leaves which usually the

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.510 
lowest layer of leaves which usually the
plant<00:02:06.180> does<00:02:06.600> not<00:02:06.780> really<00:02:07.170> need<00:02:07.469> because<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
plant does not really need because the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.570 
plant does not really need because the
flowers<00:02:08.910> they<00:02:09.239> come<00:02:09.479> between<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.110> second<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
flowers they come between the second the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.380 
flowers they come between the second the
first<00:02:11.760> and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
first and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.809 
first and
can<00:02:12.510> layer<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:13.050> where<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.800> flowers<00:02:14.130> come<00:02:14.370> from

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
can layer is where the flowers come from

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.710 
can layer is where the flowers come from
so<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:16.050> demonstrate<00:02:16.830> on<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.160> one<00:02:17.400> here<00:02:17.720> so

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
so I demonstrate on this one here so

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.520 
so I demonstrate on this one here so
here<00:02:18.959> is<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.730> here<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:23.090> inner<00:02:24.090> layer<00:02:24.530> babies

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
here is the here is inner layer babies

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.190 
here is the here is inner layer babies
and<00:02:25.830> then<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.550> second<00:02:26.940> layer<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.360> all<00:02:28.080> the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
and then the second layer and all the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.280 
and then the second layer and all the
flowers<00:02:28.410> come<00:02:28.920> between<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:30.630> first<00:02:30.930> layer

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
flowers come between the the first layer

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.890 
flowers come between the the first layer
and<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.920> second<00:02:32.280> layer<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.459> leaf<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.570> can<00:02:33.630> see

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
and the second layer of leaf you can see

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.180 
and the second layer of leaf you can see
that<00:02:34.110> yes<00:02:36.020> so<00:02:37.020> what<00:02:37.200> happened<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.770> when<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.040> took

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
that yes so what happened is when I took

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.880 
that yes so what happened is when I took
away<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.820> lower<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.239> I<00:02:39.570> took<00:02:40.410> them<00:02:40.620> away

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
away the lower this I took them away

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.750 
away the lower this I took them away
just<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.750> know<00:02:42.780> make<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:44.010> plant<00:02:44.400> lighter

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
just to you know make the plant lighter

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.229 
just to you know make the plant lighter
and<00:02:45.239> so<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.050> can<00:02:46.230> focus<00:02:46.440> on<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.830> flower<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.239> so

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
and so it can focus on the flower a so

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.060 
and so it can focus on the flower a so
the<00:02:48.420> bottom<00:02:48.750> most<00:02:48.930> layer<00:02:49.200> for<00:02:49.560> example<00:02:49.980> this

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
the bottom most layer for example this

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.640 
the bottom most layer for example this
big<00:02:50.400> one<00:02:50.610> this<00:02:50.880> big<00:02:51.180> leaf<00:02:51.420> here<00:02:51.720> if<00:02:52.230> not

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
big one this big leaf here if not

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.979 
big one this big leaf here if not
required<00:02:53.070> you<00:02:53.489> can<00:02:53.519> cut<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:53.970> away<00:02:54.120> when<00:02:54.870> the

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
required you can cut it away when the

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.300 
required you can cut it away when the
plant<00:02:55.200> gets<00:02:55.440> too<00:02:55.620> big<00:02:55.830> you<00:02:55.980> can<00:02:56.040> participate

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
plant gets too big you can participate

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.000 
plant gets too big you can participate
but<00:02:57.180> what<00:02:57.390> happens<00:02:57.900> every<00:02:58.080> time<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.500> cut<00:02:58.709> away

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
but what happens every time you cut away

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.910 
but what happens every time you cut away
the<00:02:59.700> plant<00:03:00.000> puts<00:03:00.269> out<00:03:00.510> babies<00:03:01.260> at<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.739> cut

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
the plant puts out babies at the cut

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.050 
the plant puts out babies at the cut
away<00:03:02.130> point<00:03:02.459> for<00:03:03.150> example<00:03:03.269> here<00:03:04.459> now<00:03:05.459> you<00:03:05.880> can

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
away point for example here now you can

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.090 
away point for example here now you can
see<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.390> baby<00:03:06.600> leaves<00:03:06.870> coming<00:03:07.260> up<00:03:07.380> here<00:03:10.100> yes

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
see the baby leaves coming up here yes

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.360 
see the baby leaves coming up here yes
so<00:03:11.790> this<00:03:11.910> is<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.120> new<00:03:12.330> plant<00:03:13.010> yes

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
so this is a new plant yes

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:26.180 
so this is a new plant yes
have<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:14.880> got<00:03:15.060> any<00:03:15.269> more<00:03:22.700> yes<00:03:23.780> here<00:03:25.070> can<00:03:26.070> you

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
have you got any more yes here can you

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.850 
have you got any more yes here can you
see<00:03:26.220> now<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.820> baby<00:03:27.090> plant<00:03:27.420> coming<00:03:27.780> there<00:03:28.019> so

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
see now the baby plant coming there so

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.990 
see now the baby plant coming there so
in<00:03:29.310> this<00:03:30.140> pot<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:31.440> will<00:03:31.739> have<00:03:32.130> three<00:03:32.430> four<00:03:32.670> baby

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
in this pot I will have three four baby

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.880 
in this pot I will have three four baby
plants<00:03:33.420> coming<00:03:33.750> out<00:03:33.930> from<00:03:34.230> where<00:03:34.530> that<00:03:34.560> cut

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
plants coming out from where that cut

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.560 
plants coming out from where that cut
away<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.940> bottom<00:03:36.510> most<00:03:36.780> layer<00:03:37.079> of<00:03:37.650> these

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
away the bottom most layer of these

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.140 
away the bottom most layer of these
similarly<00:03:39.570> in<00:03:39.720> this<00:03:39.900> one<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.760> have<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.790> baby

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
similarly in this one I have a baby

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.979 
similarly in this one I have a baby
plant<00:03:42.510> coming<00:03:42.930> here<00:03:43.370> you<00:03:44.370> see<00:03:44.579> that<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:45.900> the

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
plant coming here you see that it is the

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:46.850 
plant coming here you see that it is the
top<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.380> plant

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
top of the plant

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.740 
top of the plant
the<00:03:47.040> lower<00:03:47.250> leaves<00:03:47.519> have<00:03:47.760> cut<00:03:48.000> away<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.540> there

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
the lower leaves have cut away and there

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.850 
the lower leaves have cut away and there
you<00:03:48.870> get<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:49.019> baby<00:03:49.290> blunt

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
you get a baby blunt

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:59.569 
you get a baby blunt
add<00:03:50.549> more<00:03:54.709> here<00:03:56.090> there<00:03:57.090> is<00:03:57.180> another<00:03:57.209> baby<00:03:58.579> yes

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
add more here there is another baby yes

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.069 
add more here there is another baby yes
and<00:04:00.620> you<00:04:01.620> can<00:04:01.799> see<00:04:02.070> there<00:04:03.060> is<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.269> flower<00:04:03.690> bud

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
and you can see there is a flower bud

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.060 
and you can see there is a flower bud
coming<00:04:04.560> here<00:04:05.360> between<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.720> inner<00:04:07.500> layer<00:04:07.739> and

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
coming here between the inner layer and

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.789 
coming here between the inner layer and
the<00:04:08.850> second<00:04:09.239> layer<00:04:09.299> of<00:04:09.630> leaf<00:04:09.840> so<00:04:10.500> this<00:04:10.650> is<00:04:10.769> a

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
the second layer of leaf so this is a

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.290 
the second layer of leaf so this is a
flower<00:04:11.100> there<00:04:12.109> so<00:04:13.109> that's<00:04:13.320> how<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.560> identify

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
flower there so that's how you identify

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.289 
flower there so that's how you identify
where<00:04:15.930> are<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.170> baby<00:04:16.489> so<00:04:17.489> we<00:04:17.519> keep<00:04:17.940> going

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
where are the baby so we keep going

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:18.860 
where are the baby so we keep going
around

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
around

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.630 
around
you've<00:04:19.260> gotta<00:04:19.470> weigh<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.799> bottom<00:04:20.130> most<00:04:20.340> layer

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
you've gotta weigh the bottom most layer

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.940 
you've gotta weigh the bottom most layer
of<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.000> leaf<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:21.480> you'll<00:04:22.200> end<00:04:22.470> up<00:04:22.590> with<00:04:22.770> very

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
of the leaf and you'll end up with very

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.820 
of the leaf and you'll end up with very
plant<00:04:23.400> automatically<00:04:24.390> so<00:04:25.260> you<00:04:25.290> don't<00:04:25.470> even

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
plant automatically so you don't even

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.540 
plant automatically so you don't even
have<00:04:26.100> to<00:04:26.340> do<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.640> leaf<00:04:26.820> propagation<00:04:27.830> so<00:04:28.830> that

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
have to do the leaf propagation so that

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.910 
have to do the leaf propagation so that
is<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:29.850> lesson<00:04:30.060> totally<00:04:30.690> how<00:04:31.410> to<00:04:31.470> propagate

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
is the lesson totally how to propagate

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.030 
is the lesson totally how to propagate
African<00:04:32.760> violet<00:04:33.260> without<00:04:34.260> cutting<00:04:34.680> away<00:04:34.890> the

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
African violet without cutting away the

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.370 
African violet without cutting away the
leaves<00:04:35.400> and<00:04:35.640> simply<00:04:36.570> by<00:04:36.720> taking<00:04:36.900> away<00:04:37.320> the

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
leaves and simply by taking away the

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.400 
leaves and simply by taking away the
third<00:04:38.000> big<00:04:39.000> layer<00:04:39.270> of<00:04:39.540> leaf<00:04:39.750> at<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.080> bottom

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
third big layer of leaf at the bottom

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.820 
third big layer of leaf at the bottom
and<00:04:40.730> after<00:04:41.730> some<00:04:41.910> time<00:04:42.150> you<00:04:42.330> will<00:04:42.360> find<00:04:42.830> that

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
and after some time you will find that

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.440 
and after some time you will find that
we<00:04:44.130> actually<00:04:44.400> get<00:04:44.910> little<00:04:45.630> baby<00:04:45.930> plush<00:04:47.450> okay

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
we actually get little baby plush okay

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.610 
we actually get little baby plush okay
so<00:04:48.780> that's<00:04:49.020> the<00:04:49.230> lesson<00:04:50.750> for<00:04:51.750> today<00:04:51.930> I<00:04:52.260> get<00:04:52.590> a

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
so that's the lesson for today I get a

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.960 
so that's the lesson for today I get a
good<00:04:52.860> shot<00:04:53.100> of<00:04:53.130> that<00:04:54.770> yes<00:04:55.800> day<00:04:56.900> all<00:04:57.900> right
