 yes with us ten Lima is the MMO soon downhill it came to that means 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.710
 explained very well 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.890
 Time Platter appeared that nobody seemed to bow to me 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.080
 as with me now here is a small exclamation mark then he creates anyway 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:34.160
 Mobile backups to the local plate until they could not fully vinegar 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.120
 realize that the large space takes up and if then his 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.030
 Machine wanted to be available again 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.370
 he will 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.500
 to delete this mobile Becker and on the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.330
 Theimer appeared and volley around 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.510
 about playing Colonel Whole so I can do Time Machine 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.130

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.170
 around 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.620
 then he did not want to join me here I see it 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.620
 not connected and now start a machine shop 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.170
 you see that works 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.420
 and i could also recover something in the mobile 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.420
 Becker PSI is canceling for summer 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.540
 then finally we close for the desk 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.540
 Jung wanted to push my Theimer once 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.400
 I have the timer, Volley seemed unencrypted that's a new one 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.770
 Borrow function under OS 10 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.759
 that means now briefly in the system settings two machines 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.710
 and could say here with cloudy select 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.410
 okay he should encode the Becker broth here 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.360
 I've clicked on that and that means Becker custom 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.360
 encoded 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.270
 we can not make any further adjustments here since another video 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.170
 how to turn off the mopay Beckerts are percent me personally 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.469
 have activated this although I am the 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.760
 Mac Book Air here only have 128 gigabytes of SSD 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.760
 I did not tell him that the big storage tank 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:15.699
 so 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:17.169
 then talk again 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.169
 his machines 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.220
 What's new that looks a bit different here 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.229
 Percent what is this 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:42.679
 Added to Stamer so much male masculine themes 

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:44.670
 Percent of the time here 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.279
 and PrÃ¶ll I want you 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:48.289
 briefly explain what that means 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:50.669
 Pink are always 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.920
 Backups or are displayed here in the timeline 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.779
 for what is on the 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:57.319
 Theimer seemed to volley around 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.479
 on it is or where one 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:04.790
 proper bed was sewn yesterday at 9:50 am was a 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.270
 there was also bend on my time machine here i have no order 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.790
 beautiful spank and 10 42 clock was a MMO soon Beckert at 12 clock 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.760
 8 was also an MMO soon downhill if it goes back a bit 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.390
 yesterday at 10 o'clock or the day before yesterday 10 o'clock 50 a correct Beckert took place 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.390
 on the three machines volley at 8 55 clock also 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:31.549
 three days ago at 13:26, however, one being Becker and three days ago at 8 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.349
 24 o'clock he followed again a baker buy a Theimer seemed wanting young 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.019
 therefore the colors are shown here now 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.290
 Percent 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.880
 Handke and in that already that was not so before if I would like to see now 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.750
 When has the Main Desk been changed for the last time? 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.750
 Changes in these 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.899
 Folder then I climbed here once on the fire and he shows me now 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:04:01.069
 when my desk was last changed, but that's not it 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.209
 what I want to see 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.450
 I am now looking far for completely different files 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.450
 Plischke again 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.039
 Percent back when was my desk Ten changed 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:15.199
 at 10 4 10 so to speak, but that's not what I'm looking for 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:16.709
 So every day 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.129
 back 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:23.129
 back again 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.110
 and I see 8 now 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.199
 on the day before yesterday 10 o'clock 50 is this something something 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.080
 search 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.789
 and then I kick it 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.080
 I can navigate as well as a club that I can 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.530
 me 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.950
 to let pictures Quick Lock also show what it is about me 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.200
 restore the correct file could now say restore and 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.260
 then I could restore this whole folder or and at present 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.800
 which is still a good feature you have since percent something definitely happened 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.740
 neither in your downhill nor before the skyscrapers in the computer want 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.139
 Whatever, whatever you can here 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.659
 right-click once on it and 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.569
 they say all backups of 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:11.810
 this file 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.270
 in that case it will delete a picture 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.770
 then you will 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.070
 this file in Einbeck as fair 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.460
 and I could too 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.400
 delete this stalemate completely from here if I say and how I like it 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.219
 not then watchman that Becker the day before yesterday and she only 50 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.630
 I did not show that in my last few days percent video 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.889
 so here's something to catch up with, there was something like that before 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.830
 at least those are the new features of 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.159
 Theimer seemed like I said 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:44.449
 Beckett recognizes that here you do not want to 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.370
 Was available and thus seems to be behind 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.530
 Percent timeline and otherwise you are yourself 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.480
 He does not worry about anything again, he does it fully automatically with the Oberdeck share 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.850
 could now where the hard drive 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.970
 the decker the house is so the time seemed plate encrypt it 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.069
 does not work on one 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:06.810
 March 2009 you can not encrypt that 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.720
 but he is not a plate because it makes sense synonymous you can encrypt 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.669
 yes so much for the topic 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:17.669
 his machine and turbo s 10 Lyon I say thank you for watching and 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:18.939
 See you next time
