hey<00:00:00.840> there<00:00:01.020> Scipio<00:00:01.410> here<00:00:01.650> and<00:00:01.829> we're<00:00:02.040> gonna<00:00:02.129> do

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
hey there Scipio here and we're gonna do

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.309 
hey there Scipio here and we're gonna do
some<00:00:02.490> quick<00:00:02.700> bench<00:00:03.030> testing<00:00:03.480> today<00:00:03.780> with<00:00:04.080> my

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
some quick bench testing today with my

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.579 
some quick bench testing today with my
dual<00:00:04.740> sky<00:00:04.950> motors<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.640> 11<00:00:06.600> inch<00:00:06.720> props<00:00:06.990> these

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
dual sky motors and 11 inch props these

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.810 
dual sky motors and 11 inch props these
are<00:00:07.710> dual<00:00:07.859> Sky<00:00:08.069> XM<00:00:08.670> 40<00:00:09.120> 10<00:00:09.389> mr<00:00:09.889> 6.5<00:00:10.889> s<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.730> what

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
are dual Sky XM 40 10 mr 6.5 s and what

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.100 
are dual Sky XM 40 10 mr 6.5 s and what
I<00:00:11.880> want<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.120> do<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.330> find<00:00:12.599> out<00:00:12.750> what<00:00:12.960> my

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
I want to do is find out what my

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.220 
I want to do is find out what my
expected<00:00:13.710> maximum<00:00:13.980> amp<00:00:14.610> draw<00:00:15.059> which<00:00:15.839> six<00:00:16.109> of

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
expected maximum amp draw which six of

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.840 
expected maximum amp draw which six of
these<00:00:16.320> motors<00:00:16.680> would<00:00:16.800> be<00:00:16.949> on<00:00:17.070> my<00:00:17.220> system<00:00:17.609> so

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
these motors would be on my system so

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.779 
these motors would be on my system so
I've<00:00:18.420> got<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.630> strapped<00:00:18.930> down<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.289> table<00:00:19.789> and

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
I've got it strapped down to a table and

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.310 
I've got it strapped down to a table and
I'm<00:00:20.910> just<00:00:21.000> gonna<00:00:21.090> test<00:00:21.449> two<00:00:21.660> different<00:00:21.689> motors

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
I'm just gonna test two different motors

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.170 
I'm just gonna test two different motors
to<00:00:22.500> kind<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.769> get<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> delta<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.880> make<00:00:24.000> sure<00:00:24.150> I

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
to kind of get a delta and make sure I

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.429 
to kind of get a delta and make sure I
get<00:00:24.470> at<00:00:25.470> least<00:00:25.740> two<00:00:26.010> tested<00:00:27.170> let's<00:00:28.170> see<00:00:28.289> what

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
get at least two tested let's see what

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:43.970 
get at least two tested let's see what
happens<00:00:40.940> so<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:41.969> should<00:00:42.270> note<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.770> both<00:00:43.770> of

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
happens so I should note that both of

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.520 
happens so I should note that both of
these<00:00:44.100> tests<00:00:44.730> I'm<00:00:45.120> doing<00:00:45.420> two<00:00:45.539> different<00:00:45.690> test

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
these tests I'm doing two different test

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.520 
these tests I'm doing two different test
two<00:00:47.010> different<00:00:47.039> motors<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.600> battery<00:00:49.410> is

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
two different motors the battery is

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.750 
two different motors the battery is
charged<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.390> 4.2<00:00:51.390> volts<00:00:51.780> per<00:00:52.649> cell<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.460> fully

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
charged to 4.2 volts per cell so fully

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.240 
charged to 4.2 volts per cell so fully
topped<00:00:54.059> off<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.570> I'm<00:00:55.410> running<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.800> testing

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
topped off and I'm running the testing

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.970 
topped off and I'm running the testing
down<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:56.760> about<00:00:56.910> 200<00:00:57.449> milliamps<00:00:57.690> down<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.739> 4

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
down for about 200 milliamps down to 4

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:34.950 
down for about 200 milliamps down to 4
volts<00:00:59.340> so

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.540 

and<00:01:35.960> here's<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.440> look<00:01:36.650> at<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.860> final<00:01:37.220> numbers

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
and here's a look at the final numbers

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.640 
and here's a look at the final numbers
looks<00:01:38.180> like<00:01:38.330> I<00:01:38.450> was<00:01:38.570> able<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:38.840> pull<00:01:39.110> a<00:01:39.440> little

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
looks like I was able to pull a little

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:53.540 
looks like I was able to pull a little
over<00:01:39.920> 17<00:01:40.960> amps<00:01:41.960> out<00:01:42.230> of<00:01:42.350> that<00:01:42.470> one<00:01:42.680> motor

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.890 

all<00:01:54.550> right<00:01:54.670> so<00:01:54.790> here's<00:01:54.970> another<00:01:55.120> motor<00:01:55.420> let's

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
all right so here's another motor let's

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:09.480 
all right so here's another motor let's
see<00:01:56.020> what<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:56.230> does

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.900 

looky<00:02:10.490> there

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
looky there

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:52.380 
looky there
hit<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.060> 20

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.230 

I<00:02:53.400> should<00:02:54.400> stop<00:02:54.640> before<00:02:54.820> i<00:02:55.000> vibrate

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
I should stop before i vibrate

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.130 
I should stop before i vibrate
everything<00:02:55.990> off<00:02:56.760> look<00:02:57.760> at<00:02:57.850> this<00:02:57.970> so<00:02:58.270> I<00:02:58.600> pulled

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
everything off look at this so I pulled

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.060 
everything off look at this so I pulled
a<00:02:59.820> little<00:03:00.820> over<00:03:01.090> 20<00:03:01.450> amps<00:03:01.900> out<00:03:02.140> of<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.410> 300

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
a little over 20 amps out of that 300

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.030 
a little over 20 amps out of that 300
Watts<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:04.020> that's<00:03:05.020> my<00:03:05.170> worst<00:03:05.320> case<00:03:05.530> scenario

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
Watts so that's my worst case scenario

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.760 
Watts so that's my worst case scenario
so<00:03:06.520> what<00:03:07.270> does<00:03:07.360> this<00:03:07.450> mean<00:03:07.660> well<00:03:08.410> it<00:03:08.530> means<00:03:08.560> I

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
so what does this mean well it means I

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.980 
so what does this mean well it means I
need<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:08.950> plan<00:03:09.160> for<00:03:09.220> at<00:03:09.490> least<00:03:09.580> 20<00:03:09.970> ants<00:03:10.240> max

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
need to plan for at least 20 ants max

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.890 
need to plan for at least 20 ants max
per<00:03:11.380> motor<00:03:11.590> that's<00:03:12.460> gonna<00:03:12.640> be<00:03:12.850> 120<00:03:13.510> amps<00:03:13.780> on

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
per motor that's gonna be 120 amps on

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.810 
per motor that's gonna be 120 amps on
this<00:03:14.020> hexacopter<00:03:14.770> so<00:03:15.190> all<00:03:15.370> of<00:03:15.520> my<00:03:15.610> electronics

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
this hexacopter so all of my electronics

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.970 
this hexacopter so all of my electronics
connectors<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.050> modules<00:03:17.530> should<00:03:17.590> be<00:03:17.770> rated

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
connectors and modules should be rated

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.370 
connectors and modules should be rated
to<00:03:18.220> handle<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.760> it's<00:03:19.540> possible<00:03:20.140> I've

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
to handle that it's possible I've

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.710 
to handle that it's possible I've
already<00:03:20.680> proven<00:03:20.920> it<00:03:21.040> on<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.280> bench<00:03:21.630> but<00:03:22.630> of

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
already proven it on the bench but of

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.180 
already proven it on the bench but of
course<00:03:22.930> also<00:03:23.230> based<00:03:23.440> on<00:03:23.590> this<00:03:23.709> test<00:03:23.950> if<00:03:24.130> you

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
course also based on this test if you

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.830 
course also based on this test if you
look<00:03:24.340> back<00:03:24.490> at<00:03:24.640> those<00:03:24.730> numbers<00:03:24.940> I<00:03:25.360> could

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
look back at those numbers I could

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.570 
look back at those numbers I could
probably<00:03:26.110> expect<00:03:26.440> to<00:03:26.590> really<00:03:26.890> pull<00:03:27.070> about<00:03:27.310> 10

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
probably expect to really pull about 10

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.630 
probably expect to really pull about 10
apps<00:03:27.790> normally<00:03:28.270> so<00:03:28.770> anyway<00:03:29.770> that's<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.370> just

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
apps normally so anyway that's it just

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.250 
apps normally so anyway that's it just
want<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.850> share<00:03:31.000> that<00:03:31.150> with<00:03:31.270> you<00:03:31.330> I<00:03:31.660> wanted<00:03:32.140> to

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
want to share that with you I wanted to

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.990 
want to share that with you I wanted to
make<00:03:32.350> sure<00:03:32.380> I<00:03:32.500> did<00:03:32.739> that<00:03:32.770> test<00:03:33.160> actually<00:03:33.580> turns

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
make sure I did that test actually turns

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.620 
make sure I did that test actually turns
out<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:34.180> motors<00:03:34.690> are<00:03:35.020> rated<00:03:35.860> at<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.100> max<00:03:36.489> of<00:03:36.760> 24

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
out that motors are rated at a max of 24

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.280 
out that motors are rated at a max of 24
bursts<00:03:38.110> so<00:03:38.560> hitting<00:03:38.920> 20<00:03:39.510> is<00:03:40.510> fairly

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
bursts so hitting 20 is fairly

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.320 
bursts so hitting 20 is fairly
consistent<00:03:41.890> with<00:03:42.430> what<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.760> manufacturer

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
consistent with what the manufacturer
