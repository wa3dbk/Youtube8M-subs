00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 the spoon brigadeiro or those 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.629
 recipe that ends with any will 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.890
 crazy to eat sweet but he has a 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.740
 little problem 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.509
 I always burn the tongue if the person 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.490
 is making a woman employee is 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.400
 Why did you comment five o'clock nobody? 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.039
 hope to know with this solution we 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.269
 let's prepare and cool the brigadeiro 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.430
 in a pot I only heard story 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.920
 to cool the brigadeiro in the favela has more 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.720
 an advantage it does not pass the point not 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.550
 I know if it happened to you but you know. 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.160
 How much will that spoonful give you? 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.870
 and he did not show up with 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.820
 This bowl of ice will not go away. 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.250
 happen because it's going to be salt 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.320
 cooking this is the brigadeiro pronto 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.430
 and we still enjoy the ice water 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.200
 To wash the pot the milk has a method 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.399
 different the brigadeiro that we go 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.219
 do kaka takes a powder is not chocolate in 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.530
 powder much less chocolate because the 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.600
 condensed milk is already very sweet 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.899
 as it is not soluble I need a 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.729
 a little water to make a pastry 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:10.590
 file two tablespoons of cocoa 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:13.820
 and runs and two tablespoons of water 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.820
 Can you stop for a little while? 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.320
 but a detail our brigadier is going 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:29.320
 be done in a stainless steel frying pan 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.320
 with bottom pan non frying pan 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.660
 the point of contact of the Brigadier with the 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.090
 pan bottom has to be the largest 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.040
 possible if it is a 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.680
 besides taking longer to cook 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.930
 it will also take time to cool the steel 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.910
 stainless steel is an excellent conductor of heat 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.640
 so it is so suitable for the pots 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.890
 but also withstands a thermal shock and 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.310
 cold will not make this recipe with 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.740
 a glass pan is a dot 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.080
 important below will leave the 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.300
 Brigadier pulls the tall fire 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.220
 crystallize the sugar that leaves that 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.480
 layer of sand that has nothing to do 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.850
 with the brigadier, right? 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.440
 It's a joke that did not work then 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.300
 average fire that we are going to cook 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.490
 these ingredients a can of milk 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.040
 condensed the equivalent of two spoons 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.370
 of butter soup and the dissolved cocoa 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.370
 in water 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.100
 if you need the written prescription 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.960
 has a link below the video to the site 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.720
 clique that is where they are 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.730
 published all dry lines and 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.470

 and tries clique we love good 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.370
 gramar also benefits from 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.050
 subscribe to the channel clique on youtube 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.840
 and you always know that people 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.570
 publish a new video and look a lot 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.700
 thing out there you saw that I'm using 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.830
 he is not the one who leaves the 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.200
 creamy brigadier than this 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.390
 story that I like I chose 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.940
 stainless steel frying pan as the car from there 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.010
 Why do not you guys heat up and people? 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.550
 will need to fiddle well for about eight 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.550
 minutes 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.090
 He needs school from the bottom of the pan. 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.890
 but in fact with this technique of 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.050
 cooling what you need 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.990
 check is whether it is in texture that you 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.300
 like because it will change very little not 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.230
 It is like wanting common and when it 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.600
 a skin 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.900
 now you have to put the pan on the 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.900
 ice 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.160
 now instead of was going to use a 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.160
 spatula 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.270
 to speed up the process you have to move b 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.380
 if you start forming a film in the 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.390
 bottom of the pan 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.390
 Take the time to tell the truth. 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.770
 proof in not burn the tongue point 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.770
 look how colorful 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.590
 now comes a sharp little chill 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:10.040
 You know about the flame nix and it's 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.349
 almonds of roasted and ground cocoa is 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.390
 Crunchy a little more of my taste 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:18.459
 perfect complement to this 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.459
 brigadier to harvest what is divine 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.630
 by the way if you like bitter chocolate 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.240
 I'll show you another way to 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.850
 make brigadeiros and already the sky in powder 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.180
 with the same respect with 50 grams of 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:35.419
 chocolate with 70% cocoa and chocolate 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.430
 good quality with 70% cocoa which only 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:41.710
 clear 86 bar 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.710
 People, this whole pot is too good. 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.720
 Before I say goodbye I'll leave the 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.550
