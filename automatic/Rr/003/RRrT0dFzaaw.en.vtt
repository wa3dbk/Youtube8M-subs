 the sherry vinegar a little bit of a 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.810
 It attacks red wine very well the droplets 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.930
 of lemon sweet lemon and we want 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.280
 mix we have put a little bit of 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.170
 you and I at home will be that easy and 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.720
 simple and mango of course because 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.730

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.770
 mango is dropped from the trees is good 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.720

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.460
 have breakfast that to eat it include teas 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.990
 who are going to make vinaigrettes that 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.900
 do good is a is a wonder to me 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.540
 love we are already relieving a little bit 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.430
 and looking at it by aligning applying the 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.370
 vinaigrette to the set of vegetables in 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.680
 another line that we put another capita very 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.450

 another combination of lettuces that we have 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:44.390
 prepared with which I have problem not 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.760
 is a closed recipe is important the 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.830
 joy to apply to add things 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.880
 different as the jlca manden crudités 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:56.540
 or in ditches we do it in 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.340
 salads or better said by a great chef 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.260
 so you can do it at home with 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.970
 everything you have at home is not a 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.790
 closed recipe as he just said 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.230

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.330
 we have ask you can be a speaker 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.500
 ment also came to the vinaigrette can 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.660
 there are people who like a little bit of 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.430
 raw garlic because the feeling it brings 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.620
 there are people who like the term the 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.269
 tender onion stem each 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.370
 You can put what you want if we have 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.680
 fact is because as it consists of three 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.220
 things that is the egypt tomato hold 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.050
 the handle 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.320
 and he has put a little bit of 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.270
 fresh basil plus extra oil 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.560
 Virgin a little bit of vinegar or two 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.560
 combination of two vinegars with some 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.300
 lemon droplets to taste we will add 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.590
