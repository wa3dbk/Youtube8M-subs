00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.299 
opponents i don'ti of the only one thing
that<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.360> see<00:00:42.660> being<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.140> threat<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.710> going<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.160> be

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
that I see being a threat is going to be

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.700 
that I see being a threat is going to be
that<00:00:44.489> gorebyss<00:00:44.969> just<00:00:45.539> because<00:00:45.809> after<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> shell

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
that gorebyss just because after a shell

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.410 
that gorebyss just because after a shell
smash<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.250> could<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.730> pull<00:00:48.000> out<00:00:48.059> through<00:00:48.329> my

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
smash it could just pull out through my

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.209 
smash it could just pull out through my
team<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.200> really<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> watch<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:50.190> for

team so I really have to watch out for
that<00:00:50.370> but<00:00:50.670> from<00:00:50.820> looks<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.210> tangela<00:00:51.660> is

going to be little off the sake tone and

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.480 
going to be little off the sake tone and
I<00:01:07.350> know<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> giga<00:01:07.950> drain<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.280> way<00:01:08.430> too

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.429 
I know that the giga drain is way too
obvious<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.510> what<00:01:09.659> I'm<00:01:09.750> gonna<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:10.260> go

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
obvious so what I'm gonna do is just go

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.899 
obvious so what I'm gonna do is just go
strictly<00:01:10.740> sleep<00:01:11.100> powder<00:01:11.280> as<00:01:11.490> he<00:01:11.610> does<00:01:11.790> bring

strictly sleep powder as he does bring

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.640 
strictly sleep powder as he does bring
in<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.150> scolipede<00:01:12.479> possibly<00:01:13.229> expecting<00:01:13.590> me

Pole past with the hydro pump I still

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.120 
Pole past with the hydro pump I still
have<00:03:30.900> my<00:03:31.019> bravery<00:03:31.319> which<00:03:31.739> I<00:03:31.829> would<00:03:32.010> have

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
have my bravery which I would have

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.410 
have my bravery which I would have

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
brought in on the sleep powder just

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.150 
brought in on the sleep powder just
because<00:03:33.630> my<00:03:33.810> brain<00:03:34.019> theory<00:03:34.290> does<00:03:34.859> have<00:03:35.040> the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
because my brain theory does have the

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
sleep talk so yeah that's where I don't

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.170 
sleep talk so yeah that's where I don't
really<00:03:37.889> think<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.340> Hajj<00:03:38.519> upon<00:03:38.850> miss<00:03:39.000> is

think<00:06:11.490> the<00:06:11.909> mist<00:06:12.149> was<00:06:12.360> entirely

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:12.719 
think the mist was entirely

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:14.809 
think the mist was entirely
game-changing<00:06:13.439> but<00:06:13.620> let's<00:06:13.830> say<00:06:14.039> if<00:06:14.250> he<00:06:14.460> did

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:14.819 
game-changing but let's say if he did

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:16.639 
game-changing but let's say if he did
take<00:06:15.060> me<00:06:15.089> out<00:06:15.300> with<00:06:15.389> the<00:06:15.479> mega<00:06:15.659> horn<00:06:15.960> then<00:06:16.409> he

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:16.649 
take me out with the mega horn then he

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:18.110 
take me out with the mega horn then he
would<00:06:16.889> have<00:06:17.009> potentially<00:06:17.490> swept<00:06:17.819> through<00:06:18.029> my

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
would have potentially swept through my

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.450 
would have potentially swept through my
team<00:06:18.389> but<00:06:19.020> as<00:06:19.169> she<00:06:19.289> saw<00:06:19.469> there<00:06:19.710> I<00:06:19.740> had<00:06:20.099> a<00:06:20.129> chance

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
team but as she saw there I had a chance

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.639 
team but as she saw there I had a chance
to<00:06:20.699> live<00:06:20.909> so<00:06:21.509> you<00:06:21.569> guys<00:06:21.810> can<00:06:22.050> be<00:06:22.199> the<00:06:22.349> deciding

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:22.649 
to live so you guys can be the deciding
