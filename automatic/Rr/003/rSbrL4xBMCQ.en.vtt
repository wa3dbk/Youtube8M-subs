00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.070
 We're starting this honor already. 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.830
 my now well today Tuesday a quickie 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.980
 as I had previously posted 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:20.310
 on facebook express channel will bring 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.740
 it's a bit of the shaft I went through because 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.199
 cool nice things that go there 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.090
 knows how to stop and already makes a 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.760
 news that I can give you already 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.030
 It's been a couple of days, but it's only 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.890
 I 'm just going to leave the situation of the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.890
 woman talking only got better 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.149
 now then all it soon became clear that 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.430
 here at the front I think it is 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.829
 important because it was even 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.020
 the promise he had made for all the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.600
 people accompanying the channel that is 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:55.410
 there always trying to give information about 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:57.629
 the glass art is causal south or blazers 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.760
 other better where these 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.129
 I can currently be remembering new 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.739
 but surely I will remember as soon as 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.640
 arrived news about him and arrived 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.680
 the art time and do not stay there but we are 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.990
 one thing servers done in knowing if 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.340
 you can play right 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.820
 I'm talking about the art in American then 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.400
 attracts the word finally gave a 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.409
 full American air situation that much 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.689
 people were even thinking it was going to be 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.770
 launched this year due to the fact that 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:35.189
 usually get finished over it 's 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:39.869
 mentioned then orth and of the tray world already 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.420
 started his alpha fred week what 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.619
 means that means testing 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.799
 closed between friends and family of 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.899
 troy galley word ie people who 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.360
 are closer they can access 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.420
 the game to test the first 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:02.520
 parties having to have our reports 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:07.009
 are that the customer is already 80% in laws 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.750
 a lot of things still need trans is trans 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.590
 I'm thinking translation convention 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.019
 brings more the translation of then one was given 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.400
 more or less so if the skonto 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:23.819
 rafa who posted this on mr pg.com 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.390
 So I think it 's a guy there. 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.790
 name already if that french emilie of life 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.060
 with the galera to world is testing the 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.599
 game also then Mr. scott 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.790
 Hoffmann said that it is a large part of 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.299
 that he really plans to team one 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.170
 point is the boss can for the launch 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:49.079
 send cheche in English plata and others 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.959
 definitely this is and estimates if more 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:56.720
 less than six months from now. 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:03:00.329
 official launch of the art and that is it 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.480
 enough time is half a year still has to be 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.459
 launched there by August or November of 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.380
 2014 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.900
 But I believe it's going to be just that. 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.780
 even some people think of the date 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.819
 What he said could be July or 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.810
 July August but I believe but 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:21.900
 November or December or maybe even open 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.290
 beta of life are only January of 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.810
 2015 maybe maybe we can stop 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.920
 goals did not know from December if everything 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.040
 occur well 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.910
 usually achieves that it is a very 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.489
 large and there can be giving as 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.310
 well you know full well that 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.780
 things tend to give zica stronger already 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.109
 is with your people 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.470
 many other languages ​​as well. 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:52.290
 running nice maybe this helps this 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.329
 Group d maturity is coming back already 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.700
 in different countries the panel and 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.099
 origin may well have given maturity 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.780
 interesting with the client to send 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.200
 30 t beautiful 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.819
 open beta and in August between August and 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.819
 December 2014 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.590
 another thing that is also being 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.260
 discussed is already being compared. 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.579
 good time for the publication model of the 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.230
 article 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.590
 it seems that the missions 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.900
 suspicions were correct I do not think 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.100
 the archer will be feature player by 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.900
 Spanish years 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.970
 many people can find this medium 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.220
 Complicated I personally found that 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.880
 would be perfect the archer comes as knocks 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.180
 play equal to youtube borges 2 only 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.070
 with fantasies and things that did not 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.210
 no type of status within the game of 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:48.270
 cash service is venite even more 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:52.940
 it seems that with this junction of the 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:57.090
 worldspan excel games made the 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:05:00.180
 the company itself to modify the 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.300
 cash system an easy play system 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.610
 do not hit it and many are 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.900
 commenting that with very similar when 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:15.300
 ift that is the game of lyon that was said 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:18.630
 what xl games and world walked 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.210
 talking to each other and the 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:25.500
 article staff very likes the way 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.930
 with which it attracted 11 transformed the shift into 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.080
 an ugly game to play and it looks like they are 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.810
 want to copy the cash store since it already 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.240
 are partners in the same way to make a 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.400
 copy of a system that is already 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.620
 Just so you can not make it up. 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.570
 ending up giving up can be a good 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.820
 idea 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.500
 definitely I think the full of 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.060
 free to play would be a mess too 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:53.610
 big r prefers it beats the play off to 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.170
 play us I do not think I do not think 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.060
 give a fair margin of players 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.740
 high because it actually blows 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.350
 sandboxing you need a brand of 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.180
 High players maybe a low play 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.430
 would be more interesting than the futile 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.680
 play because I've been play what scares me 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.920
 in fit play is that the store closes sometimes 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.710
 can be very appealing not only 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.510
 Of course you have no interest, yes, pardon. 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.180
 but there's always a guy way 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.850
 to be able to do something very 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.010
 heavy of the game just buy no more 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:26.169
 well ahead because it's kind of dangerous maggi 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:30.639
 There's a damn light there to put 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:33.099
 that a point of departure connects you to this 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.409
 of this theory, but let's see how it is 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:37.990
 that will stand the situation the initiative 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:40.180
 will come ask play play play or free to 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.550
 play for you who does not know that play 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.490
 Pleasure to play under pre purchase 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:48.189
 to play and the fish influences to stay 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.990
 to pay for a month to play 

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:51.999
 so let's see how it will get there 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:54.669
 in the end who will beat the 

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:56.830
 final verdict really oil world 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:59.020
 because the article has so many 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.599
 servers that worked with both 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.810
 Both fish and play methods in Japan 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:06.779
 how much fixed color play is then there 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.460
 Do not know very well how it is that it is not 

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:13.629
 haskoning then there is an update with 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:17.710
 your alfa test friends in berlin 

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:21.039
 already started giving there then the six months 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:23.499
 estimate created by the trojan look at 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:27.759
 be officially released 

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:30.219
 So we can play hands for sure. 

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:33.969
 a lot of people are there a lot but a lot 

00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:37.389
 anxious're get their hands of these sandbox 

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:40.389
 It's better than talking rpg that you can be 

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:43.000
 do lots of things, whatever you want 

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:45.550
 this day pirates day you can 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.710
 and I think even there that 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.990
 does not exist but you will be able to 

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:52.300
 name of your life as a hat band 

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:54.819
 straw and then put the son because 

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:58.330
 fish in the name that will be 

00:07:54.819 --> 00:08:01.180
 If you put hilda name and well this is 

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:03.460
 A quickie I'm going to go on this I hope 

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:06.659
 that you liked it lessa new 

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.659
 said I went
