to say you can be the next camera failed
given<00:04:29.930> five<00:04:30.110> years<00:04:30.380> could<00:04:30.950> be<00:04:31.040> an<00:04:31.130> Xterra<00:04:31.430> fail

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
given five years could be an Xterra fail

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.640 
given five years could be an Xterra fail
it's<00:04:32.030> that<00:04:32.150> type<00:04:32.360> of<00:04:32.390> quality<00:04:32.900> you<00:04:33.140> know

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
it's that type of quality you know

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.020 
it's that type of quality you know
attack<00:04:34.520> and<00:04:34.700> fall<00:04:35.480> back<00:04:35.660> so<00:04:36.010> I<00:04:37.030> definitely

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
attack and fall back so I definitely

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.460 
attack and fall back so I definitely
think<00:04:38.330> silent<00:04:38.690> it<00:04:38.750> would<00:04:38.870> be<00:04:38.990> quality<00:04:39.230> because

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
think silent it would be quality because

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.300 
think silent it would be quality because
then<00:04:39.590> you've<00:04:39.680> got<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:39.890> experience<00:04:40.250> that

talent of Luke Shaw progresses a

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.610 
talent of Luke Shaw progresses a
footballer<00:05:02.090> progresses<00:05:03.050> a<00:05:03.080> person<00:05:03.500> and

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
footballer progresses a person and

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.400 
footballer progresses a person and
hopefully<00:05:03.740> become<00:05:04.460> a<00:05:05.170> stalwart<00:05:06.170> for

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
hopefully become a stalwart for

hopefully become a stalwart for
Manchester<00:05:06.800> right<00:05:06.920> so<00:05:07.900> those<00:05:08.900> but<00:05:09.260> basically

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
Manchester right so those but basically

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
Manchester right so those but basically
those<00:05:09.860> are<00:05:09.920> the<00:05:10.070> players<00:05:10.280> on<00:05:10.430> the<00:05:10.490> side<00:05:10.670> I

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
those are the players on the side I

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.640 
those are the players on the side I
think<00:05:10.820> the<00:05:10.970> key<00:05:11.480> arragement<00:05:11.990> we<00:05:12.080> need<00:05:12.230> as<00:05:12.350> a

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
think the key arragement we need as a

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.200 
think the key arragement we need as a
Senate<00:05:13.010> back<00:05:13.130> maybe<00:05:13.310> even<00:05:13.610> two<00:05:13.820> because

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
Senate back maybe even two because

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.610 
Senate back maybe even two because
there's<00:05:14.390> girls<00:05:14.570> we've<00:05:14.750> lost<00:05:14.870> birdie<00:05:15.200> and<00:05:15.410> and

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
there's girls we've lost birdie and and

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.710 
there's girls we've lost birdie and and
village<00:05:16.310> so<00:05:16.820> we<00:05:16.940> up<00:05:17.090> will<00:05:17.120> probably<00:05:17.480> do<00:05:17.570> need

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
village so we up will probably do need

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.710 
village so we up will probably do need
to<00:05:17.930> Senate<00:05:18.290> backs<00:05:18.470> and<00:05:19.430> then<00:05:19.610> left<00:05:19.820> back<00:05:20.090> would

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
to Senate backs and then left back would

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.470 
to Senate backs and then left back would
be<00:05:20.840> great<00:05:21.080> sure<00:05:21.470> someone<00:05:22.430> like<00:05:22.520> that<00:05:22.580> if<00:05:23.270> not

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
be great sure someone like that if not

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.000 
be great sure someone like that if not
sure<00:05:23.690> there<00:05:23.870> may<00:05:23.930> be<00:05:23.990> like<00:05:24.140> Fabio<00:05:24.500> Cointreau

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
other lay right back think roughly ours

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.230 
other lay right back think roughly ours
is<00:05:30.230> quality<00:05:30.680> no<00:05:31.340> need<00:05:31.520> to<00:05:31.640> really<00:05:31.910> and<00:05:32.120> worry

night<00:07:02.360> at<00:07:02.479> this<00:07:02.569> season

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.470 
night at this season

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.320 
night at this season
if<00:07:03.740> this<00:07:03.889> season<00:07:04.159> is<00:07:04.220> anything<00:07:04.490> to<00:07:04.610> go<00:07:04.639> by<00:07:04.729> so<00:07:05.120> I

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
if this season is anything to go by so I

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.270 
if this season is anything to go by so I
think<00:07:05.870> we<00:07:06.199> with<00:07:06.440> where<00:07:06.710> three<00:07:06.949> or<00:07:07.069> four

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 
think we with where three or four

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.980 
think we with where three or four
world-class<00:07:07.789> islands<00:07:08.300> away<00:07:08.539> from<00:07:08.780> being

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990 
world-class islands away from being

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.659 
world-class islands away from being
right<00:07:09.199> up<00:07:09.349> there<00:07:09.620> in<00:07:09.830> terms<00:07:10.190> of<00:07:10.340> having<00:07:10.520> a

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:10.669 
right up there in terms of having a

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:12.370 
right up there in terms of having a
really<00:07:11.090> really<00:07:11.419> strong<00:07:11.630> eleven<00:07:11.990> just<00:07:12.169> as<00:07:12.289> good

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
really really strong eleven just as good

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.830 
really really strong eleven just as good
as<00:07:12.470> anybody<00:07:12.680> else's<00:07:13.130> but<00:07:14.120> also<00:07:14.360> we<00:07:14.690> need<00:07:14.780> a

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 
as anybody else's but also we need a

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.969 
as anybody else's but also we need a
couple<00:07:15.080> of<00:07:15.169> squad<00:07:15.380> players<00:07:15.590> as<00:07:15.680> well<00:07:15.740> just

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.300 
just to strengthen that I'll probably

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.820
