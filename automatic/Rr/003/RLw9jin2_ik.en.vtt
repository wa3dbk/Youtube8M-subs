00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.920
 there are very good I'm chrono c's and we're 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.170
 in another star band video 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.299
 this time the video is something more cheerful than 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.120
 the previous ones since we have a 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.309
 pretty good news to say as the 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.500
 title says the beta is very close already 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.660
 of our hands and here in this video 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.460
 Well, you can know how the beta will come out 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.150
 and to who jumps in three stages 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.550
 main good in stage 1 moves 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.430
 at a dizzying speed they will have 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.129
 fail-full scenarios and many 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.170
 features will be disabled on 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.109
 game can get updated 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.050
 even several times a day therefore 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:43.359
 it is something for the most impatient if 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.210
 you decide to participate in the first stage 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:48.730
 then you should keep in mind any type 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.620
 of error so do not take much love to 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.420
 your character or universe because in the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.089
 first stage there will be many changes 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.600
 which could erase all for 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:01.030
 have then and start from scratch but do not 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.370
 worry about it because this set 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.980
 let's say it comes with a lot 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.560
 new content 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.350
 and the performance may be somewhat poor in 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.650
 old computers since the engine does not 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.730
 is optimized at all in the first 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.010
 stage 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.440
 in short you will have opportunities to see 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.300
 many experimental contents and 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.770
 You can report reports that will be 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.649
 crucial for the later ellis 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.350
 stage 2 will largely contain 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.420
 full features it is possible that 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.939
 you find some weird faults that 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.369
 produce the closing of the game but that to 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.549
 there will be less risk that your 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.159
 world character is deleted but there are some 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.439
 small possibility of it the argument 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.509
 of the main line of missions not 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.250
 will still be implemented but the 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.700
 experience is in box you can 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.679
 enjoy almost all of them 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.439
 sectors of the galaxy will be 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.810
 available including sectors of 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.239
 end of the game much of the 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.789
 attention of this stage will be subject to 

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:07.880
 error correction optimization and 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.489
 balance in summary this stage is for 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.920
 those who want to enjoy a 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.470
 more optimized version with fewer failures 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.870
 but they also want to help the team 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.140
 send the game's faults 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.470
 Stage 3 is a great preparation for 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.810
 the final version called 1.0 and this 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.000
 means that they will be preparing for 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.730
 finish the main story and the 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.909
 missions and the content that will be added 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.819
 in the beta post when this is finished 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:40.310
 stage star band will be ready and the 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.549
 game finished with very few failures 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.040
 let's hope but the best part is that 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.019
 they intend to continue adding 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.959
 new content after the launch 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.930
 end of the game for a year or even 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.170
 much more so updates and 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.030
 new content finally the beta 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.049
 as I said is check and the game what 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.269
 we will have this year 2013 and with him 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:08.780
 we are the worst case then in the three 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:13.040
 2014 videos although they have promised 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:17.349
 well for this year so that's it and 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.349
 see you in another video bye bye
