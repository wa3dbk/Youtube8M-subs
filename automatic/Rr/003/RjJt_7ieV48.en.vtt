this lid or this door flips down and if

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.280 
this lid or this door flips down and if
telescopes<00:01:47.800> out<00:01:48.330> so<00:01:49.330> that<00:01:49.720> it<00:01:49.870> will<00:01:50.020> catch

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
telescopes out so that it will catch

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.290 
telescopes out so that it will catch
your<00:01:50.650> project<00:01:51.220> which<00:01:51.610> is<00:01:51.760> a<00:01:51.790> nice<00:01:52.030> big

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
this also telescopes up to accommodate

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.940 
this also telescopes up to accommodate
the<00:02:04.240> different<00:02:04.450> sizes<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:04.990> paper<00:02:05.320> that<00:02:05.770> you

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950

Oh before I forget though let's look

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.540 
Oh before I forget though let's look
underneath<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.360> hood<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.830> can<00:02:40.980> see<00:02:41.190> here

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
underneath the hood and you can see here

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.280 
underneath the hood and you can see here
this<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:41.819> where<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.180> printing<00:02:42.510> magic<00:02:42.840> happens

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
this is where the printing magic happens

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.210 
this is where the printing magic happens
including<00:02:43.940> where<00:02:44.940> all<00:02:45.209> of<00:02:45.660> your<00:02:46.220> ink

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
including where all of your ink

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.750 
including where all of your ink
cartridges<00:02:47.629> get<00:02:48.629> loaded<00:02:49.110> in<00:02:49.379> so<00:02:50.129> I<00:02:50.430> found<00:02:50.670> it

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
cartridges get loaded in so I found it

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.370 
cartridges get loaded in so I found it
really<00:02:50.849> easy<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.269> load<00:02:51.599> them<00:02:51.750> in<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:52.049> was<00:02:52.200> not

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
really easy to load them in that was not

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.170 
really easy to load them in that was not
worried<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.040> it's<00:02:53.190> color-coordinated<00:02:54.060> so

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
worried and it's color-coordinated so

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.720 
worried and it's color-coordinated so
you<00:02:54.269> really<00:02:54.480> can't<00:02:54.720> mess<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.080> up<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:56.250> you

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
you really can't mess it up and you

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.490 
you really can't mess it up and you
should<00:02:56.940> be<00:02:57.030> aware<00:02:57.150> that<00:02:57.480> yes<00:02:57.720> each<00:02:58.019> cartridge

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
should be aware that yes each cartridge

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.400 
should be aware that yes each cartridge
is<00:02:58.970> different<00:02:59.970> an<00:03:00.180> individual<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:01.079> that<00:03:01.110> if

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
is different an individual so that if

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.830 
is different an individual so that if
you<00:03:01.560> run<00:03:01.769> low<00:03:01.920> on<00:03:01.950> one<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:03.209> will<00:03:03.360> only<00:03:03.540> have<00:03:03.780> to

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.300 
photos and again pretty and glossy now I
was<00:05:23.820> able<00:05:23.970> to<00:05:24.120> talk<00:05:24.330> over<00:05:24.570> that<00:05:24.840> and<00:05:25.230> it<00:05:26.220> was

and not have a problem and you can see

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.960 
and not have a problem and you can see
that<00:05:32.610> really<00:05:33.090> pretty<00:05:33.710> glossy<00:05:34.710> photo<00:05:35.130> now<00:05:35.820> they

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
that really pretty glossy photo now they

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.670 
that really pretty glossy photo now they
suggest<00:05:36.360> that<00:05:36.420> you<00:05:36.600> just<00:05:36.780> let<00:05:36.930> this<00:05:37.080> sit<00:05:37.380> and
