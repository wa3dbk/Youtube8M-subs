00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.570
 It seems like you know someone who is a day fan of this job. 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.810
 lack is the lack of agreement with a prestigious T-shirt 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.599
 so always 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.719
 fan of movies so does the same thing over 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.260
 have many people participate if you determine the month 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.120
 what he is doing with small resources still 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.790
 we are reproducing filming these productions the past china was little 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.660
 work of this total the movie 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.570
 Although this afternoon for you and shut up today we'll know a little bit 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.850
 more about the movies fans 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.699
 as the name already says carol 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.969
 are fan made movies 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.739
 films but which are eventually produced 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.240
 based on themes from comic books and even TV series 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.400
 and the local team 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.250
 the solar milan of Munich and the analysis of systems and also directors of 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.730
 Traffic 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.460
 How long have you behave as a director? 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.080
 we started in the first projects six years ago was our first 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.560
 cold spot 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.950
 as the name says, it's a fan-made movie 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.720
 in our case it's a movie made 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.870
 fans to list the 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.680
 within the modern tv series the stars 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.680
 here in brazil is not very widespread this more 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.270
 has been published is a normal practice for them to act by impediments score too 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.770
 he has many Brazilians in this movement in this new phase of 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.240
 yes intervention 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.370
 we already have 

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:14.470
 enough staff that was going to fail television is a fan of serials in 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.659
 comic books 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.920
 but mostly track hours in this order whatever hit the case 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:27.239
 the thing is getting ugly now about the home folks having a thousand notion 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.769
 It took six years to be ready. 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.769
 an hour an hour and a half of work and 40 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.459
 I do not know the weekend 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.919
 good 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.319
 see also explained that everything started 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.609
 hello we choose who the movie was 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.459
 who inherited a story based on a book that is brought to power in a 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.289
 panel is not george lucas plus he's inside that quick team works with 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:55.889
 making it an expanded universe of this store 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.739
 and then we decide to do 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.420
 It's really a studio here. 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.939
 the fanapi that in a month 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:07.409
 who they can make you was all done in stop motion is that they are the dolls 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:11.419
 recorded so they change position 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:15.130
 and from there they are filmed with a photograph as a photograph 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.890
 stood up on the film doll a little 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.409
 get up a little longer 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.710
 on a table a little the sense if making a scene in which 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.030
 5 seconds takes as long as more or less depending on the scene if it has 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.209
 very detail 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.589
 then it can take five seconds for it to take up to two hours just for us 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:36.979
 is to make an arm movement for example that you involve naked involved 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.979
 background involves many things 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.759
 I think we're going to need all of them. 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:46.649
 - we started in 2000 in the city in the last 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:47.879
 almost anything 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.769
 any proposal was to do what is the best film possible 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.979
 what sets a fan short duke movie 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.029
 It's what sets a fan out of a non-for-profit movie 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.629
 for copyright reasons 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:07.290
 it's the characters we can not make a profit so we can not have any 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.109
 way to make money from it is all trademark patents then 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.969
 is different from a production 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:17.969
 depending on the case 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.819
 it will be a good 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:25.279
 have you thought 

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:26.379
 Yes sir 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:29.919
 a fan skill and has more or less how long nilton 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.690
 Let's go with movies in general. 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.650
 lasted more than ten minutes 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.610
 twelve minutes at most ours has a differential because as we want 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.379
 from the beginning do 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.350
 with a whole book story 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.250
 so is the first sip so far the only and feature-length animation 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.210
 that is far from the world is one hour and 40 minutes long by our 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.210
 statistics we are already with more than 5 thousand downloads 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.849
 on websites that this in more than 35 countries 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:01.490
 united states is the champion right because they really love this store can we 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.379
 leave the busy while you go 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:05.690
 this secrecy 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.970
 made the accounts of the state of the margin of error I already got a contact with a 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.089
 lucas and neymar lucas arts 

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:15.259
 and she said she could go wrong 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:19.020
 We'll talk, I'll give her a DVD and we'll see what the doors with 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.020
 Sabrina 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.720
 and I'm thank you 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.810
 It is a success for you that the Lucas diary in effect 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.710
 good and very good seminar 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.080
 and congratulations congratulated the success of the typing because after all 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.289
 to face six years beyond fine battle 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:39.750
 and simply 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:40.960
 for love of art 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.129
 one of them 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.129
 linked to the succession of JosÃ© Serra 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.400
 which makes me think that tomorrow 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.710
 it's really over 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.249
 was surrounded by work
