 A little to introduce because the number of recent It's a little example Ttomegane have been a little more 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.090
 I thought it would be like 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:41.420
 I think I would like to see the glasses video 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.800
 Well the way that is over now 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.470
 From the early days of my youtube 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:56.200
 Not match the line to do this is to say around the time of that initial 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:56.200
 I've been using that since that time I was supposed to be doing this sideways 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.520
 Hey I now Well where the guy 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.800
 After making this glasses and making and handling 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:11.640
 Oh, it's a bit heavy. 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.440
 There is a place like a hole metal of that place 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.800
 8 in this 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.470
 Oh dear 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:23.660
 I also have to put 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:26.170
 Then its up was made in conjunction with this aside Well it I'm already a full 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.170
 Is fine 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:34.620
 Well Iå°‚the case for a place to say jins 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:39.970
 It was glasses, but recently zoff has more me 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:46.390
 This is to understand you or I color it a little Well 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:52.180
 There is nothing in the previous glasses but there is no color on the lens, but a little 8 yellow 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:56.350
 Because it is often also say that you have got to put go Well fine in its overseas 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:59.050
 Further to Sarah himself or even by all 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.830
 Well I think this is after the forties 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:07.810
 Not really Spain 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:14.800
 It is still skewered be or not those so and walk often be operated 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:19.040
 Aspect is is location to when little is strong sunlight even in the Well of course the summer of Japan fairly strong in 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.900
 There is also a moment when there is also, I will put a little now 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.930
 3 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.930
 In in like this and you'll look at the Toka Well Horizontal 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:34.810
 Whole have become high-greenish 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.700
 Lens Moe Yeah like this when compared to the time of this jins 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:44.269
 I wonder a little after all keel 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:46.770
 And I like to amazing it lightly around here around here is at all even if the Byonbyon seconds published 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:50.050
 I say it's not jealous 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:56.069
 It is a point that durability is also excellent 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:58.450
 In was made to then Well is it is the bait glasses for this pc 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.870
 Publish it on youtube 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:05.040
 I think I do 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:08.220
 I only Tsu was a video that certainly was a little taken before from 3 years 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.510
 In winter , this is also basic 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.850
 When I'm in front of a computer, I always use this 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.800
 I guess this is too light for listening 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.760
 A little more than the previous eight girls 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.620
 I wonder if it will be 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:32.950
 It seems that the color of the lens is included, but this is the cut rate of the blue light I 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:35.950
 Where I made it bigger and after all it got darker too 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:40.250
 So great this is also light 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:45.240
 This I'm Pyong Kyanpi is ant corona want you to do 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:50.580
 That's why not 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:52.950
 I think I understand that people who have poor eyesight are wearing glasses, but I understand that 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:58.200
 That ban is quite amazing 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:03.410
 Inevitably this lens becomes thicker because sometimes I mean Tsu With both 0.1 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:09.140
 It is this flower to say what happens if you do so 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:10.010
 It is heavy if this part is pressed very much or is pushed by antigravity 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.440
 For 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.000
 If you do so, it 's also a male hero 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.750
 Hmm 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.440
 Zushi 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:24.090
 In the end it's a stiff shoulder, so I'm going to go to such places too 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.820
 I suppose 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.419
 The fact that I're in the very important is first really good sleep mail environment 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.660
 When 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:39.350
 There is a lot of work sitting in a chair after that, but there is always a little bit 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.129
 Hey there in the liquid immediately 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:48.559
 It seems like you won't get tired even if you sit for a long time 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:50.059
 That's right also to Tteyuu the because it chose Tai Demi and I thought that Well age also age 

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:54.470
 But that 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:05:00.590
 Also Well from this place called I wonder if it becomes even presbyopia 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:05.840
 Thinking while wintering at a place called the glasses Yeah a little more self-investment 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:09.420
 I'm the real is a This was made not you in this time now are making doing this 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.470
 So this is how I got it 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.420
 Wintering 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.800
 Here and it is a same 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:20.120
 this 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.169
 A little yellow yellow is in the lens but I do not know much anymore 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.840
 I think 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:29.240
 It might have gone wrong just maybe Well I asked something to that if it 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.900
 I do n't know what it is 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:36.060
 I guess this 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:39.479
 Is I'm red in which you can see the turn white begs the package 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:45.300
 In this around it is going to become like a red beam Pekko 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:50.920
 It will come red and it will write when it sees from the front 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.440
 After all, this red turns to my mother on this face 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:57.070
 I will 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:06:00.870
 I think that the face is a bit a little because I think it will be organized and reflected 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:05.490
 It looks like there is an effect that it looks like going bright 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:11.250
 If you think you hanging if that calculation to say the office of the erased Takashi of time 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:12.070
 Shingo Lee said that this is better than here , so maybe yes 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.420
 I wonder if 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.420
 How is it? 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:28.980
 So yourself where I know is pretty array I talk of that glasses now 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:35.190
 It has really put that shepherd care to say either use or to go gold spending money 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:39.300
 If I do not get a good night's sleep, it will affect my work and relationships . 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:40.940
 Various places Well it work if Kowase the waist sitting in a chair 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:45.770
 My eyes are the same 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:50.060
 So when choosing something, my case goes to 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:56.449
 A person who supports me around me or a client 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:07:00.530
 Their own because it is so choose to say makes what is thought to be of various friends 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:02.900
 Nowadays Tteyuu is kana has become less without the other as far as to say I choose from want 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.950
 I'm spending it 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:08.360
 To the fact that 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:13.200
 When the glasses of Zotsu says the recommended 4 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:16.010
 It was Kameoka signal room Thank you very much, I received a look to the last 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.010
 A little
