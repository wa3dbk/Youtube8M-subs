00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
get your measuring device I would

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.279 
get your measuring device I would
recommend<00:00:55.850> using<00:00:55.969> a<00:00:56.149> ruler<00:00:56.570> I<00:00:56.780> didn't<00:00:57.140> have

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
recommend using a ruler I didn't have

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.080 
recommend using a ruler I didn't have
one<00:00:57.620> I<00:00:57.649> couldn't<00:00:57.980> find<00:00:58.129> mine<00:00:58.340> so<00:00:58.460> I<00:00:58.519> used<00:00:58.850> a

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
one I couldn't find mine so I used a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.619 
one I couldn't find mine so I used a
human<00:00:59.469> measuring<00:01:00.469> tape<00:01:00.829> whatever<00:01:01.399> um<00:01:01.760> but<00:01:02.510> it

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
human measuring tape whatever um but it

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:03.099 
human measuring tape whatever um but it
worked

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
worked

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:04.479 
worked
you're<00:01:03.230> just<00:01:03.379> going<00:01:03.590> to<00:01:03.710> figure<00:01:03.890> out<00:01:04.160> what

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
you're just going to figure out what

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.000 
you're just going to figure out what
kind<00:01:04.670> of<00:01:04.699> triangles<00:01:05.150> you<00:01:05.300> want<00:01:05.540> I<00:01:05.810> went<00:01:06.440> for<00:01:06.770> an

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
kind of triangles you want I went for an

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.710 
kind of triangles you want I went for an
equilateral<00:01:07.490> but<00:01:07.910> it<00:01:08.000> ended<00:01:08.240> up<00:01:08.360> being<00:01:08.420> kind

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
equilateral but it ended up being kind

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.690 
equilateral but it ended up being kind
of<00:01:08.840> isosceles<00:01:09.260> I<00:01:09.680> was<00:01:09.800> trying<00:01:10.010> to<00:01:10.040> do<00:01:10.190> two

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
of isosceles I was trying to do two

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.370 
of isosceles I was trying to do two
inches<00:01:10.940> by<00:01:11.090> two<00:01:11.150> inches<00:01:11.240> by<00:01:11.570> two<00:01:11.630> inches<00:01:11.780> it

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
inches by two inches by two inches it

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.649 
inches by two inches by two inches it
ended<00:01:13.070> up<00:01:13.159> being<00:01:13.400> kind<00:01:13.490> of<00:01:13.790> longer<00:01:14.210> on<00:01:14.390> these

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
ended up being kind of longer on these

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.300 
ended up being kind of longer on these
sides<00:01:14.900> rather<00:01:15.080> than<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.350> base<00:01:15.530> but<00:01:15.799> as<00:01:16.009> long

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
sides rather than the base but as long

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.429 
sides rather than the base but as long
as<00:01:16.340> you<00:01:16.759> get<00:01:17.150> your<00:01:17.270> first<00:01:17.450> triangle<00:01:17.990> right<00:01:18.200> all

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
as you get your first triangle right all

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.080 
as you get your first triangle right all
the<00:01:18.740> rest<00:01:18.950> will<00:01:19.189> fit<00:01:19.430> with<00:01:19.610> it<00:01:19.759> because<00:01:20.000> you're

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
the rest will fit with it because you're

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.980 
the rest will fit with it because you're
going<00:01:20.180> to<00:01:20.240> use<00:01:20.360> your<00:01:20.479> first<00:01:20.689> one<00:01:20.840> as<00:01:20.930> a

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
going to use your first one as a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.510 
going to use your first one as a
template<00:01:21.350> that's<00:01:21.619> why<00:01:21.830> I<00:01:21.860> would<00:01:22.040> recommend<00:01:22.130> if

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
template that's why I would recommend if

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.620 
template that's why I would recommend if
you're<00:01:22.610> using<00:01:22.759> like<00:01:22.880> a<00:01:23.030> magazine<00:01:23.299> or

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
you're using like a magazine or

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.230 
you're using like a magazine or
something<00:01:23.900> cut<00:01:24.500> it<00:01:24.619> out<00:01:24.829> of<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.610> front<00:01:26.000> page

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
something cut it out of the front page

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.969 
something cut it out of the front page
or<00:01:26.659> back<00:01:26.840> page<00:01:27.140> just<00:01:27.470> something<00:01:27.799> that's<00:01:27.950> a

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
or back page just something that's a

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.800 
or back page just something that's a
little<00:01:28.100> bit<00:01:28.250> more<00:01:28.729> heavy-duty<00:01:29.150> than<00:01:29.659> the

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
little bit more heavy-duty than the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.569 
little bit more heavy-duty than the
inside<00:01:30.170> pages<00:01:30.439> and<00:01:30.860> then<00:01:31.130> once<00:01:31.310> you<00:01:31.430> get<00:01:31.520> that

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
inside pages and then once you get that

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.370 
inside pages and then once you get that
well<00:01:31.880> figure<00:01:32.150> it<00:01:32.240> out<00:01:32.360> just<00:01:32.570> start<00:01:33.020> cutting<00:01:33.259> up

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
well figure it out just start cutting up

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.160 
well figure it out just start cutting up
a<00:01:33.409> bunch<00:01:33.680> of<00:01:33.799> triangles<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:34.670> as<00:01:35.090> you<00:01:35.630> work<00:01:35.930> I

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
a bunch of triangles and as you work I

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.289 
a bunch of triangles and as you work I
would<00:01:36.439> recommend<00:01:36.979> laying<00:01:37.340> them<00:01:37.579> out<00:01:37.820> like<00:01:38.090> as

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
would recommend laying them out like as

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.630 
would recommend laying them out like as
you<00:01:38.420> go<00:01:38.659> also<00:01:39.500> remember<00:01:40.250> you're<00:01:40.369> gonna<00:01:40.490> have

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
you go also remember you're gonna have

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.490 
you go also remember you're gonna have
to<00:01:40.700> cut<00:01:40.880> some<00:01:41.090> triangles<00:01:41.420> in<00:01:41.659> half<00:01:41.930> so<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:42.229> can

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
to cut some triangles in half so you can

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.429 
to cut some triangles in half so you can
fill<00:01:42.770> these<00:01:43.009> little<00:01:43.070> edge<00:01:43.640> bits<00:01:44.270> over<00:01:44.899> here

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
fill these little edge bits over here

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.380 
fill these little edge bits over here
and<00:01:45.619> over<00:01:45.680> here<00:01:46.009> sorry<00:01:46.460> I<00:01:46.549> didn't<00:01:46.880> show<00:01:47.090> myself

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
and over here sorry I didn't show myself

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.749 
and over here sorry I didn't show myself
like<00:01:47.990> putting<00:01:48.380> it<00:01:48.560> together<00:01:48.740> as<00:01:49.130> much<00:01:49.340> but<00:01:49.640> I

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
like putting it together as much but I

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.690 
like putting it together as much but I
was<00:01:49.969> kind<00:01:50.210> of<00:01:50.329> like<00:01:50.689> I<00:01:50.810> said<00:01:51.159> every<00:01:52.159> time<00:01:52.340> I<00:01:52.430> cut

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
was kind of like I said every time I cut

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.069 
was kind of like I said every time I cut
out<00:01:52.790> a<00:01:52.820> triangle<00:01:53.119> I'd<00:01:53.420> put<00:01:53.630> it<00:01:53.719> where<00:01:53.869> it<00:01:53.960> need

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
out a triangle I'd put it where it need

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:54.609 
out a triangle I'd put it where it need
to<00:01:54.110> be

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
to be

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.889 
to be
I<00:01:54.649> wasn't<00:01:55.369> gluing<00:01:55.759> anything<00:01:56.090> down<00:01:56.270> yet<00:01:56.329> by<00:01:56.869> the

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
I wasn't gluing anything down yet by the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.749 
I wasn't gluing anything down yet by the
way<00:01:57.020> you'll<00:01:57.229> need<00:01:57.380> glue<00:01:57.649> or<00:01:57.890> tape<00:01:57.950> doesn't

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
way you'll need glue or tape doesn't

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.090 
way you'll need glue or tape doesn't
matter<00:01:58.880> but<00:01:59.270> yeah<00:01:59.540> so<00:01:59.810> like<00:01:59.990> as<00:02:00.170> I<00:02:00.500> worked<00:02:00.860> I

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
matter but yeah so like as I worked I

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.399 
matter but yeah so like as I worked I
was<00:02:01.280> just<00:02:01.549> setting<00:02:01.729> them<00:02:02.000> down<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:02.899> so<00:02:03.350> you

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
was just setting them down and so you

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:04.810 
was just setting them down and so you
don't<00:02:03.560> really<00:02:03.680> see<00:02:03.890> me<00:02:04.310> like<00:02:04.490> putting<00:02:04.759> it

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
don't really see me like putting it

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.399 
don't really see me like putting it
together<00:02:05.000> but<00:02:05.450> that's<00:02:05.570> okay<00:02:05.899> you<00:02:06.200> get<00:02:06.289> the

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
together but that's okay you get the

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:07.899 
together but that's okay you get the
idea<00:02:06.680> you<00:02:06.829> guys<00:02:06.950> know<00:02:07.159> how<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.369> do<00:02:07.549> this<00:02:07.700> I'm

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
idea you guys know how to do this I'm

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.580 
idea you guys know how to do this I'm
sure<00:02:07.939> and<00:02:08.360> so<00:02:08.660> once<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:09.320> get<00:02:09.410> all<00:02:09.560> your

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
sure and so once you get all your

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.190 
sure and so once you get all your
triangles<00:02:10.220> out<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.759> looking<00:02:11.270> super<00:02:11.900> fresh

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
triangles out and looking super fresh

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.870 
triangles out and looking super fresh
and<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.710> way<00:02:12.830> you<00:02:12.890> like<00:02:13.190> it<00:02:13.220> you're<00:02:13.670> gonna

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
and the way you like it you're gonna

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.240 
and the way you like it you're gonna
take<00:02:14.600> your<00:02:14.690> glue<00:02:14.960> and<00:02:15.200> just<00:02:15.770> go<00:02:15.890> around<00:02:16.130> the

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
take your glue and just go around the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.660 
take your glue and just go around the
edges<00:02:16.400> or<00:02:16.880> just<00:02:17.150> very<00:02:17.390> lightly<00:02:17.750> squiggle<00:02:18.350> it

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
edges or just very lightly squiggle it

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.730 
edges or just very lightly squiggle it
you<00:02:19.060> don't<00:02:19.270> want<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.450> ton<00:02:19.630> of<00:02:19.660> glue<00:02:19.990> because

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
you don't want a ton of glue because

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.350 
you don't want a ton of glue because
it'll<00:02:20.950> bunch<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.370> up<00:02:21.490> really<00:02:21.730> weird<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.180> some

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
it'll bunch it up really weird and some

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.120 
it'll bunch it up really weird and some
of<00:02:22.480> mine<00:02:22.660> did<00:02:22.870> bunch<00:02:23.200> but<00:02:23.470> it's<00:02:23.590> not<00:02:23.709> that<00:02:23.920> bad

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
of mine did bunch but it's not that bad

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.949 
of mine did bunch but it's not that bad
but<00:02:24.430> yeah<00:02:24.730> very<00:02:25.000> lightly<00:02:25.270> put<00:02:25.660> just<00:02:25.840> some

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
but yeah very lightly put just some

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.150 
but yeah very lightly put just some
Elmer's<00:02:26.230> glue<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.650> don't<00:02:26.770> need<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.920> hot<00:02:27.130> glue

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
Elmer's glue you don't need a hot glue

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.970 
Elmer's glue you don't need a hot glue
gun<00:02:27.400> you<00:02:27.940> don't<00:02:28.030> need<00:02:28.209> super<00:02:28.630> glue<00:02:28.870> just<00:02:29.800> glue

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
gun you don't need super glue just glue

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.589 
gun you don't need super glue just glue
will<00:02:30.160> do<00:02:30.280> fine<00:02:30.489> or<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.849> little<00:02:31.180> bit<00:02:31.300> of<00:02:31.390> tape

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
will do fine or a little bit of tape

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.690 
will do fine or a little bit of tape
when<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:31.930> made<00:02:32.349> these<00:02:32.530> tins<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:33.130> few<00:02:33.310> years<00:02:33.489> ago<00:02:33.670> I

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
when I made these tins a few years ago I

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.309 
when I made these tins a few years ago I
actually<00:02:33.910> just<00:02:34.209> taped<00:02:34.510> down<00:02:34.780> magazine

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
actually just taped down magazine

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.410 
actually just taped down magazine
clippings<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.430> lot<00:02:36.670> Podge<00:02:36.910> over<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.360> it

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
clippings and a lot Podge over and it

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.580 
clippings and a lot Podge over and it
worked<00:02:37.569> just<00:02:37.660> fine<00:02:37.870> once<00:02:38.290> you're<00:02:38.440> all<00:02:38.560> done

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
worked just fine once you're all done

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.380 
worked just fine once you're all done
gluing<00:02:39.280> everything<00:02:39.400> where<00:02:39.940> it<00:02:40.030> needs<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.270> be

whatever you're working on get that Mod
Podge<00:02:48.160> out<00:02:48.489> and<00:02:48.849> go<00:02:49.090> crazy<00:02:49.599> you're<00:02:50.140> gonna<00:02:50.260> want

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
Podge out and go crazy you're gonna want

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.210 
Podge out and go crazy you're gonna want
a<00:02:50.790> semi<00:02:51.790> thick<00:02:52.450> layer<00:02:52.780> don't<00:02:53.230> go<00:02:53.650> up<00:02:53.769> it<00:02:53.920> on<00:02:54.040> too

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
a semi thick layer don't go up it on too

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.410 
a semi thick layer don't go up it on too
thick<00:02:54.250> otherwise<00:02:54.580> it'll<00:02:54.940> take<00:02:55.060> forever<00:02:55.209> to

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
thick otherwise it'll take forever to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.360 
thick otherwise it'll take forever to
dry<00:02:55.569> but<00:02:55.900> if<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:56.230> do<00:02:56.319> it<00:02:56.440> too<00:02:56.590> thin<00:02:56.920> it<00:02:57.160> won't

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
dry but if you do it too thin it won't

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.970 
dry but if you do it too thin it won't
be<00:02:57.549> enough<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:58.239> you<00:02:58.420> know<00:02:58.540> make<00:02:58.780> it<00:02:58.810> smooth<00:02:59.530> in

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
be enough to you know make it smooth in

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.000 
be enough to you know make it smooth in
the<00:03:00.010> end<00:03:00.250> and<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:01.030> want<00:03:01.239> it<00:03:01.330> smooth<00:03:01.690> so<00:03:02.230> um<00:03:02.560> go

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
the end and you want it smooth so um go

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.979 
the end and you want it smooth so um go
ahead<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.370> put<00:03:03.549> a<00:03:03.580> layer<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:03.940> that<00:03:04.090> on<00:03:04.360> I<00:03:04.660> only

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
ahead and put a layer of that on I only

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.250 
ahead and put a layer of that on I only
did<00:03:05.620> one<00:03:06.010> coat<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.549> let<00:03:06.880> it<00:03:07.000> dry<00:03:07.299> for<00:03:07.330> I<00:03:08.140> don't

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
did one coat and let it dry for I don't

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.620 
did one coat and let it dry for I don't
