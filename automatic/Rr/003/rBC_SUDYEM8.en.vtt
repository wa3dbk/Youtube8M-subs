00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:10.060
 Hello everyone, continuation with a bicycle 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:13.590
 Series today review of my first bikes 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:19.050
 planetary sleeve model trek elite 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.910
 2007 actually had two 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.550
 bike in this series can 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:29.560
 guess 2 was called bonnie bonnie and 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:32.740
 Clyde such a youth series for a guy 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:38.940
 Bonnie girl was female model in 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.940
 class service male bike too 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:50.590
 a little tune it for him 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.840
 gently saddle on less wide and more 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:58.150
 comfortable in my opinion is a saddle pro 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:04.000
 craft and replaced the steering wheel because I consider 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:09.390
 that the 800 millimeter wide wheel is 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.240
 Is it hard to drive where it costs less 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.270
 more compact steering yes width approximately 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.490
 550 millimeters 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.670
 such an interesting model 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.670
 this is a 7 speed bike 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.770
 planetary sleeve shimano nexus 7 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:41.010
 let's take a closer look like this 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:46.110
 looks at such an interesting frame and 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.280
 the most on the trick of this bike is this 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.830
 here is a unique 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.800
 shock absorber which is no longer 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.730
 I saw no models at all to be honest 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.590
 this is probably the only model of the city 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.130
 Kemerovo 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:06.060
 with such a shock absorber here we work this 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.990
 principle pretty tolerable here that does 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.580
 the trip 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.510
 much softer up than tough up to heaven 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.510
 shock absorbers 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.860
 Well what can you say about the huskies in terms of 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.700
 Tarka but this model I say again 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.090
 about six years 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.190
 This is the first bike I drive on it 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.700
 about two years later he stood by me 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.450
 During that time laid up because of 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.690
 the fact that a serious replacement was required 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:48.110
 component parts here fail to change 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:51.019
 part of the needles had to change it here 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.150
 do a perry special 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:57.180
 the problem was with the circuit but and so on here 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.830
 and there were a lot of problems which 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.239
 I could not solve the history for now 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.250
 as if I had a desire and i 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:07.680
 reinstalled this bike is about what 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:14.299
 absolutely do not regret their machine very 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:18.690
 Interestingly want a sleeve nexus 7 seven 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:20.519
 but in principle the powertrain is enough 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.990
 yes of course the eight best in the plan 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.100
 what 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.530
 more parse speeds and even 8 speeds 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:33.180
 here a little bit missing here first on 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.340
 direct let's say so the average speed on 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.600
 the eight chassis will have 30 kilometers 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.160
 this one will be twenty-six meters 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.080
 about 27 well, it's not a terrible result 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.560
 died while driving in the city he is much 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.470
 softer 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.470
 due to the presence of amortization youth 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:04:05.810
 let's show teddy and front here 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:05.810
 This machine frame 19 inches for me 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.480
 the saddle is also not a saddle and take 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.269
 steering wheel 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.250
 light as the steering wheel steering too firm that is 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.090
 two 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.760
 I bought her a German children's store 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:32.540
 bike brought under the order 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:36.530
 Here is my machine was taken in Moscow 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.620
 online store who in box 1007 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.620
 year 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:05:01.780
 There are certain problems with this 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.400
 bike here, but in particular, that's not very 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.830
 let's say so strong abad in my opinion 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.319
 rear rim 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.810
 can not stand jumping partners 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:13.819
 strong yes and he quickly begins 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.520
 eight has to pull 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:17.470
 twist the needles as said after 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.419
 two years in 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:24.740
 drive in general came to do before the special clothes 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:29.060
 here for an hour worth more reliable spokes 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:33.440
 kripke so I think it will be less 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:39.289
 prone to say so here the problem in 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:41.560
 the whole machine is very interesting yet 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:45.800
 it drives about two months in total 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:49.520
 here then I will tell a little more in detail 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:53.870
 maybe from your impressions 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.930
 it is from this model all the best to 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.930
 meeting
