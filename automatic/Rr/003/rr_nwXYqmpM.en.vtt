00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
this far five years ago I don't think

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.319 
this far five years ago I don't think
I've<00:00:43.829> been<00:00:43.860> even<00:00:44.070> near<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:45.090> know<00:00:45.180> he's<00:00:45.270> a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
I've been even near this you know he's a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.850 
I've been even near this you know he's a
great<00:00:45.480> player<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.559> privilege<00:00:46.829> to

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
great player and it's a privilege to

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.220 
great player and it's a privilege to
ball<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.190> him<00:00:47.420> obviously<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.629> roller<00:00:48.809> ball<00:00:48.960> to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
ball to him obviously a roller ball to

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.630 
ball to him obviously a roller ball to
the<00:00:49.350> other<00:00:49.379> guys<00:00:49.649> into<00:00:49.860> session<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.399> mean

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the other guys into session I mean

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.510 
the other guys into session I mean
that's<00:00:50.879> pretty<00:00:51.120> obvious<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.690> think<00:00:51.989> but

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
that's pretty obvious that I think but

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.590 
that's pretty obvious that I think but
look<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.579> think<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:53.850> put<00:00:54.059> anything<00:00:54.239> Iranian

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
look I think it's put anything Iranian

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.970 
look I think it's put anything Iranian

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
start of today it's pretty about the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.910 
start of today it's pretty about the
rain<00:01:33.570> we<00:01:33.750> couldn't<00:01:33.960> finish<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.229> off<00:01:34.350> today<00:01:34.619> but

rain we couldn't finish it off today but

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.080 
rain we couldn't finish it off today but
you<00:01:35.340> know<00:01:35.369> hopefully<00:01:35.579> we<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:35.909> come<00:01:36.030> back

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
you know hopefully we can come back

you know hopefully we can come back
tomorrow<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.540> do<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.500> pretty<00:01:37.619> quickly

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
tomorrow and do it pretty quickly

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.890 
tomorrow and do it pretty quickly
so<00:01:38.610> obviously<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.270> would<00:01:39.390> as<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.600> said<00:01:39.780> before

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
so obviously you would as I said before

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.660 
so obviously you would as I said before
we'd<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.920> bet<00:01:41.070> again<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.579> we

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
we'd like to not bet again but if we

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.770 
we'd like to not bet again but if we
have<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.850> knock<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> few<00:01:42.090> often<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.570> suppose

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
have to knock a few often I suppose

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.969 
have to knock a few often I suppose
that's<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.020> way<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.229> goes<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.860> know<00:01:43.950> I

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
that's the way it goes but you know I

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.469 
that's the way it goes but you know I
don't<00:01:44.700> know<00:01:44.759> what<00:01:44.850> our<00:01:44.909> leaders<00:01:45.180> mouthing

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
don't know what our leaders mouthing

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.690 
don't know what our leaders mouthing
Fetty<00:01:45.720> odd<00:01:45.840> runs<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.770> hopefully<00:01:47.159> we<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.310> you

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
Fetty odd runs so hopefully we can you

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.889 
Fetty odd runs so hopefully we can you
know<00:01:47.790> get<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.180> next<00:01:48.360> two<00:01:48.420> baguettes<00:01:48.659> for<00:01:48.810> less

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
know get the next two baguettes for less

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.749 
know get the next two baguettes for less
than<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.680> if<00:01:49.770> there<00:01:50.220> were<00:01:50.280> not<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.460> few<00:01:50.549> of

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
than that but if there were not a few of

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.210 
than that but if there were not a few of
them<00:01:50.939> if<00:01:51.060> they're<00:01:51.240> not<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.390> fuel<00:01:51.979> maybe<00:01:52.979> you're

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
them if they're not a fuel maybe you're

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.399 
them if they're not a fuel maybe you're
right<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.610> way<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.060> think<00:01:54.570> maybe<00:01:54.899> India<00:01:55.259> came

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
right in a way I think maybe India came

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.530 
right in a way I think maybe India came
out<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.680> played<00:01:55.799> but<00:01:56.520> better<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:57.119> with<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> bit

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
out and played but better but with a bit

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.800 
out and played but better but with a bit
more<00:01:57.689> intensity<00:01:58.079> off<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> lunch<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.340> know

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
more intensity off the lunch so you know

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.090 
more intensity off the lunch so you know
probably<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.930> double-edged<00:02:01.259> sword<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.590> that

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
probably a double-edged sword that that

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.100 
probably a double-edged sword that that
clan<00:02:02.310> we<00:02:02.430> had<00:02:02.549> earlier<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.180> but<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.750> think<00:02:03.960> that

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
clan we had earlier so but I think that

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.560 
clan we had earlier so but I think that
was<00:02:04.259> just<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:05.490> two<00:02:05.729> very<00:02:06.000> very<00:02:06.149> good<00:02:06.329> players

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
was just the two very very good players

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.320 
was just the two very very good players
but<00:02:06.659> very<00:02:07.049> very<00:02:07.200> well<00:02:07.439> so

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
but very very well so

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.730 
but very very well so
and<00:02:08.420> I<00:02:08.540> thought<00:02:08.720> Dhoni<00:02:08.960> played<00:02:09.260> a<00:02:09.290> very<00:02:09.530> very

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
and I thought Dhoni played a very very

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.500 
and I thought Dhoni played a very very
good<00:02:09.890> knock<00:02:10.070> there<00:02:10.280> he<00:02:10.460> came<00:02:10.910> in<00:02:11.060> he<00:02:11.180> took<00:02:11.330> the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
good knock there he came in he took the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.580 
good knock there he came in he took the
game<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:11.870> our<00:02:12.050> borders

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
game to our borders

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.830 
game to our borders
you<00:02:13.070> took<00:02:13.250> our<00:02:13.370> channels<00:02:13.730> art<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.300> better

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
you took our channels art and better

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.750 
you took our channels art and better
great<00:02:15.050> not<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:15.380> such<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.500> good<00:02:15.710> TSP<00:02:16.460> it's<00:02:16.670> all

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
great not that such a good TSP it's all

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.710 
great not that such a good TSP it's all
about<00:02:16.940> that<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.270> know<00:02:17.360> taking<00:02:17.690> the

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
about that you know taking the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.180 
about that you know taking the
initiative<00:02:17.960> back<00:02:18.230> from<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.680> team<00:02:19.040> in<00:02:19.160> that

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
initiative back from a team in that

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.010
