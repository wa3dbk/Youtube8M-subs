00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
the afternoon yeah this year we've got

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.219 
the afternoon yeah this year we've got
so<00:01:39.210> much<00:01:39.300> bigger<00:01:39.569> than<00:01:39.659> last<00:01:39.960> year<00:01:40.170> we

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
so much bigger than last year we

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.510 
so much bigger than last year we
probably<00:01:40.319> doubled<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.830> size<00:01:41.039> and<00:01:41.340> so

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
probably doubled the size and so

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.160 
probably doubled the size and so
therefore<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:42.060> thought<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.750> would<00:01:42.929> give<00:01:43.080> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
therefore we thought we would give the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.160 
therefore we thought we would give the
