00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:08.950
 it's good to see my relationship with 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:10.960
 with me it's very very good totally 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.559
 we do not understand each other 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.339
 we both respect each other and I am 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.339
 one that you have 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.780
 Y 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.370
 and nothing then 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.790
 and a little bit we talked about the 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.310
 equipment situation of the face but 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:35.600
 in the future, well, it's difficult for me 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:39.890
 I think that until the team does not know 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.640
 and July 1 does not really arrive on 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.720
 draft is important to see what 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.239
 management takes the team what decisions 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.520
 they take and what kind of play can they 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.140
 track down 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.850
 if you can bet on it in the future in 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.519
 present future 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.989
 and then I would enter into that 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:03.250
 situation and what kind of contract would 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.049
 where there are many factors that really 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.930
 now we could not comment either 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:11.150
 it made much more sense 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.820
 and nothing but above all that he 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.760
 no matter what the respect and the 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.880
 thank you for mick that you continue to have 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.290
 there were many options for rumors that 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.540
 could have been transferred but to 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.270
 final I'm sure there would be options 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.719
 that he has declined 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.340
 and he has preferred to keep me here and I 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.320
 I thought that the team would not have 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.159
 obtained many victories this year and has 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.250
 been complicated because I always said 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.549
 that I wanted to end the season here and 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.560
 this is my team and this is my city and 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.310
 so I appreciate it and nothing either 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.310
 we have talked much more 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.240
 good if it happens not to know if it's going to happen 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.990
 it is clear that once it passes then clear 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.990
 what do you have to do to see it from the 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.990
 positive perspective the glass half full 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.880
 and even change the chip you do not have another 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:21.560
 but but until that did not happen 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.840
 I did not want to raise it either 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.170
 very seriously because I did not have 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.170
 a lot of sense 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.020
 direct to the station 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.270
 Well, it's going to be a situation, I think 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.330
 exciting for me I pose it with 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.060
 win and with illusion 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.950
 and well we'll see what happens because 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.160
 me is also a bit of an adventure one 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.160
 unknown 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.900
 but I tell them I do not know if I want 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.030
 want to be in that situation I 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.360
 I can choose a little bit my future and my 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.360
 destination 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.060
 here 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.800
 well nothing very nice very moment a 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.260
 unforgettable moment for me the moment 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.489
 that I will always remember good as 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.730
 there have been many moments I do not want either 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.730
 what 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.590
 maybe that's the last game that 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:27.409
 I played at home but maybe not 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.280
 so mostly grateful he thanked 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:33.049
 the hobby that has supported me during 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.620
 are the good times but also 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.720
 when the team has not complied 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.170
 expectations or have we had for 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.170
 Seasons 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.720
 well I think the coach is a 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.780
 important factor 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.550
 I do not know what will happen either because I do not know 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.530
 Which direction does the team want to take? 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.370
 If you want to maintain the philosophy of these 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.850
 last two years I do not know then but 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.310
 yes that is a factor that I will consider 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.620
 facing my decision or whether it's here or 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.540
 with another team that is interested in 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.200
 I always have to know who trains 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.680
 what philosophy does it have and how does it adapt to 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.680
 your game 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.510
 well I would like that 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.940
 Well, they had a team in which 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.000
 with me we could take a leap from 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.590
 important quality and be able to fight for 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.770
 championship that would be something that to me 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.680
 would attract a lot and good beyond the 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.430
 economic amount also the number of 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.410
 years is also not an important factor 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:01.070
 to consider not just a number for this 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:04.660
 next year but then a number of 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.500
 long years let's say between goiÃ¡s 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.500
 I can wait 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.010
 I would like if I would like to be able to play 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.860
 I think not only not just a wish but 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.930
 I think I can hope to play that at 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.810
 minus four or five years of quality 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.810
 high and high performance 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.670
 yes 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.919
 if I will be with our national team if 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:40.449
 the coach calls me as always 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:44.910
 I said if the selector counts 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:47.480
 with me well then go out with the group 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.530
 in an appointment that really is very 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.810
 important for us that also 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:57.120
 we are the country that organizes the world and 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:00.840
 it might be the last performance of 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.950
 some important players within 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.670
 our team in this 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.980
 in these last many years 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.580
 you never know you never know what could be 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.889
 the same 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.840
 I always enjoy playing with the 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:16.729
 selection and I enjoy playing both 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.590
 basketball that I would like to play during 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.420
 many more years 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.220
 and I know that our career is limited and 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.020
 not that 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.320
 not hard not last forever no 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.450
 then I also have to 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.790
 be a little rational and understand what 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:33.760
 good to what extent do you want to continue 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:36.190
 squeezing but without could could it be 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.680
 could you never know the lessons too 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.450
 I hope they do not happen but they can be 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.950
 conditioning in the future then I 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:45.280
 that's why I always go from year to year and watching 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:47.260
 If I feel well then go ahead if not 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.020
 I can play for whatever it is because bad 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.569
 luck 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.599
 the space to write 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:58.060
 well very well I think very a very team 

00:06:53.599 --> 00:07:01.090
 very full powerful very deep 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:03.400
 and I'm going to work a lot during the 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:08.699
 preparation to get to 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.699
 to the championship in the phase let's say optimal 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.450
 and especially how we have to have 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:16.560
 much illusion much illusion much 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:18.360
 humility within the group to get 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.930
 our goal that would be to try 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.930
 win the world 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:30.479
 in principle it does not have to condition 

00:07:27.689 --> 00:07:32.280
 nothing evolved very well every day 

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:33.800
 I feel better also with these flights in 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.050
 these trips 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.629
 I have gone from less to more the first flight 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:41.120
 affected and I was not quite well 

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:43.159
 the next day but then the two 

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.690
 following flights I have found with 

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:47.840
 quite normal after the flight 

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:49.610
 so what good has been evolving well and 

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.940
 the therapists and the doctors tell me 

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:56.979
 that in a week two completely already 

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.979
 it should be perfect 

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.320
 Y
