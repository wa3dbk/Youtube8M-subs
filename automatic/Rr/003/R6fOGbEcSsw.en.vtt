00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
to be the ghost pepper but now it's the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.060 
to be the ghost pepper but now it's the
Carolina<00:00:24.330> Reaper<00:00:27.380> they<00:00:28.380> keep<00:00:28.619> making<00:00:28.800> like

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
Carolina Reaper they keep making like

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.780 
Carolina Reaper they keep making like
new<00:00:29.310> strains<00:00:30.179> why<00:00:31.340> it's<00:00:32.340> not<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.550> natural

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
new strains why it's not a natural

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.970 
new strains why it's not a natural
pepper<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.840> new<00:00:34.050> strain<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.620> somebody

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
pepper it's a new strain that somebody

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.220 
pepper it's a new strain that somebody
created<00:00:35.190> he<00:00:35.910> calls<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.480> Carolina<00:00:36.899> Reaper

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
created he calls it the Carolina Reaper

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.100 
created he calls it the Carolina Reaper
so<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.010> Scoville<00:00:38.850> pepper<00:00:39.120> heat

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
so this is the Scoville pepper heat

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.590 
so this is the Scoville pepper heat
chart<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.100> pretty<00:00:41.219> much<00:00:41.340> it's<00:00:41.610> at<00:00:41.820> 1.5

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
chart and so pretty much it's at 1.5

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.430 
chart and so pretty much it's at 1.5
million<00:00:43.430> Scoville<00:00:44.430> heat<00:00:44.719> units<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
million Scoville heat units what the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.970 
million Scoville heat units what the
pure<00:00:46.829> what's<00:00:47.250> top<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> list<00:00:48.030> pepper<00:00:48.300> spray

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.590 

Carolina<00:00:52.980> Reaper<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.820> pepper<00:00:54.120> spray

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
Carolina Reaper in the pepper spray

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.979 
Carolina Reaper in the pepper spray
Wow<00:00:56.010> capsaicin<00:00:56.489> which<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.329> chemical<00:00:57.809> in

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
Wow capsaicin which is the chemical in

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.959 
Wow capsaicin which is the chemical in
hot<00:00:58.230> peppers<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:59.280> responsible<00:00:59.940> for

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
hot peppers that is responsible for

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.450 
hot peppers that is responsible for
their<00:01:00.329> heat<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.899> that's<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.350> highest<00:01:01.559> just

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
their heat so that's the highest just

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.670 
their heat so that's the highest just
just<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.030> purely<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.600> chemical<00:01:04.080> by<00:01:04.199> itself

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
just a purely that chemical by itself

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.890 
just a purely that chemical by itself
15<00:01:05.220> million<00:01:05.549> yeah<00:01:05.970> fuck<00:01:06.270> them<00:01:06.479> they<00:01:06.689> make

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
15 million yeah fuck them they make

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.780 
15 million yeah fuck them they make
pepper<00:01:07.200> spray<00:01:07.530> out<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.220> one<00:01:08.400> ever

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
pepper spray out of it is that one ever

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.490 
pepper spray out of it is that one ever
sprays<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> bottom<00:01:09.750> it's<00:01:10.080> higher<00:01:10.470> than

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
sprays on the bottom it's higher than

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.800 
sprays on the bottom it's higher than
pepper<00:01:11.070> spray<00:01:11.549> yeah<00:01:12.000> that's<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.479> pure

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
pepper spray yeah that's the pure

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.510 
pepper spray yeah that's the pure
chemical<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.650> they<00:01:13.740> dilute<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.369> make

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
chemical so they dilute it to make

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.050 
chemical so they dilute it to make
pepper<00:01:14.670> spray<00:01:15.030> yeah<00:01:16.100> pure<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.400> 15<00:01:17.850> million

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
pepper spray yeah pure is 15 million

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.690 
pepper spray yeah pure is 15 million
heat<00:01:18.930> units<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.530> then<00:01:19.619> pepper<00:01:19.830> spray<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.369> two

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
heat units and then pepper spray is two

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.850 
heat units and then pepper spray is two
to<00:01:20.850> five<00:01:21.060> million<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.049> Carolina<00:01:22.439> Reaper
