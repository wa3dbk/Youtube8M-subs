00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
bottom which they do this is very simple

bottom which they do this is very simple
and<00:00:48.000> fairly<00:00:48.539> inexpensive<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.940> works

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
and fairly inexpensive but it works

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.049 
and fairly inexpensive but it works
awesome<00:00:51.920> they<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:53.070> come<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.460> multitude<00:00:53.610> of

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
awesome they do come in a multitude of

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.310 
awesome they do come in a multitude of
colors<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:54.719> well<00:00:55.460> design-wise<00:00:56.660> that<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
colors as well design-wise that the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.670 
colors as well design-wise that the
material<00:00:59.190> it's<00:00:59.309> like<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.910> guess<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> hard<00:01:01.109> foam

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
material it's like a I guess a hard foam

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.170 
material it's like a I guess a hard foam
is<00:01:02.070> what<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.340> would<00:01:02.399> call<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.670> because<00:01:02.910> it's

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
is what you would call it because it's

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.109 
is what you would call it because it's
cushy<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.439> not<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:04.920> extremely<00:01:05.729> soft

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
cushy but it's not like extremely soft

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.880 
cushy but it's not like extremely soft
like<00:01:06.390> memory<00:01:06.659> foam<00:01:06.689> because<00:01:07.200> obviously<00:01:07.710> needs

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
like memory foam because obviously needs

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.640 
like memory foam because obviously needs
total<00:01:08.070> something<00:01:08.670> firm<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.840> then<00:01:09.960> covered<00:01:10.439> by

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
total something firm and then covered by

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.950 
total something firm and then covered by
a<00:01:10.680> fabric<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> non-slip<00:01:12.390> fabric<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:14.960> top

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
a fabric like a non-slip fabric the top

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.469 
a fabric like a non-slip fabric the top
is<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> little<00:01:16.680> bit<00:01:16.799> smaller<00:01:17.130> than<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.820> base<00:01:18.000> as

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
is a little bit smaller than the base as

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.170
