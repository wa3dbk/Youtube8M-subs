00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.729 
zip system that sees can use overhand in
zip<00:00:37.730> to<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:37.969> front<00:00:38.239> and<00:00:39.019> the<00:00:39.079> idea<00:00:39.530> this

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
zip to the front and the idea this

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.580 
zip to the front and the idea this
basically<00:00:40.190> is<00:00:40.340> to<00:00:41.019> negate<00:00:42.019> the<00:00:42.140> need<00:00:42.170> for<00:00:42.559> a

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
basically is to negate the need for a

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.529 
basically is to negate the need for a
zip<00:00:43.010> on<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.280> back<00:00:43.460> which<00:00:43.789> gives<00:00:44.269> you<00:00:44.359> more

which you normally see almost wet suits

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.150 
which you normally see almost wet suits
the<00:01:08.660> idea<00:01:08.900> of<00:01:08.990> smooth<00:01:09.200> skin<00:01:09.440> is<00:01:09.560> to<00:01:09.680> stop<00:01:09.920> wind

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
the idea of smooth skin is to stop wind

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.980

getting<00:01:10.460> through<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.730> suit<00:01:10.940> and<00:01:11.690> that's

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
getting through the suit and that's

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.750 
getting through the suit and that's
basically<00:01:12.170> this<00:01:12.620> technology<00:01:13.280> that<00:01:13.400> sees<00:01:13.580> can

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
basically this technology that sees can

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.120 
basically this technology that sees can
use<00:01:14.000> does<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.360> same<00:01:14.540> thing<00:01:14.870> it<00:01:15.560> wicks<00:01:15.830> water

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
use does the same thing it wicks water

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.590 
use does the same thing it wicks water
away<00:01:16.340> from<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.670> body<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.210> that<00:01:17.240> water<00:01:17.450> doesn't

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
away from the body so that water doesn't

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.300 
away from the body so that water doesn't
collection<00:01:18.170> chest<00:01:18.500> and<00:01:18.770> whole<00:01:18.890> idea<00:01:19.250> is

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
collection chest and whole idea is

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.310 
collection chest and whole idea is
basically<00:01:19.580> just<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:20.390> keep<00:01:20.510> you<00:01:20.630> warmer<00:01:20.900> again

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
basically just to keep you warmer again

basically just to keep you warmer again
if<00:01:22.280> you<00:01:22.400> ever<00:01:22.430> look<00:01:22.820> at<00:01:22.910> the<00:01:22.970> cuffs<00:01:23.270> of<00:01:23.420> the

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
if you ever look at the cuffs of the

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.080 
if you ever look at the cuffs of the
suit<00:01:23.750> get<00:01:24.680> a<00:01:24.710> little<00:01:24.830> bit<00:01:25.010> closer<00:01:25.220> head<00:01:25.520> the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
suit get a little bit closer head the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.430 
suit get a little bit closer head the
cuffs<00:01:26.270> are<00:01:26.420> brought<00:01:26.630> in<00:01:26.870> so<00:01:27.110> they're<00:01:27.260> quite

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
cuffs are brought in so they're quite

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.440 
cuffs are brought in so they're quite
small<00:01:27.740> basically<00:01:28.730> and<00:01:28.910> the<00:01:29.000> idea<00:01:29.270> of<00:01:29.300> this

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
small basically and the idea of this

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.240 
small basically and the idea of this
again<00:01:29.750> if<00:01:30.140> you<00:01:30.230> wipe<00:01:30.440> out<00:01:30.620> or<00:01:30.800> you<00:01:30.890> fall<00:01:31.100> off

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
again if you wipe out or you fall off

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.950 
again if you wipe out or you fall off
whatever<00:01:31.430> craft<00:01:31.820> you're<00:01:32.000> riding<00:01:32.330> basically<00:01:32.780> a

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
lot of suits will ride back up on your

sleeve you get washes up your arm and if

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.230 
sleeve you get washes up your arm and if
you're<00:01:37.340> wearing<00:01:37.460> gloves<00:01:37.700> than<00:01:37.940> your<00:01:38.030> gloves

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
you're wearing gloves than your gloves

you're wearing gloves than your gloves
fill<00:01:38.420> up<00:01:38.510> the<00:01:38.630> water<00:01:38.660> so<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.470> idea<00:01:39.590> that<00:01:39.800> these

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
fill up the water so the idea that these

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.650 
fill up the water so the idea that these
are<00:01:40.130> closed<00:01:40.370> in<00:01:40.580> so<00:01:40.850> that<00:01:40.880> don't<00:01:41.180> write<00:01:41.360> up<00:01:41.510> on

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
are closed in so that don't write up on

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.360 
are closed in so that don't write up on
your<00:01:41.780> arm<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.530> it<00:01:42.650> basically<00:01:42.800> means<00:01:43.160> is<00:01:43.340> a

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
your arm and it basically means is a

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.580 
your arm and it basically means is a
better<00:01:43.610> joint<00:01:43.880> between<00:01:44.030> glove<00:01:44.480> and<00:01:44.750> works<00:01:45.410> you

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
better joint between glove and works you

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.800 
better joint between glove and works you
around<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:45.950> wrist<00:01:46.130> area<00:01:46.310> as<00:01:46.640> well<00:01:46.810> have

the<00:02:32.420> seams<00:02:32.690> on<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:32.959> inside<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.440> sea<00:02:33.590> skin

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
the seams on the inside of the sea skin

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.309 
the seams on the inside of the sea skin
word<00:02:34.010> are<00:02:34.250> glued<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.060> blind<00:02:35.300> stitched<00:02:35.599> which

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
word are glued and blind stitched which

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.309 
word are glued and blind stitched which
ones<00:02:36.530> are<00:02:36.680> basically<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.900> scene<00:02:38.900> doesn't<00:02:39.140> go

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
ones are basically the scene doesn't go

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.150 
ones are basically the scene doesn't go
the<00:02:39.440> whole<00:02:39.590> way<00:02:39.650> through<00:02:40.100> so<00:02:40.340> it's<00:02:40.519> basically

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
the whole way through so it's basically

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.410 
the whole way through so it's basically
protecting<00:02:43.160> you<00:02:43.250> against<00:02:43.700> water<00:02:43.910> seeping

protecting you against water seeping

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.900 
protecting you against water seeping
through<00:02:44.600> to<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.810> seams<00:02:45.340> you've<00:02:46.340> got<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.790> have

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
through to the seams you've got to have

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.030 
through to the seams you've got to have
a<00:02:46.940> little<00:02:47.209> glue<00:02:47.480> spots<00:02:47.810> on<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.440> stress<00:02:48.709> points

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
a little glue spots on the stress points

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.350 
a little glue spots on the stress points
down<00:02:49.190> as<00:02:49.280> well<00:02:49.519> just<00:02:49.819> to<00:02:49.940> make<00:02:50.060> sure<00:02:50.090> the

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
down as well just to make sure the

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.759 
down as well just to make sure the
solutes<00:02:50.569> nice<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:50.989> robust<00:02:51.319> it's<00:02:51.530> not<00:02:51.680> going

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
solutes nice and robust it's not going

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.910 
solutes nice and robust it's not going
to<00:02:51.860> fall<00:02:52.010> apart<00:02:52.160> on<00:02:52.459> you<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:53.920> essentially

to fall apart on you and essentially

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.350 
to fall apart on you and essentially
that's<00:02:55.250> at<00:02:55.459> everything<00:02:55.880> that's<00:02:56.030> going<00:02:56.239> on

that's at everything that's going on

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.470 
that's at everything that's going on
inside<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.810> seasons<00:02:57.260> what
