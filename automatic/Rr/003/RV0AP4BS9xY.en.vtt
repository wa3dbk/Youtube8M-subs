okay in this video I wanted to give a
just<00:00:03.300> have<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.480> little<00:00:03.780> discussion<00:00:04.529> over<00:00:05.150> ball

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
just have a little discussion over ball

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.860 
just have a little discussion over ball
bearings<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:07.020> swapping<00:00:07.890> out<00:00:08.010> ball<00:00:08.340> bearings

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
bearings and swapping out ball bearings

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:16.970 
bearings and swapping out ball bearings
I'll<00:00:09.870> be<00:00:10.110> showing<00:00:10.830> some<00:00:11.070> more<00:00:12.230> direct<00:00:15.980> footage

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
I'll be showing some more direct footage

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.310 
I'll be showing some more direct footage
of<00:00:17.160> how<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.369> do<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:18.000> another<00:00:18.270> video<00:00:18.480> but<00:00:19.109> in

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
of how to do it in another video but in

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.410 
of how to do it in another video but in
this<00:00:19.439> case<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.890> have<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.490> relatively<00:00:21.090> new

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
this case I have a relatively new

stroller and the ball bearings have been
completely<00:00:26.220> destroyed<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:26.880> one<00:00:27.029> side<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.630> I

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
completely destroyed on one side so I

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.470 
completely destroyed on one side so I
pried<00:00:28.109> out<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.920> outer<00:00:29.099> part<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.760> here<00:00:30.029> this

central locking mechanism which I'm
going<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> have<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.910> remove<00:00:36.320> if<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.800> it

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
going to have to remove if you have it

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.180 
going to have to remove if you have it

other end by placing a screwdriver or
something<00:00:45.570> like<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:46.070> I<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.910> through<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
something like this I in through the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.479 
something like this I in through the
hole<00:00:48.690> against<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.590> ball<00:00:49.770> bearings<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.309> then

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
hole against the ball bearings and then

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.119 
hole against the ball bearings and then
using<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.910> hammer<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.020> smack<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
using a hammer you can smack on it and

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.819 
using a hammer you can smack on it and
knock<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.270> ball<00:00:54.390> bearing<00:00:54.690> out<00:00:54.840> be<00:00:55.260> aware<00:00:55.590> that

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
knock the ball bearing out be aware that

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.470 
knock the ball bearing out be aware that
if<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:55.980> ball<00:00:56.219> bearing<00:00:56.579> you're<00:00:56.789> knocking<00:00:57.360> out

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
if the ball bearing you're knocking out

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.560 
if the ball bearing you're knocking out
is<00:00:57.660> good<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.680> might<00:00:58.920> damage<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.730> if<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.210> flat

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
is good you might damage it if the flat

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.750 
is good you might damage it if the flat
part<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.379> screwdriver<00:01:01.620> goes<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.370> through

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
part of the screwdriver goes in through

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.149 
part of the screwdriver goes in through
the<00:01:02.850> side<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> ball<00:01:03.570> bearing<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.619> want

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
the side of the ball bearing so you want

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.310 
the side of the ball bearing so you want
to<00:01:05.369> make<00:01:05.640> sure<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.119> hits<00:01:06.390> directly<00:01:07.110> on

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
to make sure that this hits directly on

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.890 
to make sure that this hits directly on
the<00:01:07.860> steel<00:01:08.100> rim<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:08.700> you're<00:01:09.330> going<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.750> be

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the steel rim if you're going to be

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.510 
the steel rim if you're going to be
using<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.710> ball<00:01:10.860> bearing<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.369> you're

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
using the ball bearing that you're

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.480 
using the ball bearing that you're
knocking<00:01:11.700> out<00:01:12.350> when<00:01:13.350> removing<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.040> central

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
knocking out when removing the central

locking mechanism the wheel will

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.440 
locking mechanism the wheel will
generally<00:01:17.549> look<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.330> ball

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
generally look like this that ball

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.590 
generally look like this that ball
bearing<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:18.900> case<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.590> intact<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
bearing in this case is intact and you

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.660 
bearing in this case is intact and you
need<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.869> pinch<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.740> press<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.310> through

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
need to pinch this and press it through

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.210 
need to pinch this and press it through
if<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.659> relatively<00:01:25.049> new<00:01:25.140> wheel<00:01:25.560> sometimes

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
if it's a relatively new wheel sometimes

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.620 
if it's a relatively new wheel sometimes
it<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.549> survive<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:27.210> hitting<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:27.600> a

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
it can survive just hitting with a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.230 
it can survive just hitting with a
hammer<00:01:27.900> which<00:01:28.290> will<00:01:28.500> naturally<00:01:29.100> push<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.970> in

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
hammer which will naturally push this in

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.760 
hammer which will naturally push this in
words<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:30.750> otherwise<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.350> want<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.619> maybe

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
words but otherwise you want to maybe

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.160 
words but otherwise you want to maybe
pinch<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.310> with<00:01:32.430> some<00:01:33.150> kind<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.420> pliers<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
pinch it with some kind of pliers and

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.850 
pinch it with some kind of pliers and
then<00:01:34.409> hit<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.570> as<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:37.259> get<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.530> through<00:01:37.680> one

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
then hit and as you get it through one

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.280 
then hit and as you get it through one
side<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.610> generally<00:01:39.060> pull<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.259> will

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
side you can generally pull and it will

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.560 
side you can generally pull and it will
pull<00:01:40.650> out<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.340> ball<00:01:41.490> bearing<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.360> other

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
pull out the ball bearing on the other

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.520 
pull out the ball bearing on the other
side<00:01:43.970> this<00:01:44.970> one<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.390> too<00:01:45.540> rusted<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.140> work<00:01:46.290> that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
side this one is too rusted to work that

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.510 
side this one is too rusted to work that
way<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:46.909> there<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.000> goes

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
way so there it goes

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.399 
way so there it goes

have problems with the ball bearings and

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.700 
have problems with the ball bearings and
if<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.850> slightly<00:02:00.479> weak<00:02:01.020> ball<00:02:01.320> bearings
