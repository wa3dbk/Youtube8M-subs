00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
this gold to be shiny on this card that

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.030 
this gold to be shiny on this card that
would<00:02:48.630> be<00:02:48.780> phenomenal<00:02:48.960> because<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.680> just<00:02:49.860> kind

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
would be phenomenal because it just kind

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.710 
would be phenomenal because it just kind
of<00:02:50.100> looks<00:02:50.310> dull<00:02:50.580> in<00:02:50.820> my<00:02:51.360> eyes<00:02:51.650> right<00:02:52.940> here<00:02:53.940> so

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
of looks dull in my eyes right here so

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.750 
of looks dull in my eyes right here so
if<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.990> was<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.470> gold<00:02:55.920> color<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.490> think<00:02:56.700> it

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
if it was that gold color I think it

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.760 
if it was that gold color I think it
would<00:02:56.880> look<00:02:56.910> just<00:02:57.260> amazing

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
would look just amazing

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.220 
would look just amazing
but<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.190> course<00:02:59.220> they<00:02:59.670> couldn't<00:03:00.510> do<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:00.990> and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
but of course they couldn't do that and

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.600 
but of course they couldn't do that and
I<00:03:01.290> think<00:03:01.500> in<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.680> future<00:03:01.860> they<00:03:02.130> will<00:03:02.310> be<00:03:02.370> able

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
I think in the future they will be able

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.640 
I think in the future they will be able
to<00:03:02.730> do<00:03:02.910> that<00:03:03.060> but<00:03:03.840> we'll<00:03:03.990> just<00:03:04.020> have<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.380> wait

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
to do that but we'll just have to wait

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.430 
to do that but we'll just have to wait
and<00:03:04.860> see<00:03:04.890> guys<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:05.790> overall<00:03:06.120> good<00:03:06.720> it's<00:03:07.320> a

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
and see guys so overall good it's a

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.940 
and see guys so overall good it's a
decent<00:03:07.890> ace<00:03:07.980> but<00:03:08.610> if<00:03:09.270> they<00:03:09.540> could<00:03:09.840> have<00:03:10.020> gotten

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
decent ace but if they could have gotten

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.730 
decent ace but if they could have gotten
that<00:03:11.220> gold<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.820> that<00:03:12.000> shine<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:12.740> brightness

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740

on<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.550> it<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.790> would<00:03:14.880> have<00:03:14.940> been<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.120> lot<00:03:15.420> better

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
doesn't like to kind of branch out and

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.660 
doesn't like to kind of branch out and
create<00:03:38.580> new<00:03:38.610> artwork<00:03:39.270> for<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.580> know

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
actually famous people and maybe I'll do

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.310 
actually famous people and maybe I'll do
a<00:03:49.980> little<00:03:50.250> history<00:03:50.700> lesson<00:03:50.730> next<00:03:51.330> week<00:03:51.480> but

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
a little history lesson next week but

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.560 
a little history lesson next week but
the<00:03:52.709> cars<00:03:52.950> themselves<00:03:53.100> are<00:03:53.640> pretty<00:03:53.970> normal<00:03:54.180> I

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
the cars themselves are pretty normal I

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.010 
the cars themselves are pretty normal I
I<00:03:55.530> kind<00:03:55.950> of<00:03:55.980> hope<00:03:56.190> maybe<00:03:57.030> theory<00:03:57.450> 11<00:03:57.750> starts

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
I kind of hope maybe theory 11 starts

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.020 
I kind of hope maybe theory 11 starts
branching<00:03:58.560> out<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:58.920> experimenting<00:03:59.910> new

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
branching out and experimenting new

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.420 
branching out and experimenting new
things<00:04:00.330> it's<00:04:01.170> done<00:04:01.350> to<00:04:01.470> this<00:04:01.590> normal<00:04:02.130> artwork

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
things it's done to this normal artwork

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.070 
things it's done to this normal artwork
because<00:04:02.610> I'm<00:04:02.700> no<00:04:02.820> but<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.030> guys<00:04:03.180> I<00:04:03.450> think<00:04:03.720> the

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
because I'm no but you guys I think the

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.050 
because I'm no but you guys I think the
boxes<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:04.860> bat<00:04:05.010> designs<00:04:05.370> are<00:04:05.790> unique

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
boxes and the bat designs are unique

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.060 
boxes and the bat designs are unique
they<00:04:06.540> grew<00:04:06.810> they're<00:04:07.050> great<00:04:07.350> I<00:04:07.530> love<00:04:07.860> the

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
they grew they're great I love the

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.220 
they grew they're great I love the
change<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:08.459> pace<00:04:08.670> but<00:04:09.270> these<00:04:09.450> these<00:04:09.750> are<00:04:09.930> cars

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
change of pace but these these are cars

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.590 
change of pace but these these are cars
I'm<00:04:10.500> getting<00:04:10.860> you<00:04:11.190> know<00:04:11.310> I'm<00:04:11.520> so<00:04:12.000> used<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.390> them

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
I'm getting you know I'm so used to them

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.630 
I'm getting you know I'm so used to them
and<00:04:12.840> I've<00:04:13.080> seen<00:04:13.290> them<00:04:13.440> so<00:04:13.709> I've<00:04:13.950> seen<00:04:14.100> hundreds

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
and I've seen them so I've seen hundreds

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
and I've seen them so I've seen hundreds
of<00:04:14.790> these<00:04:15.000> okay

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
of these okay

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.470 
of these okay
I<00:04:16.320> think<00:04:16.530> it's<00:04:16.770> time<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.520> change<00:04:17.730> it<00:04:17.910> up<00:04:18.090> now

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
I think it's time to change it up now

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.580 
I think it's time to change it up now
let's<00:04:18.630> take<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.810> peek<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:19.020> this<00:04:19.080> back<00:04:19.350> design

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
let's take a peek of this back design

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.690 
let's take a peek of this back design
okay<00:04:20.180> now<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:21.479> I<00:04:21.750> don't<00:04:22.080> exactly<00:04:22.800> know<00:04:23.130> what<00:04:23.310> AEG

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
okay now I I don't exactly know what AEG

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.690 
okay now I I don't exactly know what AEG
stands<00:04:24.360> for<00:04:24.690> I<00:04:24.930> think<00:04:25.740> it<00:04:26.070> was<00:04:26.100> Gil

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
stands for I think it was Gil

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.190 
stands for I think it was Gil
of<00:04:26.790> artisans<00:04:27.360> I<00:04:27.600> think<00:04:27.780> that's<00:04:27.930> what<00:04:28.110> it

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
of artisans I think that's what it

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.710 
of artisans I think that's what it
stands<00:04:28.440> for<00:04:28.550> and<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.850> think<00:04:30.060> this<00:04:30.180> bag<00:04:30.390> design

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
stands for and I think this bag design

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.630 
stands for and I think this bag design
looks<00:04:30.960> great<00:04:31.230> now<00:04:31.650> once<00:04:31.920> again<00:04:32.070> like<00:04:32.430> I<00:04:32.580> said

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
looks great now once again like I said

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.270 
looks great now once again like I said
earlier<00:04:33.210> if<00:04:34.080> they<00:04:34.410> had<00:04:34.560> made<00:04:34.770> it<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:35.010> gold

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
earlier if they had made it the gold

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.600 
earlier if they had made it the gold
that<00:04:35.880> we<00:04:36.090> saw<00:04:36.360> earlier<00:04:36.960> over<00:04:37.260> here<00:04:38.010> and<00:04:38.160> that

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
that we saw earlier over here and that

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.490 
that we saw earlier over here and that
kind<00:04:38.850> of<00:04:38.910> shininess<00:04:39.450> I<00:04:39.750> think<00:04:40.140> this<00:04:40.260> looks

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
kind of shininess I think this looks

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.290 
kind of shininess I think this looks
phenomenal<00:04:40.680> I<00:04:41.220> really<00:04:41.940> do

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
phenomenal I really do

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.260 
phenomenal I really do
if<00:04:42.360> if<00:04:43.050> my<00:04:43.410> cards<00:04:43.920> look<00:04:44.250> like<00:04:44.430> this<00:04:44.640> I<00:04:44.850> think

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
if if my cards look like this I think

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.270 
if if my cards look like this I think
people<00:04:45.750> would<00:04:45.870> think<00:04:45.930> you<00:04:46.320> were<00:04:46.440> rich<00:04:46.710> okay

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
people would think you were rich okay

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.950 
people would think you were rich okay
cuz<00:04:47.490> if<00:04:47.640> every<00:04:48.000> back<00:04:48.180> design<00:04:48.420> looked<00:04:48.810> like

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
cuz if every back design looked like

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.220 
cuz if every back design looked like
this<00:04:49.110> guys<00:04:49.380> you<00:04:50.190> you<00:04:50.520> would<00:04:50.670> have<00:04:50.810> such<00:04:51.810> a<00:04:51.840> nice

something to add to your collection but

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.520 
something to add to your collection but
if<00:06:26.730> you're<00:06:27.030> just<00:06:27.270> a<00:06:27.420> regular<00:06:27.450> buyer<00:06:28.110> you're

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:35.670 
because the back design isn't great but

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.180 
because the back design isn't great but
it's<00:06:35.820> definitely<00:06:36.000> not<00:06:36.420> bad<00:06:37.110> at<00:06:37.440> all<00:06:37.650> okay<00:06:38.160> so
