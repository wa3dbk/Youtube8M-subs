this is a mark - right here
what<00:00:37.440> has<00:00:37.590> changed<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:38.250> they<00:00:38.430> went<00:00:38.640> from<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
what has changed is they went from the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.850 
what has changed is they went from the

my review on the version 1 of this plane

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.560 
my review on the version 1 of this plane
and<00:00:51.540> I<00:00:52.260> recommend<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.950> as<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.399> modest<00:00:53.969> upgrade

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
and I recommend it as a modest upgrade

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.000 
and I recommend it as a modest upgrade

mark twos come with this 27 33,000 KB
look<00:01:06.710> like<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.890> see<00:01:08.100> Tony<00:01:09.030> F<00:01:09.270> speed<00:01:09.539> control

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
look like you see Tony F speed control

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:11.510 
look like you see Tony F speed control
now<00:01:10.050> much<00:01:10.410> bigger<00:01:10.709> twice<00:01:11.069> as<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.399> is

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
now much bigger twice as that is

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.580 
now much bigger twice as that is
actually<00:01:11.940> so<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.929> little<00:01:13.229> guy<00:01:13.319> is

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
actually so this little guy is

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.980 
actually so this little guy is
definitely<00:01:14.459> more<00:01:14.759> designed<00:01:15.179> for<00:01:15.479> some<00:01:15.750> high

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
definitely more designed for some high

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.490 
definitely more designed for some high
speed<00:01:16.440> now<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.340> does<00:01:17.520> come<00:01:17.610> stock<00:01:18.030> with<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.500> 5.5

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
speed now it does come stock with a 5.5

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.559 
speed now it does come stock with a 5.5
prop<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.429> be<00:01:20.580> very<00:01:20.729> careful<00:01:21.179> on<00:01:21.240> your<00:01:21.390> battery

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:21.569 
prop so be very careful on your battery

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:24.410 
prop so be very careful on your battery
selection<00:01:22.140> based<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.190> my<00:01:23.340> testing<00:01:23.819> is<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.209> run

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
selection based on my testing is you run

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.960 
selection based on my testing is you run
a<00:01:24.479> two<00:01:24.869> cell<00:01:25.200> then<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.310> will<00:01:26.520> be<00:01:26.640> pulling

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
a two cell then you will be pulling

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.969 
a two cell then you will be pulling
about<00:01:27.060> 16<00:01:27.690> amps<00:01:28.080> which<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.410> perfect<00:01:28.860> it's

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
about 16 amps which is perfect it's

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.949 
about 16 amps which is perfect it's
underneath<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> ESC<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.209> plenty<00:01:30.660> of<00:01:30.780> power

00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:30.959 
underneath the ESC it's plenty of power

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.740 
underneath the ESC it's plenty of power
you<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.410> go<00:01:31.560> vertical<00:01:32.130> unlimited<00:01:33.000> guaranteed

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
you can go vertical unlimited guaranteed

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.240 
you can go vertical unlimited guaranteed
mine<00:01:34.140> will<00:01:34.770> go<00:01:34.800> up<00:01:35.280> forever<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> two<00:01:36.780> cell

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
mine will go up forever on a two cell

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.040 
mine will go up forever on a two cell
now<00:01:38.250> if<00:01:38.550> you<00:01:38.759> are<00:01:38.940> a<00:01:38.970> hot<00:01:39.209> rodder<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.869> like

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
now if you are a hot rodder and you like

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.600 
now if you are a hot rodder and you like
it<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.289> go<00:01:40.410> a<00:01:40.440> little<00:01:40.590> bit<00:01:40.800> faster<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.429> can

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
it to go a little bit faster you can

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.639 
it to go a little bit faster you can
always<00:01:41.970> run<00:01:42.209> a<00:01:42.479> three<00:01:42.810> cell<00:01:43.080> but<00:01:43.289> you<00:01:43.319> have<00:01:43.530> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
always run a three cell but you have to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.260 
always run a three cell but you have to
be<00:01:43.740> very<00:01:43.860> careful<00:01:44.340> because<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.700> three<00:01:45.030> cell

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
be very careful because a three cell

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.380 
be very careful because a three cell
with<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.990> stock<00:01:46.289> 5x5<00:01:47.039> is<00:01:47.310> going<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.819> overdraw

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
with the stock 5x5 is going to overdraw

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.510 
with the stock 5x5 is going to overdraw
the<00:01:48.450> esc<00:01:48.989> it<00:01:49.440> is<00:01:49.649> going<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.979> be<00:01:50.099> pulling<00:01:50.340> about

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
the esc it is going to be pulling about

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.690 
the esc it is going to be pulling about
26<00:01:51.390> amps<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.050> is<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:52.380> even<00:01:52.619> close<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.369> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
26 amps so that is not even close to the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.729 
26 amps so that is not even close to the
20<00:01:54.000> amp<00:01:54.179> limit<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.929> wouldn't<00:01:55.410> recommend

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:55.739 
20 amp limit so I wouldn't recommend

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:57.350 
20 amp limit so I wouldn't recommend
doing<00:01:56.069> that<00:01:56.220> it's<00:01:56.550> not<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.849> you<00:01:56.940> couldn't

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
doing that it's not that you couldn't

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.050 
doing that it's not that you couldn't
but<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.539> wouldn't<00:01:57.840> recommend<00:01:57.989> it<00:01:58.530> now<00:01:59.130> what<00:02:00.030> I

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
but I wouldn't recommend it now what I

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.940 
but I wouldn't recommend it now what I
would<00:02:00.209> recommend<00:02:00.660> is<00:02:01.170> if<00:02:01.349> you<00:02:01.470> have<00:02:01.679> three

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
would recommend is if you have three

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.770 
would recommend is if you have three
cells<00:02:02.190> lying<00:02:02.489> around<00:02:02.640> or<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.119> just<00:02:03.300> want<00:02:03.630> to

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
cells lying around or you just want to

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.930 
cells lying around or you just want to
use<00:02:03.989> a<00:02:04.020> three<00:02:04.349> cell<00:02:04.619> then<00:02:05.160> somewhere<00:02:05.729> between

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
use a three cell then somewhere between

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.330 
use a three cell then somewhere between
about<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.560> 750<00:02:07.560> well<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.130> could<00:02:08.250> probably

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
about a 750 well you could probably

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.550 
about a 750 well you could probably
should<00:02:08.610> probably<00:02:08.789> do<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.090> lower<00:02:09.270> than<00:02:09.450> 500<00:02:10.080> so

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
should probably do is lower than 500 so

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.770 
should probably do is lower than 500 so
about<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> 500<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.550> 1100

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
about a 500 to 1100

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.240 
about a 500 to 1100
our<00:02:13.350> lipo<00:02:14.310> in<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.910> 3-cell<00:02:15.450> dropped<00:02:16.440> down<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.980> a

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
our lipo in a 3-cell dropped down to a

our lipo in a 3-cell dropped down to a

four point five by four point five that

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.590 
four point five by four point five that
seemed<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.920> be<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.160> magic<00:02:20.370> prop<00:02:20.940> for<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.330> three

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
seemed to be the magic prop for a three

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.440 
seemed to be the magic prop for a three

cell on this motor and speed control got

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.720 
cell on this motor and speed control got
you<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.750> about<00:02:24.870> eighteen<00:02:25.410> years<00:02:25.620> even<00:02:26.370> more

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
you to about eighteen years even more

setup<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.820> little<00:02:30.090> bit<00:02:30.209> less<00:02:30.360> torque<00:02:30.690> roll

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
setup and a little bit less torque roll

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.680 
setup and a little bit less torque roll
due<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.350> slightly<00:02:31.709> smaller<00:02:32.100> prop<00:02:32.490> so<00:02:33.060> that

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
due to the slightly smaller prop so that

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.150 
due to the slightly smaller prop so that
was<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.870> really<00:02:34.080> cool<00:02:34.320> setup<00:02:34.590> if<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:34.860> want<00:02:35.070> to

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
was a really cool setup if you want to

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.500 
was a really cool setup if you want to
run<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.400> three<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:35.760> go<00:02:36.000> ahead<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.209> pick<00:02:36.360> up

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
run it three so go ahead and pick up

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.330 
run it three so go ahead and pick up
some<00:02:36.720> four<00:02:36.930> by<00:02:37.080> four<00:02:37.440> point<00:02:37.680> five<00:02:37.830> by<00:02:38.100> four

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
some four by four point five by four

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.100 
some four by four point five by four
point<00:02:38.580> five<00:02:38.730> props<00:02:39.060> if<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.630> want<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.930> little

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
point five props if you want it a little

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.750 
point five props if you want it a little
hotter<00:02:40.350> man<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.800> can<00:02:40.950> always<00:02:41.010> go<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.520> four

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
hotter man you can always go to a four

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.310 
hotter man you can always go to a four
point<00:02:42.000> seven<00:02:42.180> five<00:02:42.450> by<00:02:42.750> four<00:02:42.959> point<00:02:43.170> seven

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
point seven five by four point seven

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.070 
point seven five by four point seven
five<00:02:43.590> but<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.459> also<00:02:44.760> goes<00:02:45.300> slightly<00:02:45.840> over

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
five but that also goes slightly over

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.020 
five but that also goes slightly over
the<00:02:46.140> ESC<00:02:46.590> at<00:02:46.680> about<00:02:46.890> twenty<00:02:47.220> two<00:02:47.459> amps<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:47.820> be

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
the ESC at about twenty two amps so be

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.990 
the ESC at about twenty two amps so be
very<00:02:48.209> careful<00:02:48.570> with<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.280> so<00:02:50.280> overall<00:02:50.730> I

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
very careful with that so overall I

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.850 
very careful with that so overall I
think<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.300> mark<00:02:51.510> 2<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.930> big<00:02:52.230> improvement<00:02:52.500> I

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
think the mark 2 is a big improvement I

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.380 
think the mark 2 is a big improvement I
really<00:02:53.220> like<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.580> small<00:02:53.760> motor<00:02:54.000> because<00:02:54.270> it's

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
really like the small motor because it's

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.260 
really like the small motor because it's
a<00:02:54.450> very<00:02:54.660> easy<00:02:54.780> miss<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:55.980> barely<00:02:56.910> loses

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
a very easy miss of it this barely loses

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.960 
a very easy miss of it this barely loses
any<00:02:57.510> floatiness<00:02:58.020> but<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.440> gains<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.950> ton<00:02:59.280> in<00:02:59.730> the

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
any floatiness but it gains a ton in the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:00.620 
any floatiness but it gains a ton in the
top-end

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
top-end

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.949 
top-end
so<00:03:00.959> again<00:03:01.680> mark<00:03:02.220> two<00:03:02.400> out<00:03:02.670> now<00:03:02.940> about<00:03:03.209> 45<00:03:03.660> bucks

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
so again mark two out now about 45 bucks

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.590 
so again mark two out now about 45 bucks
comes<00:03:04.350> with<00:03:04.560> nicer<00:03:05.160> more<00:03:06.060> expensive

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
comes with nicer more expensive

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.330 
comes with nicer more expensive
electronics<00:03:07.260> but<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.530> price<00:03:07.739> did<00:03:07.920> not<00:03:08.040> change

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
electronics but the price did not change

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.640 
electronics but the price did not change
on<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.820> model<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:09.570> I<00:03:09.810> hope<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.290> guys<00:03:10.380> enjoy
