stuff so we have here is a trial key
actually<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:54.630> don't<00:03:54.780> think<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:56.010> need

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.640 
actually I don't think that you need
this<00:03:56.550> at<00:03:57.320> all<00:03:58.320> I<00:03:58.650> think<00:03:59.040> that<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.640> can<00:03:59.820> start<00:04:00.120> a

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
this at all I think that you can start a

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.920 
this at all I think that you can start a
starter<00:04:01.650> version<00:04:02.270> just<00:04:03.270> like<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:03.630> I<00:04:03.780> don't

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
starter version just like that I don't

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.540 
starter version just like that I don't
know<00:04:04.020> I<00:04:04.320> have<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.680> check<00:04:04.830> this<00:04:04.980> out<00:04:05.190> if<00:04:05.370> this

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
know I have to check this out if this

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.270 
know I have to check this out if this
actually<00:04:05.790> gives<00:04:06.330> you<00:04:06.630> something<00:04:07.590> more<00:04:07.950> by<00:04:08.220> the

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
actually gives you something more by the

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.890 
actually gives you something more by the
starter<00:04:08.670> edition<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.300> might<00:04:09.720> do<00:04:10.020> some<00:04:10.320> kind<00:04:10.560> of

starter edition I might do some kind of

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.650 
starter edition I might do some kind of
some<00:04:12.900> kind<00:04:13.020> of<00:04:13.170> get<00:04:13.380> away<00:04:13.410> for<00:04:13.800> this<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:15.420> we
