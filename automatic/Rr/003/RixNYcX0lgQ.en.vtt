they can vote with the box is a little
bit<00:00:13.019> different<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.679> know<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
bit different and I know that is the

bit different and I know that is the
only<00:00:14.370> difference<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:15.030> think<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:16.049> was<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.170> little

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
only difference I think it was a little

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.040 
only difference I think it was a little
bit<00:00:16.650> darker<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:18.390> one's<00:00:18.600> kind<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.930> more

bit darker and this one's kind of more
like<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.260> faded<00:00:19.740> look<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.189> but<00:00:21.119> I'm<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.750> way

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
like a faded look to it but I'm the way

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.450 
like a faded look to it but I'm the way
the<00:00:21.990> box<00:00:22.170> was<00:00:22.350> designed<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.890> it's<00:00:23.070> supposed<00:00:23.400> to

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
the box was designed is it's supposed to

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.300 
the box was designed is it's supposed to
look<00:00:23.670> like<00:00:23.730> it's<00:00:24.090> made<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.660> metal<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.310> it

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
look like it's made of metal and it

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.849 
look like it's made of metal and it
really<00:00:26.760> does<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.390> think<00:00:27.960> that's<00:00:28.140> really
