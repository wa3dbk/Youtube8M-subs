 And that person both sides without it why and a Well Well Hironobu before feeling another Kagiyama kilometers of child 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.970
 Let's go 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:18.680
 Ay ? Hey I was a clothes shop, but a 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:24.440
 Palliative in the know is not whether after all instead we were 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.950
 When you give me the theme song, you may meet at the launch etc. 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.729

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:35.320

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.780
 Ask me what I 'm talking about 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.020
 15 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:58.450
 It is six years ago, but it is not an impression, but I heard that it is broken and the reason is that flower 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:01.450
 I heard that you can hear a few schools in Aniraji 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:07.630
 I heard that I heard it by chance 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:09.970
 During the sequel, I hit it and put it on with the knob, so it's starting to play some anime songs 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.950
 So you started listening from there 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:21.000
 It seems came I was also like eyes or II in ancient times in 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:22.590

 Let's do it 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:35.380
 It's about that time, I guess it is already 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:41.920
 I'd like to innovate, but I heard it was dark before I went to bed 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:43.510
 Nakano I wonder if the listener has ever sent a postcard if there is a room Aikamura 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.170
 It is unique 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:52.570
 There are people who have been acted, but it is just Kobe city 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:54.880
 Oh oh, it's a stop but I wonder if it will be Nakamura Easter for the show 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.290
 Let's cut it up 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.790

 Or the other his is fun Taｰ receive what is this giving is not not you're junior 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.390

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:25.880
 It is fun to listen to this already completed space 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.030
 Tokuda West's interview Toka heard also at that time 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.570
 I wanted to see that is right or not 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:39.530
 Though there is a way that Takaaki Tanaka came for effort 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:42.770
 theme song of Hata voice-san is the Braves of that remember most I in aki Nessore 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.900
 I think it was a story when I made it 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:50.549
 If you try up the delicious delicious 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:56.680
 The shorts that were delicious and delicious were the face agents Okantoku 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:04:00.540
 Operation bring bad trying to I want it the most and garden Fuwari different stains 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:09.180
 Another Naa there in I think in like a story was waiting for 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:20.560
 Well Koyasan is split and now at the beginning immediately is by ne yer say so and Admit and come to this program 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:25.600
 Kapyon summer while ago Ii' even with street Tsu I'm so even pretend bran variety that now but is aware 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:30.250
 I'm Katsuko Nemoto, but that won't bite the government anyway in one series of dubbing 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:36.340
 I have heard that I was nervous and nervous because I was careful 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:38.470
 Abe- kun is too cool to participate in the sound director participation in a magazine that is likely to be discharged 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.550
 Things like say that I was told that was written 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:45.100
 I have to fight not to be cool 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.630
 What kind of thing was it difficult ? 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.590
 Yes 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:54.560
 That you got too good 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:56.180
 Not good and I wonder if was tell me port door Bridge too and Year Japan certainly cool parentheses 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:02.810
 It is said that 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:04.370
 Well that do not separate from anything even in the anything or fantasy what this ordinary high school students of the story 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.889
 Please be normal at 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.039
 I'm going to do it normally, yes 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.550
 I wonder if this is what you think 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:16.560
 Hey zoo 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:23.030
 The sand that seems not to be a very difficult hero of the word squirrel is probably that kind of 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:27.320
 Tan probably it this is hero-ish things heat and nuances Nokka' is 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:32.720
 It was said that he would do it as a high school student without such a thing 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:36.120
 But it is okay shiny found Sada and get referred to me to do an ordinary high school students 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:41.340
 Said animation or still say fiction even Enande 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:46.889
 I have to say how far the car is attached with characters 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:53.370
 After all sound director is quite such a tea Jess chan or such in the after recording site 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:55.290
 That's right or was the director's image of the staff and say, Beyond Sai dot 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:01.330
 The image that Mr. Side has 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:05.470
 As the director of sound tells us all this way, we are actually directly Kanto 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.430
 It is also about talking with director Mr. playwright who wants to have a discussion with 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:12.939
 Not 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:16.590
 Acoustic Director's is not high or the still most understand that hear through such this Kang Director's 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:20.790
 I can not say but I think it is a difficult task 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.590
 While listening to other sounds all the while 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:26.300
 Hmm 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:28.160
 It's like I thought how I should think about balance, so that's why 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:33.920
 I want to put such a song 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:39.950
 Here I'm listening to the dialogue while thinking strong expectations and after 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:41.580
 Oh now I'm sure that I'm passionate about this new mood, but here too that effect is seo 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.210
 I want to fall in love with you 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:50.750
 If there is a scene like Nah 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:53.569
 For example, the scene at the bottom of that, for example, is that the feeling is good and the sound is a little bit stronger 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:59.059
 Say it is good 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:07:04.669
 Shinjo and just is not a little and said, issued a piping hot that the remains in only the sound wake 

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:10.249
 se Market I have experienced after recording, and that sound director is Chiba Chiba 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:11.059
 I am ah i am ah ah ah ah i am not an amateur just because I am an amateur 

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:13.670

 I'm a funny person I sound supervision 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:26.100
 ran maybe that's just the case 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:33.580
 Now Now the other so the other time Kit tour from the cared temple the morning this day head morning I 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:37.689
 For the first time or the voice of the work Hiaro likely Tteyuu dubbing born 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:43.360
 It would be interesting to have thousands of jokes Seriously 

00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:52.319
 I could not softening and have always seen that character I was fun characters
