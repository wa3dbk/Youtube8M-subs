the<00:00:01.800> saw<00:00:02.280> talks<00:00:02.639> about<00:00:02.879> some<00:00:03.000> of<00:00:03.030> the

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
the saw talks about some of the

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.180 
the saw talks about some of the
physiologic<00:00:03.750> changes<00:00:03.780> that<00:00:04.710> happen<00:00:05.040> in

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
physiologic changes that happen in

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.900 
physiologic changes that happen in
pregnancy<00:00:05.970> and<00:00:06.720> so<00:00:07.020> as<00:00:07.200> as<00:00:07.440> usual<00:00:08.130> with<00:00:08.790> these

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
pregnancy and so as as usual with these

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.570 
pregnancy and so as as usual with these
things<00:00:09.440> this<00:00:10.440> is<00:00:10.620> health<00:00:11.070> information<00:00:11.400> I

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
things this is health information I

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.830 
things this is health information I
suppose<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.820> be<00:00:11.880> for<00:00:11.969> just<00:00:12.030> education<00:00:12.719> it's

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
suppose to be for just education it's

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.020 
suppose to be for just education it's

treatment this is in order to be used to

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.000 
treatment this is in order to be used to
try<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.070> diagnose<00:00:17.970> what's<00:00:18.630> going<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.289> yourself

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
try to diagnose what's going on yourself

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.170 
try to diagnose what's going on yourself
if<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.340> have<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.520> problem<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.820> need<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.000> see<00:00:21.150> a

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
if you have a problem you need to see a

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.730 
if you have a problem you need to see a
doctor<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.570> just<00:00:21.660> for<00:00:21.960> learning<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.470> for

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
doctor is just for learning and for

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.340 
doctor is just for learning and for
thinking<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.510> the<00:00:24.510> changes<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
thinking so the changes and the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.040 
thinking so the changes and the
physiologic<00:00:25.859> parameters<00:00:26.300> of<00:00:27.300> pregnancy<00:00:27.840> so

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
physiologic parameters of pregnancy so

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.720 
physiologic parameters of pregnancy so
this<00:00:28.260> discharge<00:00:28.590> meant<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.519> general

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
this discharge meant so in general

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.859 
this discharge meant so in general
things<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.179> are<00:00:30.269> increasing<00:00:30.750> and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
things that are increasing and

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.780 
things that are increasing and
decreasing<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.769> talking<00:00:32.040> about<00:00:32.189> how<00:00:32.640> they're

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
decreasing and talking about how they're

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.459 
decreasing and talking about how they're
connected<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.239> each<00:00:33.270> other<00:00:33.510> not<00:00:33.750> sort<00:00:34.410> of

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
connected to each other not sort of

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.740 
connected to each other not sort of
super<00:00:35.160> accurate<00:00:35.340> absolutely<00:00:35.700> numbers<00:00:36.329> we'll

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
super accurate absolutely numbers we'll

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.260 
super accurate absolutely numbers we'll
start<00:00:36.930> out<00:00:37.079> here<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:38.270> respiratory

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
start out here with the respiratory

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.240 
start out here with the respiratory
system<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:39.989> MV<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.350> minute<00:00:40.680> ventilation<00:00:40.800> and

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
system so MV is minute ventilation and

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.630 
system so MV is minute ventilation and
TVs<00:00:41.640> tidal<00:00:42.000> volume<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.320> an<00:00:43.950> increase<00:00:44.460> in

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
TVs tidal volume you have an increase in

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.180 
TVs tidal volume you have an increase in
tidal<00:00:44.910> volume<00:00:45.440> during<00:00:46.440> pregnancy<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.070> what

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
tidal volume during pregnancy so what

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.250 
tidal volume during pregnancy so what
type<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.370> volume<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.140> how<00:00:49.140> much

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
type of volume is is just how much

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.510 
type of volume is is just how much
you're<00:00:49.440> breathing<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.890> out<00:00:49.950> what's<00:00:50.370> that

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
you're breathing in and out what's that

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.010 
you're breathing in and out what's that
volume<00:00:50.910> as<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.629> imagine<00:00:51.750> if<00:00:51.989> that

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
volume as you can imagine if that

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.270 
volume as you can imagine if that
increases<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> given

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
increases and you have a given

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.369 
increases and you have a given
respiratory<00:00:53.760> rate<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.120> multiply<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.570> volume

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
respiratory rate you multiply the volume

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.660 
respiratory rate you multiply the volume
times<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.680> rate<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.100> get<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.309> men<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.550> any

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
times the rate to get the men of any

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.569 
times the rate to get the men of any
ventilation<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.079> goes<00:00:58.230> up<00:00:58.579> alveolar

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
ventilation so that goes up alveolar

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.040 
ventilation so that goes up alveolar
ventilation<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.449> also<00:01:00.629> depending<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
ventilation is also depending on the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.450 
ventilation is also depending on the
tidal<00:01:01.350> volume<00:01:01.680> alveolar<00:01:02.370> ventilation

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
tidal volume alveolar ventilation

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.210 
tidal volume alveolar ventilation
increases<00:01:03.329> what<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.899> does<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> P<00:01:04.680> big<00:01:05.070> a

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
increases what that does is the P big a

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.429 
increases what that does is the P big a
co2<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> co2<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> alveoli<00:01:07.260> is

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
co2 is the co2 in the alveoli is

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.820 
co2 is the co2 in the alveoli is
decrease<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.510> so<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.080> term<00:01:10.500> for

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
decrease it so the the term for

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.609 
decrease it so the the term for
breathing<00:01:11.670> more<00:01:12.570> hyperventilating<00:01:13.500> and

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
breathing more hyperventilating and

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.870 
breathing more hyperventilating and
having<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.890> drop<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.310> your<00:01:14.400> PA<00:01:15.000> co2<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.869> a

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
having a drop in your PA co2 is a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.660 
having a drop in your PA co2 is a
respiratory<00:01:17.880> alkalosis<00:01:18.860> right<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.549> this

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
respiratory alkalosis right so this

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.640 
respiratory alkalosis right so this
these<00:01:21.540> changes<00:01:21.900> are<00:01:21.960> believed<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.320> be<00:01:22.409> driven

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
these changes are believed to be driven

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.780 
these changes are believed to be driven
by<00:01:23.299> increased<00:01:24.299> levels<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.930> progesterone

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
by increased levels of progesterone

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.130 
by increased levels of progesterone
cardiac<00:01:26.790> output<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.210> increases<00:01:27.659> during

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
cardiac output that increases during

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.870 
cardiac output that increases during
pregnancy<00:01:28.680> that's<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.189> cardiac<00:01:29.520> output<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
pregnancy that's the cardiac output the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.480 
pregnancy that's the cardiac output the
components<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:31.040> stroke<00:01:32.040> volume<00:01:32.189> and

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
components of that are stroke volume and

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.219 
components of that are stroke volume and
the<00:01:32.850> rate<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.210> those<00:01:33.329> things<00:01:33.509> go<00:01:33.659> up<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.960> cause

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the rate so those things go up to cause

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.749 
the rate so those things go up to cause
a<00:01:34.259> bigger<00:01:34.500> cardiac<00:01:35.250> output

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
a bigger cardiac output

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.310 
a bigger cardiac output
you<00:01:36.030> also<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.329> increases<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.900> plasma

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
you also have increases in the plasma

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.770 
you also have increases in the plasma
volume<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.310> GFR<00:01:38.759> they<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.479> make<00:01:39.600> sense

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
volume and the GFR they can make sense

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.060 
volume and the GFR they can make sense
that<00:01:39.900> those<00:01:40.020> two<00:01:40.259> go<00:01:40.380> together<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.740> little<00:01:40.950> bit

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
that those two go together a little bit

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.859 
that those two go together a little bit
you<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.640> bunch<00:01:42.090> more<00:01:42.210> plasma<00:01:42.780> you

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
you have a bunch more plasma you

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.560 
you have a bunch more plasma you
probably<00:01:43.110> need<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.500> higher<00:01:43.890> GFR<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:45.180> filter<00:01:45.479> it

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
probably need a higher GFR to filter it

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.560 
probably need a higher GFR to filter it
B<00:01:45.990> UN<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.470> creatinine<00:01:47.509> decreased<00:01:48.509> slightly

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
B UN and creatinine decreased slightly

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.469 
B UN and creatinine decreased slightly
both<00:01:48.960> by<00:01:49.110> about<00:01:49.320> 25<00:01:50.250> percent<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:51.149> pregnant

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
both by about 25 percent the pregnant

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.370 
both by about 25 percent the pregnant
people<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.960> plasma<00:01:54.960> volume<00:01:55.049> go

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
people so you have this plasma volume go

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.109 
people so you have this plasma volume go
up<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.950> might<00:01:56.430> be<00:01:56.490> wondering<00:01:56.729> what<00:01:56.880> happens

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
up you might be wondering what happens

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.330 
up you might be wondering what happens
to<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.240> red<00:01:57.390> blood<00:01:57.570> cells<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.740> count<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.189> them

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
to the red blood cells the count of them

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.740 
to the red blood cells the count of them
or<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.579> volume<00:01:59.700> of<00:02:00.000> them<00:02:00.149> well<00:02:00.509> they<00:02:00.600> also

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
or the volume of them well they also

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.300 
or the volume of them well they also
increased<00:02:01.229> our<00:02:01.259> blood<00:02:01.530> cells<00:02:01.740> count<00:02:02.159> or

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
increased our blood cells count or

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.219 
increased our blood cells count or
volume<00:02:02.549> goes<00:02:02.729> up<00:02:02.759> but<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:03.659> not<00:02:03.840> enough<00:02:04.079> to

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
volume goes up but it's not enough to

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.719 
volume goes up but it's not enough to
keep<00:02:04.350> up<00:02:04.530> with<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.710> plasma<00:02:05.189> increase<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:05.640> you

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
keep up with this plasma increase so you

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.380 
keep up with this plasma increase so you
have<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.799> dilutional<00:02:07.799> anemia<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.270> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
have a dilutional anemia so the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.010 
have a dilutional anemia so the
hematocrit<00:02:09.869> drops

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
hematocrit drops

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.500 
hematocrit drops
low<00:02:11.260> into<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.250> low<00:02:12.400> 30s<00:02:12.430> whereas<00:02:13.090> normally

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
low into the low 30s whereas normally

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.590 
low into the low 30s whereas normally
the<00:02:14.050> low<00:02:14.230> normal<00:02:14.620> value<00:02:14.890> for<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.730> woman<00:02:16.480> would

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
the low normal value for a woman would

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.990 
the low normal value for a woman would
be<00:02:16.630> 36<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.530> can<00:02:17.650> have<00:02:17.800> north<00:02:18.400> it's<00:02:18.610> normal<00:02:18.910> to

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
be 36 you can have north it's normal to

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.150 
be 36 you can have north it's normal to
have<00:02:19.120> kinetic<00:02:19.870> roots<00:02:20.110> below<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.590> when

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
have kinetic roots below that when

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.490 
have kinetic roots below that when
somebody's<00:02:21.930> pregnant<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.140> again<00:02:23.350> that's

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
somebody's pregnant and again that's

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.020 
somebody's pregnant and again that's
because<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.860> increase<00:02:24.220> in<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.430> plasma<00:02:24.610> sort

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
because the increase in the plasma sort

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.420 
because the increase in the plasma sort
of<00:02:25.090> outpaces<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.720> increase<00:02:26.140> in<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.500> RBC

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
of outpaces the increase in the RBC

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.690 
of outpaces the increase in the RBC
count<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:28.630> SVR<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.470> BP<00:02:29.800> blood<00:02:30.490> pressure

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
count the SVR and the BP blood pressure

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.960 
count the SVR and the BP blood pressure
the<00:02:31.240> decrease<00:02:31.690> in<00:02:31.990> pregnancy<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:33.370> they

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
the decrease in pregnancy and so they

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.510 
the decrease in pregnancy and so they
reach<00:02:34.210> a<00:02:34.480> bottom<00:02:35.230> ad<00:02:35.350> or<00:02:35.530> an<00:02:35.590> ad<00:02:35.770> or<00:02:35.890> around<00:02:36.220> 20

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
reach a bottom ad or an ad or around 20

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.640 
reach a bottom ad or an ad or around 20
to<00:02:36.610> 24<00:02:37.000> weeks<00:02:37.210> and<00:02:37.330> then<00:02:37.510> slowly<00:02:37.780> go<00:02:38.110> back

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
to 24 weeks and then slowly go back

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.030 
to 24 weeks and then slowly go back
towards<00:02:39.550> normal<00:02:40.080> but<00:02:41.080> should<00:02:41.230> not<00:02:41.350> not<00:02:41.860> get

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
towards normal but should not not get

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.120 
towards normal but should not not get
above<00:02:42.310> where<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.060> person<00:02:43.330> was<00:02:43.450> before<00:02:44.130> before

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
above where the person was before before

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.760 
above where the person was before before
they<00:02:45.400> were<00:02:45.490> pregnant<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:46.380> think<00:02:47.380> that<00:02:47.590> covers

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
they were pregnant I think that covers

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.550 
they were pregnant I think that covers
the<00:02:48.010> major<00:02:48.630> changes<00:02:49.630> in<00:02:49.690> in<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.290> organ

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
the major changes in in the organ

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.920 
the major changes in in the organ
systems<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.100> what's<00:02:52.030> left<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.270> talk<00:02:52.420> about<00:02:52.480> is

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
systems and what's left to talk about is

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.200 
systems and what's left to talk about is
the<00:02:53.970> endocrine<00:02:54.970> changes<00:02:55.450> so<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:57.210> placenta

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
the endocrine changes so the placenta

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.820 
the endocrine changes so the placenta
when<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:58.960> think<00:02:59.140> about<00:02:59.170> it<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.440> think<00:02:59.530> most<00:02:59.770> of

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
when you think about it I think most of

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.410 
when you think about it I think most of
us<00:02:59.920> think<00:02:59.980> about<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.340> as<00:03:00.520> a<00:03:00.550> sort<00:03:01.060> of<00:03:01.120> interface

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
us think about it as a sort of interface

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.210 
us think about it as a sort of interface
for<00:03:01.900> this<00:03:02.050> exchange<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.500> like<00:03:02.620> nutrients<00:03:03.130> and

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
for this exchange of like nutrients and

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.320 
for this exchange of like nutrients and
oxygen<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.820> sort<00:03:04.030> of<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.150> connection

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
oxygen and sort of the connection

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.790 
oxygen and sort of the connection
between<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.810> mom<00:03:04.960> and<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.350> fuse<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.620> that's

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
between the mom and the fuse and that's

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.200 
between the mom and the fuse and that's
you<00:03:06.340> know<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.430> perfectly<00:03:06.760> good<00:03:06.880> way<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.060> think

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
you know a perfectly good way to think

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.600 
you know a perfectly good way to think
about<00:03:07.330> it<00:03:07.480> that's<00:03:07.540> true<00:03:08.170> but<00:03:08.710> it's<00:03:08.800> also<00:03:08.860> think

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
about it that's true but it's also think

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.400 
about it that's true but it's also think
about<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.880> as<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.000> temporary<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:10.840> or<00:03:10.990> in<00:03:11.110> Oregon

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
about it as a temporary and or in Oregon

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.510 
about it as a temporary and or in Oregon
because<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.710> has<00:03:11.830> lots<00:03:11.980> of<00:03:12.160> endocrine

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
because it has lots of endocrine

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.280 
because it has lots of endocrine
functions<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.090> very<00:03:13.240> first<00:03:13.480> one<00:03:13.660> happens

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
functions and the very first one happens

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.900 
functions and the very first one happens
before<00:03:14.590> it's<00:03:14.710> even<00:03:14.950> called<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.340> placenta<00:03:15.760> right

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
before it's even called a placenta right

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.810 
before it's even called a placenta right
you<00:03:16.000> have<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:17.220> fertilization<00:03:18.220> then<00:03:18.640> you<00:03:18.700> have

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
you have the fertilization then you have

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.420 
you have the fertilization then you have
a<00:03:18.850> blastocyst<00:03:19.480> form<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:19.959> have<00:03:20.020> the

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
a blastocyst form and you have the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.710 
a blastocyst form and you have the
trophoblast<00:03:21.430> cells<00:03:21.459> on<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.150> outside<00:03:22.480> of<00:03:22.630> it

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
trophoblast cells on the outside of it

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.150 
trophoblast cells on the outside of it
they're<00:03:23.230> gonna<00:03:23.320> differentiate<00:03:23.950> into<00:03:24.070> the

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
they're gonna differentiate into the

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.650 
they're gonna differentiate into the
side<00:03:24.340> of<00:03:24.370> trophoblast<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:25.120> citrus<00:03:25.420> and

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
side of trophoblast and citrus and

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.150 
side of trophoblast and citrus and
social<00:03:25.990> for<00:03:26.140> glass<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.470> make<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.740> placenta

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
social for glass to make the placenta

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.780 
social for glass to make the placenta
and<00:03:27.459> they<00:03:27.580> start<00:03:27.820> producing<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:29.709> hcg<00:03:30.190> around

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
and they start producing the hcg around

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.000 
and they start producing the hcg around
the<00:03:30.880> sixth<00:03:31.150> day<00:03:31.440> after<00:03:32.440> ovulation<00:03:32.650> in<00:03:32.950> the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
the sixth day after ovulation in the

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.199 
the sixth day after ovulation in the
case<00:03:33.190> of<00:03:33.340> pregnancy

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
case of pregnancy

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.280 
case of pregnancy
so<00:03:35.080> this<00:03:35.380> HCG<00:03:36.190> is<00:03:36.250> one<00:03:36.700> of<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:36.850> very<00:03:36.940> first

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
so this HCG is one of the very first

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.240 
so this HCG is one of the very first
endocrine<00:03:38.290> type<00:03:38.440> functions<00:03:38.830> of<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:38.980> placenta

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
endocrine type functions of the placenta

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.580 
endocrine type functions of the placenta
simulates<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.180> corpus<00:03:40.570> luteum<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:41.410> produce

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
simulates the corpus luteum to produce

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.230 
simulates the corpus luteum to produce
the<00:03:41.920> progesterone<00:03:42.220> which<00:03:42.610> is<00:03:42.700> very<00:03:42.850> important

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
the progesterone which is very important

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.550 
the progesterone which is very important
for<00:03:43.300> keeping<00:03:43.570> that<00:03:43.630> demetria<00:03:44.050> mint<00:03:44.230> act<00:03:44.410> and

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
for keeping that demetria mint act and

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.130 
for keeping that demetria mint act and
also<00:03:44.650> estrogen<00:03:45.220> so<00:03:45.880> this<00:03:46.060> endocrine<00:03:46.810> function

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
also estrogen so this endocrine function

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.380 
also estrogen so this endocrine function
as<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.650> lot<00:03:47.950> as<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.220> initial<00:03:48.790> event<00:03:49.060> it<00:03:49.150> allows

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
as a lot as the initial event it allows

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.699 
as a lot as the initial event it allows
the<00:03:49.600> frames<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:49.990> be<00:03:50.050> maintained<00:03:50.500> at<00:03:50.680> the

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
the frames to be maintained at the

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:51.780 
the frames to be maintained at the
corpus<00:03:50.980> luteum<00:03:51.040> produced<00:03:51.490> of<00:03:51.550> progesterone

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
corpus luteum produced of progesterone

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.610 
corpus luteum produced of progesterone
and<00:03:52.240> the<00:03:52.420> estrogen<00:03:52.600> then<00:03:53.200> eventually<00:03:53.410> has

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
and the estrogen then eventually has

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.500 
and the estrogen then eventually has
presented<00:03:53.830> develops<00:03:54.370> by<00:03:54.850> the<00:03:55.209> end<00:03:55.360> of<00:03:55.390> the

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
presented develops by the end of the

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.860 
presented develops by the end of the
first<00:03:55.660> trimester<00:03:56.160> you<00:03:57.160> know<00:03:57.250> week<00:03:57.400> 12<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:58.209> the

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
first trimester you know week 12 the the

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.949 
first trimester you know week 12 the the
corpus<00:03:59.140> luteum<00:03:59.850> degenerates<00:04:00.850> then<00:04:01.420> placenta

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
corpus luteum degenerates then placenta

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.630 
corpus luteum degenerates then placenta
takes<00:04:02.170> over<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.770> responsibility<00:04:03.400> of<00:04:03.459> making

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
takes over the responsibility of making

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.220 
takes over the responsibility of making
the<00:04:03.910> progesterone<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.450> estrogen<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.050> so

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
the progesterone the estrogen and so

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.979 
the progesterone the estrogen and so
these<00:04:05.380> levels<00:04:05.740> rise<00:04:06.670> throughout<00:04:07.600> throughout

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
these levels rise throughout throughout

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.680 
these levels rise throughout throughout
the<00:04:08.110> pregnancy<00:04:08.290> and<00:04:08.620> they're<00:04:08.709> made<00:04:09.630> by<00:04:10.630> the

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
the pregnancy and they're made by the

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.729 
the pregnancy and they're made by the
placenta<00:04:11.730> prolactin<00:04:12.730> levels<00:04:13.350> also<00:04:14.350> arise

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
placenta prolactin levels also arise

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.409 
placenta prolactin levels also arise
throughout<00:04:15.459> pregnancy<00:04:15.670> and<00:04:16.060> I<00:04:16.120> wanted<00:04:16.330> to

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
throughout pregnancy and I wanted to

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.630 
throughout pregnancy and I wanted to
make<00:04:17.350> a<00:04:17.380> special<00:04:17.650> note<00:04:17.799> about<00:04:18.130> sort<00:04:18.400> of<00:04:18.459> the

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
make a special note about sort of the

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.360 
make a special note about sort of the
third<00:04:18.970> hormone<00:04:19.810> that<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.200> placenta<00:04:20.470> makes<00:04:20.830> it

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
third hormone that the placenta makes it

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.190 
third hormone that the placenta makes it
doesn't<00:04:21.609> get<00:04:21.729> talked<00:04:21.910> about<00:04:22.030> as<00:04:22.780> much<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.110> it

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
doesn't get talked about as much and it

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.660 
doesn't get talked about as much and it
can<00:04:23.320> be<00:04:23.380> kind<00:04:23.530> of<00:04:23.560> confusing<00:04:23.740> so<00:04:24.190> that's

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
can be kind of confusing so that's

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.830 
can be kind of confusing so that's
human<00:04:25.270> placental<00:04:26.200> lacta<00:04:27.010> Jin<00:04:27.160> HPL<00:04:27.670> so<00:04:28.660> there's

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
human placental lacta Jin HPL so there's

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.620 
human placental lacta Jin HPL so there's
two<00:04:28.960> functions<00:04:29.410> to<00:04:29.560> know<00:04:29.680> about<00:04:30.270> with<00:04:31.270> a<00:04:31.300> human

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
two functions to know about with a human

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.810 
two functions to know about with a human
placental<00:04:32.200> a<00:04:32.260> kitchen<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:32.770> so<00:04:32.950> one<00:04:33.280> is

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
placental a kitchen and so one is

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.900 
placental a kitchen and so one is
increase<00:04:34.450> in<00:04:34.480> lipolysis<00:04:35.220> so<00:04:36.220> lipolysis<00:04:36.580> is

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
increase in lipolysis so lipolysis is

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.030 
increase in lipolysis so lipolysis is
taking<00:04:37.300> a<00:04:37.390> triglyceride<00:04:37.720> glycerol<00:04:38.590> in<00:04:38.770> three

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
taking a triglyceride glycerol in three

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.920 
taking a triglyceride glycerol in three
fatty<00:04:39.280> acids<00:04:39.790> and<00:04:39.970> breaking<00:04:40.420> it<00:04:40.510> up<00:04:40.570> into<00:04:40.750> its

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
fatty acids and breaking it up into its

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.100 
fatty acids and breaking it up into its
components<00:04:41.880> so<00:04:42.880> that<00:04:43.030> increases<00:04:43.810> in<00:04:43.990> human

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
components so that increases in human

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.470 
components so that increases in human
central<00:04:44.560> action<00:04:44.830> also<00:04:45.150> causes<00:04:46.150> insulin

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
central action also causes insulin

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.780 
central action also causes insulin
resistance<00:04:47.310> interferes<00:04:48.310> with<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.490> function

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
resistance interferes with the function

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.810 
resistance interferes with the function
of<00:04:48.880> insulin<00:04:49.000> as<00:04:49.690> a<00:04:49.750> contribution<00:04:50.110> to

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
of insulin as a contribution to

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.200 
of insulin as a contribution to
gestational<00:04:51.820> diabetes<00:04:52.210> and<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:54.010> a<00:04:54.610> thought

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
gestational diabetes and the a thought

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.120 
gestational diabetes and the a thought
about<00:04:55.450> why<00:04:55.660> human<00:04:56.560> sounds<00:04:56.710> of<00:04:56.770> action<00:04:57.040> it

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
about why human sounds of action it

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.400 
about why human sounds of action it
might<00:04:57.250> cause<00:04:57.460> increase<00:04:58.120> in<00:04:58.210> lipolysis<00:04:58.540> is<00:04:58.930> you

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
might cause increase in lipolysis is you

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.030 
might cause increase in lipolysis is you
have<00:04:59.500> more<00:05:00.510> fatty<00:05:01.510> acids<00:05:02.020> that<00:05:02.260> could<00:05:02.650> they<00:05:02.830> go

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
have more fatty acids that could they go

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.300 
have more fatty acids that could they go
into<00:05:03.220> the<00:05:03.870> TCA<00:05:04.870> cycle<00:05:04.960> or<00:05:05.680> they<00:05:05.800> could<00:05:05.920> also<00:05:05.980> be

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
into the TCA cycle or they could also be

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.530 
into the TCA cycle or they could also be
used<00:05:06.460> to<00:05:06.550> make<00:05:06.670> ketones<00:05:07.060> that<00:05:07.300> sort<00:05:07.480> of

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
used to make ketones that sort of

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.030 
used to make ketones that sort of
provides<00:05:07.840> more<00:05:08.230> energy<00:05:08.560> it<00:05:08.650> might<00:05:08.800> free<00:05:09.010> up

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
provides more energy it might free up

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.030 
provides more energy it might free up
more<00:05:10.080> glucose<00:05:11.080> for<00:05:11.800> the<00:05:12.760> fetus<00:05:13.000> to<00:05:13.210> use<00:05:14.040> so

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
more glucose for the fetus to use so

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.260 
more glucose for the fetus to use so
that<00:05:15.810> that's<00:05:16.810> those<00:05:17.080> are<00:05:17.230> the<00:05:18.270> major

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
that that's those are the major

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.090 
that that's those are the major
endocrine<00:05:20.170> functions<00:05:20.620> and<00:05:20.830> we<00:05:20.890> talked<00:05:21.040> about

endocrine functions and we talked about

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.010 
endocrine functions and we talked about

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
what the change in the organ systems

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.750 
what the change in the organ systems
that's<00:05:23.230> that's<00:05:23.470> the<00:05:23.560> majority<00:05:23.920> of<00:05:23.950> it<00:05:24.130> some

people<00:05:28.510> that<00:05:28.690> seems<00:05:28.870> to<00:05:28.930> come<00:05:29.020> up<00:05:29.110> a<00:05:29.230> lot<00:05:29.610> it's

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
people that seems to come up a lot it's

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.220 
people that seems to come up a lot it's
hypercoagulable<00:05:31.060> state<00:05:31.120> and<00:05:31.870> then<00:05:31.960> there's<00:05:32.140> a

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
hypercoagulable state and then there's a

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.270 
hypercoagulable state and then there's a
difference<00:05:32.560> between<00:05:32.620> morning<00:05:33.040> sickness

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
difference between morning sickness

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.450 
difference between morning sickness
versus<00:05:33.760> hyperemesis<00:05:34.150> gravidarum<00:05:34.650> and<00:05:35.650> so<00:05:36.340> how

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
versus hyperemesis gravidarum and so how

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.130 
versus hyperemesis gravidarum and so how
do<00:05:36.520> you<00:05:36.640> decide<00:05:36.880> what's<00:05:37.180> the<00:05:37.240> sort<00:05:37.930> of<00:05:37.960> normal

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
do you decide what's the sort of normal

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.350 
do you decide what's the sort of normal
morning<00:05:38.530> sickness<00:05:38.830> versus<00:05:39.280> what's<00:05:39.490> this

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
morning sickness versus what's this

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.180 
morning sickness versus what's this
condition<00:05:41.170> and<00:05:41.380> the<00:05:41.560> way<00:05:41.650> to<00:05:41.710> decide<00:05:41.980> at<00:05:42.130> the

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
condition and the way to decide at the

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.570 
condition and the way to decide at the
first<00:05:42.370> timing<00:05:42.580> weight<00:05:42.760> loss<00:05:43.000> having<00:05:43.720> ketones

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
first timing weight loss having ketones

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.510 
first timing weight loss having ketones
then<00:05:45.580> it's<00:05:45.700> hyperemesis<00:05:46.000> gravidarum<00:05:47.280> so<00:05:48.280> this

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
then it's hyperemesis gravidarum so this

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.370 
then it's hyperemesis gravidarum so this
is<00:05:48.670> that<00:05:48.880> was<00:05:49.000> a<00:05:49.030> brief<00:05:49.600> procedure<00:05:49.900> a<00:05:49.990> calm
