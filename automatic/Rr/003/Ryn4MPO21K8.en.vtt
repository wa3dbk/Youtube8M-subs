00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.900

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.029
 Dying friends today I have one 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.490
 few intergalactic values ​​worth knowing 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.070
 facts about metroid one of my 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:29.789
 absolute favorite franchise for it 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:31.619
 So you in the Japanese 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.079
 version of metroid for the fan icon 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.329
 is similar to the bachelor of 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.350
 zelda the possibility of the game on 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.270

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.620
 in all other versions that only works 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.649
 with the help of a rather long one 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.420
 passwords show the memory levels 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.270
 even in addition to the previous one 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.850
 playing time to what actually one 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.730
 makes sense because you are looking for a 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:03.719
 fast run through the game with the 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:05.729

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.110
 planned the character model was indeed 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.850
 completely finished, however 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.890
 The developers did not have enough time 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.670
 To be a good boss opponent from him 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.310

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.590
 craig should be like riedle's 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.590
 case was a cyborg version 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.970
 in the year 2005 the rumor haunted 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.910

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.850
 series with the name metroid dredd 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.420
 However , one had planned from the 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.580
 Never play something again 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.700
