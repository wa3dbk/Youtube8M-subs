00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
oh and I got some of the pieces out in

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.310 
oh and I got some of the pieces out in
here<00:02:19.360> separate<00:02:20.020> boxes<00:02:21.780> one<00:02:22.780> is<00:02:22.990> in<00:02:23.140> each

this<00:02:34.960> fully<00:02:35.790> black<00:02:36.790> cherry<00:02:37.090> fits<00:02:37.360> call<00:02:37.660> it<00:02:37.750> one

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.500 

so<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.130> got<00:02:42.550> these<00:02:42.760> two<00:02:43.060> last<00:02:43.720> Saturday<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:46.360> now

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
so I got these two last Saturday and now

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.130 
so I got these two last Saturday and now
I'm<00:02:47.140> in<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.350> process<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.950> fixing<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.750> I

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
I'm in the process of fixing it and I

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.840 
I'm in the process of fixing it and I
don't<00:02:50.230> know<00:02:50.380> where<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.950> problem<00:02:50.980> is<00:02:51.550> with<00:02:51.760> the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
don't know where the problem is with the

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.760 
don't know where the problem is with the
blue<00:02:52.030> ones<00:02:52.240> but<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.660> keeps<00:02:52.780> tripping<00:02:53.620> the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
blue ones but it keeps tripping the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.670 
blue ones but it keeps tripping the
circuit<00:02:54.130> breakers<00:02:54.520> so<00:02:55.050> I<00:02:56.050> guess<00:02:56.260> someone<00:02:56.530> had

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
circuit breakers so I guess someone had

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.240 
circuit breakers so I guess someone had
to<00:02:56.800> find<00:02:57.040> where<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:57.700> problem<00:02:58.300> is<00:02:58.920> or<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.100> must

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
to find where that problem is or it must

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.660 
to find where that problem is or it must
have<00:03:00.459> been<00:03:00.550> just<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:02.130> wet<00:03:03.130> terminal

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670

everything was wet right here in the

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.810 
everything was wet right here in the
bottom<00:03:11.250> now<00:03:12.250> let<00:03:12.430> it<00:03:12.459> air<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.760> out<00:03:13.000> overnight
