00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.830
 hit hard 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.689
 and therefore a warm welcome too 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.690
 a new video on a channel 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:12.370
 namely the how to build a champion 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.379
 Video series and here certainly already 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.200
 have noticed the first video 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.910
 To call at no further time 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.070
 I start to waste right away 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.380
 in advance, I should say that I have two versions 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.449
 for the picture have the normal one 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.060
 standard image of reefs and the other 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.560
 the new picture with black climate which 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.359
 but not addressed in this video 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.700
 this video is focused 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.380
 for the time being only on version number one the 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.360
 second version with active still gets 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.230
 an additional video accordingly 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.700
 do not be surprised 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.340
 fang is therefore concerned with the first point 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.949
 that would be the runes we see 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.430
 speak and 15 flatrate the 72nd 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:51.219
 live and 5 percent collection per level 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.410
 as well as 50 action flat this collection 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.090
 has a very specific reason, the 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.829
 will not explain later 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.780
 That's why we're doing this 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.250
 only start with the master ries 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.469
 In itself, I do not have much to say 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.870
 except that you really get the five percent 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.250
 coal dax in the measure as needed before 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.080
 especially because of the reason later 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.970
 image builds on it 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.890
 accordingly, just catch the early gm 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.450
 image to the standard state as the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.189
 called is the longboard from the 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.799
 simple reason because sustain offers and 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.420
 cad gives accordingly you have 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.280
 already early game a relatively high with it 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.259
 output also you can do this direct 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.820
 quietly remove the putt by the here 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.740
 turn branch will come and 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.090
 In addition, also penetration thereafter 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.770
 try her as soon as possible 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.680
 boots in cool didactic boots 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.500
 expand to finally 40 percent 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.299
 to get grown exactly at 40 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.979
 percent should be achieved 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.909
 you rest as well as the measures like it 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.920
 to adjust 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.710
 Above all things threw on production 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.700
 based around that to illustrate 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.280
 I have a few gameplay 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.600
 edited together 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.700
 you can already see in this example 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.700
 how powerful the word alone is 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.450
 and in this example you can see 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.200
 how important collection is around you 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.200
 secure child 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.210
 and what timing is all about 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.210
 can 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.200
 the other music was also the extreme 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.200
 damage place with just three items 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.800
 so far as the hurley gm we go to 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.630
 with game over and which in turn 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.920
 its strongest phase has in most 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.080
 you decide from this 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.150
 point for tiamat for the simple reason 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.680
 because animal market is perfect in the 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.930
 combination of rain inserts 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.280
 then you build in heather 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.780
 or rather decides for the 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.610
 option again a kick backs too 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.500
 Buy and first on the display too 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.180
 go in most cases to which 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.550
 advise cheerful to wash especially in 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.350
 the relatively good system offers and 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.239
 also relatively stable 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.920
 Cube combination though that 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.660
 opposing team cupid forms then you should 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.489
 you also for the last one is 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.930
 scold instead of the heath 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.220
 in the end, both are single 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.380
 us for the suffering game of acting very 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.120
 important on the one hand because of the system and 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.280
 for another, because of the penetration of 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.560
 lars jasper needed to, for example, 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.220
 tanks in the car or on silently 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.200
 shred 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.840
 In the following video you can exactly 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:20.709
 look how effective this combination is 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:22.690
 collection and tiamat is exactly and 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.880
 we finally come to the late game 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.470
 There is a lot regarding the label 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.360
 possibility i will therefore you one 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.100
 few possibilities imagine a very 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.750
 offensive variation would be this 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.130
 display which in turn directly 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.170
 continues into the blood thirst 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.329
 definitely recommended if you 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.160
 more extreme has not been otherwise 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.780
 really in my opinion are full 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.459
 mainly for the reason that they 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.500
 otherwise be laid pretty fast 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.750
 So I guess you should advise too 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.030
 defensive items such as randow 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.620
 into the omen an offensive option to 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.750
 For example, the ski would defend 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.340
 meter in turn the quiksilver / 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.109
 In the end you could join 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.750
 schmideiner club offensive as well 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.609
 Defensive aspects of the items thus would have 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.310
 man system and is also against 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.630
 tc relatively unreliable other optional 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.019
 For example, items count on this 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.459
 still make patches mail &amp; guardian 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.470
 Angels relatively strong defensive old 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.390
 people with the advantage of being single 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.310
 can block and be quite honest with the 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.250
 Advantage that after the death immediately 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.539
 revived is finally part 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.919
 also two possibilities to 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.050
 form the option with 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.010
 bluetooth and randow into this picture 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.289
 mainly against teams like 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.750
 for example xslt or yes so 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.880
 relatively strong picasa or even if the 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.889
 opponent is huge and the second one 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.810
 Possibility made with us 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.909
 is mainly against teams 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.370
 are based and also relatively icc 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.810
 have 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.310
 we have thus come to the end 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.259
 I thank you for these steps 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.999
 for seeing and hope that you too 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.560
 liked the video and also 

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:49.029
 which has brought to respect 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.529
 Please forget that we are not too 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:51.849
 rate and also comment 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:53.560
 feedback helps me on 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.490
 and in this sense until next time 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.490
 four people
