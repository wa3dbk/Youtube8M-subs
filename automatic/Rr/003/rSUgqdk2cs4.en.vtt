not<00:00:44.339> qualified<00:00:44.609> to<00:00:44.879> teach<00:00:45.210> but<00:00:46.199> I<00:00:46.379> felt<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.829> was

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
not qualified to teach but I felt it was

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.439 
not qualified to teach but I felt it was
warranted<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.460> do<00:00:47.699> this<00:00:47.879> special<00:00:48.149> video

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
warranted to do this special video

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.470 
warranted to do this special video
because<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:49.379> did<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.249> cover<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.730> Betty<00:00:51.059> Wright's

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
because I did a cover of Betty Wright's

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.739

cleanup<00:00:52.109> woman<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.789> I<00:00:53.789> didn't<00:00:54.179> include<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:54.749 
cleanup woman and I didn't include the

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:56.599 
cleanup woman and I didn't include the
chords<00:00:55.230> because<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.920> was<00:00:56.010> one<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.249> my<00:00:56.309> early

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:58.910

this as short braid out as far as to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.859 
this as short braid out as far as to
play<00:01:07.079> the<00:01:07.320> guitar<00:01:07.439> riff<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.939> historical

play the guitar riff on that historical
classic<00:01:10.470> tune<00:01:10.759> because<00:01:11.759> it's<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.570> those

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
classic tune because it's one of those

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.380 
classic tune because it's one of those
risks<00:01:13.290> where<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.680> couldn't<00:01:14.130> put<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.149> words

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
risks where I couldn't put it in words

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.560 
risks where I couldn't put it in words
across<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.290> bottom<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.799> screen<00:01:17.240> it<00:01:18.240> takes

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.499 
across the bottom of the screen it takes
a<00:01:18.719> little<00:01:18.899> more<00:01:19.049> detail<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.399> more<00:01:21.329> or<00:01:21.450> less

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
a little more detail to more or less

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.920 
a little more detail to more or less
capture<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:23.310> accuracy<00:01:23.969> of<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.240> riff<00:01:24.630> and

that Betty Wright tune when he was 16

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.690 
that Betty Wright tune when he was 16
years<00:01:39.539> old<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.380> that's<00:01:40.469> interesting<00:01:40.979> but<00:01:41.490> here

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
years old so that's interesting but here

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.609 
years old so that's interesting but here
it<00:01:41.789> is<00:01:41.909> I'm<00:01:42.180> going<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.479> break<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.170> first<00:01:43.469> I'm

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
it is I'm going to break it first I'm

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.080 
it is I'm going to break it first I'm
going<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> play<00:01:44.039> it<00:01:44.100> then<00:01:44.399> I'm<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.729> show

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
going to play it then I'm going to show

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.590 
going to play it then I'm going to show
you<00:01:45.149> what<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.840> play<00:01:46.200> because<00:01:46.469> again<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.600> couldn't

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
you what I play because again I couldn't

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.550 
you what I play because again I couldn't
do<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:49.049> or<00:01:49.859> kind<00:01:50.609> of<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.939> guess<00:01:51.259> put<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.439> in

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
do this or kind of I guess put it in

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.310 
do this or kind of I guess put it in
words<00:01:52.890> across<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.969> screen<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.960> I'm<00:01:55.079> going<00:01:55.259> to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
words across the screen so I'm going to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.230 
words across the screen so I'm going to
do<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.590> now<00:01:55.770> because<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.609> a<00:01:56.640> pretty<00:01:56.939> cool

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
do it now because it is a pretty cool

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:15.390 
do it now because it is a pretty cool
riff<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:58.109> goes<00:01:58.289> something<00:01:58.619> like<00:01:58.770> this

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.720 

okay<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:16.460> this<00:02:16.700> is<00:02:16.880> what<00:02:17.030> I<00:02:17.060> did<00:02:18.310> basically<00:02:19.310> the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
okay so this is what I did basically the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.750 
okay so this is what I did basically the
first<00:02:19.970> chord<00:02:20.330> is<00:02:20.570> it's<00:02:20.870> like<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:22.370> finger

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
first chord is it's like a the finger

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.150 
first chord is it's like a the finger
grip<00:02:23.000> or<00:02:23.210> shape<00:02:23.480> of<00:02:23.660> a<00:02:23.810> D<00:02:24.020> chord<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.770> just<00:02:24.980> take

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
grip or shape of a D chord to just take

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.620 
grip or shape of a D chord to just take
that<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.610> slide<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:26.510> down<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.350> fifth<00:02:27.590> fret

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
that and slide it down to the fifth fret

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.300 
that and slide it down to the fifth fret
so<00:02:29.630> it<00:02:29.840> sounds<00:02:30.260> like<00:02:30.290> that<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.830> it<00:02:30.890> looks<00:02:31.040> like

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
so it sounds like that and it looks like

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.600 
so it sounds like that and it looks like
that<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:32.720> second<00:02:33.200> one<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:34.250> take<00:02:34.460> your

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
that the second one you take your

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.090 
that the second one you take your
fingers<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.030> bar<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.600> crust<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.500> first

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
fingers and bar the crust of the first

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.670 
fingers and bar the crust of the first
three<00:02:37.340> strings<00:02:37.760> which<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.810> G<00:02:39.050> B<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.410> E

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
three strings which is the G B and E

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.030 
three strings which is the G B and E
it's<00:02:40.370> almost<00:02:40.970> a<00:02:41.210> c11<00:02:41.900> but<00:02:42.080> not<00:02:42.410> quite<00:02:42.830> it's

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
it's almost a c11 but not quite it's

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.250 
it's almost a c11 but not quite it's
missing<00:02:43.370> one<00:02:43.400> note<00:02:43.820> so<00:02:44.180> it's<00:02:44.390> not<00:02:44.600> a<00:02:44.660> sea<00:02:44.990> level

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
missing one note so it's not a sea level

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.320 
missing one note so it's not a sea level
so<00:02:45.470> I<00:02:45.590> don't<00:02:45.770> know<00:02:45.860> what<00:02:46.010> it<00:02:46.100> is<00:02:46.220> but<00:02:46.610> just

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
so I don't know what it is but just

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:56.890 
so I don't know what it is but just
those<00:02:47.690> three<00:02:48.820> so<00:02:49.820> it<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.180> have<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.780> be

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
those three so it and you have to be

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.450 
those three so it and you have to be
careful<00:02:57.320> with<00:02:57.410> this<00:02:57.620> kind<00:02:57.890> of<00:02:57.950> rift<00:02:58.130> because

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
careful with this kind of rift because

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.030 
careful with this kind of rift because
you<00:02:59.120> run<00:02:59.300> the<00:02:59.420> risk<00:02:59.630> of<00:02:59.840> hitting<00:03:00.620> these<00:03:00.830> other

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
you run the risk of hitting these other

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.830 
you run the risk of hitting these other
notes<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:01.520> you<00:03:01.640> can't<00:03:01.880> it<00:03:02.000> on<00:03:02.120> one<00:03:02.360> so<00:03:02.600> it

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
notes that you can't it on one so it

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.140 
notes that you can't it on one so it
takes<00:03:03.320> a<00:03:03.470> little<00:03:03.620> practice<00:03:03.740> to<00:03:04.220> hit<00:03:04.850> it<00:03:05.000> clean

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
takes a little practice to hit it clean

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.600 
takes a little practice to hit it clean
and<00:03:08.150> then<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:09.230> third<00:03:09.470> note<00:03:09.800> or<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.280> third

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
and then the third note or the third

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.030 
and then the third note or the third
chord<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.380> again<00:03:12.380> I<00:03:12.410> don't<00:03:12.560> know<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:12.860> name<00:03:13.010> of

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
chord is again I don't know the name of

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.070 
chord is again I don't know the name of
it<00:03:13.310> but<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.640> take<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:14.120> your<00:03:14.480> first<00:03:14.690> finger

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
it but you take the your first finger

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.790 
it but you take the your first finger
and<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:15.709> run<00:03:15.890> across<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.640> first<00:03:16.970> fret<00:03:17.360> of

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
and you run across the the first fret of

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.590 
and you run across the the first fret of
running<00:03:18.800> across<00:03:18.890> dub<00:03:19.520> the<00:03:20.060> B<00:03:20.270> and<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.540> E

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
running across dub the B and the E

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.520 
running across dub the B and the E
string<00:03:20.930> just<00:03:21.260> those<00:03:21.410> two<00:03:21.650> two<00:03:22.340> two<00:03:22.940> strings

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
string just those two two two strings

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.710 
string just those two two two strings
then<00:03:24.530> you<00:03:24.620> take<00:03:24.830> your<00:03:25.040> second<00:03:25.580> finger<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:26.090> you

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
then you take your second finger and you

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.229 
then you take your second finger and you
put<00:03:26.989> it<00:03:27.140> on<00:03:27.320> your<00:03:28.010> g<00:03:28.250> string<00:03:28.580> on<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.850> second

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
put it on your g string on the second

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.510 
put it on your g string on the second
fret<00:03:29.270> so<00:03:29.660> it<00:03:29.750> sounds<00:03:29.989> like<00:03:30.050> this

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
fret so it sounds like this

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.250 
fret so it sounds like this
and<00:03:32.030> this<00:03:32.180> is<00:03:32.330> when<00:03:32.510> you<00:03:32.630> have<00:03:32.660> to<00:03:32.960> kind<00:03:33.170> of

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
and this is when you have to kind of

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.050 
and this is when you have to kind of
practice<00:03:33.620> because<00:03:33.950> uh<00:03:34.070> when<00:03:34.520> you<00:03:34.640> planned<00:03:34.910> it

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
practice because uh when you planned it

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.000 
practice because uh when you planned it
the<00:03:35.240> regular<00:03:35.420> speed<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:36.350> have<00:03:36.380> a<00:03:36.530> tendency<00:03:36.980> to

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
the regular speed you have a tendency to

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.980 
the regular speed you have a tendency to
hit<00:03:37.160> these<00:03:37.340> other<00:03:37.550> notes<00:03:37.850> on<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.420> top<00:03:38.690> that

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
hit these other notes on the top that

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.890 
hit these other notes on the top that
you<00:03:39.140> don't<00:03:39.320> want<00:03:39.620> so<00:03:40.210> cuz<00:03:41.210> I<00:03:41.330> even<00:03:41.570> still<00:03:41.780> have

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
you don't want so cuz I even still have

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.780 
you don't want so cuz I even still have
a<00:03:41.930> tendency<00:03:42.410> sometimes<00:03:42.440> to<00:03:43.010> hit<00:03:43.370> these<00:03:43.520> other

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
a tendency sometimes to hit these other

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.730 
a tendency sometimes to hit these other
notes<00:03:44.090> when<00:03:44.270> I<00:03:44.300> don't<00:03:44.570> want<00:03:44.630> to<00:03:44.750> hit<00:03:44.840> them<00:03:44.960> so

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
notes when I don't want to hit them so

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:59.290 
notes when I don't want to hit them so
it<00:03:45.890> sounds<00:03:46.280> like<00:03:46.370> this<00:03:46.730> and<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:58.760> change<00:03:59.090> to

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
it sounds like this and the change to

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.240 
it sounds like this and the change to
that<00:03:59.450> song<00:03:59.750> is<00:04:00.020> C<00:04:00.850> D<00:04:01.850> -7<00:04:02.630> G<00:04:02.960> minor<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:03.860> then<00:04:04.040> a

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
that song is C D -7 G minor and then a

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:24.580 
that song is C D -7 G minor and then a
sharp<00:04:04.700> so<00:04:05.060> it<00:04:22.570> and<00:04:23.570> that's<00:04:23.750> it<00:04:23.990> it<00:04:24.110> has<00:04:24.260> a<00:04:24.290> nice

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
sharp so it and that's it it has a nice

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.470 
sharp so it and that's it it has a nice
rhythmic<00:04:25.280> feel<00:04:25.490> to<00:04:25.790> it<00:04:25.850> it<00:04:25.970> feels<00:04:26.000> good<00:04:26.330> to

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
rhythmic feel to it it feels good to

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.480 
rhythmic feel to it it feels good to
actually<00:04:26.510> play<00:04:26.960> it<00:04:27.020> so<00:04:27.710> you<00:04:27.770> know<00:04:27.950> it<00:04:28.280> took<00:04:28.430> me

four strings on the guitar because of

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.720 
four strings on the guitar because of
the<00:05:12.230> other<00:05:12.440> Arrangements<00:05:13.100> the<00:05:13.160> piano<00:05:13.520> and

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
everything so they didn't have to strike

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.640

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
that's the same thing with the concept

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.090

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
three note chords to know chords because

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
they didn't want to give too much

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.020 
they didn't want to give too much
because<00:05:26.360> the<00:05:27.230> other<00:05:27.410> parts<00:05:28.010> of<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.370> musical

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
because the other parts of the musical

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.210 
because the other parts of the musical
arrangement<00:05:29.510> were<00:05:29.600> filling<00:05:29.840> in<00:05:30.050> the<00:05:30.170> gaps<00:05:30.410> so

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
arrangement were filling in the gaps so

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.070 
arrangement were filling in the gaps so
