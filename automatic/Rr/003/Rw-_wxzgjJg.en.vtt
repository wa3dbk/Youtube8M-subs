00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.500

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.630
 It's also good but I like this one 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.880
 little bit more then you have to see the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.270
 package content 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.300

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.760
 propaganda things come 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:58.340
 I think they are only available to us already 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.340
 which is from the USA look at what father 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:12.140
 so here we see the bluray and the blu 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.140
 3d ray is removed and here we have the dvd 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.569
 and we put it back and we take out the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.040
 blu-ray 3d and here we have the copy 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.940
 digital 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.390
 degrees 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.610
 and we put back the digital copy 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.850
 well many people complained about this 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.170
 movie since the dubbing was bad 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.170
 because it was done by Maria Antonieta 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.880
 the snows the chilindrina the interesting thing 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.830
 is that the director of this movie the 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.319
 American director chose her 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.120
 to fold the Lopez line was not a 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.459
 dishlatino decision or anything like this 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.680
 but like the one he lived before in the 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.510
 border and saw the guy from eight 'said 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.350
 you can be a very good voice but to 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.290
 my character and yes 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.870
 this is a pretty good edition, not the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.620
 that they sell here if you have a chance 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.960
 to buy this edition in amazon or in 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.090
 ebay buy the appointment at the opportunity 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.630
 since the version that you see here in mexico 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.910
 it is terrible terrible terrible does not come 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.760
 very complete that we say 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.450
 then I was the one with roses and see you 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.960
 the next one by someone realized 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.960
 this scene 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.810
