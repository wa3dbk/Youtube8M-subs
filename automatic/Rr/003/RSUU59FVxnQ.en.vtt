00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 the world of technology is in a climate of 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.550
 expectation this week Apple should 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.120
 show your new phone model the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.179
 iphone 5 comes and promises to mess with 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.880
 the market as its predecessors as 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.070
 there is always a lot of mystery surrounding 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.439
 launch and in recent months the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.000
 internet was populated by the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.160
 different rumors 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.039
 we got caught up with what 's more 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.640
 likely to be present on iphone 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.640
 check out 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.309
 the anxiety expectations are great 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.670
 at least for technology lovers 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.829
 and especially for fans of the apple in 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.230
 2007 the launch of the first iphone 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.300
 revolutionized the mobile phone market in 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.129
 everybody and when the next year 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.199
 iphone 3g came up 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.449
 the launch of a new model came in 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.940
 time for the annual calendar of large 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.030
 high tech world events 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:08.170
 we have already seen all this circus three others 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.869
 times in 2009 with 3gs 2010 with the 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:16.119
 birth of iphone 4 and last year with 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:18.340
 version 4 is this year very 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:22.860
 probably this week should be 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.290
 announced the long awaited iphone 5 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.170
 the anxiety of the person accompanying the subject 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.660
 is so great and a multitude of rumors 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.890
 idea came up on the internet about 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.530
 New model 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.210
 it seems the new iPhone should 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.780
 be very similar to your 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:44.360
 predecessor iPhone 4s yet 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.360
 some news should draw attention 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.330
 between all bets on videos that 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.290
 we found this to be the most 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.479
 likely 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.610
 following a market trend, the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.700
 iphone 5 should bring a larger screen 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.350
 probably somewhere around 4.7 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.210
 inch widescreen 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.759
 but there are those who believe in a total 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.610
 reformulation of the apparatus with a 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:14.190
 transparent screen or a second screen 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:16.560
 will be even greater 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.090
 the iphone 5 should be thinner than your 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.370
 predecessors 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.600
 another change in the body of the appliance is 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.610
 back part 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.620
 instead of glass the new model should 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.290
 bring some kind of metal in the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.450
 later decision knows that finally 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.670
 end up with a lot of headache 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.830
 people who had the 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.750
 iphone4 shattered 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.750
 sometimes more than once 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.600
 something else that appeared in the possible 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.250
 prototype is a new entry used for 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.300
 connect the charger and other 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.550
 equipment 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.000
 in place of the traditional pub used in 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.150
 ipods iphones and ipads since 2003 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.130
 iphone 5 should open a smaller club 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.200
 Furthermore the output to the sectors 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.380
 heard should come at the bottom 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.970
 where there will be two loudspeakers and 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.970
 more powerful than previous ones 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.660
 Speaking of sound told by around 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.990
 headphones will also be fully 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.120
 reformulated 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:24.820
 this video shows how the new 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:27.370
 iphone 5 headphones as we said in 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.160
 start the agitation is so great that what 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.840
 more are ideas and bets for the 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.600
 new apple smartphone 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.620
 These people even believe in 3d cameras 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.930
 on the device 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.570
 others say that now there will be a keyboard 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.570
 virtual designed and so on 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.000
 we digital look we also have our 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.310
 betting 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.800
 we believe that the new iphone will really be 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.950
 bigger faster and thinner 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.230
 the nfc technology that enables 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.360
 proximity of the appliance should also 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:08.709
 embedded in the version as well as 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:10.150
 4G network support good but all this is 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.280
 just rumors 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.769
 although with some foundation but 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.139
 Rumors sure will come when 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:20.169
 probably on Wednesday the 12th of 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.110
 September 2012 five announce the 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.820
