a boil we're going to crack our eggs
it's<00:00:37.649> very<00:00:37.920> important<00:00:38.399> not<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.640> get<00:00:39.030> yolks<00:00:39.420> in

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
the whites because whites look better

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.880 
the whites because whites look better
without<00:00:42.629> yolks<00:00:42.899> because<00:00:43.200> you'll<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.860> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
without yolks because you'll just have a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.360 
without yolks because you'll just have a
fat<00:00:44.190> content<00:00:45.500> they<00:00:46.500> make<00:00:46.710> all<00:00:46.890> kinds<00:00:46.950> of

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
fat content they make all kinds of

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.490 
fat content they make all kinds of
contraptions<00:00:47.820> now<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.570> help<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.930> separate

eggs<00:00:49.860> but<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.610> find<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.090> be<00:00:51.620> using<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> shell

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
eggs but I find that be using the shell

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.160 
eggs but I find that be using the shell
and<00:00:53.280> moving<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.760> yolk<00:00:53.940> back<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.390> forth<00:00:54.690> which

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
and moving the yolk back and forth which

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.650 
and moving the yolk back and forth which
works<00:00:55.440> well<00:00:55.680> if<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.670> ain't<00:00:56.760> broke<00:00:57.030> don't<00:00:57.300> fix

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
works well if it ain't broke don't fix

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.139 
works well if it ain't broke don't fix
it<00:00:58.050> now<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.680> our<00:00:58.710> eggs<00:00:58.980> are<00:00:59.129> separated<00:00:59.730> just

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
it now that our eggs are separated just

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.209

three types of buttercream which are

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
known as Italian meringue buttercream

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.680 
known as Italian meringue buttercream

buttercream<00:02:13.840> which<00:02:14.830> is<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.220> same

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
buttercream which is the same

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.120 
buttercream which is the same
ingredients<00:02:16.120> just<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.360> different<00:02:17.130> procedure

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
ingredients just a different procedure

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.260

and<00:02:19.470> American<00:02:20.470> buttercream<00:02:20.710> which<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.700> pretty

and American buttercream which I pretty

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.780

much<00:02:22.390> like<00:02:23.020> American<00:02:23.920> buttercream<00:02:24.100> is

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
much like American buttercream is

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.930 
much like American buttercream is
shortening<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:25.570> icing<00:02:26.050> sugar<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:27.370> so<00:02:27.790> it's

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
shortening and icing sugar and so it's

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.120 
shortening and icing sugar and so it's
more<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.270> frosting<00:02:28.810> or<00:02:28.960> an<00:02:29.050> icing<00:02:29.590> whereas

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
more of a frosting or an icing whereas

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.320
