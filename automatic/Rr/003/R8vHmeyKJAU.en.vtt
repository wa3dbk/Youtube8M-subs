the lower the suspension in fact you can
raise<00:05:36.090> the<00:05:36.210> suspension<00:05:36.540> by<00:05:36.840> nearly<00:05:37.080> 5

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
raise the suspension by nearly 5

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.350 
raise the suspension by nearly 5
centimeters<00:05:38.040> and<00:05:38.160> that's<00:05:38.250> enough<00:05:39.030> ground

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
centimeters and that's enough ground

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.910

that<00:05:51.840> obstacle<00:05:52.170> as<00:05:52.350> well<00:05:52.530> then<00:05:53.520> you<00:05:53.640> also<00:05:53.790> have

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
that obstacle as well then you also have

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.150 
that obstacle as well then you also have
hill<00:05:54.210> descent<00:05:54.360> control<00:05:54.600> and<00:05:55.160> gradient

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
hill descent control and gradient

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.830 
hill descent control and gradient
