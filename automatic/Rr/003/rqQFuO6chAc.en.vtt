 spare kit just in case 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.159
 I wonder how many will run with our 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.049
 product because there was already experience 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.210
 product use on previous 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.060

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.420
 delivery intensively enough 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.850
 used and there about 220 a day 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.220
 220,200 kilometers traveled therefore 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.360
 the issue of fuel economy is just that 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.360
 the moment was for me 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.950
 Hyper toilet in general, I decided all the same 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.080
 on your previous cars 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.230
 try this product company 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.140
 fofan got crazy on it 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.050
 the result is 22 percent so machine 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.480
 I had corporate money 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.780
 here and saved means earned 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.890
 correctly and then already changed a little bit 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.830
 scope of activity 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.709
 bought this car here is nissan and 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.970
 can tell by the results in 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.459
 as a result, I will say right away I donâ€™t 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.890
 it was just before using the product 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.810
 use the product of the period but I will say 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.650
 so I have a clear result 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.810
 after 4 tanks, that's what I have with 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.340
 the first day of use of the product in 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.320
 I was about 8 8 and 384 consumption 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.299
 there is an average I measure full tanks for 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.580
 the neck I often drive mode 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.320
 I drive the track in Cherkasy 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.890
 region because I live in Cherkasy and 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:26.600
 in Odessa 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:27.950
 cool it turns out and first was consumption 8 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.819
 and 3 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.010
 I paid attention to this result and 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:37.160
 after 5 tank I decided to make a paste 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.610
 repeated measurements that slightly 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.930
 honestly speaking shocked consumption was 8 and 7 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.110
 on the way to Cherkasy 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.239
 I arrived a certain mileage on 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.459
 the same smell is not exactly refueled 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.670
 Here I read the expense bored me got 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.040
 that is, there was this result on the reverse 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.940
 ways i thought he was following them 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.220
 make sure 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.230
 here on the way back on the way back 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:05.060
 limit the same experiment 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.560
 here and I figure out 7 and 7 is here 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.680
 I already understood that the product is already 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.310
 works but I noticed looking for him a little 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.780
 earlier work products since 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.639
 feel the dynamics of the car of course 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.889
 increment and there is a zone of two-liter such 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.530
 cars and know how they drive like and not 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.840
 currently lead and therefore from the first 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.300
 Tank noticed the pickup result 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.979
 the car became faster obedience 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.930
 pressed the pedal especially when u 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:34.970

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.979
