other 4.7 inch screen phones you're

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.390 
other 4.7 inch screen phones you're
going<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:18.659> find<00:02:18.930> because<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.709> bezel<00:02:20.129> which<00:02:20.250> is

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
going to find because the bezel which is

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.979 
going to find because the bezel which is
like<00:02:20.549> the<00:02:20.580> outer<00:02:20.849> perimeter<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.540> phone<00:02:21.750> is

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
like the outer perimeter of the phone is

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.990 
like the outer perimeter of the phone is
quite<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.530> bit<00:02:22.680> smaller<00:02:22.830> um<00:02:23.250> it's<00:02:23.430> it's<00:02:23.580> very

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
quite a bit smaller um it's it's very

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.759 
quite a bit smaller um it's it's very
close<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.540> screen<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.290> mean<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.530> tugs

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
close to the screen and I mean it tugs

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.619 
close to the screen and I mean it tugs
it<00:02:26.099> hugs<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.340> screen<00:02:26.549> a<00:02:26.580> lot<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:27.330> way<00:02:27.480> you're

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
it hugs the screen a lot that way you're

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:28.940 
it hugs the screen a lot that way you're
going<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.810> get<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.959> much<00:02:28.140> slimmer<00:02:28.379> or<00:02:28.709> device

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
going to get a much slimmer or device

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.199 
going to get a much slimmer or device
even<00:02:29.190> though<00:02:29.310> it's<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.430> much<00:02:29.580> bigger<00:02:29.819> screen

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
even though it's a much bigger screen

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
it's a kind of unbalanced that they

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:26.930 
it's a kind of unbalanced that they
would<00:03:26.010> make<00:03:26.099> it<00:03:26.220> so<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.340> can't<00:03:26.430> remove<00:03:26.760> the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
would make it so you can't remove the

would make it so you can't remove the
back<00:03:27.090> it'll<00:03:28.019> be<00:03:28.109> a<00:03:28.139> little<00:03:28.260> bit<00:03:28.410> better<00:03:28.470> if

back it'll be a little bit better if

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.530 
back it'll be a little bit better if
maybe<00:03:28.859> you<00:03:29.069> could<00:03:29.099> add<00:03:29.400> in<00:03:29.639> a<00:03:29.819> second<00:03:30.419> battery

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
maybe you could add in a second battery

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.120 
maybe you could add in a second battery
say<00:03:30.959> that<00:03:31.139> you<00:03:31.290> run<00:03:31.470> out<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.620> battery<00:03:31.919> life<00:03:32.010> on

say that you run out of battery life on

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.949 
say that you run out of battery life on
one<00:03:32.310> battery<00:03:32.639> and<00:03:32.849> you<00:03:33.120> can<00:03:33.269> buy<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.480> second

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
one battery and you can buy a second

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.089 
one battery and you can buy a second
batter<00:03:34.079> that<00:03:34.290> way<00:03:34.410> when<00:03:34.560> your<00:03:34.680> first<00:03:34.859> battery

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
batter that way when your first battery

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.620 
batter that way when your first battery
dies<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.519> can<00:03:35.549> throw<00:03:35.849> in<00:03:35.940> another<00:03:36.090> one<00:03:36.329> or

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
dies you can throw in another one or

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.210 
dies you can throw in another one or
maybe<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.169> could<00:03:37.319> have<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.620> double<00:03:37.980> battery

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
maybe you could have a double battery

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.250 
maybe you could have a double battery
like<00:03:38.370> I've<00:03:38.489> on<00:03:38.639> my<00:03:38.669> galaxy<00:03:39.150> s3<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.169> way

like I've on my galaxy s3 and that way

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.659 
like I've on my galaxy s3 and that way
you've<00:03:40.380> got<00:03:40.410> a<00:03:40.560> bigger<00:03:40.859> back<00:03:41.130> but<00:03:41.489> you're

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
you've got a bigger back but you're

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:42.770 
you've got a bigger back but you're
trading<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:42.120> in<00:03:42.209> for<00:03:42.359> a<00:03:42.389> lot<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.630> battery

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
trading that in for a lot of battery

trading that in for a lot of battery
power<00:03:43.280> unfortunately<00:03:44.280> they<00:03:44.340> don't<00:03:44.459> give<00:03:44.669> you

the option here it's a non-removable

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
battery pack so you're going to be

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.680 
battery pack so you're going to be

you're<00:03:51.840> sitting<00:03:52.109> at<00:03:52.169> 1.3<00:03:52.739> megapixels<00:03:53.310> this

concern<00:03:58.530> you've<00:03:58.739> got<00:03:58.829> a<00:03:58.889> 13<00:03:59.340> megapixel<00:03:59.519> rear

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
something like a 3 megapixel front
