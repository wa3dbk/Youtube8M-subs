think will probably be the coolest thing
about<00:01:23.930> this<00:01:24.930> good<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.939> you<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.090> do<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.299> at

about this good and you can do this at

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.440 
about this good and you can do this at
any<00:01:27.630> Lander<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:29.040> lander<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.610> don't<00:01:30.210> know<00:01:30.270> that

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
any Lander the lander I don't know that

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.940 
any Lander the lander I don't know that
any<00:01:30.630> other<00:01:30.780> land<00:01:31.020> would<00:01:31.200> be<00:01:31.320> useful<00:01:31.500> except

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
any other land would be useful except

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.219 
any other land would be useful except
the<00:01:32.040> one<00:01:32.159> by<00:01:32.360> sickle<00:01:33.360> which<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.630> juggernaut<00:01:34.110> or

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the one by sickle which is juggernaut or

the one by sickle which is juggernaut or
speed<00:01:34.619> Cola<00:01:34.829> cuz<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.090> one<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.270> can<00:01:36.540> get

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
speed Cola cuz on that one you can get

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.390 
speed Cola cuz on that one you can get
on<00:01:36.780> one<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.140> towers<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.829> then<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.100> can<00:01:38.280> go

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
on one of the towers and then you can go

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.310 
on one of the towers and then you can go
explore<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.850> outside<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.450> map<00:01:39.600> that

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
explore the outside of the map that

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.630 
explore the outside of the map that

well but I guess maybe he's a little
better<00:03:39.639> at<00:03:39.790> doing<00:03:39.939> this<00:03:40.150> than<00:03:40.420> me<00:03:40.540> then<00:03:41.349> I<00:03:41.560> the

easter egg on this map and

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.530 
easter egg on this map and
so<00:05:57.890> I<00:05:57.920> kind<00:05:58.250> of<00:05:58.370> boggled<00:05:58.670> out<00:05:58.820> in<00:05:58.940> mind<00:05:59.120> we

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
so I kind of boggled out in mind we

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.520 
so I kind of boggled out in mind we
can't<00:05:59.750> we<00:05:59.870> couldn't<00:06:00.080> really<00:06:00.200> figure<00:06:00.350> out

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
can't we couldn't really figure out

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.310 
can't we couldn't really figure out
because<00:06:00.590> uh<00:06:00.800> the<00:06:01.460> to<00:06:01.730> the<00:06:01.940> couple<00:06:02.270> three<00:06:02.960> last

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
because uh the to the couple three last

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.440 
because uh the to the couple three last
name<00:06:03.620> is<00:06:03.770> really<00:06:04.220> hard<00:06:04.400> to<00:06:04.550> figure<00:06:04.850> out<00:06:05.300> what

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
name is really hard to figure out what

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.990 
name is really hard to figure out what
they<00:06:05.540> are<00:06:05.800> we<00:06:06.800> tried<00:06:07.010> figuring<00:06:07.280> them<00:06:07.610> out<00:06:07.730> we

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
they are we tried figuring them out we

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.700 
they are we tried figuring them out we
think<00:06:08.030> we<00:06:08.540> figured<00:06:08.720> out<00:06:08.930> what<00:06:09.080> they<00:06:09.230> are<00:06:09.260> but

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
think we figured out what they are but

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.850 
think we figured out what they are but
we<00:06:10.550> called<00:06:10.880> and<00:06:11.090> it<00:06:11.210> wasn't<00:06:11.570> a<00:06:11.870> number<00:06:12.530> that

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
we called and it wasn't a number that

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.700 
we called and it wasn't a number that
would<00:06:13.040> pick<00:06:13.280> up<00:06:13.460> so<00:06:13.730> we're<00:06:14.720> gonna<00:06:14.870> keep<00:06:15.380> trying

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
would pick up so we're gonna keep trying

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.370 
would pick up so we're gonna keep trying
to<00:06:15.860> decipher<00:06:16.190> the<00:06:16.520> last<00:06:16.700> numbers<00:06:17.120> my<00:06:18.080> friend

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
to decipher the last numbers my friend

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.230 
to decipher the last numbers my friend
is<00:06:18.560> gonna<00:06:18.860> get<00:06:19.070> a<00:06:19.130> sniper<00:06:19.430> eventually<00:06:19.970> so<00:06:20.120> he

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
is gonna get a sniper eventually so he

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.690 
is gonna get a sniper eventually so he
can<00:06:20.360> now<00:06:20.510> figure<00:06:21.410> out<00:06:21.650> maybe<00:06:21.860> he<00:06:22.160> scopes

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:22.700 
can now figure out maybe he scopes

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.100 
can now figure out maybe he scopes
inhale<00:06:23.210> be<00:06:23.390> able<00:06:23.570> to<00:06:23.660> see<00:06:23.750> the<00:06:23.840> number<00:06:24.080> a

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
inhale be able to see the number a

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.230 
inhale be able to see the number a
little<00:06:24.320> better<00:06:24.470> but<00:06:25.370> here<00:06:25.760> I'm<00:06:25.910> going<00:06:26.000> to<00:06:26.090> show

how we can take care of a monkey around

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.310 
how we can take care of a monkey around
since<00:07:07.120> really<00:07:07.419> the<00:07:07.479> only<00:07:07.600> perk<00:07:07.900> need<00:07:08.199> is

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.320 
since really the only perk need is

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.980 
since really the only perk need is
flopper<00:07:08.650> topper<00:07:09.070> or<00:07:09.250> PhD<00:07:10.030> flopper<00:07:10.300> in<00:07:10.630> case<00:07:10.810> we

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990 
flopper topper or PhD flopper in case we

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.129 
flopper topper or PhD flopper in case we
fall<00:07:11.490> so<00:07:12.490> if<00:07:12.639> we<00:07:12.760> fall<00:07:13.030> we<00:07:13.210> can<00:07:13.360> still<00:07:13.570> live<00:07:13.840> or

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:14.139 
fall so if we fall we can still live or

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:16.290 
fall so if we fall we can still live or
when<00:07:14.979> we're<00:07:15.130> doing<00:07:15.250> the<00:07:15.490> glitch<00:07:15.699> if<00:07:15.880> we<00:07:16.000> fall

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:16.300 
when we're doing the glitch if we fall

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.060 
when we're doing the glitch if we fall
and<00:07:16.540> miss<00:07:16.780> this<00:07:17.229> roof<00:07:17.770> we<00:07:18.250> can<00:07:18.400> still<00:07:18.610> live<00:07:18.850> and

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.070 
and miss this roof we can still live and

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.210 
and miss this roof we can still live and
so<00:07:21.070> my<00:07:21.310> friend<00:07:21.610> khabar<00:07:21.880> kab<00:07:22.090> boys<00:07:22.300> down<00:07:22.540> there

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:28.780 
and it's very easy because they're only

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.070 
and it's very easy because they're only

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:34.660 
else that you have is kind of trivial

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.390 
else that you have is kind of trivial
because<00:07:34.990> you<00:07:35.290> don't<00:07:35.440> need<00:07:35.560> Juggernog<00:07:36.040> up<00:07:36.190> here

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.400 
because you don't need Juggernog up here

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.530 
because you don't need Juggernog up here
you're<00:07:36.490> obviously<00:07:36.699> not<00:07:36.880> going<00:07:37.000> to<00:07:37.180> get<00:07:37.300> hit

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:37.540 
you're obviously not going to get hit

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.070 
you're obviously not going to get hit
and<00:07:38.050> speed<00:07:38.860> Cola<00:07:39.100> wouldn't<00:07:39.430> be<00:07:39.520> a<00:07:39.570> big<00:07:40.570> issue<00:07:40.810> I

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080 
and speed Cola wouldn't be a big issue I

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.240 
and speed Cola wouldn't be a big issue I
guess<00:07:41.289> it'd<00:07:41.410> be<00:07:41.500> a<00:07:41.530> little<00:07:41.710> better<00:07:41.830> you<00:07:42.100> can

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.250 
guess it'd be a little better you can

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.529 
guess it'd be a little better you can
reload<00:07:42.490> faster<00:07:42.699> but<00:07:43.060> it<00:07:43.090> wouldn't<00:07:43.449> really

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:43.539 
reload faster but it wouldn't really

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:46.500 
reload faster but it wouldn't really
matter<00:07:44.130> standing<00:07:45.130> up<00:07:45.220> there's<00:07:45.910> no<00:07:46.060> reason<00:07:46.360> for

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.150 
matter standing up there's no reason for
that<00:07:46.539> because<00:07:46.720> you<00:07:47.110> why<00:07:47.770> would<00:07:47.830> you<00:07:47.949> need<00:07:48.100> to

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.160 
that because you why would you need to

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.000 
that because you why would you need to
run<00:07:48.370> around<00:07:48.490> up<00:07:48.820> here<00:07:48.850> and<00:07:49.840> then<00:07:50.080> a<00:07:50.110> quick

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.010 
run around up here and then a quick

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.480 
run around up here and then a quick

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:54.490 
revive is not something that anyone
