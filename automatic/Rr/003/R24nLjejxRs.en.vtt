00:00:01.315 --> 00:00:04.450
 And now a brief history of the United States of America. 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.493
 Hey guys and girls! We can begin? 

00:00:06.613 --> 00:00:09.417
 They lived, there were people in Europe called the Pilgrims, 

00:00:09.537 --> 00:00:11.838
 who were afraid of persecution. 

00:00:13.661 --> 00:00:17.607
 So that they no longer had to fear, they boarded the ship and sailed to the New World, 

00:00:17.727 --> 00:00:20.251
 - I'm completely relaxed! - I feel much safer. 

00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:24.156
 But as soon as they landed, the savages welcomed them and they were afraid again. 

00:00:24.276 --> 00:00:26.311
 - Indians! - So they shot them. 

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.982
 But even the murder of the nation did not calm them down. 

00:00:30.102 --> 00:00:32.361
 Now they started to fear each other. 

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:34.956
 - Witch! - So they started to burn witches. 

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:38.860
 In 1775 they began killing the British to be free. 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.630
 And it was a success, but they still didn't feel safe. 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.920
 And so the second addition to all whites was the right to own a gun. 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.710
 I love my gun! 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.606
 Which brings us to a brilliant idea of â€‹â€‹slavery. 

00:00:49.726 --> 00:00:53.049
 As you can see, boys and girls, whites were also afraid of work. 

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:56.540
 So they went to Africa, kidnapped thousands of blacks, took them to America 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.360
 and forced them to do the hard work for which they did not give them any money. And I don't mean: 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.110
 I'm not making money at Wal-Mart. 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.859
 I mean $ 0. Nothing! 

00:01:04.615 --> 00:01:08.057
 This has made the United States the richest state in the world. 

00:01:08.364 --> 00:01:11.233
 Do you think the money and work for free white people calmed down? 

00:01:11.353 --> 00:01:13.374
 Not at all. They got even more worried. 

00:01:13.494 --> 00:01:17.859
 That's because after 200 years of slavery, there were more blacks in the South than white men. 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.888
 You probably guess what happened next. 

00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:23.708
 The slaves began to rebel, and one master shortened. 

00:01:23.828 --> 00:01:26.585
 When the white men heard it, they were afraid and shouted: 

00:01:26.705 --> 00:01:29.117
 Don't kill me, big black men. 

00:01:29.237 --> 00:01:32.016
 Fortunately, Samuel Colt arrived at the right time 

00:01:32.136 --> 00:01:34.604
 who invented the first weapon in 1836, 

00:01:34.724 --> 00:01:37.417
 that didn't have to be recharged after every blow. 

00:01:37.537 --> 00:01:39.843
 And so all the Southerners called Yee-ha! 

00:01:39.963 --> 00:01:43.514
 But it was too late! North won a civil war and freed slaves. 

00:01:43.634 --> 00:01:46.642
 They were free now and could kill all their masters. 

00:01:46.762 --> 00:01:49.690
 And everyone was shaking: No! We die! 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.496
 But the liberated slaves did not fight, they just wanted to live in peace. 

00:01:53.616 --> 00:01:56.163
 But the whites could not be persuaded 

00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:58.542
 and therefore founded the Ku-klux-clan. 

00:01:58.662 --> 00:02:03.327
 In 1871, when the KKK was declared an illegal terrorist organization, 

00:02:03.447 --> 00:02:06.590
 another group was established: National Shooting Association (NRA). 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.811
 Politicians soon adopted the law 

00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:11.623
 who banned blacks from owning weapons. 

00:02:11.743 --> 00:02:15.220
 It was a great year for America, KKK and NRA. 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.453
 Though they had nothing to do with each other and it was just coincidence, 

00:02:18.573 --> 00:02:20.720
 that one took care of the Arms Act 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.861
 and the other was killing and lynching blacks. 

00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:25.239
 And so it went until 1955, 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.471
 when one black woman refused to sit in the bus at the back. 

00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:30.221
 White did not believe their eyes: 

00:02:30.341 --> 00:02:32.110
 - What does? - What's going on? 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.819
 Suddenly hell broke out and the blacks began to demand their rights. 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.956
 The white men were afraid to walk the streets and cried: 

00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:40.873
 Run! Run! 

00:02:41.183 --> 00:02:45.465
 So they fled to the suburbs where everything was white, safe and clean. 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.011
 And they bought 250 million weapons 

00:02:48.131 --> 00:02:51.943
 and locks for doors and alarms for houses and fences around their neighborhoods. 

00:02:52.063 --> 00:02:55.670
 Finally, everyone was safe and there was nothing to worry about. 

00:03:01.927 --> 00:03:04.893
 And they all lived happily ever after.
