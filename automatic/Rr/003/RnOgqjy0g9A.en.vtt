00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.470
 the temperature in estepona for six 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.339
 days has been 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.339
 fifteen 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:17.250
 25 22 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:21.869
 18 and 20 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.810
 It is worth calculating the average fashion and 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.640
 median of that distribution for 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.640
 calculate the average that needs to be done 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.130
 and add all the numbers and divide it 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.130
 between how much 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.020
 120 in 36 how much is 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.730
 how much is 120 between 6 does not do it 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.730
 lack of calculator 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.870
 I just had to remember the table 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.870
 multiply that number x 6 of 12 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.820
 2 and 0 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:30.070
 The average temperature is 20 degrees 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.480
 to calculate fashion 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.480
 what number is repeated more 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.700
 twenty 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.350
 because it is twice and to do in the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.350
 medium you have to do 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.260
 I have explained it to you already 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.930
 tell me no, that's not what the 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.840
 median has not said the median 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.550
 first the numbers are ordered from the 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:09.690
 smaller to the largest 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:15.280
 15 18 20 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:17.260
 20 22 and 25 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.670
 and the number that is between 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.670
 what number is in the middle 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.660
 and the 220 s are added 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.660
 very well 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.340
 40 between 12 and 20 first next 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.760
 shot a die 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.370
 and you have to write what 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.890
 we are doing 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.060
 so that later you can go over in your house 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.400
 the exercises 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.080
 I have not seen you write this one 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:08.640
 written because this one you're going to write 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.640
 we throw a dice 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.380
 ten times 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.220
 and we go out 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.220
 the following numbers 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.360
 63 44 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.060
 6 2 2 1 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.780
 make a table with the absolute frequency 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.709
 and the relative frequency of each number 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:00.569
 the absolute frequency 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.569
 the die has six faces 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.910
 the absolute frequency is achieved 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:13.350
 counting each the one I put 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:15.900
 sticks once on 6 once on 3 on 4 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.049
 the 4 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.680
 is 6 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.680
 the 2 the 2 the 1 and the 4 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.879
 and the absolute frequency is the number of 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.879
 sticks 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.289
 twenty-one 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.729
 302 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.729
 and what is the relative frequency 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.620
 the relative frequency is the frequency 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.889
 absolute match the total of numbers 2 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.310
 match 10 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:59.510
 2 matches 10 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.510
 1 game 10 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.510
 match 10 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.510
 but party 10 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.129
 and it is already 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.129
 if you want, you put it in decimal form 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:27.040
 and the sum of all the frequencies 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:30.840
 relative has to be 102 040 508 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.840
 + 0 2 1 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.389
 and this is the whole subject
