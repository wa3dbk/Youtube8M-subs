a couple different builds but the most
i've<00:00:24.750> been<00:00:25.019> successful<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.789> start<00:00:27.119> off

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
i've been successful is you start off

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.640 
i've been successful is you start off
with<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.170> health<00:00:28.789> region<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.179> one<00:00:31.109> mana<00:00:31.380> pot

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
with the health region and one mana pot

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.389 
with the health region and one mana pot
then<00:00:32.189> from<00:00:32.520> there<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:33.090> go<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:34.190> usually<00:00:35.190> would

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
then from there you go to usually would

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.840 
then from there you go to usually would
be<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.940> dimmer<00:00:36.930> Curie<00:00:37.170> treads<00:00:37.559> but<00:00:37.950> sometimes

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
be the dimmer Curie treads but sometimes

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.500 
be the dimmer Curie treads but sometimes
i<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.719> go<00:00:39.899> ninja<00:00:40.260> tabi<00:00:40.469> depending<00:00:41.219> on

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
i like to go ninja tabi depending on

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.610 
i like to go ninja tabi depending on
what<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.079> enemy<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:44.000> then<00:00:45.000> after<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:46.379> get

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
what is the enemy and then after you get

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.869 
what is the enemy and then after you get
these<00:00:47.430> three<00:00:48.110> you<00:00:49.110> go<00:00:49.260> straight<00:00:49.800> into<00:00:50.039> making

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
these three you go straight into making

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.010 
these three you go straight into making
uh<00:00:50.960> that<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:51.989> phage<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.480> immediately<00:00:54.480> after

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
uh that the phage and immediately after

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.889 
uh that the phage and immediately after
you<00:00:55.170> get<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.469> phage<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.340> complete<00:00:56.879> your<00:00:56.910> war

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
you get the phage you complete your war

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.860 
you get the phage you complete your war
Moggs<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.440> then<00:00:59.100> go<00:00:59.280> back<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.120> phage<00:01:00.420> and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
Moggs and then go back to the phage and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.740 
Moggs and then go back to the phage and
then<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.829> complete<00:01:02.340> your<00:01:02.640> frozen<00:01:03.239> mallet<00:01:03.570> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
then you complete your frozen mallet and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.990 
then you complete your frozen mallet and
those<00:01:04.019> are<00:01:04.140> your<00:01:04.229> core<00:01:04.500> build<00:01:04.769> really<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.549> most

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
those are your core build really in most

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.539 
those are your core build really in most
games<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.200> played<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.770> was<00:01:08.040> my<00:01:08.220> core

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
games that I played that was my core

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.429 
games that I played that was my core
build<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.420> was<00:01:09.540> experimenting<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
build and I was experimenting with the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.210 
build and I was experimenting with the
third<00:01:12.020> equip<00:01:13.020> or<00:01:13.320> fourth<00:01:13.650> equipment<00:01:14.040> stuff

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
third equip or fourth equipment stuff

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.140 
third equip or fourth equipment stuff
and<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.850> know<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:16.290> ad<00:01:16.830> musze<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.850> Munson

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
and I you know the ad musze that Munson

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.380 
and I you know the ad musze that Munson
pillar<00:01:18.509> was<00:01:18.840> was<00:01:19.380> pretty<00:01:19.740> good<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.000> found

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
pillar was was pretty good but I found

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.039 
pillar was was pretty good but I found
that<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.590> life<00:01:23.280> still<00:01:23.610> would<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.090> better

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
that a life still would be better

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.340 
that a life still would be better
beneficial<00:01:25.950> however<00:01:27.049> since<00:01:28.049> you're<00:01:28.200> going<00:01:28.290> to

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
beneficial however since you're going to

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.109 
beneficial however since you're going to
be<00:01:28.439> slowing<00:01:28.680> them<00:01:28.890> down<00:01:28.920> what<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.400> decided<00:01:29.970> to

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
be slowing them down what I decided to

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.630 
be slowing them down what I decided to
do<00:01:30.329> was<00:01:30.570> give<00:01:30.840> them<00:01:30.869> give<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.040> that

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
do was give them give it with that that

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.600 
do was give them give it with that that
axe<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.329> Black<00:01:33.570> Cleaver<00:01:33.930> because<00:01:34.770> then<00:01:35.460> it

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
axe the Black Cleaver because then it

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.780 
axe the Black Cleaver because then it
would<00:01:35.700> reduce<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:37.320> armor<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> enemy

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
would reduce the the armor of the enemy

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.060 
would reduce the the armor of the enemy
so<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.299> do<00:01:39.509> more<00:01:39.720> damage<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.920> best

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
so you can do more damage so the best

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.550 
so you can do more damage so the best
way<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> build<00:01:41.840> renekton<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:42.990> found<00:01:43.320> out

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
way to build renekton that I found out

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.330 
way to build renekton that I found out
is<00:01:43.799> by<00:01:44.670> building<00:01:44.939> him<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:46.409> lots<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.009> lots<00:01:47.100> of

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
is by building him with lots and lots of

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.789 
is by building him with lots and lots of
health<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.420> course<00:01:48.659> my<00:01:48.810> runes<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.290> go<00:01:49.649> with

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
health and of course my runes I go with

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.130 
health and of course my runes I go with
my<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.220> rammus<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:50.909> I'm<00:01:50.970> not<00:01:51.119> done<00:01:51.360> yet<00:01:51.390> I'm<00:01:51.960> not

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
my I rammus and I'm not done yet I'm not

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.319 
my I rammus and I'm not done yet I'm not
done<00:01:52.380> yet<00:01:52.409> because<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.520> my<00:01:53.640> rammus<00:01:54.060> build

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
done yet because this is my rammus build

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.539 
done yet because this is my rammus build
bum<00:01:54.540> going<00:01:54.750> with<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.530> he'll<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:55.979> more

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
bum going with it so he'll have more

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.630 
bum going with it so he'll have more
armor<00:01:57.409> putting<00:01:58.409> more<00:01:58.500> armor<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.369> i

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
armor putting more armor and and and i

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.980 
armor putting more armor and and and i
decided<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.119> do<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.329> instead<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.840> more

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
decided to do that instead of the more

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.620 
decided to do that instead of the more
health<00:02:01.259> because<00:02:01.710> more<00:02:02.460> armor<00:02:02.850> means<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.360> have

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
health because more armor means you have

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.690 
health because more armor means you have
to<00:02:03.659> penetrate<00:02:04.200> through<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.799> armor<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.340> get<00:02:05.520> to

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
to penetrate through the armor to get to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.510 
to penetrate through the armor to get to
his<00:02:05.820> health<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:06.930> put<00:02:07.320> then<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.129> all

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
his health so I put then that and all

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.790 
his health so I put then that and all
cool<00:02:08.910> down<00:02:09.119> ruins<00:02:09.390> for<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.599> blue<00:02:09.810> I'll<00:02:10.200> cool

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
cool down ruins for the blue I'll cool
