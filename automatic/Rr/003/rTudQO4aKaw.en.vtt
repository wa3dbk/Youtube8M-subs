00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
from that particular decision about ten

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.840 
from that particular decision about ten

sum than the myriad and to me that means

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.829 
sum than the myriad and to me that means

that this field completely opens up and

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.609 
that this field completely opens up and
it<00:01:05.500> will<00:01:05.740> allow<00:01:06.689> companies<00:01:07.689> to<00:01:07.929> go<00:01:08.200> forward
