00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:04.759
 "Many people have asked me you're back percent and Hua if it already 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.070
 for years now way with apple products 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.759
 you can not just do it 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.139
 a bit and we have trouble showing thieves the maybe easy 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:13.199
 to be able to solve 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:17.300
 The man of today directly to him was already a very interesting topic to us 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.669
 was 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:23.369
 the hitherto very common these chaps are small keyboards from Apple but I am 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.859
 work wonderfully well here via Bluetooth 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.710
 clean thing place on the desk 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.970
 but you also have a few drawbacks you do not have this 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.210
 push this Phnom Penh Zberg 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.220
 and indeed to none took away 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.910
 Noront put in writing to quantify but not many do not come like that 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.089
 good with right or bolt is not 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:44.690
 always have 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.710
 and if so a lot of people would like to have a Windows Vista Tour on 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.300
 connected to the Mac and heard many times 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.620
 here we have them too so here could i see not only from 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.030
 Percent 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.150
 Windows pages I have such a very thick Microsoft that though that was synonymous 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.190
 not cheap at all 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.500
 and this ergonomically shaped has so beautiful editions 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.060
 and the possibility also 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.700
 and my mac right here on my iMac 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.350
 and she is ready to go 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.880
 you just have to connect them via USB 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.970
 and then you lay down the appropriate software for and has, for example, goal 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.040
 from Microsoft 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.869
 in Wersen there were directly CDs then he was percent or one 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.869
 And they are not looking for the product name on the Internet 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.530
 Logitech is the same 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.060
 But there is a sign that Bayern Bavaria can take note of 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.440
 b and although now here in this team already go with us 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.720
 Prince Philip understands 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.720
 so how easy in the system settings and dock 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.369
 and if it will not be so well then it seems that you too 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.040
 Microsoft mouse Max Hoff keyboard 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.430
 or here also percent Logitech Control Center 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.790
 and thus have to be daredevils 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.670
 Therefore, ask from time to time more so that the internally are simply on Optic 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.529
 so and then we are survey 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:12.299
 Here you can now adjust the individual things 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:15.819
 going on and so on percent 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.319
 SMA Solar 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.969
 you can go into detail but you do not care about it here 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.979
 At least at Microsoft they try their power options Red 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:26.949
 it is exactly because of it itself 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:30.039
 the cti- the option windows and all buttons 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:32.939
 exchange and we actually need that for 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.189
 The children here with the way that should activate 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.769
 has against the background 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.769
 Beijing does not always compare the truth 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.739
 we see here 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.849
 the Space is supposed to hit the space bar in the middle 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.079
 Company is on the 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.489
 Keyboards my apple trees the komanis 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.559
 and there Le Maire Salt 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:00.629
 for this - the car is there exactly the opposite is the case for food then wait 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:01.909
 he is old 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.000
 and then you can get one now is the windows button you get 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:07.559
 sampled longer than this one in Haiti 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:11.519
 so Mendes is but swap is the same as here then you can so 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:12.919
 not at all wrong 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.529
 Here you have the app for the country directly 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.699
 is still age on small but now 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:22.039
 If you work only more Mac then you can with the small apple 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:25.269
 Sticker TataufklÃ¤rung so we can do 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.269
 or merchant or whatever 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:31.560
 So it's a good job but keep it up 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.899
 and do not get confused 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:38.779
 then you just have to pay attention to that for example if you have a boot camp 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:41.309
 Silly Windows has run on the Mac 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:44.109
 then the council needed new states 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.159
 and that it so that you can also use the NEC keyboard 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:51.069
 if you keep the alt key when Neustadt so you between the 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.099
 single operating system can change 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.859
 "Of course I have to do that now 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.909
 if I sell this off since I did not hold that button 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.539
 You have to keep this almost because of the year 

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:03.360
 around 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.309
 virtually with me 

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:07.309
 take now 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:11.059
 third in the MAK that the app for the 2 but before starts 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.969
 still think that it's the old-style key 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:16.969
 important so listen now can 

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.319
 yes, otherwise have fun with the at least the 2 2 on the Mac 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.210
 In the meantime, one of the main drawers of French fries also left 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.060
 if, for example, at any time goals but something has so applications like 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.129
 actually times even 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:34.219
 frequently - were used 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:36.639
 then you can mark other things and then 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.880
 you really only that removes that 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.840
 No, I can also delete something 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.910
 b otherwise you have to do it a bit 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.659
 could have complicated and on the mac that nature 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:49.499
 you could keep ESPN 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:51.330
 and then dax-vestor de 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.949
 the vacancy as well 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.289
 what if the same function 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.639
 otherwise leaves open if that does not work with the internally 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.689
 if I hear something internally 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:04.339
 If the other one jumps, you could also adjust yourself manually 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:07.309
 Nonsense is not so strange then I have to go back here 

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:10.729
 the now valued key combination you join 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.680
 Pick up backspace 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.779
 to delete that is also possible 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:19.150
 and who graces in this case embarrassing the Windows the car on Mac 

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:21.600
 has "Old gr" from Baxter's 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.710
 then I can do what we already do 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.199
 it's not that easy 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:29.300
 This is how the keyboard shortcuts work 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.469
 for example 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:32.990
 if I want to open a folder now 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.170
 then i can get the old ones here 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.990
 and especially customers 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.210
 For example, the place feels or "old" 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.150
 is he alright at Rapid the accident now goes up too 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.289
 still high Robbie folder under 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:51.530
 everyone graced our new drafted and climbed down Euro 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.860
 just for comparison other factors 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.860
 yes it is very complicated 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.939
 Therefore, that actually I have here on the side of me sometimes off 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:02.610
 the beer 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.099
 but do not deduce 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:06.999
 down and up 

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:10.379
 and folder structure go down or clock 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.569
 I can here you hold it the use we now exchange something 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:17.009
 my has been scanned 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.080
 yes because there are still questions then he writes to his comments 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.099
 our 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:24.960
 APA because there are still many questions on New Year we lost 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.059
 and who else sometimes up to listen
