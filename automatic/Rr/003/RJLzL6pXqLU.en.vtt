00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.880 
it up as well just like you're doing the
iPhone<00:02:49.780> which<00:02:49.870> is<00:02:49.990> a<00:02:50.020> pretty<00:02:50.170> simple<00:02:50.440> method

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
iPhone which is a pretty simple method

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.490 
iPhone which is a pretty simple method
but<00:02:51.040> effective<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.870> does<00:02:53.020> have<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.230> cellar

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
but effective it does have a cellar

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.810 
but effective it does have a cellar
monitor<00:02:53.830> in<00:02:53.890> there<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.400> cellar<00:02:54.610> arm

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
monitor in there and the cellar arm

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.280 
monitor in there and the cellar arm
looks<00:02:55.000> actually<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.600> little<00:02:55.900> bit<00:02:56.020> part<00:02:56.260> a

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
looks actually a little bit part a

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.510 
looks actually a little bit part a
little<00:02:56.350> bit<00:02:56.530> better<00:02:56.680> than<00:02:56.860> what<00:02:57.010> you<00:02:57.160> find<00:02:57.190> in

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
little bit better than what you find in

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.010 
little bit better than what you find in
the<00:02:57.580> iPhone<00:02:57.940> right<00:02:58.060> now<00:02:58.270> it<00:02:58.600> also<00:02:58.720> has<00:02:58.930> the

ambient<00:02:59.440> light<00:02:59.530> sensor<00:02:59.860> so<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.430> can<00:03:00.580> heighten

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
ambient light sensor so it can heighten

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.900

systems which is a company that Apple

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.440 
systems which is a company that Apple
actually<00:03:21.160> bought<00:03:21.310> up<00:03:21.460> a<00:03:21.550> few<00:03:21.730> years<00:03:21.940> ago<00:03:22.090> and

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
actually bought up a few years ago and

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.150 
actually bought up a few years ago and
so<00:03:22.870> they<00:03:22.960> got<00:03:23.080> their<00:03:23.230> own<00:03:23.260> processors<00:03:23.860> test

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
so they got their own processors test

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.290 
so they got their own processors test
processor<00:03:24.640> and<00:03:24.790> in<00:03:24.850> here<00:03:25.030> so<00:03:25.150> you're<00:03:25.240> looking

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
processor and in here so you're looking

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.420 
processor and in here so you're looking
at<00:03:25.480> trying<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:25.780> get<00:03:25.900> away<00:03:26.020> from<00:03:26.140> using<00:03:26.950> Intel

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
at trying to get away from using Intel

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.100 
at trying to get away from using Intel
and<00:03:27.580> go<00:03:27.670> to<00:03:27.730> their<00:03:27.970> model<00:03:28.750> with<00:03:28.870> just<00:03:29.020> a

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
and go to their model with just a

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.420 
and go to their model with just a
company<00:03:29.380> that<00:03:29.560> can<00:03:29.650> do<00:03:29.770> every<00:03:30.130> single<00:03:30.250> thing

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
company that can do every single thing

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.950 
company that can do every single thing
for<00:03:30.700> their<00:03:30.790> products<00:03:31.120> for<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.270> most<00:03:31.450> part<00:03:31.690> and

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
for their products for the most part and

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.450 
for their products for the most part and
so<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:32.410> using<00:03:32.620> that<00:03:32.710> process<00:03:33.100> and<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.310> people

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
so the using that process and the people

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.830 
so the using that process and the people
got<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.820> hands<00:03:33.970> on<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.210> said<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.390> processor

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
got the hands on it said the processor

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.070 
got the hands on it said the processor
is<00:03:34.960> very<00:03:35.200> speedy<00:03:36.150> moving<00:03:37.150> around<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.510> OS<00:03:37.870> of

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
is very speedy moving around the OS of

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.460 
is very speedy moving around the OS of

actually<00:03:41.860> was<00:03:41.980> pretty<00:03:42.130> smooth<00:03:42.490> pretty<00:03:42.520> fast

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
actually was pretty smooth pretty fast

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.720 
actually was pretty smooth pretty fast
and<00:03:43.330> efficient<00:03:43.720> now<00:03:44.350> looking<00:03:44.590> at<00:03:44.710> the<00:03:44.800> OS<00:03:45.220> it's

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
and efficient now looking at the OS it's

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.970 
and efficient now looking at the OS it's
just<00:03:46.000> really<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.300> basically<00:03:46.630> a<00:03:46.720> big<00:03:46.960> iPhone<00:03:47.740> or

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
can be able to use Skype on this is

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.399 
can be able to use Skype on this is
especially<00:05:27.879> get<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.180> data<00:05:28.360> plan<00:05:28.629> so<00:05:29.110> that<00:05:29.139> can

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
especially get the data plan so that can

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:31.080 
especially get the data plan so that can
work<00:05:29.440> out<00:05:29.710> for<00:05:29.889> you<00:05:30.039> and<00:05:30.219> pictures<00:05:30.909> other

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
work out for you and pictures other

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.430 
work out for you and pictures other
people<00:05:31.330> make<00:05:31.479> some<00:05:31.659> applications<00:05:32.199> to<00:05:32.259> be<00:05:32.349> able

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
people make some applications to be able

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.140 
people make some applications to be able
to<00:05:32.590> do<00:05:32.650> some<00:05:32.830> wrong<00:05:33.009> phone<00:05:33.460> calling<00:05:33.819> over<00:05:33.969> it

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
to do some wrong phone calling over it

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.480 
to do some wrong phone calling over it
so<00:05:34.569> I<00:05:35.080> think<00:05:35.500> the<00:05:35.680> lack<00:05:35.860> of<00:05:35.889> the<00:05:36.099> camera<00:05:36.400> is

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
so I think the lack of the camera is

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:37.620 
so I think the lack of the camera is
actually<00:05:36.729> a<00:05:36.789> big<00:05:36.940> thing<00:05:37.120> because<00:05:37.389> everybody

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
actually a big thing because everybody

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.420 
actually a big thing because everybody
expected<00:05:38.139> a<00:05:38.199> camera<00:05:38.469> in<00:05:38.590> it<00:05:38.710> I<00:05:38.889> don't<00:05:39.279> think

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
expected a camera in it I don't think

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.920 
expected a camera in it I don't think
it's<00:05:39.550> that<00:05:39.580> much<00:05:39.909> travel<00:05:40.360> to<00:05:40.449> actually<00:05:40.779> put<00:05:40.900> a

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
it's that much travel to actually put a

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.360 
it's that much travel to actually put a
camera<00:05:41.199> in<00:05:41.289> it<00:05:41.440> I<00:05:41.529> don't<00:05:41.680> see<00:05:41.830> why<00:05:42.039> not<00:05:42.310> but

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
camera in it I don't see why not but

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.950 
camera in it I don't see why not but
they<00:05:42.699> probably<00:05:42.880> net<00:05:43.300> for<00:05:43.449> the<00:05:43.539> next<00:05:43.750> model

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
they probably net for the next model

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.469 
they probably net for the next model
give<00:05:44.199> you<00:05:44.259> some<00:05:44.440> some<00:05:44.919> reason<00:05:45.190> to<00:05:45.279> upgrade<00:05:45.669> but

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
give you some some reason to upgrade but

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.170 
give you some some reason to upgrade but
I<00:05:46.539> think<00:05:46.750> overall<00:05:47.080> the<00:05:47.169> iPad<00:05:47.710> is<00:05:47.979> a<00:05:48.610> good

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
I think overall the iPad is a good

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.820 
I think overall the iPad is a good
device<00:05:49.479> for<00:05:49.539> the<00:05:49.990> market<00:05:50.349> that<00:05:50.469> is<00:05:50.590> going

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
device for the market that is going

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.769 
device for the market that is going
after<00:05:51.009> I've<00:05:51.669> got<00:05:51.789> a<00:05:51.849> nice<00:05:52.000> low<00:05:52.150> argument<00:05:52.539> India

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:52.779 
after I've got a nice low argument India

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:54.240 
after I've got a nice low argument India
and<00:05:53.169> Ustream<00:05:53.469> talking<00:05:53.770> about<00:05:53.919> whether<00:05:54.099> this

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
and Ustream talking about whether this

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.740 
and Ustream talking about whether this
thing<00:05:54.490> is<00:05:54.520> actually<00:05:54.969> worth<00:05:55.120> getting<00:05:55.509> and

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
thing is actually worth getting and

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.420 
thing is actually worth getting and
eventually<00:05:56.259> where<00:05:56.379> I<00:05:56.409> came<00:05:56.500> to<00:05:56.860> my<00:05:57.039> opinion<00:05:57.340> on

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
eventually where I came to my opinion on

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.860 
eventually where I came to my opinion on
that<00:05:57.520> I<00:05:57.580> think<00:05:57.759> that<00:05:57.909> if<00:05:58.210> you<00:05:58.330> have<00:05:58.419> an<00:05:58.539> iPod

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
that I think that if you have an iPod

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.719 
that I think that if you have an iPod
Touch<00:05:59.110> or<00:05:59.199> iPhone<00:05:59.440> you<00:05:59.919> may<00:06:00.250> not<00:06:00.400> need<00:06:00.490> to<00:06:00.550> get

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
Touch or iPhone you may not need to get

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:01.800 
Touch or iPhone you may not need to get
it<00:06:00.849> may<00:06:01.000> not<00:06:01.120> be<00:06:01.270> for<00:06:01.389> you<00:06:01.509> you're<00:06:01.659> probably

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
it may not be for you you're probably

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.559 
it may not be for you you're probably
not<00:06:02.020> to<00:06:02.080> spend<00:06:02.289> the<00:06:02.349> money<00:06:02.529> for<00:06:02.590> it<00:06:03.360> but<00:06:04.360> if<00:06:04.479> you

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:04.569 
not to spend the money for it but if you

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:06.059 
not to spend the money for it but if you
always<00:06:04.810> been<00:06:05.020> wanting<00:06:05.259> like<00:06:05.349> an<00:06:05.469> iPod<00:06:05.830> Touch

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:07.479 
or iPhone just don't want to get it for

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:09.300 
or iPhone just don't want to get it for
some<00:06:07.629> reason<00:06:07.960> you're<00:06:08.500> stuck<00:06:08.650> in<00:06:08.770> the<00:06:08.830> contract

can still run nearly virtually all the

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:17.610 
can still run nearly virtually all the

applications run right out the box you

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:23.159 
applications run right out the box you
can<00:06:22.060> run<00:06:22.210> them<00:06:22.330> and<00:06:22.419> they<00:06:22.509> can<00:06:22.659> actually<00:06:22.779> scale

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
can run them and they can actually scale

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.080 
can run them and they can actually scale
up<00:06:23.409> so<00:06:23.590> you<00:06:23.680> can<00:06:23.800> open<00:06:24.009> up<00:06:24.190> the<00:06:24.310> application<00:06:24.430> it

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
up so you can open up the application it

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.820 
up so you can open up the application it
looks<00:06:25.360> kind<00:06:25.750> of<00:06:25.779> just<00:06:25.960> the<00:06:26.139> same<00:06:26.319> size<00:06:26.560> that<00:06:26.590> it

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
looks kind of just the same size that it

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.350

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
full screen of the device so that's

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.769

so either way back to the back to the

so either way back to the back to the
point<00:06:53.080> here<00:06:53.260> the<00:06:53.980> device<00:06:54.370> is<00:06:54.580> kind<00:06:54.760> of<00:06:54.820> going

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 
point here the device is kind of going

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.820 
point here the device is kind of going
for<00:06:55.120> that<00:06:55.210> niche<00:06:55.390> market<00:06:55.780> kinda<00:06:56.080> that<00:06:56.320> Amazon

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:56.830 
for that niche market kinda that Amazon

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.550 
for that niche market kinda that Amazon
Kindle<00:06:57.310> iPod<00:06:57.760> type<00:06:58.120> of<00:06:58.240> market<00:06:58.600> I<00:06:58.750> think<00:06:59.260> for

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
Kindle iPod type of market I think for

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.140 
Kindle iPod type of market I think for
the<00:06:59.620> prices<00:07:00.010> starting<00:07:00.280> at<00:07:00.340> $4.99<00:07:00.820> that's<00:07:01.000> not

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150 
the prices starting at $4.99 that's not

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.390 
the prices starting at $4.99 that's not
a<00:07:01.180> bad<00:07:01.390> deal<00:07:01.570> at<00:07:01.750> all<00:07:01.840> not<00:07:02.740> a<00:07:02.770> bad<00:07:02.890> day<00:07:03.040> at<00:07:03.310> all

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 
a bad deal at all not a bad day at all

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.740 
a bad deal at all not a bad day at all
so<00:07:03.550> it's<00:07:03.670> a<00:07:03.730> pretty<00:07:03.910> good<00:07:04.000> deal<00:07:04.300> there

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.750 
so it's a pretty good deal there
