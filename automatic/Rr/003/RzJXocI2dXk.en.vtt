00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
backwards and upside down well this is

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.819 
backwards and upside down well this is
very<00:01:16.829> unique<00:01:17.189> because<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.240> only

most of our individuals with these cases

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.609 
most of our individuals with these cases
work<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.600> well<00:01:24.780> together<00:01:24.869> we<00:01:25.259> had<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.530> have
