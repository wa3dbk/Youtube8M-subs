is<00:02:20.970> it's<00:02:21.180> no<00:02:21.300> good<00:02:22.010> but<00:02:23.010> if<00:02:23.220> we're<00:02:23.430> an<00:02:23.550> old

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
is it's no good but if we're an old

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.490 
is it's no good but if we're an old
we're<00:02:26.700> an<00:02:26.760> old<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:27.270> kerosene<00:02:27.930> heater<00:02:28.230> it

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
we're an old a kerosene heater it

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.050 
we're an old a kerosene heater it
actually<00:02:29.040> has<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> few<00:02:30.210> nice<00:02:31.040> features<00:02:32.040> such<00:02:33.030> as

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
actually has a few nice features such as

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.010 
actually has a few nice features such as
the<00:02:33.930> safety<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.860> keeps<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:36.450> see<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.780> weight

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
the safety it keeps you see that weight

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.640 
the safety it keeps you see that weight
that<00:02:37.260> goes<00:02:37.440> there<00:02:37.740> up<00:02:38.540> that<00:02:39.540> weight<00:02:39.870> make<00:02:40.410> sure

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
that goes there up that weight make sure

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.610 
that goes there up that weight make sure
make<00:02:41.190> sure<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.520> if<00:02:41.790> if<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.660> heater<00:02:42.900> falls<00:02:43.290> to

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
make sure that if if the heater falls to

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.470 
make sure that if if the heater falls to
a<00:02:43.650> side<00:02:43.950> or<00:02:44.160> something<00:02:44.430> like<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:44.550> when<00:02:45.300> that

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
a side or something like that when that

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.350 
a side or something like that when that
weight<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:46.020> tuck<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:46.830> side<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.730> activates

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
weight it tuck to the side it activates

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.110 
weight it tuck to the side it activates
that<00:02:48.480> lever<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.710> turns<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.340> heater<00:02:50.820> off

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
that lever and it turns the heater off

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.520 
that lever and it turns the heater off
automatically<00:02:52.020> so<00:02:52.350> it's<00:02:52.830> very<00:02:53.160> safe<00:02:53.460> in

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
automatically so it's very safe in

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.510 
automatically so it's very safe in
extremely<00:02:55.530> unlikely<00:02:55.830> that<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.160> will<00:02:56.280> have<00:02:56.490> a

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
extremely unlikely that you will have a

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.360 
extremely unlikely that you will have a
problem<00:02:57.230> like<00:02:58.230> with<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.650> falling<00:02:59.130> and

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
problem like with it falling and

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.680 
problem like with it falling and
starting<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.760> fire<00:03:00.000> or<00:03:00.270> something<00:03:00.420> like<00:03:00.600> that

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
starting a fire or something like that

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.840 
starting a fire or something like that
just<00:03:00.960> forget<00:03:01.830> it's<00:03:01.980> nots<00:03:02.220> not<00:03:02.610> gonna<00:03:02.760> be

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
just forget it's nots not gonna be

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.300 
just forget it's nots not gonna be
happening<00:03:03.090> still<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.710> does<00:03:04.950> need<00:03:05.280> a

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
happening still and it does need a

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.480 
happening still and it does need a
little<00:03:05.460> bit<00:03:05.610> of<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:06.360> care<00:03:06.930> because<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:08.160> was<00:03:08.310> out

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
little bit of of care because it was out

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.690 
little bit of of care because it was out
obviously<00:03:09.180> not<00:03:09.480> well<00:03:09.840> taken<00:03:10.080> care<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.530> for<00:03:10.890> for

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
obviously not well taken care of for for

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.190 
obviously not well taken care of for for
some<00:03:11.970> time<00:03:13.490> and<00:03:14.490> yeah<00:03:15.450> I'm<00:03:15.570> gonna<00:03:15.720> be<00:03:15.870> doing<00:03:16.140> a

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
some time and yeah I'm gonna be doing a

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.670 
some time and yeah I'm gonna be doing a
little<00:03:16.290> bit<00:03:16.380> of<00:03:17.210> on<00:03:18.210> the<00:03:18.540> inside<00:03:18.960> let<00:03:19.410> me<00:03:19.500> show

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
little bit of on the inside let me show

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:28.640 
little bit of on the inside let me show
you<00:03:19.740> how<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.250> how<00:03:20.520> it<00:03:20.610> looks

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.870 

like<00:03:29.650> this<00:03:29.830> one<00:03:30.190> side

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.790 

and<00:03:34.970> this<00:03:35.750> is<00:03:35.840> what<00:03:35.960> it<00:03:36.020> looks<00:03:36.200> like<00:03:36.590> on<00:03:36.740> the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
and this is what it looks like on the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.590 
and this is what it looks like on the
inside<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.340> needs<00:03:37.610> to<00:03:37.730> be<00:03:37.790> cleaned

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
inside and needs to be cleaned

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.850 
inside and needs to be cleaned
definitely<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.950> wick<00:03:40.250> is<00:03:41.440> pretty<00:03:42.440> much<00:03:42.590> gone

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
definitely the wick is pretty much gone

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.290 
definitely the wick is pretty much gone
there's<00:03:43.250> there's<00:03:43.580> almost<00:03:43.730> no<00:03:44.090> work<00:03:44.240> left

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
there's there's almost no work left

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.390 
there's there's almost no work left
there<00:03:47.440> still<00:03:48.440> smells<00:03:48.830> a<00:03:49.040> little<00:03:49.130> bit<00:03:49.340> like

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
there still smells a little bit like

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.920 
there still smells a little bit like
like<00:03:50.000> kerosene<00:03:50.570> which<00:03:51.230> is<00:03:51.380> understandable

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
like kerosene which is understandable

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.500 
like kerosene which is understandable
pull<00:03:53.930> it<00:03:54.020> up<00:03:54.110> like<00:03:54.170> that<00:03:54.320> and<00:03:54.800> I'm<00:03:55.760> still<00:03:56.210> not

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
pull it up like that and I'm still not

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.830 
pull it up like that and I'm still not
100%<00:03:56.870> sure<00:03:57.770> because<00:03:58.070> I<00:03:58.550> had<00:03:59.210> been<00:03:59.330> doing<00:03:59.690> my

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
100% sure because I had been doing my

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.250 
100% sure because I had been doing my
research<00:03:59.870> as<00:04:00.530> always<00:04:00.950> but<00:04:01.430> this<00:04:01.900> kind<00:04:02.900> of<00:04:02.990> wick

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
research as always but this kind of wick

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.830 
research as always but this kind of wick
in<00:04:03.470> particular<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:04.580> from<00:04:04.940> this<00:04:05.090> model<00:04:05.480> model

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
in particular and from this model model

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.710 
in particular and from this model model
37<00:04:06.380> I'm<00:04:07.220> not<00:04:07.490> exactly<00:04:07.820> how<00:04:08.090> sure<00:04:08.360> it<00:04:08.480> works

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
37 I'm not exactly how sure it works

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.080 
37 I'm not exactly how sure it works
because<00:04:08.990> the<00:04:09.800> most<00:04:10.010> common<00:04:10.370> models<00:04:10.700> I've<00:04:10.820> seen

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
because the most common models I've seen

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.360 
because the most common models I've seen
have<00:04:11.360> like<00:04:11.600> a<00:04:11.630> couple<00:04:12.350> of<00:04:12.470> tabs<00:04:12.770> there<00:04:13.070> on<00:04:13.250> the

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
have like a couple of tabs there on the

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.190 
have like a couple of tabs there on the
side<00:04:13.640> and<00:04:13.970> it's<00:04:14.240> a<00:04:14.330> little<00:04:14.450> bit<00:04:14.570> easier<00:04:14.960> I

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
side and it's a little bit easier I

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.979 
side and it's a little bit easier I
think<00:04:15.950> that<00:04:16.160> what<00:04:16.280> you<00:04:16.370> have<00:04:16.489> to<00:04:16.640> do<00:04:16.790> is

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
think that what you have to do is

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.479 
think that what you have to do is
carefully<00:04:17.989> because<00:04:18.170> this<00:04:18.440> is<00:04:18.590> still<00:04:19.250> pretty

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
carefully because this is still pretty

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.970 
carefully because this is still pretty
dirty<00:04:19.820> and<00:04:20.150> it<00:04:20.660> pull<00:04:20.960> it<00:04:21.110> up<00:04:21.230> a<00:04:21.470> little<00:04:21.770> bit

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
dirty and it pull it up a little bit

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.790 
dirty and it pull it up a little bit
more<00:04:22.220> until<00:04:22.820> it<00:04:23.060> comes<00:04:23.360> completely<00:04:24.170> off<00:04:24.290> and

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
more until it comes completely off and

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.250 
more until it comes completely off and
then<00:04:25.010> replace<00:04:25.430> their<00:04:26.120> wick<00:04:26.420> in<00:04:26.660> the<00:04:26.810> carrier

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
then replace their wick in the carrier

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.870 
then replace their wick in the carrier
I'm<00:04:27.560> gonna<00:04:27.740> be<00:04:27.860> showing<00:04:28.130> you<00:04:28.160> guys<00:04:28.280> all<00:04:28.670> that
