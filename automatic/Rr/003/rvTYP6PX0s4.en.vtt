00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.450
 hello today we are going to make a little basket 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.010
 origami is very cute if you want to see 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.010
 how do you stay with me 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.919
 let's take our color sheet or 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:29.019
 our decorated sheet and we're going to 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.019
 fold in half vertically 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:41.620
 then we are going to unfold and we are going to use 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.620
 only one of the parts of the sheet 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.050
 help me with my rule to cut the 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.690
 but you can use scissors or the 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.690
 You can cut as you want 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.220
 since I have my little leaf so I'm going to 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.010
 fold from bottom to top 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.680
 and I'm going to score well my doubles and then 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.920
 I'm going to unfold it and I'm going to mark the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.070
 fold vertically from one side to the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.070
 other 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.520
 since I have these folds I will return 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.399
 to mark my first fold and I'm going to put together 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.450
 the corners towards the center towards the 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.450
 fold the center 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.390
 and I'm going to repeat the same process with the 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.390
 other 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.560
 I'm going to fold 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.230
 again but now back from where 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.260
 I made the folds so that it is marked 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.670
 very well and line that fold to 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.670
 below will you know why 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:57.070
 I'm going to take one of the corners and I'm going to 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.890
 mark one of the folds inwards 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.710
 in this way 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.510
 opening my sheet and marking the fold the 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.170
 second doubles I'll mark it equal 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.740
 into 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.260
 and then the third fold I'm going to 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.659
 dial out 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.400
 and I'm going to repeat exactly the same 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:22.010
 procedure with my other corner marked 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.799
 a doubles inward the one that follows 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.799
 also and the last one out 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.440
 then I'm going to take my figure and I'm going to 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.340
 fold a little eye towards the fold of the 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.459
 center 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.800
 and so I'm going to do with the other and the 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.800
 two others that we have on the other side 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:11.140
 ready now let's take one of the 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.550
 eyelashes and we're going to fold it again 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.550
 toward the center 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.890
 a little bit past the fold of the center 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:27.680
 and on the other side we're going to do 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.319
 Exactly the same has to be left for us 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.819
 the double as between crossed up 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.819
 up as you can see 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:43.280
 and once again on the other side we're going to 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.280
 Do exactly the same procedure 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.270
 and we already have the fold and now what 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.480
 we're going to do is going to give it the shape in 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:00.140
 the bottom opening the bag 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:04.560
 what we have left then we are going to put one of 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:07.640
 the handles of our basket in the other 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.690
 you can also paste it 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.630
 up or you can put a part of the 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.630
 throws from the basket in a fold of 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.940
 the other 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.140
 I the truth open the folds that 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.639
 we made a handle and put the other so 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.740
 we need to use glue 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.830
 but if you want a bit more 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.510
 sure put a drop of glue or 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.760
 glue stick or whatever you want 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.800
 we're going to start giving the 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.020
 shape our basket so that it takes 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.270
 little basket shape and do not look like something 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:47.100
 strange and then we're going to take what 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:50.080
 that we want we can take sweets or 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.730
 chocolates or some detail what you 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.030
 you want to be careful that you do not open 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.290
 as to me 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.290
 and ready 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:03.050
