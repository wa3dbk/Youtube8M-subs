leptin<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.660> called<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.230> master<00:00:34.739> fat<00:00:34.980> hormone

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
leptin is called the master fat hormone

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.420 
leptin is called the master fat hormone
when<00:00:36.180> leptin<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.750> working<00:00:37.110> for<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:38.190> right

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
when leptin is working for you the right

getting your leptin metabolism to work
for<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.739> metabolize<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.180> best

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
for you to metabolize that the best

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.350 
for you to metabolize that the best
possible<00:00:52.110> way<00:00:52.350> what<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.460> want<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.180> get

possible way what you want to do is get

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.450 
possible way what you want to do is get
leptin<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.930> mobilize<00:00:55.440> fat<00:00:55.739> or<00:00:56.039> create<00:00:56.430> a

between<00:01:01.890> meals<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.640> have<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> regular

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
between meals you have on a regular

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.600 
between meals you have on a regular
basis<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.470> between<00:01:04.680> dinner<00:01:05.220> one

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
basis and that is between dinner one

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.330 
basis and that is between dinner one
evening<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.180> breakfast<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.960> next<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:08.130> way

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
evening and breakfast the next the way

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.580 
evening and breakfast the next the way
the<00:01:08.520> hormones<00:01:08.939> work<00:01:09.240> after<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> meal<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the hormones work after a meal and the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.070 
the hormones work after a meal and the
way<00:01:10.740> they<00:01:10.890> cycle<00:01:11.460> you'll<00:01:12.240> actually<00:01:12.479> get<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.900> a

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
way they cycle you'll actually get to a

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.920 
way they cycle you'll actually get to a
point<00:01:13.439> about<00:01:13.770> nine<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.580> ten<00:01:14.610> hours<00:01:15.420> after<00:01:15.840> you

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
point about nine to ten hours after you

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.460 
point about nine to ten hours after you
eat<00:01:16.070> till<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.250> get<00:01:17.369> all<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.000> food<00:01:18.390> gone<00:01:19.049> and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
eat till you get all the food gone and

at that point nine to ten hours after
you<00:01:25.950> eat<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.250> when<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.640> fat<00:01:26.909> metabolism<00:01:27.180> goes

you eat is when the fat metabolism goes

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.649 
you eat is when the fat metabolism goes
into<00:01:28.500> high<00:01:28.680> gear<00:01:28.710> if<00:01:29.490> you're<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.240> habit<00:01:30.390> of
