00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
be the first tape okay the second tip

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.249 
be the first tape okay the second tip
would<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.740> definitely<00:01:18.049> invest<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.290> some

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259

because<00:02:41.100> some<00:02:41.970> people<00:02:42.270> think<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.690> using

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
because some people think that using

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.570 
because some people think that using
tweezers<00:02:43.230> makes<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.770> easier<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.070> put<00:02:44.280> them<00:02:44.430> on

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
tweezers makes it easier to put them on

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.140 
tweezers makes it easier to put them on
I<00:02:44.790> think<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:45.750> shutting<00:02:46.140> them<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:46.410> your<00:02:46.560> ideas

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
I think just shutting them on your ideas

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.740 
I think just shutting them on your ideas
now<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.210> thing<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:48.780> do<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.800> just<00:02:49.860> take

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
now the thing that I do is I just take

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.640 
now the thing that I do is I just take
it<00:02:51.750> nice<00:02:52.020> BS<00:02:52.680> where<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.070> think<00:02:53.280> my<00:02:53.670> line<00:02:54.270> is<00:02:54.660> my

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
it nice BS where I think my line is my

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:07.809 
it nice BS where I think my line is my
lash<00:02:55.890> line<00:02:56.300> and<00:02:57.300> I<00:02:57.480> just<00:02:57.980> shove<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.010> on<00:02:59.190> there

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.099 

now<00:03:08.390> if<00:03:08.689> you<00:03:08.900> would<00:03:09.260> happen<00:03:09.739> to<00:03:10.010> screw<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.519> up

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
now if you would happen to screw it up

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:18.770 
now if you would happen to screw it up
you<00:03:12.109> can<00:03:12.260> always<00:03:12.379> move<00:03:12.799> it

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.090 

this<00:03:19.350> is<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.500> first<00:03:19.709> time<00:03:19.830> I've<00:03:19.980> actually

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
this is the first time I've actually

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.650 
this is the first time I've actually
worn<00:03:20.520> fake<00:03:20.730> eyelashes<00:03:21.240> without<00:03:21.569> me<00:03:23.660> mascara

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
worn fake eyelashes without me mascara

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.580 
worn fake eyelashes without me mascara
or<00:03:24.930> anything<00:03:25.290> on<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.530> long<00:03:25.890> time<00:03:27.560> usually<00:03:28.560> I

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
or anything on a long time usually I

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:37.340 
or anything on a long time usually I
have<00:03:28.680> stuff<00:03:29.130> on

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.610 

now<00:03:38.350> I<00:03:38.410> do<00:03:38.590> suggest<00:03:39.600> if<00:03:40.600> you<00:03:41.290> do<00:03:41.500> want<00:03:41.770> your<00:03:42.390> um

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
now I do suggest if you do want your um

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.020 
now I do suggest if you do want your um
think<00:03:44.620> I'll<00:03:44.770> actually<00:03:44.980> be<00:03:45.190> closer<00:03:45.550> to<00:03:45.730> the

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
think I'll actually be closer to the

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.180 
think I'll actually be closer to the
lash<00:03:46.210> line<00:03:46.380> do<00:03:47.380> you<00:03:47.440> take<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.620> pair<00:03:47.860> of<00:03:47.890> tweezers

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
lash line do you take a pair of tweezers

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.240 
lash line do you take a pair of tweezers
and<00:03:48.700> gently<00:03:49.240> pull<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.960> down<00:03:50.230> closer<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.890> lash

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
and gently pull it down closer to lash

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.340 
and gently pull it down closer to lash
line<00:03:51.550> and<00:03:51.820> it<00:03:52.210> sends<00:03:52.480> a<00:03:52.570> little<00:03:52.780> painful<00:03:53.050> but

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
line and it sends a little painful but

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.540 
line and it sends a little painful but
it<00:03:54.160> doesn't<00:03:54.430> hurt<00:03:54.580> all<00:03:54.910> and<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:56.920> gets<00:03:57.160> gives

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
it doesn't hurt all and it gets gives

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.610 
it doesn't hurt all and it gets gives
them<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:58.240> closer<00:03:58.540> to<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.840> lash<00:03:58.990> line<00:03:59.020> gives

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
them the closer to the lash line gives

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.390 
them the closer to the lash line gives
it<00:03:59.710> the<00:03:59.800> most<00:04:00.010> closest<00:04:00.520> look<00:04:00.820> what<00:04:01.420> best<00:04:01.750> look

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
it the most closest look what best look

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:10.110 
it the most closest look what best look
so<00:04:03.400> let's<00:04:04.330> do<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.660> other<00:04:04.690> lash<00:04:08.310> just<00:04:09.310> run<00:04:09.730> your

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
so let's do the other lash just run your

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.650 
so let's do the other lash just run your
thin<00:04:10.480> bead<00:04:10.930> of<00:04:11.470> glue<00:04:14.580> might<00:04:15.580> also<00:04:15.910> add<00:04:16.330> this

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
thin bead of glue might also add this

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.160 
thin bead of glue might also add this
glue<00:04:17.019> takes<00:04:17.440> just<00:04:17.650> a<00:04:17.769> little<00:04:18.100> bit<00:04:18.220> of<00:04:18.310> time<00:04:19.170> to

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
glue takes just a little bit of time to

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.050 
glue takes just a little bit of time to
get<00:04:20.290> tacky<00:04:20.650> on<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:22.200> lash<00:04:23.520> so<00:04:24.520> you<00:04:24.610> may<00:04:24.820> want<00:04:25.030> to

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
get tacky on the lash so you may want to

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.180 
get tacky on the lash so you may want to
give<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.270> a<00:04:25.330> few<00:04:25.480> seconds<00:04:25.930> I<00:04:26.110> don't<00:04:26.470> usually<00:04:26.770> I

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
give it a few seconds I don't usually I

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:44.750 
give it a few seconds I don't usually I
just<00:04:27.610> usually<00:04:28.000> just<00:04:28.300> get<00:04:29.200> impatient<00:04:29.470> but<00:04:29.890> on

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.390 

the<00:04:45.300> next<00:04:45.630> thing<00:04:45.810> you'll<00:04:46.050> want<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.380> do<00:04:46.650> after

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
the next thing you'll want to do after

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.630 
the next thing you'll want to do after
you<00:04:48.360> have<00:04:48.630> successfully<00:04:49.310> shoved<00:04:50.310> on<00:04:50.610> the

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
you have successfully shoved on the

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:57.410 
you have successfully shoved on the
lashes<00:04:51.000> is<00:04:52.880> do<00:04:53.880> they<00:04:54.150> look<00:04:55.640> symmetrical<00:04:56.640> if

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
lashes is do they look symmetrical if

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.260 
lashes is do they look symmetrical if
they<00:04:57.660> don't<00:04:57.840> fluff<00:04:58.470> them<00:04:58.940> wondering<00:04:59.940> if<00:05:00.060> I'm

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
they don't fluff them wondering if I'm

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.600 
they don't fluff them wondering if I'm
is<00:05:00.510> a<00:05:00.540> strike<00:05:00.900> gently<00:05:01.260> move<00:05:01.680> them<00:05:01.890> to<00:05:02.130> where

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
is a strike gently move them to where

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:12.559 
is a strike gently move them to where
they<00:05:02.730> look<00:05:02.940> like<00:05:04.490> they're<00:05:05.490> symmetrical

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.219 

this<00:05:13.169> one<00:05:13.529> if<00:05:13.919> you<00:05:14.339> notice<00:05:14.759> I<00:05:14.999> need<00:05:15.990> just<00:05:16.169> a

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
this one if you notice I need just a

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:21.589 
this one if you notice I need just a
little<00:05:16.259> bit<00:05:16.499> more<00:05:16.800> glue<00:05:19.849> to<00:05:20.849> get<00:05:21.029> closer<00:05:21.419> to

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
little bit more glue to get closer to

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:39.779 
little bit more glue to get closer to
the<00:05:21.839> lash

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:46.570 

ok<00:05:40.789> I<00:05:41.949> think<00:05:42.949> that's<00:05:43.639> done<00:05:45.039> there<00:05:46.039> you<00:05:46.159> go<00:05:46.310> pick

ok I think that's done there you go pick

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.480 
ok I think that's done there you go pick
eyelashes<00:05:47.240> I<00:05:47.650> hope<00:05:48.650> this<00:05:48.830> was<00:05:48.979> helpful<00:05:49.009> for
