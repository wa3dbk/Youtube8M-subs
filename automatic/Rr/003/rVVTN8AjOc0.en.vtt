are<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.439> area<00:00:22.769> then<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.519> think<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.330> know

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
are in the area then I think you know

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.910 
are in the area then I think you know
you're<00:00:24.660> not<00:00:24.840> at<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.080> point<00:00:25.320> where<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.650> want

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
you're not at the point where you want

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.790 
you're not at the point where you want
to<00:00:26.130> file<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> lawsuit<00:00:26.699> yet<00:00:27.510> but<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.349> do<00:00:28.590> know

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
to file a lawsuit yet but you do know

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.589 
to file a lawsuit yet but you do know
that<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.220> need<00:00:29.400> some<00:00:29.429> help<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.119> get<00:00:30.359> through

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
that you need some help to get through

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.330 
that you need some help to get through
this<00:00:30.840> impasse<00:00:31.349> with<00:00:31.710> your<00:00:31.890> insurance<00:00:32.189> company

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
this impasse with your insurance company

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.930 
this impasse with your insurance company
I<00:00:32.759> think<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.540> where<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.989> public<00:00:34.320> adjuster

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
I think this is where a public adjuster

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.720 
I think this is where a public adjuster
really<00:00:35.940> comes<00:00:36.360> into<00:00:36.840> their<00:00:37.200> own<00:00:37.350> because<00:00:37.920> they

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
really comes into their own because they

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.810 
really comes into their own because they
know<00:00:39.149> insurance<00:00:40.140> equality<00:00:40.860> they<00:00:41.129> know<00:00:41.340> they

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
know insurance equality they know they

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.810 
know insurance equality they know they
are<00:00:42.059> used<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.570> negotiating<00:00:43.500> they<00:00:44.309> also<00:00:44.489> have

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
are used to negotiating they also have

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.779 
are used to negotiating they also have
resources<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.510> terms<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.340> having<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.760> know

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
resources in terms of having you know

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.910 
resources in terms of having you know
contractors<00:00:48.539> or<00:00:48.750> people<00:00:49.170> who<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> scope

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
contractors or people who can do a scope

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.639 
contractors or people who can do a scope
of<00:00:50.100> laws<00:00:50.480> people<00:00:51.480> who<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:51.989> help<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.410> with

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
of laws people who can help you with

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.670 
of laws people who can help you with
your<00:00:52.920> contents<00:00:53.780> and<00:00:54.780> who<00:00:54.960> could<00:00:55.110> also<00:00:55.199> help

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
your contents and who could also help

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.920 
your contents and who could also help
you<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:56.100> arguing<00:00:56.789> about<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.180> terms<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.780> your

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
you with arguing about the terms of your

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.740 
you with arguing about the terms of your
insurance<00:00:58.289> policy<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.219> think<00:00:59.550> with<00:01:00.510> an

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
insurance policy I think with an

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.470 
insurance policy I think with an
attorney<00:01:01.170> you're<00:01:02.070> much<00:01:02.399> more<00:01:02.609> likely<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.120> use

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
attorney you're much more likely to use

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.690 
attorney you're much more likely to use
an<00:01:03.660> attorney<00:01:03.989> later<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.830> process<00:01:05.369> when

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
an attorney later on in the process when

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.420 
an attorney later on in the process when
you<00:01:05.880> still<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.540> not<00:01:06.840> gotten<00:01:07.770> where<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.250> need

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
you still have not gotten where you need

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.140 
you still have not gotten where you need
to<00:01:08.549> go<00:01:08.700> most<00:01:09.270> often<00:01:10.220> people<00:01:11.220> use<00:01:11.430> attorneys

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
to go most often people use attorneys

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.910 
to go most often people use attorneys
it's<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:12.750> because<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> company<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.619> dealing

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
it's just because the company is dealing

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.520 
it's just because the company is dealing
with<00:01:14.070> them<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.460> bad<00:01:14.670> faith<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.630> not<00:01:16.049> negotiable

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
with them in bad faith is not negotiable

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.719 
with them in bad faith is not negotiable
is<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.670> refusing<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.619> work<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.950> them<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.520> give

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
is is refusing to work with them to give

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.310 
is is refusing to work with them to give
them<00:01:20.759> where<00:01:21.060> they<00:01:21.180> need<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.659> or<00:01:21.900> isn't

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
them where they need to be or isn't

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.710 
them where they need to be or isn't
complying<00:01:22.830> with<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.549> terms<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> contract

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
complying with the terms of the contract

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.840 
complying with the terms of the contract
and<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.860> think<00:01:26.070> that's<00:01:26.250> when<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.430> bring<00:01:26.700> an

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
and I think that's when you bring an

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.870 
and I think that's when you bring an
attorney<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.479> they<00:01:27.720> both<00:01:27.960> have<00:01:28.229> their<00:01:28.470> place

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
attorney in they both have their place

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.090 
attorney in they both have their place
and<00:01:29.880> they're<00:01:30.030> not<00:01:30.180> necessarily<00:01:30.810> mutually

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
and they're not necessarily mutually

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.370 
and they're not necessarily mutually
exclusive<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.850> think<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.329> PA<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.720> bring<00:01:34.170> in

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
exclusive but I think a PA you bring in

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.249 
exclusive but I think a PA you bring in
earlier<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.579> process<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.750> help<00:01:36.990> represent

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
earlier in the process to help represent

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.920 
earlier in the process to help represent
you<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.860> advocate<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.520> your<00:01:38.549> behalf<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.479> an

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
you and advocate on your behalf and an

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.140 
you and advocate on your behalf and an
attorney<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.530> kind<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.979> big<00:01:41.159> gistic<00:01:41.610> that

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
attorney is kind of a big gistic that

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.420 
attorney is kind of a big gistic that
when<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:43.409> gotten<00:01:43.860> as<00:01:43.950> far<00:01:43.979> as<00:01:44.280> you're

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
when you have gotten as far as you're

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.850 
when you have gotten as far as you're
going<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.670> go<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.869> insurance<00:01:46.170> company<00:01:46.680> is

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
going to go and the insurance company is

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.360 
going to go and the insurance company is
not<00:01:47.310> willing<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:48.000> settle<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.780> there's<00:01:48.960> not

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
not willing to settle and there's not

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.460 
not willing to settle and there's not
to<00:01:49.760> negotiate<00:01:50.060> with<00:01:50.720> you<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:53.360> I<00:01:53.900> think<00:01:54.140> the

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
to negotiate with you the I think the

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.620 
to negotiate with you the I think the
