so it's the first thing and this is just
a<00:01:26.600> left<00:01:26.810> hand<00:01:27.020> for<00:01:27.259> right<00:01:27.380> now<00:01:27.560> alright<00:01:28.369> so<00:01:28.549> you

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
do that one and then the second quarter

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.139 
do that one and then the second quarter
of<00:01:30.470> it<00:01:30.560> is<00:01:30.709> these<00:01:30.979> two<00:01:31.340> actually<00:01:31.819> stay<00:01:32.000> the

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
of it is these two actually stay the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.029 
of it is these two actually stay the
same<00:01:32.360> but<00:01:32.959> you<00:01:33.049> move<00:01:33.229> your<00:01:33.380> pinky<00:01:33.709> down<00:01:33.740> to

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
same but you move your pinky down to

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.160 
same but you move your pinky down to
this<00:01:34.159> one<00:01:34.429> so<00:01:35.030> it<00:01:35.149> goes

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.080 

so<00:01:39.130> you're<00:01:39.280> parting<00:01:39.460> out<00:01:39.580> to<00:01:39.700> work<00:01:39.850> on<00:01:40.000> the

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
so you're parting out to work on the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.020 
so you're parting out to work on the
switch<00:01:40.360> in<00:01:40.659> there<00:01:40.840> so<00:01:41.050> I<00:01:41.080> guess<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:43.000> it<00:01:43.120> is

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
switch in there so I guess that it is

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.010 
switch in there so I guess that it is
that's<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.210> first<00:01:46.240> two<00:01:46.540> chords<00:01:46.780> and<00:01:46.930> the

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
that's the first two chords and the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.840 
that's the first two chords and the
second<00:01:47.409> one<00:01:47.530> each<00:01:47.800> finger<00:01:48.159> moves<00:01:48.369> down<00:01:48.550> once

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
second one each finger moves down once

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:57.060 
second one each finger moves down once
it<00:01:49.119> goes<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:52.270> there<00:01:52.390> goes<00:01:52.540> from<00:01:53.610> down<00:01:54.610> -<00:01:56.070> all

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
it goes so there goes from down - all

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.440 
it goes so there goes from down - all
right<00:01:57.190> you<00:01:57.400> do<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.610> first<00:01:57.850> time<00:01:58.000> four<00:01:58.210> times

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
right you do the first time four times

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.990 
right you do the first time four times
this<00:01:59.050> one<00:01:59.229> twice<00:01:59.440> now<00:01:59.830> enjoys<00:02:00.160> so<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:00.850> whole

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
this one twice now enjoys so the whole

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:11.320 
this one twice now enjoys so the whole
left<00:02:01.180> hand<00:02:01.420> is

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.290 

all<00:02:11.660> right<00:02:11.780> they<00:02:12.080> just<00:02:12.320> repeat<00:02:12.530> that<00:02:12.620> toys<00:02:12.890> and

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
all right they just repeat that toys and

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.430 
all right they just repeat that toys and
the<00:02:14.300> second<00:02:14.660> time<00:02:14.780> when<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:14.990> goes<00:02:15.110> up<00:02:15.170> higher

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
the second time when it goes up higher

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.050 
the second time when it goes up higher
you<00:02:15.740> actually<00:02:16.160> just<00:02:16.340> do<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.670> exact<00:02:17.030> same
