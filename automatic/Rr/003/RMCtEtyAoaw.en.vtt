when<00:00:10.019> evaluating<00:00:10.320> applications<00:00:11.040> how

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
when evaluating applications how

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.190 
when evaluating applications how
significant<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.240> factor<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.719> clinical

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
significant of a factor is clinical

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.570 
significant of a factor is clinical
experience<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.740> deciding<00:00:14.190> whether<00:00:14.340> or<00:00:14.460> not

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
experience and deciding whether or not

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.640 
experience and deciding whether or not
to<00:00:14.790> admit<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:15.000> candidate<00:00:15.389> so<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.049> may<00:00:16.379> have<00:00:16.470> just

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
to admit a candidate so I may have just

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.340 
to admit a candidate so I may have just
given<00:00:16.770> away<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.160> answer<00:00:17.460> here<00:00:18.109> but<00:00:19.109> we<00:00:19.199> can

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
given away the answer here but we can

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.529 
given away the answer here but we can
see<00:00:19.380> here<00:00:19.789> 59<00:00:20.789> percent<00:00:21.150> said<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.480> very

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
see here 59 percent said it's very

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.900 
see here 59 percent said it's very
significant<00:00:22.470> with<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.680> further<00:00:22.949> 37<00:00:23.609> percent

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
significant with a further 37 percent

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.750 
significant with a further 37 percent
saying<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.480> somewhat<00:00:25.050> significant<00:00:25.800> so

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
saying it is somewhat significant so

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.870 
saying it is somewhat significant so
clearly<00:00:27.570> clinical<00:00:28.470> experience<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.340> big

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
clearly clinical experience is a big

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.269 
clearly clinical experience is a big
factor<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.449> application<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:32.040> have

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
factor in the application you you have

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.910 
factor in the application you you have
heard<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.820> important<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.450> yay<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.739> is

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
heard it is important and yay so it is

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.860 
heard it is important and yay so it is
so<00:00:35.640> let<00:00:36.059> me<00:00:36.120> ask<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.420> based<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
so let me ask you this based on the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.380 
so let me ask you this based on the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
conferences with the medical school

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.139 
conferences with the medical school
deans<00:00:40.890> what's<00:00:41.489> going<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.850> clinical

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
clinical experience why is it so

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.869 
clinical experience why is it so
important<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:44.700> know<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:45.059> largely<00:00:45.570> because

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
important you know it's largely because

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.540 
important you know it's largely because
what<00:00:47.879> med<00:00:48.059> schools<00:00:48.390> want<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:49.020> know<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.559> that

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
what med schools want to know is that

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.420 
what med schools want to know is that
you<00:00:50.940> are<00:00:50.969> serious<00:00:51.329> about<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.530> what

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
you are serious about this and what

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.639 
you are serious about this and what
clinical<00:00:53.699> experience<00:00:54.390> does<00:00:54.780> more<00:00:55.500> than

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
clinical experience does more than

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.610 
clinical experience does more than
anything<00:00:55.860> else<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.489> takes<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.210> outside<00:00:57.690> of

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
anything else is it takes you outside of

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
problems and that is why this is so

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.749 
problems and that is why this is so
important<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.280> think<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.520> other<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
important and I think the other the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:39.679 
important and I think the other the
other<00:01:38.820> piece<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> puzzle<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.630> we

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
other piece of the puzzle here is we

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.640 
other piece of the puzzle here is we
want<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.900> make<00:01:40.020> sure<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.290> students<00:01:40.619> know

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
want to make sure that students know

want to make sure that students know
what<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.250> means<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> doctor<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.329> were

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
what it means to be a doctor you were

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.210 
what it means to be a doctor you were
alluding<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.649> example<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.189> always
