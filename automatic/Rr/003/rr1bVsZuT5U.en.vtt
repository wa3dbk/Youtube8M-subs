to<00:00:36.100> work<00:00:36.309> the<00:00:36.550> hose<00:00:36.730> clamps<00:00:37.269> and<00:00:39.239> I've<00:00:40.239> had

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
to work the hose clamps and I've had

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.349 
to work the hose clamps and I've had
this<00:00:41.109> head<00:00:41.530> soaking<00:00:42.100> this<00:00:42.760> has<00:00:42.940> been<00:00:43.120> soaking

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359 
this head soaking this has been soaking

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:45.090 
this head soaking this has been soaking
actually<00:00:43.840> for<00:00:44.019> two<00:00:44.199> days<00:00:44.410> but<00:00:44.739> that's<00:00:44.920> not

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
actually for two days but that's not

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.439 
actually for two days but that's not
necessary<00:00:45.640> a<00:00:45.929> couple<00:00:46.929> hours<00:00:47.199> is<00:00:47.320> enough<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:49.390> to

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
necessary a couple hours is enough so to

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.810 
necessary a couple hours is enough so to
start<00:00:49.809> we<00:00:50.050> want<00:00:50.230> to<00:00:50.379> put<00:00:50.589> see<00:00:51.070> how<00:00:51.190> I've<00:00:51.250> left<00:00:51.579> a

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
start we want to put see how I've left a

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.160 
start we want to put see how I've left a
little<00:00:51.969> space<00:00:52.300> where<00:00:52.809> there<00:00:52.929> isn't<00:00:53.079> any

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
little space where there isn't any

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.500 
little space where there isn't any
fabric<00:00:53.559> so<00:00:54.399> you<00:00:54.460> can<00:00:54.640> actually<00:00:54.789> do<00:00:55.089> this<00:00:55.210> step

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
fabric so you can actually do this step

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.259 
fabric so you can actually do this step
before<00:00:55.780> you<00:00:56.289> put<00:00:56.499> the<00:00:56.589> fabric<00:00:56.800> on<00:00:57.129> or<00:00:57.579> you<00:00:58.120> can

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
before you put the fabric on or you can

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.060

put<00:00:58.449> the<00:00:58.690> yeah<00:00:59.230> and<00:00:59.379> then<00:00:59.499> or<00:00:59.679> you<00:00:59.769> can<00:00:59.890> put<00:01:00.010> the

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
put the yeah and then or you can put the

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.680 
put the yeah and then or you can put the
fabric<00:01:00.280> on<00:01:00.519> first<00:01:00.879> and<00:01:01.149> then<00:01:01.239> come<00:01:01.390> back<00:01:01.420> to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
fabric on first and then come back to

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.079 
fabric on first and then come back to
this<00:01:01.809> so<00:01:02.739> all<00:01:02.949> you<00:01:03.039> want<00:01:03.219> to<00:01:03.280> do<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:03.789> again<00:01:04.059> I

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
this outside edge be generous because

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.240 
this outside edge be generous because
even<00:01:17.740> if<00:01:17.830> it<00:01:17.950> runs<00:01:18.250> or<00:01:18.520> go<00:01:18.670> somewhere<00:01:19.150> else<00:01:19.270> it

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
even if it runs or go somewhere else it

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.280 
even if it runs or go somewhere else it
dries<00:01:21.250> clear

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.590 

I<00:01:26.820> probably<00:01:27.820> should<00:01:28.090> have<00:01:28.120> thought<00:01:28.330> of<00:01:28.390> a<00:01:28.570> joke

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600

to<00:01:29.020> tell<00:01:29.080> on<00:01:29.500> doing<00:01:29.890> this<00:01:30.010> it's<00:01:30.250> kind<00:01:30.520> of

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
to tell on doing this it's kind of

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.670 
to tell on doing this it's kind of
boring<00:01:30.820> to<00:01:30.940> watch<00:01:31.030> huh<00:01:33.510> anyway<00:01:34.510> keep<00:01:35.380> doing

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
boring to watch huh anyway keep doing

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.720

this<00:01:35.860> a<00:01:37.620> half<00:01:38.620> inch<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:39.040> an<00:01:39.130> inch<00:01:39.310> is<00:01:39.430> enough

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
this a half inch to an inch is enough

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.450 
this a half inch to an inch is enough
this<00:01:39.940> one's<00:01:40.180> probably<00:01:40.650> I'm<00:01:41.650> redoing<00:01:42.160> this

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
this one's probably I'm redoing this

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.070 
this one's probably I'm redoing this
head<00:01:42.670> as<00:01:42.850> you<00:01:42.940> can<00:01:43.090> see<00:01:43.270> over<00:01:43.450> here<00:01:43.570> it<00:01:44.050> has

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
head as you can see over here it has

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.500 
head as you can see over here it has
fabric<00:01:44.650> on<00:01:44.830> it<00:01:44.980> I<00:01:45.130> don't<00:01:45.940> think<00:01:46.090> you<00:01:46.150> can<00:01:46.270> see

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
fabric on it I don't think you can see

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.030 
fabric on it I don't think you can see
but<00:01:46.690> there's<00:01:46.840> staple<00:01:47.320> marks<00:01:47.440> this<00:01:47.680> is<00:01:47.830> one<00:01:48.010> of

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
but there's staple marks this is one of

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.100 
but there's staple marks this is one of
my<00:01:48.220> earliest<00:01:48.640> drums<00:01:49.090> and<00:01:49.479> it's<00:01:49.600> only<00:01:49.810> like

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
my earliest drums and it's only like

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.530 
my earliest drums and it's only like
about<00:01:50.380> five<00:01:50.680> years<00:01:51.010> later<00:01:51.370> that<00:01:51.700> I've<00:01:52.210> had<00:01:52.420> to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
about five years later that I've had to

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.930 
about five years later that I've had to
take<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:52.870> head<00:01:53.050> off<00:01:53.080> and<00:01:53.530> redo<00:01:53.890> it<00:01:54.040> so<00:01:54.790> these

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
take the head off and redo it so these

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.300 
take the head off and redo it so these
are<00:01:55.180> very<00:01:55.479> sturdy<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.320> they<00:01:56.770> last<00:01:57.010> a<00:01:57.160> long

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
are very sturdy and they last a long

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.790 
are very sturdy and they last a long
time<00:01:57.340> it<00:01:57.970> might<00:01:58.690> take<00:01:58.990> a<00:01:59.020> pretty<00:01:59.290> good<00:01:59.530> beating

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
time it might take a pretty good beating

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.210 
time it might take a pretty good beating
a<00:02:00.100> couple<00:02:00.580> times<00:02:00.790> a<00:02:00.970> week<00:02:01.710> ok<00:02:02.710> so<00:02:02.770> now<00:02:03.070> we<00:02:03.130> have

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
a couple times a week ok so now we have

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.260 
a couple times a week ok so now we have
that<00:02:03.520> on<00:02:04.380> then<00:02:05.670> I'm<00:02:06.670> not<00:02:06.880> sure<00:02:06.940> if<00:02:07.119> it's

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
that on then I'm not sure if it's

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.469 
that on then I'm not sure if it's
necessary<00:02:07.780> or<00:02:07.869> not<00:02:08.110> but<00:02:08.380> I<00:02:08.590> put<00:02:09.280> some<00:02:09.580> on<00:02:09.850> this

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
necessary or not but I put some on this

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:28.940 
necessary or not but I put some on this
edge<00:02:10.720> too<00:02:11.110> on<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.470> top

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.350 

okay<00:02:29.950> now<00:02:30.220> I'm<00:02:30.550> going<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.760> let<00:02:30.850> this<00:02:31.030> sit<00:02:31.330> for

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
okay now I'm going to let this sit for

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.910 
okay now I'm going to let this sit for
about<00:02:31.630> ten<00:02:32.110> minutes<00:02:32.320> and<00:02:32.790> then<00:02:33.790> I'll<00:02:34.090> be<00:02:34.240> back

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
about ten minutes and then I'll be back

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.790 
about ten minutes and then I'll be back
with<00:02:35.920> my<00:02:36.070> husband<00:02:36.550> my<00:02:36.670> assistant<00:02:37.240> and<00:02:37.470> we<00:02:38.470> will

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
with my husband my assistant and we will

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.420 
with my husband my assistant and we will
together<00:02:39.600> put<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.690> hem<00:02:40.840> on<00:02:41.250> okay

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
together put the hem on okay

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.560 
together put the hem on okay
the<00:02:42.550> next<00:02:42.910> step<00:02:43.150> is<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:44.380> take<00:02:45.340> your<00:02:45.400> head<00:02:45.730> out

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
the next step is to take your head out

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.760 
the next step is to take your head out
of<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.870> water<00:02:47.110> like<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.930> said<00:02:49.960> this<00:02:50.290> has<00:02:50.530> been

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
of the water like I said this has been

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.740 
of the water like I said this has been
soaking<00:02:51.070> forever<00:02:51.580> but<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:51.880> couple<00:02:52.360> hours<00:02:52.630> is

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
soaking forever but a couple hours is

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.930 
soaking forever but a couple hours is
fine<00:02:53.730> then<00:02:54.730> it's<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.570> good<00:02:55.720> idea<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.760> dry<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:57.820> off

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
fine then it's a good idea to dry it off

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.380 
fine then it's a good idea to dry it off
a<00:02:58.000> bit<00:02:58.360> I<00:02:58.510> just<00:02:58.570> have<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:58.960> towel<00:02:59.290> here<00:02:59.620> that<00:02:59.800> I'm

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
a bit I just have a towel here that I'm

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:12.860 
a bit I just have a towel here that I'm
dabbing<00:03:01.390> it<00:03:01.720> with

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.699 

now<00:03:13.470> another<00:03:13.739> thing<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:14.280> really<00:03:14.550> remember<00:03:15.030> is

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
now another thing to really remember is

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.470 
now another thing to really remember is
if<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:16.950> have<00:03:17.190> backlogs<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.150> think<00:03:18.360> it's

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
if you have backlogs and I think it's

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.949 
if you have backlogs and I think it's
all<00:03:18.660> like<00:03:18.900> this<00:03:19.250> if<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.459> have<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.700> shiny<00:03:21.120> sign

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
all like this if you have a shiny sign

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.210 
all like this if you have a shiny sign
I<00:03:21.989> don't<00:03:22.410> know<00:03:22.470> if<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.650> can<00:03:22.800> see<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.069> in<00:03:23.160> the

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
I don't know if you can see it in the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.780 
I don't know if you can see it in the
video<00:03:23.580> but<00:03:23.930> this<00:03:24.930> has<00:03:25.170> like<00:03:25.379> a<00:03:25.440> dull<00:03:25.830> side<00:03:26.160> and

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
video but this has like a dull side and

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.650 
video but this has like a dull side and
a<00:03:27.480> shiny<00:03:27.780> side<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:29.280> want<00:03:29.580> to<00:03:29.879> glue<00:03:30.330> it<00:03:30.480> on

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
a shiny side and you want to glue it on

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.869 
a shiny side and you want to glue it on
shiny<00:03:31.290> side<00:03:31.890> up<00:03:32.569> because<00:03:33.739> it<00:03:34.739> won't<00:03:35.129> if<00:03:35.580> you<00:03:35.730> do

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
shiny side up because it won't if you do

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.220 
shiny side up because it won't if you do
it<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.060> other<00:03:36.090> way<00:03:36.269> it<00:03:36.510> won't<00:03:36.690> stick<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.200> the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
it the other way it won't stick to the

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.979 
it the other way it won't stick to the
shiny<00:03:37.560> side<00:03:37.860> I've<00:03:38.069> had<00:03:38.250> heads<00:03:38.519> come<00:03:38.790> off<00:03:38.989> so

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
shiny side I've had heads come off so

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.050 
shiny side I've had heads come off so
that's<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:40.980> for<00:03:41.160> you<00:03:41.310> just<00:03:41.489> get<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:41.760> pretty

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
well dried off and now we'll glue it

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.780 
well dried off and now we'll glue it
onto<00:03:45.329> the<00:03:45.480> head<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:45.810> put<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.019> hose<00:03:46.170> clamps<00:03:46.620> on

onto the head and put the hose clamps on

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.960 
onto the head and put the hose clamps on
I<00:03:47.900> like<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:48.930> fold<00:03:49.319> it<00:03:49.470> in<00:03:49.590> half

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
I like to fold it in half

I like to fold it in half
remember<00:03:51.079> shiny<00:03:52.079> side<00:03:52.769> up<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.579> can<00:03:54.000> just<00:03:54.030> lay

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
remember shiny side up you can just lay

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.259 
remember shiny side up you can just lay
it<00:03:54.450> on<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.780> head<00:03:55.579> make<00:03:56.579> sure<00:03:56.760> there's<00:03:57.000> plenty

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269

it on the head make sure there's plenty
of<00:03:57.870> space<00:03:58.290> on<00:03:58.680> both<00:03:58.920> sides<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.579> pull<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.890> two

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
of space on both sides to pull and two

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.740 
of space on both sides to pull and two
of<00:04:02.040> us<00:04:02.160> are<00:04:02.310> going<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.489> do<00:04:02.670> this<00:04:02.819> but<00:04:03.180> one

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
of us are going to do this but one

of us are going to do this but one
person<00:04:04.260> can<00:04:04.530> do<00:04:04.769> it<00:04:04.799> it's<00:04:05.160> just<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.519> little<00:04:05.549> more

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
person can do it it's just a little more

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.910 
person can do it it's just a little more
difficult<00:04:06.360> and<00:04:06.510> Michael's<00:04:07.349> a<00:04:07.410> lot<00:04:07.590> stronger

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
difficult and Michael's a lot stronger

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.520 
difficult and Michael's a lot stronger
than<00:04:08.129> me<00:04:08.430> so<00:04:08.610> I<00:04:08.670> like<00:04:08.879> to<00:04:08.910> have<00:04:09.209> him<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.720> you

than me so I like to have him to you
know<00:04:10.680> pull<00:04:11.459> it<00:04:11.579> really<00:04:11.730> tight<00:04:11.849> so<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:12.900> get<00:04:13.170> the

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
know pull it really tight so you get the

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.650 
know pull it really tight so you get the
hose<00:04:13.560> clamps<00:04:14.069> on<00:04:14.220> there<00:04:14.489> and<00:04:14.700> you<00:04:15.209> clamp<00:04:15.510> it

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
hose clamps on there and you clamp it

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.930 
hose clamps on there and you clamp it
down<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:16.139> start<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:16.470> clamp<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:16.859> down<00:04:16.940> just

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
down you start to clamp it down just

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.750 
down you start to clamp it down just
enough<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:18.419> get<00:04:18.539> it<00:04:19.220> tight<00:04:20.220> so<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:20.669> doesn't

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
enough to get it tight so it doesn't

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.750 
enough to get it tight so it doesn't
fall<00:04:21.180> down<00:04:21.209> off<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.810> drum<00:04:25.520> depending<00:04:26.520> on<00:04:26.610> what

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
fall down off the drum depending on what

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.879 
fall down off the drum depending on what
size<00:04:26.970> hose<00:04:27.330> clamps<00:04:27.990> you<00:04:28.169> get<00:04:28.380> you'll<00:04:28.710> either

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
size hose clamps you get you'll either

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.570 
size hose clamps you get you'll either
be<00:04:29.039> gazing<00:04:29.460> together<00:04:30.120> two<00:04:30.479> or<00:04:30.840> three<00:04:31.830> it

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
be gazing together two or three it

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.000 
be gazing together two or three it
doesn't<00:04:32.940> really<00:04:33.060> matter<00:04:33.330> you<00:04:34.289> just<00:04:34.320> need<00:04:34.770> to

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
doesn't really matter you just need to

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.659 
doesn't really matter you just need to
get<00:04:35.639> enough<00:04:35.940> you<00:04:36.210> get<00:04:36.419> around<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.930> head<00:04:37.669> now

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
get enough you get around the head now

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:45.370 
get enough you get around the head now
it's<00:04:41.030> it's<00:04:42.030> fairly<00:04:42.360> tight

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:53.650 

now<00:04:46.380> Michaels<00:04:46.800> going<00:04:46.949> to<00:04:47.040> start<00:04:47.280> pulling<00:04:51.979> then

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
now Michaels going to start pulling then

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.240 
now Michaels going to start pulling then
when<00:04:54.660> he<00:04:54.840> pulls<00:04:55.139> I<00:04:56.780> tighten<00:04:57.889> then<00:04:58.889> he<00:04:59.070> goes

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
when he pulls I tighten then he goes

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.770 
when he pulls I tighten then he goes
like<00:04:59.550> 180<00:05:00.180> degrees<00:05:00.540> and<00:05:00.840> pulls<00:05:01.139> again<00:05:02.570> you<00:05:03.570> can

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
like 180 degrees and pulls again you can

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.100 
like 180 degrees and pulls again you can
see<00:05:04.020> the<00:05:04.199> pack<00:05:04.440> o'clock<00:05:04.740> move<00:05:05.780> so<00:05:06.780> you'd<00:05:06.990> be

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
see the pack o'clock move so you'd be

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.080 
see the pack o'clock move so you'd be

it's a redo okay can you stop there a

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.480 
it's a redo okay can you stop there a
second<00:05:51.900> Michael<00:05:52.050> it<00:05:52.530> does<00:05:52.830> have<00:05:53.099> a<00:05:53.130> little<00:05:53.370> bit

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
second Michael it does have a little bit

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.719 
second Michael it does have a little bit
of<00:05:53.639> an<00:05:53.849> egg<00:05:54.060> shape<00:05:54.860> so<00:05:55.860> he's<00:05:56.130> going<00:05:56.310> to<00:05:56.400> take

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
of an egg shape so he's going to take

of an egg shape so he's going to take
that<00:05:56.940> egg<00:05:57.120> shape<00:05:57.389> and<00:05:57.599> go<00:05:57.720> those<00:05:58.020> sides<00:05:58.349> and

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
that egg shape and go those sides and

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.620 
that egg shape and go those sides and
see<00:05:59.520> if<00:05:59.580> it'll<00:05:59.729> pull<00:05:59.970> is<00:06:00.389> already<00:06:00.870> tight<00:06:02.630> you

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
see if it'll pull is already tight you

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.270 
see if it'll pull is already tight you
just<00:06:03.690> keep<00:06:04.020> pulling<00:06:04.229> do<00:06:04.500> you<00:06:04.590> see<00:06:04.800> no<00:06:05.039> movement

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
just keep pulling do you see no movement

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.070 
just keep pulling do you see no movement
in<00:06:05.820> the<00:06:05.849> head<00:06:08.240> the<00:06:09.240> tighter<00:06:09.539> you<00:06:09.750> do<00:06:09.930> it

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
in the head the tighter you do it

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:18.670 
in the head the tighter you do it
actually<00:06:10.470> the<00:06:10.590> higher<00:06:10.770> the<00:06:10.979> pitch<00:06:11.250> so

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.860 

understand<00:06:19.680> you<00:06:19.770> move<00:06:20.010> did<00:06:20.280> you<00:06:20.430> know<00:06:21.120> okay<00:06:21.810> so

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
understand you move did you know okay so

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.230 
understand you move did you know okay so
I<00:06:22.020> think<00:06:22.320> we're<00:06:22.500> done<00:06:22.710> so<00:06:23.490> I<00:06:23.520> give<00:06:23.729> it<00:06:23.760> one<00:06:23.880> last

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
I think we're done so I give it one last

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.540 
I think we're done so I give it one last
tight<00:06:24.870> clamp<00:06:25.260> and<00:06:25.530> then<00:06:28.190> sounds<00:06:29.190> pretty<00:06:29.400> good

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
tight clamp and then sounds pretty good

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.750 
tight clamp and then sounds pretty good
so<00:06:31.940> that's<00:06:32.940> the<00:06:33.180> end<00:06:33.270> of<00:06:33.389> this<00:06:33.570> of<00:06:34.400> the<00:06:35.400> next

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
so that's the end of this of the next

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.260 
so that's the end of this of the next
step<00:06:36.440> will<00:06:37.440> be<00:06:37.470> to<00:06:37.830> let<00:06:38.099> it<00:06:38.220> sit<00:06:38.490> overnight<00:06:38.669> and

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
step will be to let it sit overnight and

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.110 
step will be to let it sit overnight and
dry<00:06:39.599> and<00:06:39.930> then<00:06:40.740> the<00:06:40.830> final<00:06:41.250> step<00:06:41.460> is<00:06:41.520> to<00:06:41.789> cut

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
dry and then the final step is to cut

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.770 
dry and then the final step is to cut
this<00:06:42.810> excess<00:06:43.500> off
