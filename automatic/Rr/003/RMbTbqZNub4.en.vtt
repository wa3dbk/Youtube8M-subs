00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:31.659 
let's try out the Maelstrom first and

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:34.020 
let's try out the Maelstrom first and
we'll<00:00:32.020> see<00:00:32.140> how<00:00:32.290> it<00:00:32.439> does<00:00:32.590> and<00:00:32.920> then<00:00:33.070> I'll<00:00:33.790> show

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
we'll see how it does and then I'll show

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.670 
we'll see how it does and then I'll show
you<00:00:34.090> something<00:00:34.359> that<00:00:34.510> you<00:00:34.660> never<00:00:34.840> seen<00:00:35.079> before

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.610 

there's<00:00:38.680> your<00:00:38.890> maelstrom<00:00:39.250> g5<00:00:39.640> with<00:00:39.910> the<00:00:40.000> s2

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
there's your maelstrom g5 with the s2

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.599 
there's your maelstrom g5 with the s2
you<00:00:41.620> can't<00:00:41.800> really<00:00:41.949> see<00:00:42.160> it<00:00:42.190> out<00:00:42.340> here

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.609

bout four or five hundred yards away
I'll<00:00:51.039> get<00:00:51.190> a<00:00:51.219> better<00:00:51.399> distance<00:00:51.699> when<00:00:51.879> I<00:00:51.940> get

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
I'll get a better distance when I get

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:53.939 
I'll get a better distance when I get

here got about a hundred yards with some
of<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.090> smaller<00:03:01.420> lights<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:02.050> I<00:03:02.770> wanted<00:03:03.010> to

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
of the smaller lights and I wanted to

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.920 
of the smaller lights and I wanted to
show<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.310> this<00:03:03.760> big<00:03:04.060> beast<00:03:04.330> in<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.720> same

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
show you this big beast in the same

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.600 
show you this big beast in the same
conditions<00:03:05.440> just<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.800> note<00:03:05.980> actually<00:03:06.430> turn

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
conditions just to note actually turn

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.600 
conditions just to note actually turn
the<00:03:06.760> exposure<00:03:07.120> way<00:03:07.570> way<00:03:07.810> down<00:03:08.050> for<00:03:08.320> this

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
the exposure way way down for this

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
the exposure way way down for this
compared<00:03:09.610> to<00:03:09.700> what<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:09.970> other<00:03:10.000> ones<00:03:10.390> were

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
compared to what the other ones were

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.150 
compared to what the other ones were
because<00:03:11.050> Mac's<00:03:11.320> done<00:03:11.500> on<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.710> other<00:03:11.860> ones<00:03:12.040> had

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
because Mac's done on the other ones had

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.460 
because Mac's done on the other ones had
to<00:03:12.190> turn<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.490> way<00:03:12.610> down<00:03:12.790> because<00:03:13.690> you

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
to turn it way down because you

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.690 
to turn it way down because you
basically<00:03:14.890> would<00:03:15.100> have<00:03:15.190> just<00:03:15.340> seen<00:03:15.520> a

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
basically would have just seen a

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.210 
basically would have just seen a
completely<00:03:16.240> white<00:03:16.450> screen<00:03:16.840> on<00:03:17.770> this<00:03:17.920> video

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
double-click it and you have strobe I

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.750 
double-click it and you have strobe I
turned<00:05:39.620> it<00:05:39.740> on<00:05:39.830> but<00:05:40.130> I've<00:05:40.220> already<00:05:40.340> blinded

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
turned it on but I've already blinded

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.400 
turned it on but I've already blinded
myself<00:05:40.880> about<00:05:41.330> 50<00:05:41.660> times<00:05:41.870> with<00:05:42.050> this<00:05:42.200> thing

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
myself about 50 times with this thing

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.770 
myself about 50 times with this thing
and<00:05:42.590> I<00:05:43.400> still<00:05:43.760> have<00:05:43.910> spots<00:05:44.150> from<00:05:44.450> about<00:05:44.660> the

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
and I still have spots from about the

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.750 
and I still have spots from about the
last<00:05:44.930> time<00:05:45.140> I<00:05:45.169> did<00:05:45.380> it<00:05:45.410> a<00:05:45.680> half<00:05:46.130> hour<00:05:46.250> ago

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
last time I did it a half hour ago

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.520 
last time I did it a half hour ago
so<00:05:47.090> I<00:05:47.120> don't<00:05:47.600> really<00:05:47.780> want<00:05:47.960> to<00:05:47.990> do<00:05:48.140> that<00:05:48.260> again

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
so I don't really want to do that again

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:49.690 
so I don't really want to do that again
so<00:05:48.710> I'm<00:05:48.980> not<00:05:49.070> going<00:05:49.190> to<00:05:49.280> turn<00:05:49.370> this<00:05:49.520> one<00:05:49.640> on

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
so I'm not going to turn this one on

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.610 
so I'm not going to turn this one on
inside<00:05:50.090> because<00:05:50.390> it's<00:05:50.600> a<00:05:50.720> it's<00:05:51.320> just<00:05:51.500> too

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
inside because it's a it's just too

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.210 
inside because it's a it's just too
bright<00:05:51.830> for<00:05:51.890> that<00:05:52.190> so<00:05:53.620> that's<00:05:54.620> the<00:05:54.770> prototype

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
bright for that so that's the prototype

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.760 
bright for that so that's the prototype
of<00:05:55.250> the<00:05:55.580> four<00:05:55.820> sevens<00:05:56.180> XM<00:05:56.570> 18<00:05:56.960> final<00:05:57.500> version

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
of the four sevens XM 18 final version

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.590 
of the four sevens XM 18 final version
maybe<00:05:57.950> a<00:05:58.100> little<00:05:58.280> bit<00:05:58.490> different<00:05:58.640> I'm<00:05:59.540> going

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
maybe a little bit different I'm going

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.150 
maybe a little bit different I'm going
to<00:05:59.780> see<00:05:59.900> if<00:05:59.960> we<00:06:00.020> can<00:06:00.169> get<00:06:00.260> David<00:06:00.440> tomorrow<00:06:00.950> to
