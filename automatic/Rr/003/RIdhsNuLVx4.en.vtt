00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.910
 1.8.8 and start as always from the very beginning. 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.500
 start simple and obvious yes we have 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.119
 today command blocks and different 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.920
 interesting team here is such 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.810
 fun team that allows 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.789
 you call the inhabitants in the boat she is fine 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.070
 works because it is correct 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.019
 the team is such an option team 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.679
 which does the same thing it looks like 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.300
 a little bit like this and it doesn't work 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.399
 she used to call michroft thefts now 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.260
 it just doesn't work here appears 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.610
 the inscription that it is impossible to call 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.610
 the object you need 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.620
 ok moreover there is an option and yet 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.500
 such a team who do the same 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.850
 absolutely but no she just calls 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.489
 boat and fake ka-a and a fake 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.050
 This nosy man is not much shorter 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.910
 I know a lot about redstone 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.890
 rob me and tell my affairs today 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.289
 you about the new version of minecraft and all 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.899
 Further, as you can see, everything is fine too 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.510
 It works correctly before crumbling whether 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.010
 server whether client mikroft shorter all 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.390
 it was terribly bad there are 4 more teams 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.220
 that looks like this and that's it 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.320
 does my thing the same no 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.439
 fake boats appear ok 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.570
 further fixed a very important and terrible 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.280
 a bug that caused people not to 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.900
 could run my server and I 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.000
 as far as I understand it is about 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.810
 vanilla minecraft server naturally 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.490
 licensed 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.159
 version 1.8.3 which run based on 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.439
 windows 7 service pack 1 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.380
 Well, I go it is clear that this bug a fix 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.860

 your favorite Windows and nothing with you 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.549
 bad does not happen here but it is not yet 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.590
 everything here was still some kind that we have a and 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.530
 there was another dodgy bug in general 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.990
 the point is that itâ€™s not right 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.969
 displayed skulls player who 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.860
 were put on pro living things 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.600
 Well, for example, do you remember such a card 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.360
 having gone as for passing there 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.190
 the return of the chrobrin there was created 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.410
 hirobrin in this way 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.540
 It was put on like a gun and a chirobrina to us 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.930
 instant zombie hq further zombies still 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.040
 400 health points were given there 2 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.420
 improved damage and so on that is 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.250
 ordinary zombies using 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.950
 ordinary teams were turned into 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.100
 common hirobrin easy and simple 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.320
 here and in this tank appeared in one of 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.170
 versions of mikroft 18 as I remember and 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.190
 now he is safe and fixed 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.500
 now head 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.900
 players normally displayed if her 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.880
 put on different monsters it's cool 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.890
 so here it is, my noggin is two skin 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.540
 shows up when you just call 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.730
 usually gun stand 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.060
 More precisely rack for armor on which she 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.640
 somewhere your noggin was not only a bug 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.500
 which which was that 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.480
 was happening forced 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.570
 update your minecraft with all 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.230
 its share of Komi when you visit 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.020
 server or out of it have you 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.260
 remember my review on the michroft version 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.210
 1.8.7 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.830
 and I told you about this bug as 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.680
 it turns out he is d'issey he is after all 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.390
 stayed and you decided to fix in again 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.690
 this time seems to be his really 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.450
 fixed entirely 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.520
 Then there are a few more 4 bugs 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.770
 exploit who called to what 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.209
 could have stolen their servers 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.270
 safely fixed 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.459
 and most importantly, the description of these bugs 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.070
 nowhere they are in the closed 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.510
 accessible because if this description 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.790
 give open access then evil people 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.010
 they will only be busy and that 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.650
 cause more minecraft servers well you 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.600
 you know shorter there was some 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.860
 potential exploit which fell out 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.500
 caused server theft 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.150
 explay related to exploit banners 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.980
 which allowed the use of banners 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.680
 in some ingenious way and shorter 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.660
 caused and this bug caused wild likes on 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.430
