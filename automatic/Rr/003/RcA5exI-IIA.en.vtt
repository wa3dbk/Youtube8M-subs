 hello with you polina kuznetsova 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.630
 today I will tell you how 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.450
 processed bottom of the skirt on the skirts of 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.250
 drape mostly from grass is from heavy 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.520
 fabrics for winter 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.220
 because we wear winter shoes and often 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.539
 very tidy up the treatment of merlock gadfly 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.760
 breaks and that's so the skirt slid well 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.939
 and nervous not torn processed 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.620
 Miter seam how to do it now 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.300
 I'll show you for this I took a leak 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:41.040
 look at the skirt should be like this 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.590
 tightly cut it on the oblique thread two with 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.910
 half a centimeter two and a half 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.449
 centimeter striped and be sure to 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:56.390
 brazenly silky and here we fold our face 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.390
 with a striped face with the product 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.869
 we pin the pins about the product 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.500
 and to the dead 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.760
 I am good there is no such disk 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.730
 heavy 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.780

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.440
 as convenient right away 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:13.820
 mix fast and easy 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:16.920

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.750
 stitching something at a distance of 0 from 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.750
 centimeters from serious 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:38.510

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:47.000

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:39.840
 It turned out such a processing edging 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.870
 oblique strip she not Assol strip on 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.020
 does not create thickness 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:48.600
 but she will have you slide in the footsteps 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.810
