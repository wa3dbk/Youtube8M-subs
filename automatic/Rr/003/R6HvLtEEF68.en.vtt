00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.240
 short by flying so that is 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.299
 really big here there is 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.470
 to find really cool thing 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:29.939
 I do not want to show that completely now 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.520
 we make in the extra video typical kbvb 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.710

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.930
 a cheap shop could be there then 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.409
 still xp get decisive advantage 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.630
 was really interesting for us there is 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:50.180
 not much to say you have any more 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:54.230
 Comments do not really matter 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:58.010
 no, there is a whole salary there is 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.890
 everything just cool etc 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.770
 We'll be back in a minute 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.210
 The lobby was really good with it 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.830
 we have already gone twice 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.110
 almost finished now 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.680
 Little is missing the building yet guessed 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.030
 Hands last in the last imagination 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.590
 already seen it was pretty 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.560
 empty but now the drive already 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:23.450
 really hot and now blissfully and will 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.030
 certainly fun to play here 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.580
 for those survival lovers below 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.330
 you so it's really everything 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.040
 done 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.470
 now there is a farm is 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.330
 So that's where you come from 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.410
 portal i believe that knows sternchen 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.640
 not even that I have not him 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.910
 showed me last night 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.430
 included 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.959
 and if you go by it comes in ride 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.000
 to get things for your property 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.190
 I also have a fine thing to do 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.280
 worked out blablabla we are designed 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.560
 this will be specially built here 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.930
 and that's the little thing we do 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.790
 build here maybe once here 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.739
 better than lonely and yet other arenas 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.910
 pvp you can then in front of a plot 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.190
 make etc 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.660
 that's all we have time 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:14.470
 it should not fail 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.470
 Well, we have said everything I still think 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:27.880
 we do not need it very quickly 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:30.560
 actually knows that every petra knows 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.769
 Everybody is practical 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:38.930
 the same now so it is 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:41.930
 Pretty much everything is unpacked for just two 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.260
 teams we get to it soon 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.260
 That means there are four teams then can 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.120
 play several against each other and then 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.650
 it will be even more exciting that 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.650
 we will be declared extra 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.000
 pretty much one wants but like 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.730
 You can say you drive the most 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.639
 on 101 since we have really cool things 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.470
 so that will be one here 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.660
 quite 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.090
 main attraction are many great premium 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.820
 themes and brothel was then so it will be 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.170
 Well, I would say good 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.560
 also make the same conclusion words as 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.610
 we said to the classic the idea 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.810
 Do you still have something to say because 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.079
 then we say goodbye right away 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.079
 again 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:26.680
 no not only maybe not it 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.650
 sunday is your job 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.400
 is not looking to spam that you apply 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.870
 based server occurs so have 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.190
 some people already tried but we 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.320
 have not quite a just yet 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.340
 do we still have Sunday and there 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.350
 I would say 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.840
 three riders we wish you much fun 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.580

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.720

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:52.020
