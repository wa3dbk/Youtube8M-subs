00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:20.940
 in this sample 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:23.790
 joel madden or mount 18 points that are 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:27.120
 the multiples of 3 that are needed 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:30.000
 whenever this stitch is done more 3 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.760
 necessary points so that it remains 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.270
 perfectly square the design of the 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.270
 little stars 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.430
 forward some careers like so that 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.150
 you see how they come out but we're going to 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.920
 to realize that this is what I just 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.350
 to mount it in maillard my 18 points and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.510
 let's start it in race number 1 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.180
 let's do it very slowly step by step 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.250
 the stitch is not reversible it comes out 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.530
 only on the right side 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.820
 we started race number 1 and we do 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.820
 2 rights 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:11.520
 two rights one loop 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.310
 three rights one 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.420
 two 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:22.759
 and three rights below 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:26.060
 I look for the first point of the three points 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:30.130
 that I just did to the mixed right and 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.540
 he passed it over the other two 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.530
 there it is like that 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.070
 and loose 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.000
 and a loop 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.000
 again 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.060
 a right two rights 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.060
 three rights 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.870
 it passed over the two points 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:59.220
 knits in right stitch 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:01.370
 the first point was spent see the threads 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.370
 loose 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.869
 is the lazada and this little piece of 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.860
 three points is the whole design of the 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.980
 stitch on the right side we're going to 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.930
 repeat it again 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.750
 one 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.350
 two 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.560
 three points in right point 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.340
 as the first of the three points that 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.830
 I have you and passed it over the others 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.430
 two a loop 1 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.430
 two 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.780
 3 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.050
 as the first 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.800
 of the three points he passed over 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.800
 the other two 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:56.660
 a loop 1 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.660
 23 knits in right stitch 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.810
 I take the first steps on the 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.860
 two others 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:10.970
 I loose them and I finish my line number 1 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:14.420
 with 1 point in right point the race 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.630
 number 2 is done all in a reverse point 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.050
 let's see you remember how it is 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.540
 the first point backwards all upside down 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:27.350
 I pass the thread over the needle 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:30.590
 I enter the needle I stack the strand about 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.800
 the needle and the whole career took off 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.080
 does exactly the same 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.810
 I finished the race number two them 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.270
 I remember in reverse all the 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.120
 races that are even points we're going to 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:48.040
 start race number three as what 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.040
 we make a right 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:56.100
 three points at a right point 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:59.100
 2 and 3 and we do the same as in the first 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.650
 race we passed the first point about 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.600
 the other 2 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.960
 laced 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.160
 I leave one 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.610
 yew 2 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.380
 Yew 3 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:19.799
 I already return the first one over the other two 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:22.040
 the yew saga 12 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.540
 3 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.400
 step the first over the other two 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.350
 they must constantly be counting the 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.750
 points so that they are not going to be wrong 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:37.950
 and they will lose a point or a loop 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:40.550
 because they would damage the stitch 1 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.550
 two 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:56.410
 the steps lazada 1 2 and 3 was my last 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.230
 design I do the same as all the returned 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.270
 Y 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:04.290
 the loose 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:08.120
 a loop I finish my line with that with 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.120
 two points at a right point 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.080
 the next race is on the side of the 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.159
 backwards therefore it touches me all in 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.900
 a reverse point I finished the race number 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:21.780
 four on the wrong side of the fabric 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.849
 and last of the design if you have 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.280
 a doubt if there is something that did not fit 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:29.099
 Clearly visit my page how to weave 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.199
 dotcom and there you will find all the 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:35.090
 written instructions as I told them of 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:35.090
 this and all the stitches that I take
