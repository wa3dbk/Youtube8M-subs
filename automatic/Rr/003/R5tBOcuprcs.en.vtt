 also said Oscar that everyone was going to do their own face apparently came out 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.790
 determined to do so aims to make a difference and caught our attention 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.790
 how it was getting 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.920
 We do not understand the proposal but surely that as a client I 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:24.060
 he knows as the fox in days past delincan do a greater says 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.429
 these are the images that correspond to the first c 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.599
 the program was fulfilled with texas and china sina 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.470
 The first half 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.470
 ratified after his presence 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.290
 citing as escort antonio norm 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.140
 Indagatory with own elements 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.090
 as early as deputies 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.950
 the rest was expected a reappearance of jorge llanas we are all working on 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.670
 that 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.440
 but still not among those ahead 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.940
 the ranking yielded this result first each Castilian 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.540
 about 50 on 2 73 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.770
 2nd and 4th antonio martos both in the second 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.760

 Miss Jorge Torres 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.960
 precisely with the dollar we were talking 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.180
 before it started almost 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.180
 let's listen to what we're going to do 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.550
 Arming a little more importance to the fact a bit negative 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.320
 we can not say it will not stay 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.670
 and can you give us and the evidence that the car said again has cast enough of the range 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.720
 of wolves so I think not 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.950
 baloghová for periods of the year and what happens the circuit favors whom 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.420
 because to decrease it so you can call that chevrolet has 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.420
 more possibilities because it says for the kisses of 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.690
 already in the category is very competitive so 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.660
 I do not believe in that but 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.210
 you have to see a good car in day for another one already I believe it because everything in this 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.599
 category without equal 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.230
 we are talking at the end of the season we should touch the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.889
 regulations to balance 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:15.319
 I think that 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.679
 match above all 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:20.219
 you can no longer benefit 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:24.540
 i where you have to work in the pursued of course the low 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:27.399
 sale of the thought percent 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:29.880
 in fact the veto to the box and the price 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.379
 it's quite important for when 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.899
 a smell and all the power he needed 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:39.359
 burke that is very lucky because we know that he will fight with everything to 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.059
 recover what you have lost 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:44.439
 of course it is that we have spent year 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.129
 PS fighting a lot with the chassis but apparently it is composed of a 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.429
 little bit so 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:53.869
 ecuador that what happens here in short and chacao tarot 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.490
