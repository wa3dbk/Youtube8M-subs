of common mistakes in this movement the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.540 
of common mistakes in this movement the
one<00:00:47.359> could<00:00:47.600> be<00:00:47.719> bar<00:00:47.960> placement<00:00:48.559> and<00:00:48.769> the<00:00:49.429> other

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
of range of motion as far as

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.939 
of range of motion as far as
implementing<00:00:53.750> this<00:00:53.870> into<00:00:54.199> our<00:00:54.230> training<00:00:54.710> just

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
implementing this into our training just

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.380 
implementing this into our training just
like<00:00:55.100> any<00:00:55.370> other<00:00:55.550> squat<00:00:55.940> we're<00:00:56.089> going<00:00:56.210> to<00:00:56.269> use

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
like any other squat we're going to use

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.419 
like any other squat we're going to use
this<00:00:56.480> as<00:00:56.660> a<00:00:56.690> complex<00:00:57.500> compound<00:00:57.920> type<00:00:58.160> lift

00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:58.429 
this as a complex compound type lift

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:00.069 
this as a complex compound type lift
where<00:00:59.059> we're<00:00:59.420> going<00:00:59.539> to<00:00:59.600> increase<00:00:59.899> the

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
where we're going to increase the

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.680 
where we're going to increase the
intensity<00:01:00.559> really<00:01:00.980> lower<00:01:01.280> to<00:01:01.489> volume<00:01:01.910> because

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
intensity really lower to volume because

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.560 
intensity really lower to volume because
it's<00:01:02.899> such<00:01:03.199> a<00:01:03.230> nervous<00:01:04.190> system<00:01:04.370> taxing<00:01:05.300> type

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
it's such a nervous system taxing type

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.690 
it's such a nervous system taxing type
movement<00:01:06.230> we<00:01:06.620> really<00:01:06.950> like<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.250> go<00:01:07.370> with<00:01:07.550> low

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
movement we really like to go with low

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.520 
movement we really like to go with low
volume<00:01:07.940> however<00:01:08.659> if<00:01:08.810> I'm<00:01:08.900> working<00:01:09.200> with<00:01:09.320> a<00:01:09.350> kid

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
volume however if I'm working with a kid

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.679 
volume however if I'm working with a kid
that<00:01:09.590> has<00:01:09.799> really<00:01:10.159> bad<00:01:10.310> posture<00:01:10.700> I<00:01:11.060> might

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
that has really bad posture I might

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.480 
that has really bad posture I might
lower<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.110> weight<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:12.619> add<00:01:12.829> a<00:01:12.860> little<00:01:13.369> bit

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
lower the weight and add a little bit

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.520 
lower the weight and add a little bit
more<00:01:13.579> reps<00:01:14.030> just<00:01:14.270> so<00:01:14.750> he<00:01:14.900> can<00:01:15.020> work<00:01:15.229> that<00:01:15.470> out

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
more reps just so he can work that out

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.679 
more reps just so he can work that out
now<00:01:16.040> as<00:01:16.189> far<00:01:16.369> as<00:01:16.430> benefits<00:01:17.060> go<00:01:17.240> with<00:01:17.390> desert

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689
