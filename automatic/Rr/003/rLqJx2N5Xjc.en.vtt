00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.699
 hello today let's see 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.749
 all the steps of a stone facing 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.749
 sweat wood frame walls 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.740
 then we are in the cage 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.560
 tower-shaped staircase of one of 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.840
 wooden houses can also be seen 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.420
 bull's-eye for the hopper then 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.020
 bear the stone wall sweat walls 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.510
 wooden frame 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.810
 here we have a wall in accordance with the dtu 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.239
 31,2 amount of saturnine others 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.689
 bracing the weft feature 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.840
 tight 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:11.390
 every 40 cm to support the weight 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:18.289
 is then reinforced stapling the 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:19.700
 canton we are on the outside side the 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:21.859
 bracing panel was covered 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.009
 of a movie by then on the entire 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:24.009
 building 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.130
 to have a siding system 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.340
 insurable we left on a 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.009
 prescription of the 52.2 dtu 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:02:04.950
 glue paste breaks and the notice 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:02:06.299
 panel manufacturer's technique then 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.429
 the realization of the joints will be carried out 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.790
 in two stages first of all a 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.260
 full lining between the stones and 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.959
 then the tricky part is that it takes 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.970
 wait for a good catch from June before 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.519
 to make a passage the brushing done 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.989
 with a metal brush the wrought 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.750
 now finished so I remember 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.190
 so reconstituted stone stick on walls 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.410
 in wood frame you saw all the 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.269
 montage to make a wink a little 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.850
 to the tradition of stone buildings 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.640
 we took out a gable stone 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.780
 a natural stone the idea was that 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.250
 whenever the owner of the 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.260
 paid house a shot to drink at the pike or 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.210
 massaging he was taking out a stone so 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.830
 actually we have gables with 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.480
 full of stones exit is there good on 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.600
 was not very generous but finally that 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.010
 reminds a bit of tradition so a 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.610
 little reminder so we put in 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.140
 place specific training on on 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.160
 these panels with our partners in soil 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.960
 nov 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.710
 listen I tell you to the next 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.710
 see you soon
