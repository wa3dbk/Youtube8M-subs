 ae 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.159
 And here people are demonstrating here in the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.859
 in the safe harbor that they interviewed 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:47.429
 murilo oliveira is now just at the convention 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:50.879
 I tattooed and everything went well 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:55.019
 thank god while trying to run away 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:59.329
 four to five years, I started to 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:01.320
 to work recently there 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.500
 professionally about three years ago 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.780
 It's for competition that sort of thing. 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.280
 that I devoted myself to the same profession of the father 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.920
 you started to become clear inside 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.470
 how did you get interested in tattooing 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.659
 I actually had contact with a tattoo 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:21.030
 when I was about 15 years old and 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.039
 a friend Armadillo year and found it very cool 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.190
 that with homemade national machine 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:28.229
 I made a machine and started 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.909
 to act but was not at all serious about 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:37.890
 joke but friends are arrived one 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:41.759
 a while I was not I did not 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.129
 I wanted to work in a non-search 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.590
 I have nothing against it but I do not know 

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:48.959
 I felt it could be more where to buy 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.080
 a kit I started to work in the interior 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:53.849
 recently today is not a little longer 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.399
 better known but at first it went well 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:58.950
 hard so knows not your whole inside 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.470
 world is bias everyone is from 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.399
 But today I managed to reverse 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.979
 this is not it 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.899
 has not proved anything to anyone but to prove 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.649

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:14.280
 continues to be able to run ddm 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.260
 dedicated and always best is always what 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.510

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.819

 best viewed 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.670

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:22.080

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.549
