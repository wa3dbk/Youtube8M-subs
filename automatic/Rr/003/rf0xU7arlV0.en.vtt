in<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.500> pose<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.040> that's<00:01:38.549> mostly<00:01:38.880> because<00:01:39.000> I

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
in a pose and that's mostly because I

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.940 
in a pose and that's mostly because I
guess<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.750> really<00:01:40.110> couldn't<00:01:40.409> get<00:01:40.560> understand

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
guess I really couldn't get understand

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.859 
guess I really couldn't get understand
and<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.369> could<00:01:41.579> get<00:01:41.729> him<00:01:41.790> sand<00:01:42.150> he<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.750> he

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
and I could get him sand he just he

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.780 
and I could get him sand he just he
looked<00:01:43.079> pretty<00:01:43.500> awkward<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.399> decided<00:01:44.700> just

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
looked pretty awkward so I decided just

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.789 
looked pretty awkward so I decided just
to<00:01:44.909> put<00:01:45.090> him<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.270> some<00:01:45.420> cool<00:01:45.780> pose<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.560> start

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
to put him in some cool pose to start

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.780 
to put him in some cool pose to start
off<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.159> three<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.630> yeah<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.920> first<00:01:50.640> of

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
off the three of you so yeah so first of

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.410 
off the three of you so yeah so first of
all<00:01:50.880> let's<00:01:51.270> uh<00:01:51.600> let's<00:01:51.869> go<00:01:52.649> over<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
all let's uh let's go over just to the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.510 
all let's uh let's go over just to the
scope<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.140> figure<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.979> school<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
scope of the figure so school to the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.120 
scope of the figure so school to the
figure<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.909> actually<00:01:57.240> really<00:01:57.420> good<00:01:57.540> um<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.619> have

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
figure is actually really good um I have

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.639 
figure is actually really good um I have
to<00:01:59.280> say<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.880> really<00:01:59.909> resembles<00:02:00.899> Samuel

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
to say it really resembles Samuel

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.010 
to say it really resembles Samuel
Jackson<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.520> really<00:02:02.759> does<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.000> die<00:02:03.689> patch

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
Jackson it really does a die patch

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.959 
Jackson it really does a die patch
probably<00:02:04.590> helps<00:02:04.890> because<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.820> eyes

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
probably helps because the eyes

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.089 
probably helps because the eyes
sometimes<00:02:06.390> can<00:02:06.810> really<00:02:07.079> make<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.950> figure

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
sometimes can really make the figure

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.999 
sometimes can really make the figure
look<00:02:08.429> like<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.849> toy<00:02:09.149> not<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.840> nickel<00:02:10.500> character

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
look like a toy not a nickel character

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.190 
look like a toy not a nickel character
but<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.060> facial<00:02:12.090> hair<00:02:12.569> obviously

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
but and and the facial hair obviously

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.990 
but and and the facial hair obviously
helps<00:02:13.349> too<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:14.220> actually<00:02:14.580> looks<00:02:14.940> really

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
helps too so it actually looks really

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.630 
helps too so it actually looks really
good<00:02:15.270> maybe<00:02:15.569> it's<00:02:15.870> him<00:02:16.260> being<00:02:16.530> bald<00:02:16.739> sometimes

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
good maybe it's him being bald sometimes

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.400 
good maybe it's him being bald sometimes
I<00:02:17.879> you<00:02:18.120> know<00:02:18.239> when<00:02:18.540> they<00:02:18.750> do<00:02:18.810> hair<00:02:19.140> with<00:02:19.319> the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
I you know when they do hair with the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.080 
I you know when they do hair with the
character<00:02:19.769> it<00:02:19.920> can<00:02:19.950> look<00:02:20.069> unnatural<00:02:20.819> more

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
character it can look unnatural more

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.030 
character it can look unnatural more
like<00:02:21.239> I<00:02:21.330> figured<00:02:21.660> well<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.560> they<00:02:22.709> didn't<00:02:22.920> have

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
like I figured well so they didn't have

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.800 
like I figured well so they didn't have
to<00:02:23.099> do<00:02:23.220> with<00:02:23.340> him<00:02:23.489> so<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:24.120> actually<00:02:24.360> looks

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
to do with him so it actually looks

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.839 
to do with him so it actually looks
really<00:02:24.900> much<00:02:25.410> like<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.920> actor<00:02:26.519> which<00:02:26.700> is

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
really much like the actor which is

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.790 
really much like the actor which is
really<00:02:27.120> neat<00:02:27.300> I'm<00:02:27.569> really<00:02:27.870> happy<00:02:28.230> about<00:02:28.470> that

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
really neat I'm really happy about that

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.370 
really neat I'm really happy about that
it's<00:02:29.550> one<00:02:29.730> thing<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.060> didn't<00:02:30.870> love<00:02:31.080> about

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
it's one thing that I didn't love about

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.479 
it's one thing that I didn't love about
the<00:02:32.510> captain<00:02:33.510> america<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.959> 6<00:02:34.830> inch<00:02:34.950> version<00:02:35.220> it

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
the captain america a 6 inch version it

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.220 
the captain america a 6 inch version it
didn't<00:02:36.060> look<00:02:36.120> too<00:02:36.300> much<00:02:36.420> like<00:02:36.480> Chris<00:02:37.050> Evans

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
didn't look too much like Chris Evans

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.920 
didn't look too much like Chris Evans
the<00:02:37.590> actor<00:02:38.220> but<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:38.880> one<00:02:39.030> looks<00:02:39.209> like<00:02:39.540> Samuel

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
the actor but this one looks like Samuel

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.110 
the actor but this one looks like Samuel

counterpart which really doesn't look
great<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.359> doesn't<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:54.840> it<00:03:55.049> looks<00:03:55.230> okay<00:03:55.530> it

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
just it doesn't kind of look very

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.210 
just it doesn't kind of look very
natural<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:58.019> looks<00:03:58.049> kind<00:03:58.380> of<00:03:58.440> weird<00:03:58.500> this<00:03:59.069> is<00:03:59.190> a

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
natural it looks kind of weird this is a

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.699 
natural it looks kind of weird this is a
weird<00:03:59.370> fabric<00:03:59.819> that<00:03:59.970> they<00:04:00.090> use<00:04:00.269> them<00:04:00.540> so<00:04:00.870> so<00:04:01.680> i

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
weird fabric that they use them so so i

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.110 
weird fabric that they use them so so i
don't<00:04:02.220> love<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:02.609> know<00:04:02.670> i'll<00:04:02.730> just<00:04:02.940> put

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
don't love that you know i'll just put

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.110 
don't love that you know i'll just put
him<00:04:03.269> back<00:04:03.450> here<00:04:04.079> for<00:04:04.440> comparison<00:04:05.220> so<00:04:05.760> yeah<00:04:05.910> so

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120

him back here for comparison so yeah so
overall<00:04:06.540> i<00:04:07.109> really<00:04:07.500> like<00:04:07.950> that<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.280> way<00:04:08.400> that

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
overall i really like that the way that

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.690 
overall i really like that the way that
they<00:04:08.730> made<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.620> costume<00:04:10.620> being<00:04:11.130> software

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
they made the costume being software

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.259 
they made the costume being software
classic<00:04:12.239> because<00:04:12.540> it<00:04:12.660> really<00:04:12.840> allows<00:04:14.269> it

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
classic because it really allows it

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.740 
classic because it really allows it
really<00:04:15.510> makes<00:04:15.840> it<00:04:15.989> look<00:04:16.139> more<00:04:16.169> real<00:04:16.650> than<00:04:17.160> the

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
really makes it look more real than the

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.330 
really makes it look more real than the
fabric<00:04:18.750> which<00:04:19.079> supposed<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.769> makes<00:04:19.950> it<00:04:20.130> what

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
fabric which supposed to makes it what

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.190 
fabric which supposed to makes it what
it's<00:04:20.519> supposed<00:04:20.789> to<00:04:20.880> make<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.120> look<00:04:21.359> really<00:04:21.750> but

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
it's supposed to make it look really but

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.200 
it's supposed to make it look really but
I<00:04:22.229> just<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.830> really<00:04:23.039> don't<00:04:23.190> think<00:04:23.250> it<00:04:23.430> does<00:04:23.580> the

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
I just I really don't think it does the

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.630 
I just I really don't think it does the
only<00:04:24.570> problem<00:04:24.810> with<00:04:25.140> this<00:04:25.260> is<00:04:25.500> it<00:04:25.890> makes<00:04:26.400> his

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
only problem with this is it makes his

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.110 
only problem with this is it makes his
arms

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
arms

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.170 
arms
way<00:04:27.600> far<00:04:27.860> this<00:04:28.860> is<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.190> closest<00:04:29.760> in<00:04:29.910> that

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
way far this is the closest in that

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.420 
way far this is the closest in that
you're<00:04:30.330> gonna<00:04:30.419> get<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.780> arms<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.979> she's<00:04:32.250> got

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
you're gonna get the arms and she's got

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.310 
you're gonna get the arms and she's got
it<00:04:32.520> all<00:04:32.580> your<00:04:32.820> way<00:04:32.940> out<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:33.150> that's<00:04:33.510> as<00:04:33.840> far<00:04:34.050> in

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
it all your way out and that's as far in

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.439 
it all your way out and that's as far in
as<00:04:34.380> you're<00:04:34.710> gonna<00:04:34.800> get<00:04:34.949> there<00:04:35.160> just<00:04:35.430> move<00:04:36.270> him

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
as you're gonna get there just move him

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.480 
as you're gonna get there just move him
cuz<00:04:36.810> then<00:04:36.930> you<00:04:37.050> can<00:04:37.199> see<00:04:37.350> the<00:04:37.470> gap<00:04:37.650> in<00:04:37.830> there<00:04:37.979> so

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
cuz then you can see the gap in there so

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.760 
cuz then you can see the gap in there so
yeah<00:04:38.639> so<00:04:38.850> as<00:04:38.970> you<00:04:39.090> can<00:04:39.210> see<00:04:39.449> i'm<00:04:39.690> really<00:04:40.169> not

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
it's not a noticeable feature so that's

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:05.540 
it's not a noticeable feature so that's
okay<00:06:03.660> I'm<00:06:04.229> so<00:06:04.500> articulation<00:06:05.099> is<00:06:05.160> really<00:06:05.340> great

articulation which I didn't mention on

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.060

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
head but it allows you to look up like

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.110 
head but it allows you to look up like
way<00:06:13.380> forward<00:06:13.889> and<00:06:14.010> also<00:06:14.370> look<00:06:14.550> down<00:06:14.789> pretty
