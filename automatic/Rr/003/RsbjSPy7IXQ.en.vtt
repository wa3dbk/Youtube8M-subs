is you press right and left to turn and
forward<00:05:04.520> but<00:05:04.880> you<00:05:05.000> would<00:05:05.120> expect<00:05:05.540> if<00:05:05.750> you<00:05:06.200> hold

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
forward but you would expect if you hold

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.080 
forward but you would expect if you hold
down<00:05:06.470> you<00:05:06.950> would<00:05:07.070> back<00:05:07.310> up<00:05:07.550> and<00:05:07.820> instead<00:05:08.000> he

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
down you would back up and instead he

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.120 
down you would back up and instead he
just<00:05:08.120> starts<00:05:08.480> he<00:05:08.870> turns<00:05:09.200> around<00:05:09.410> which<00:05:09.860> can<00:05:10.040> be

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
just starts he turns around which can be

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:16.210 
just starts he turns around which can be
really<00:05:10.370> awkward

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.300
