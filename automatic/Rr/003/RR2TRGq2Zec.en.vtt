it's<00:02:30.560> very<00:02:30.799> easy<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.280> speculate<00:02:32.060> of<00:02:32.299> course

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
it's very easy to speculate of course

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.150 
it's very easy to speculate of course
and<00:02:32.989> and<00:02:33.650> all<00:02:33.910> many<00:02:34.910> other<00:02:35.209> places<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.989> do<00:02:36.230> my

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
and and all many other places to do my

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.119 
and and all many other places to do my
personal<00:02:37.810> feeling<00:02:38.810> is<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:38.989> we<00:02:39.680> should<00:02:40.180> get

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
personal feeling is that we should get

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.990 
personal feeling is that we should get
more<00:02:43.129> scientific<00:02:43.790> data<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.599> base<00:02:44.989> our

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
more scientific data to base our

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.880 
more scientific data to base our
discussion<00:02:47.000> song<00:02:47.329> so<00:02:48.140> what's<00:02:48.379> so<00:02:48.859> special

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
discussion song so what's so special

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.610 
discussion song so what's so special
about<00:02:49.459> Hess<00:02:49.970> Talent<00:02:50.480> well<00:02:51.079> it<00:02:51.200> turns<00:02:51.410> out

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
about Hess Talent well it turns out

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.280 
about Hess Talent well it turns out
actually<00:02:52.459> it's<00:02:52.849> not<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:53.269> special<00:02:53.540> that's<00:02:54.019> an

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
actually it's not that special that's an

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.860 
actually it's not that special that's an
interesting<00:02:55.220> question<00:02:55.519> of<00:02:55.970> course<00:02:56.269> and<00:02:56.690> we

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
interesting question of course and we

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.699 
interesting question of course and we
have<00:02:57.019> asked<00:02:57.530> us<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:58.180> several<00:02:59.180> times

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
look at this light high up in the sky it

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.790 
look at this light high up in the sky it
has<00:04:35.120> been<00:04:35.360> photographs<00:04:35.960> it<00:04:36.350> has<00:04:36.530> been

has been photographs it has been

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.620 
has been photographs it has been
recorded<00:04:37.490> on<00:04:37.699> videotapes<00:04:38.600> and<00:04:40.180> so<00:04:41.180> there<00:04:41.510> is

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
recorded on videotapes and so there is

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.010

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
no doubt that there is something going

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.689 
no doubt that there is something going
on<00:04:45.320> up<00:04:45.740> there<00:04:46.100> if<00:04:46.630> someone<00:04:47.630> at<00:04:48.410> this<00:04:48.889> location

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
on up there if someone at this location

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.800 
on up there if someone at this location
could<00:04:50.479> pick<00:04:50.840> up<00:04:51.110> some<00:04:51.820> instruments<00:04:52.820> to<00:04:53.300> see<00:04:53.630> if

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
could pick up some instruments to see if

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.529 
could pick up some instruments to see if
we<00:04:53.990> got<00:04:54.169> the<00:04:54.320> same<00:04:56.020> readings<00:04:57.020> as<00:04:57.350> we<00:04:57.650> do<00:04:58.539> or

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
we got the same readings as we do or
