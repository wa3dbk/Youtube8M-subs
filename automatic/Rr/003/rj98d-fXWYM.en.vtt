this<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.170> how<00:01:07.619> all<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.549> electronics<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
this is how all the electronics on the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.149 
this is how all the electronics on the
bus<00:01:09.570> you're<00:01:10.290> controlled<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.920> from<00:01:11.100> this

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
bus you're controlled just from this

actually not used yet that's how new the
bus<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.150> they<00:01:15.270> haven't<00:01:15.450> even<00:01:15.630> managed<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.080> fill

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
bus is they haven't even managed to fill
