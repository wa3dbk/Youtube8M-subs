00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.250
 hello everyone with you andrew andreich my 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.189
 site all point dot ru 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:11.670
 1260 6 challenge 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:15.440
 express and the length of the segment a b in meters 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:22.699
 dec and meters centimeters and millimeters 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:24.680
 if a b is equal to 8 integers 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.789
 906 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:32.640
 thousand meters 8 whole 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.590
 906 thousandths of a meter but in meters here already 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.390
 expressed why we were asked in meters 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.690
 express incomprehensible because now in 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.950
 meters written already in meters further 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.820
 let's express in meters in each 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.960
 meter 10 decimeters so that 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.649
 you need to convert from meters to dice and meters 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.210
 multiply the number by 10 to translate from 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.820
 meters in dice and meters need number 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.070
 multiply by 10 how can we multiply by 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.470
 10 number 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.380
 it's very simple we can just comma 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.860
 move 1 sign to the right and 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.860
 over here 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.750
 89 point six hundredth meter faces 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:24.420
 decimeters further we need ides and 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:28.500
 meters translate to centimeters in each 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.750
 decimeter and 10 centimeters so that 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.140
 convert 9 meters to centimeters 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.610
 we need to multiply the number by 10 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.590
 multiply by 10 please just the number itself 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:45.990
 numbers in the number does not change only changes 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:48.049
 Let us again hear 8906 also 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.759
 wrong to last pass 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:54.930
 centimeters just move the comma 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:58.110
 one more sign to the right, that is, if 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.170
 decimeters we had 89 then centimeters 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.290
 already 890 10 times more 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.729
 to become 10 times more we can just 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.729
 move 1 comma 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.810
 and further we need to translate from 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.810
 centimeters to millimeters exactly the same 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.450
 in a way 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.240
 in centimeters in every centimeter 10 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.430
 millimeters so that from centimeters 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.430
 translate into millimeters we comma 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.640
 move one more sign over here 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.740
 from here when, stands the very end and after 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.840
 she has nothing this comma in 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.300
 principle, you can no longer write that is 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.590
 you, it turns out here after her 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.870
 then there is nothing then I do not write 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.880
 it turns out 8906 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.290
 millimeters that's such a problem 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.150
 write in the comments whether it was all 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.550
 clear in solving this problem 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.740
 if you like my videos 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.880
 advise friends and classmate on 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.880
 that's all for now
