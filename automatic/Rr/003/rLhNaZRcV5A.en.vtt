look<00:00:19.770> at<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.160> basic<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.850> setup<00:00:21.300> from<00:00:21.539> the

look at the basic of the setup from the
face<00:00:21.840> on<00:00:22.109> view<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.590> see<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.189> posture<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.640> I

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
face on view and see the posture that I

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.910 
face on view and see the posture that I
take<00:00:24.060> at<00:00:24.269> address<00:00:24.630> can<00:00:25.199> dramatically<00:00:25.710> affect

take at address can dramatically affect
how<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.699> can<00:00:27.060> rotate<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.750> shift<00:00:28.019> my<00:00:28.230> weight

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
how I can rotate and shift my weight

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.310 
how I can rotate and shift my weight
during<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> golf<00:00:29.970> swing<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.779> looking<00:00:31.080> down

during the golf swing and looking down
the<00:00:31.740> target<00:00:32.009> line<00:00:32.399> how<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.000> posture<00:00:33.510> would

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
the target line how the posture would

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.959 
the target line how the posture would
affect<00:00:34.020> how<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.410> can<00:00:34.739> maintain<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.370> angles

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
affect how I can maintain the angles

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.319 
affect how I can maintain the angles
that<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.239> set<00:00:36.570> during<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> swing<00:00:37.910> this<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:38.969> very

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
that I set during the swing this is very

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.910 
that I set during the swing this is very
important<00:00:39.899> because<00:00:40.050> if<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.440> poor

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
important because if you have poor

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.160 
important because if you have poor
balance<00:00:41.219> you'll<00:00:41.850> never<00:00:42.059> hit<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.480> ball<00:00:42.660> with

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
balance you'll never hit the ball with

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.860 
balance you'll never hit the ball with
the<00:00:43.320> heart<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> golf<00:00:44.160> swing<00:00:44.340> which<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.360> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the heart of the golf swing which is to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.440 
the heart of the golf swing which is to
me<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.260> great<00:00:46.320> loss<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.100> power<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.789> you'll<00:00:48.270> end

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
me a great loss of power and you'll end

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.840 
me a great loss of power and you'll end
up<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.899> squealing<00:00:49.680> swirling<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.550> swinging

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
up just squealing swirling and swinging

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.540 
up just squealing swirling and swinging
at<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.059> ball<00:00:51.300> with<00:00:51.449> your<00:00:51.570> hands<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.110> arms<00:00:52.550> so

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
at the ball with your hands and arms so

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.250 
at the ball with your hands and arms so
let's<00:00:53.730> look<00:00:53.940> at<00:00:54.120> what<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> consider<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.960> good

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
let's look at what I consider a good

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.180 
let's look at what I consider a good
setup<00:00:55.530> position<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:57.570> knees<00:00:57.890> flex<00:00:58.890> slightly

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
setup position the knees flex slightly

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.849 
setup position the knees flex slightly
depending<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.329> your<00:01:00.480> height<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:01.469> bend<00:01:01.710> from

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
depending on your height you bend from

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.340 
depending on your height you bend from
the<00:01:01.949> waist<00:01:02.070> most<00:01:03.030> important<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.570> all<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.989> must

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
the waist most important of all you must

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.859 
the waist most important of all you must
be<00:01:04.589> relaxed<00:01:05.040> from<00:01:05.220> your<00:01:05.369> shoulders<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.659> will

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
be relaxed from your shoulders this will

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.219 
be relaxed from your shoulders this will
allow<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.409> turn<00:01:07.860> naturally<00:01:08.640> around<00:01:09.270> into

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
allow you to turn naturally around into

it shifts to the left side and then

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.710 
it shifts to the left side and then
around<00:01:22.320> again<00:01:22.740> too<00:01:23.670> often<00:01:23.850> from<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.390> tight
