you can buy on the market you have to
develop<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.890> hardware<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:21.000> develop

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
develop the hardware you have to develop

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.560 
develop the hardware you have to develop
the<00:01:21.720> software<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.030> find<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
the software and you have to find a

great<00:01:24.930> sound<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> car<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.240> took<00:01:27.750> us

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
great sound for the car and this took us

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.280 
great sound for the car and this took us
more<00:01:28.860> than<00:01:29.130> than<00:01:29.490> three<00:01:29.729> years<00:01:29.909> all<00:01:30.900> the

acoustics engineers have meanwhile

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.289 
acoustics engineers have meanwhile
succeeded<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.409> giving<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.890> r8<00:01:35.400> e-tron<00:01:35.700> a

succeeded in giving the r8 e-tron a

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.350 
succeeded in giving the r8 e-tron a
sound<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.320> clearly<00:01:37.710> identifies<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.909> as<00:01:39.060> an

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
sound that clearly identifies it as an

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.240 
sound that clearly identifies it as an
electronic<00:01:39.810> vehicle<00:01:40.560> while<00:01:40.890> at<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> same

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.630 

this<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.940> what<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.480> ADI<00:01:51.780> r8<00:01:52.470> e-tron<00:01:52.740> sounds

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
this is what the ADI r8 e-tron sounds

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.810 
this is what the ADI r8 e-tron sounds
like<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.600> road
