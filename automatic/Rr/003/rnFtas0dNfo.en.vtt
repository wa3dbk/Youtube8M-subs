00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.840
 hi girls then today i want to do 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.610
 soon carpets made it clear that I saw 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.710
 do from fleurs de force that a girl 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.150
 that makes videos here on youtube like me in between 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.220
 the other also known in London and is 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.840
 very very nice and so I have 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.930
 thought about doing this tag because 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.489
 consists of listing and e55 reasons for 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.340
 which youtube has changed ours 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:30.020
 life that can be a bit absurd to say 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.119
 that there was some strange for those who do not 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.460
 knows youtube but for me and 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.460
 many other girls and many others 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.179
 people not just girls making videos 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.340
 on Youtube 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:42.949
 in the end it is a bit so then I 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.539
 it seemed nice to let you know exactly the 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.160
 my five reasons why I have you 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.399
 changed my life and is also a way 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.260
 to thank you because anyway 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.300
 all I have thanks to my channel 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.219
 on youtube and all thanks to you reason 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.629
 I would say that number one thanks to youtube e 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.579
 especially thanks to you I would say that 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.010
 this video more than youtube would be 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.690
 better to say that you have changed the 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.720
 my life however the tag is called so 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.880
 surely I managed to win the 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.530
 my shyness I do not say a hundred for 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.479
 one hundred and eighty percent 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.210
 because if they had told me ten years 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.659
 makes that I would have a channel on youtube 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.090
 in short, there is not so much followed 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.979
 never even believed a bit of a guy 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.750
 the mind because I have always been one of 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.540
 those very private people more than 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.450
 shy very reserved and I open for 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.479
 nothing in a simple way with people and 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.450
 so I would never really have it 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.310
 believed it is now no longer scares me for 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.110
 example speak in front of a video camera 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.840
 or talk 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.300
 in public they are a bit yes though 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.920
 very much much less than one 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.560
 time I just took the brown if 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.390
 I have to talk in front of 10 typical people 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.670
 now they are a little bit more 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.590
 in short, thanks, it's mine 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.760
 youtube jaga experience made the 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.340
 number two made me passionate 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.950
 even more to makeup is the world of 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.910
 beauty because I've always been 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.040
 passionate about make-up tricks and things 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.929
 of the genus however thanks to youtube they are 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.670
 managed to exploit this in my opinion 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.620
 my passion at most because I have 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.410
 really learned so much indeed 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.390
 pretty much everything I know about 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.680
 trick and I learned thanks to others 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.380
 girls doing what I do 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.239
 on youtube and then this then 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.790
 did not allow to start and to have 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.190
 a channel of my own so yes 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.290
 surely this was also the case 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.820
 fact of having accentuated one of mine 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.290
 passion is to have allowed me to 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.630
 express it better and then number three le 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.310
 job opportunities I received 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.260
 that I'm getting thanks to the popularity 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.830
 of my channel on youtube and also here 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.200
 at the end 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.330
 and thanks to you and something that I would never have 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.610
 imagined when I opened the canal 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.440
 almost four years ago I almost had it 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.630
 the opportunity to work with many homes 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.180
 cosmetics that just up to some 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.680
 year ago I never thought that 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.880
 they knew of my existence but I would 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.730
 never thought precisely that houses 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.170
 cosmetics or fashion brands would be 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.549
 never been interested in me and then 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.560
 in short, it has really changed a bit 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.360
 precisely the working sphere and therefore 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.120
 all this amazed me very much 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.290
 in short, this opportunity for me is 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.650
 It was really a big surprise 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.120
 so I am very grateful a lot 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.890
 grateful for this is the number four 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.410
 definitely the opportunity to travel 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.720
 very often as you know I was 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.239
 the shadow to google studies to know 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.740
 the many my colleagues who do 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.320
 what I do in short on youtube 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.030
 other colleagues in Europe and then much 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.760
 I often go back to Italy this makes me 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.470
 really very pleased now 25 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.020
 May as you know there is the meeting with 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.090
 you in the shop give it and I can't wait 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.430
 I also have other little things to do in Italy 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.080
 but I am very happy because I have 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.430
 the opportunity to come back often 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.650
 italy then to review mine 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.480
 family and my friends what not 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.980
 would happen if you weren't there if not 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.080
 there was youtube if I didn't have any 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.880
 commitments in Italy because they would pass 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.800
 very very long periods without 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.420
 see friends families then this 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.820
 not for which I am very much 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.410
 grateful then made number 5 golds 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.450
 He met many Smart Girls 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.320
 that same passion of mine with many of 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.840
 I feel we write to each other and it's one thing 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.200
 a more defined relationship and if 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.820
 they told me some time ago , yes 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.560
 they talked about meeting people 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.230
 through the internet having immediately thought 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.590
 bad kind of gods appeals people 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.790
 via dangerous internet now 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.950
 instead I see it totally 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.900
 different and I don't just talk about 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.990
 girls who make videos like me that I have 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.490
 known to various events that obviously 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.890
 that too has done me a lot 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.050
 pleasure but I'm also talking about 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.660
 you girls with whom I feel 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.760
 a beautiful relationship with many was born 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.770
 of you so it is something that in short me 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.020
 it is very joyful and a very relationship 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.350
 special that they are or that they succeed at 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.090
 understand the relationship we have but 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.850
 I am for me it is a very important thing 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.490
 I care so much so girls this 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.230
 was to equip them today I hope in short who 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.750
 must have let a few minutes pass 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.730
 in joy and having kept you company 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.530
 this video tag then I ask you to 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.450
 leave me below in the comments i 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.070
 five reasons why youtube has 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.950
 changed your life with the cans 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.570
 leave me any video answer is if 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.760
 youtube has not changed your unit 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.420
 so radically let me know 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.620
 the five reasons why maybe a 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.720
 change a little or five 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.370
 things that have changed 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.080
 in your life since you have 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.390
 discovered youtube here said that these 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.950
 the five things that have changed for you 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.230
 since you discovered youtube that ne 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.850
 I know maybe you want to tell me it's over 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.670
 too much time when more canvas see i 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.710
 video or I don't know you tell me so 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.450
 in fact he whole gaze I send a 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.040
 very serious kiss and see you at 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.710
 next video which will be Monday 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.970
 hi now i take lay line and ringe with 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.620
 this little brush that what 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.810
 prefer sitting on the eyeliner 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.180
 it is much simpler to spread it 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:01.700
 with this I go and apply the eyeliner 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:03.800
 from mid eyelid to outside and then 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.640
 from half I bring the color slowly 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.640
 towards the inner corner
