micro cap stocks I'm a size group out

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.740 
micro cap stocks I'm a size group out
before<00:00:50.710> me<00:00:50.829> any<00:00:50.920> other<00:00:51.130> group<00:00:51.480> then<00:00:52.480> I'm<00:00:52.600> in

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
before me any other group then I'm in

before me any other group then I'm in
value<00:00:53.140> stocks<00:00:53.530> and<00:00:53.860> then<00:00:54.010> value<00:00:54.310> stocks<00:00:55.110> most

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110

growth<00:00:58.420> stocks<00:00:58.780> so<00:00:59.140> my<00:00:59.739> idea<00:01:00.040> was<00:01:00.310> to<00:01:00.489> combine

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
growth stocks so my idea was to combine

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.100 
growth stocks so my idea was to combine
the<00:01:01.510> two<00:01:01.780> and<00:01:02.470> if<00:01:02.739> I<00:01:02.860> did<00:01:03.130> I<00:01:03.489> could<00:01:04.110> outperform

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
the two and if I did I could outperform

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.370 
the two and if I did I could outperform
the<00:01:05.500> market<00:01:06.149> when<00:01:07.149> I'm<00:01:07.299> looking<00:01:07.750> for<00:01:07.930> a<00:01:07.990> micro

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:32.139 
take a look at them and then in addition

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:35.789 
take a look at them and then in addition
to<00:01:32.560> that<00:01:32.789> I<00:01:33.789> would<00:01:34.479> prefer<00:01:34.719> the<00:01:35.229> revenues<00:01:35.619> be

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
to that I would prefer the revenues be

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:42.559 
to that I would prefer the revenues be
up<00:01:35.979> 10%<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:37.029> the<00:01:37.539> earnings<00:01:37.899> be<00:01:38.049> up<00:01:38.229> 20%<00:01:39.039> and<00:01:40.950> so

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
up 10% and the earnings be up 20% and so

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.859 
up 10% and the earnings be up 20% and so
and<00:01:43.569> I<00:01:43.689> get<00:01:44.079> a<00:01:44.109> lot<00:01:44.770> of<00:01:44.920> stocks<00:01:45.450> then<00:01:46.450> but<00:01:46.659> in

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
and I get a lot of stocks then but in

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.529 
and I get a lot of stocks then but in
addition<00:01:47.259> to<00:01:47.350> that<00:01:47.639> if<00:01:48.639> I<00:01:48.909> can<00:01:49.119> find<00:01:49.149> a

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
addition to that if I can find a

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.480 
addition to that if I can find a
catalyst<00:01:50.139> then<00:01:50.349> that<00:01:50.529> is<00:01:50.679> very<00:01:50.889> difficult<00:01:51.130> to

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
catalyst then that is very difficult to

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.580 
catalyst then that is very difficult to
find<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:51.849> catalyst<00:01:52.389> but<00:01:52.990> there's<00:01:53.380> some

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
find a catalyst but there's some

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.739 
find a catalyst but there's some
academic<00:01:54.189> studies<00:01:54.579> that<00:01:54.700> show<00:01:54.939> that<00:01:55.149> a<00:01:55.209> 70<00:01:55.630> to

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
academic studies that show that a 70 to

academic studies that show that a 70 to
90<00:01:56.139> percent<00:01:56.499> of<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.649> move<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.939> a<00:01:58.090> stock<00:01:58.420> is

90 percent of a move in a stock is

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:01.529 
90 percent of a move in a stock is
