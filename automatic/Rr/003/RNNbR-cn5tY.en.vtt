 stuffing the tamal waves in a pot with

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.659
 all the surface foam cooks to 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.749
 medium heat for half an hour with the pot 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.179
 let cool shred the chicken and save 

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:16.609
 the cooking broth is very well washed 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:20.140

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:22.759
 in hot water until they soften 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.950
 in new non-stick wallet or in a 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.740
 comal we make the tomatoes trying to 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.079
 take them by all its parts removes the 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.880
 skin and cut into cubes do not have to be 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.359
 very perfect because then they go to 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.359
 undo 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.310
 toast fat or jamaica pepper 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.270
 lightly in a pan to boost 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.800
 it's taste 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.800
 then crushed in a mortar 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.980
 with a little oil to skip 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.940
 onion until it stays slightly 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.980
 golden can not miss the spicy touch 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.170
 chop the chiles finally and add the 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.260
 just skip for a few seconds to 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.629
 prevent them from burning 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.700
 Now add the tomato that we have 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:21.629
 cut and cook until you release everything 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.299
 the liquid and reduce there is time to 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.709
 incorporate the chicken mix very well and 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.709
 keep cooking for a few minutes 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.650
 with salt and pepper to your taste this is 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.960
 very aromatic so be prudent and 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.310
 add little by little I'm testing up 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.310
 have the taste you want 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.730
 ah 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.180
 it drains and dries very well the leaves that 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.489
 we had previously hydrating 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.790
 we have everything ready to put together 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.010
 tamales now with a little dough so 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.430
 width of the sheet but do not lower the 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.769
 half height extends very well for 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.560
 let a thin layer with filling 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.920
 enough of generous so they will be more 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.569
 rich and the dough will not be so dry 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.130
 close and fold placing it with the 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.340
 opening looking down 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.140
 there are many fillings I made these 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.660
 because they are very easy ingredients 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:49.570
 get you let your imagination fly and 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:51.370
 fill in what you like most with 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.640
 leds another sheet so they are fine 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.640
 protected 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:15.079
 secure them like a piece of it 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:18.109
 leaf you remember the cooking broth 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:20.479
 of chicken strain it and put it in a 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.509
 vaporera with enough for 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:26.630
 kidnap the tamales now the grid 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:28.400
 with the tamales in vertical form with the 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.009
 part open up like this 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.740
 we will avoid that you leave the sauce closes 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.650
 like a cloth then with a plastic and 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.400
 end the lid so we will catch all the 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.610
 steam 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.919
 kitchen for 45 minutes from 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.169
 that the water starts to boil part of the 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.070
 fire and let it rest in it goes to 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.380
 power 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.980
 you know that they are ready when you take out 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.849
 one and easily peel off the sheet 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:59.399
 now if you are ready to serve 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:02.009
 do not forget to accompany them with a rich 

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:06.389
