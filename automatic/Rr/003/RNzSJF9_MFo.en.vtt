00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:27.649 
make your icons look 3d by moving around

make your icons look 3d by moving around
the<00:00:27.829> background<00:00:28.309> with<00:00:28.520> the<00:00:28.610> gyroscope<00:00:29.300> this

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
the background with the gyroscope this

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.019 
the background with the gyroscope this
is<00:00:30.020> a<00:00:30.050> little<00:00:30.410> like<00:00:30.590> that<00:00:30.860> except<00:00:31.430> it<00:00:31.640> tracks

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
is a little like that except it tracks

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.360 
is a little like that except it tracks
your<00:00:32.210> face<00:00:32.660> so<00:00:33.469> first<00:00:33.770> off<00:00:33.980> you're<00:00:34.160> going<00:00:34.280> to

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
your face so first off you're going to

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.650 
your face so first off you're going to
go<00:00:34.489> into<00:00:34.640> this<00:00:34.850> screen<00:00:35.239> where<00:00:35.450> it<00:00:35.540> will

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
go into this screen where it will

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.720 
go into this screen where it will
basically<00:00:35.840> track<00:00:36.380> your<00:00:36.590> face<00:00:36.890> and<00:00:37.219> if<00:00:37.609> you

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
basically track your face and if you

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.849 
basically track your face and if you
have<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.329> device<00:00:38.870> actually<00:00:39.230> shown<00:00:39.649> on<00:00:39.829> your

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:39.859 
have the device actually shown on your

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:42.549 
have the device actually shown on your
face<00:00:40.250> then<00:00:40.879> it<00:00:41.149> will<00:00:41.269> track<00:00:41.600> it<00:00:41.629> and<00:00:41.929> it<00:00:42.469> will

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
face then it will track it and it will

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.200 
face then it will track it and it will
basically<00:00:42.739> show<00:00:43.280> a<00:00:43.309> different<00:00:43.760> perspective

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
basically show a different perspective

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.250 
basically show a different perspective
of<00:00:44.780> where<00:00:45.530> the<00:00:45.769> 3d<00:00:46.370> will<00:00:46.879> move<00:00:47.179> around<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:47.929> how

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
of where the 3d will move around and how

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.470 
of where the 3d will move around and how
it<00:00:48.559> will<00:00:48.739> move<00:00:48.920> around<00:00:49.219> so<00:00:49.879> as<00:00:49.999> you<00:00:50.120> can<00:00:50.239> see

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
it will move around so as you can see

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.079 
it will move around so as you can see
the<00:00:50.749> device<00:00:51.050> looks<00:00:51.379> like<00:00:51.679> it's<00:00:51.920> 3d<00:00:52.489> if<00:00:52.699> you

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
the device looks like it's 3d if you

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:54.759 
the device looks like it's 3d if you
actually<00:00:53.300> have<00:00:53.659> the<00:00:53.870> device<00:00:54.170> in<00:00:54.409> your<00:00:54.440> hand

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
actually have the device in your hand

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.319 
actually have the device in your hand
it's<00:00:55.039> a<00:00:55.190> little<00:00:55.429> bit<00:00:55.550> different<00:00:55.969> and<00:00:56.059> it's<00:00:56.269> a

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
it's a little bit different and it's a

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:57.910 
it's a little bit different and it's a
little<00:00:56.539> glitchy<00:00:56.809> if<00:00:57.079> you<00:00:57.199> actually<00:00:57.379> move<00:00:57.769> it

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
little glitchy if you actually move it

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.290 
little glitchy if you actually move it
to<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:58.129> side<00:00:58.309> it<00:00:58.519> will<00:00:58.699> freeze<00:00:59.030> like<00:00:59.269> that

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
to the side it will freeze like that

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.110 
to the side it will freeze like that
nothing<00:01:00.199> an<00:01:00.319> update<00:01:00.679> can't<00:01:01.069> really<00:01:01.399> help<00:01:01.609> but

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
nothing an update can't really help but

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.969 
nothing an update can't really help but
this<00:01:02.329> is<00:01:02.510> also<00:01:02.659> a<00:01:02.809> demo<00:01:03.199> so<00:01:03.409> I<00:01:03.440> doubt<00:01:03.739> they'll

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
this is also a demo so I doubt they'll

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.790 
this is also a demo so I doubt they'll
be<00:01:04.010> updating<00:01:04.699> it<00:01:04.879> so<00:01:05.360> once<00:01:05.570> it<00:01:05.720> unfreezes<00:01:06.350> you

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
be updating it so once it unfreezes you

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.220 
be updating it so once it unfreezes you
can<00:01:06.979> see<00:01:07.250> that<00:01:07.550> it<00:01:07.729> keeps<00:01:07.970> doing<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.570> 3d<00:01:08.990> thing

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
can see that it keeps doing the 3d thing

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.650 
can see that it keeps doing the 3d thing
and<00:01:09.440> it<00:01:09.530> does<00:01:09.740> look<00:01:10.070> pretty<00:01:10.310> 3d<00:01:10.820> you<00:01:11.360> can<00:01:11.480> check

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
and it does look pretty 3d you can check

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.390 
and it does look pretty 3d you can check
out<00:01:11.750> different<00:01:12.200> screens<00:01:12.560> this<00:01:12.860> will<00:01:13.070> kind<00:01:13.220> of

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
out different screens this will kind of

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.210 
out different screens this will kind of
show<00:01:13.580> Yumi's<00:01:14.150> and<00:01:14.540> they're<00:01:15.410> on<00:01:15.590> some<00:01:15.920> sort<00:01:16.160> of

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
show Yumi's and they're on some sort of

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.550 
show Yumi's and they're on some sort of
weird<00:01:16.610> level<00:01:17.240> here<00:01:17.600> or<00:01:17.780> some<00:01:18.020> sort<00:01:18.230> of<00:01:18.320> weird

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
weird level here or some sort of weird

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.800 
weird level here or some sort of weird
stage<00:01:19.010> and<00:01:19.370> they're<00:01:19.910> moving<00:01:20.060> around<00:01:20.450> in<00:01:20.690> the

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
stage and they're moving around in the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.200 
stage and they're moving around in the
3d<00:01:21.200> zone<00:01:21.440> now<00:01:22.010> you<00:01:22.070> shouldn't<00:01:22.490> be<00:01:22.670> moving<00:01:22.850> this

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
3d zone now you shouldn't be moving this

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.330 
3d zone now you shouldn't be moving this
a<00:01:23.390> lot<00:01:23.690> or<00:01:23.960> else<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.440> will<00:01:24.530> freeze<00:01:24.890> like<00:01:25.190> I

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
a lot or else it will freeze like I

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.520 
a lot or else it will freeze like I
mentioned<00:01:25.520> before<00:01:25.730> but<00:01:26.690> you<00:01:26.960> can<00:01:27.110> just<00:01:27.320> check

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
mentioned before but you can just check

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.890 
mentioned before but you can just check
it<00:01:27.740> out<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.100> how<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.400> 3d<00:01:29.000> will<00:01:29.270> look<00:01:29.510> on<00:01:29.720> these

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
it out and how the 3d will look on these

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.740 
it out and how the 3d will look on these
devices<00:01:30.380> pretty<00:01:31.040> awesome<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.640> app<00:01:31.820> is<00:01:32.090> free<00:01:32.390> I

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
devices pretty awesome the app is free I

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.360 
devices pretty awesome the app is free I
really<00:01:33.050> like<00:01:33.200> this<00:01:33.380> one<00:01:33.590> where<00:01:33.770> it<00:01:33.890> shows<00:01:34.100> the

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
really like this one where it shows the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.520 
really like this one where it shows the
grid<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.910> it's<00:01:35.090> kind<00:01:35.330> of<00:01:35.390> moving<00:01:35.630> outward<00:01:36.230> and

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
grid and it's kind of moving outward and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.470 
grid and it's kind of moving outward and
everything<00:01:37.040> that's<00:01:37.550> a<00:01:37.670> really<00:01:37.910> cool<00:01:38.150> one<00:01:38.300> I

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.090 
everything that's a really cool one I
can't<00:01:38.870> wait<00:01:39.080> to<00:01:39.110> see<00:01:39.470> how<00:01:39.710> they<00:01:39.860> integrate

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
can't wait to see how they integrate

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.790 
can't wait to see how they integrate
this<00:01:40.520> into<00:01:40.960> applications<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.260> other<00:01:42.410> games

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
this into applications and other games

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.450
