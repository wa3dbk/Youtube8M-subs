who started relaxing my hair at a young

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.690 
who started relaxing my hair at a young
age<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:04.260> believe<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.710> was<00:01:04.860> younger<00:01:05.189> than<00:01:05.339> ten

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
age I believe I was younger than ten

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.380 
age I believe I was younger than ten
when<00:01:06.330> she<00:01:06.450> started<00:01:06.689> was<00:01:06.840> asking<00:01:07.170> my<00:01:07.290> hair<00:01:07.530> and

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
when she started was asking my hair and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.020 
when she started was asking my hair and
the<00:01:09.390> reason<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.290> because<00:01:10.490> this<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.700> what<00:01:11.880> my

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the reason is is because this is what my

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.530 
the reason is is because this is what my
hair<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:13.590> know<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.490> what<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.119> looks<00:01:15.240> like

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
hair you know is and what it looks like

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.520 
hair you know is and what it looks like
without<00:01:16.200> any<00:01:16.790> product<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.990> for<00:01:19.170> my<00:01:19.290> mom

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
without any product in it so for my mom

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.340 
without any product in it so for my mom
it<00:01:20.220> was<00:01:20.400> very<00:01:20.790> very<00:01:21.000> hard<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.810> her<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.049> style

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
it was very very hard for her to style

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.830 
it was very very hard for her to style
my<00:01:22.530> hair<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.700> could<00:01:24.090> imagine<00:01:24.330> she<00:01:24.689> had<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
my hair so I could imagine she had a

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.620 
my hair so I could imagine she had a
very<00:01:25.080> hard<00:01:25.350> time<00:01:25.619> styling<00:01:26.400> my<00:01:26.490> hair<00:01:26.520> curly<00:01:27.210> and

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
very hard time styling my hair curly and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.960 
very hard time styling my hair curly and
that<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.380> why<00:01:28.530> she<00:01:28.560> started<00:01:29.100> relaxing<00:01:29.610> my<00:01:29.700> hair

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
that is why she started relaxing my hair

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.600 
that is why she started relaxing my hair
and<00:01:30.210> doing<00:01:30.900> straight<00:01:31.290> styles<00:01:32.070> like<00:01:32.310> roller

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
and doing straight styles like roller

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.920 
and doing straight styles like roller
sets<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.180> blow<00:01:33.390> dryers

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
sets and blow dryers

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.380 
sets and blow dryers
and<00:01:34.110> such<00:01:34.799> because<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.400> was<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.520> easier<00:01:36.299> to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
and such because it was just easier to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.460 
and such because it was just easier to
maintain<00:01:37.189> but<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.610> took<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.090> upon<00:01:39.390> myself<00:01:39.470> when

use<00:04:22.560> some<00:04:22.890> of<00:04:22.980> that<00:04:23.010> to<00:04:23.850> create<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.420> twist<00:04:24.660> up

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
use some of that to create the twist up

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.870 
use some of that to create the twist up
so<00:04:25.440> what<00:04:25.680> I'm<00:04:25.770> going<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:25.920> do<00:04:26.100> first<00:04:26.370> is<00:04:26.670> I'm

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
so what I'm going to do first is I'm

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.760 
so what I'm going to do first is I'm
going<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.060> moisten<00:04:27.570> my<00:04:27.600> hair<00:04:28.050> because<00:04:28.500> it's

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
going to moisten my hair because it's

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.280 
going to moisten my hair because it's
actually<00:04:28.980> dry<00:04:29.520> right<00:04:29.790> now<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.360> I<00:04:30.930> want<00:04:31.140> to

start with some washed in hair once your
hair<00:04:38.310> is<00:04:38.430> damp<00:04:38.760> you<00:04:39.030> can<00:04:39.360> start<00:04:39.630> sectioning

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
hair is damp you can start sectioning

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.710 
hair is damp you can start sectioning
your<00:04:40.320> hair<00:04:40.470> into<00:04:41.130> sections<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:42.000> this<00:04:42.570> is

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
your hair into sections and this is

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:53.980 
your hair into sections and this is
going<00:04:43.020> to<00:04:43.170> allow<00:04:43.530> for<00:04:43.830> easier<00:04:44.430> styling<00:04:51.230> and

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
going to allow for easier styling and

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.810 
going to allow for easier styling and
after<00:04:54.990> you've<00:04:55.200> done<00:04:55.500> all<00:04:55.560> your<00:04:55.920> sections<00:04:56.520> you

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
after you've done all your sections you

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.520 
after you've done all your sections you
can<00:04:57.030> go<00:04:57.180> back<00:04:57.450> and<00:04:57.690> detangle<00:04:58.350> each<00:04:58.560> section

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
can go back and detangle each section

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.590 
can go back and detangle each section
I'm<00:05:01.530> going<00:05:01.890> to<00:05:02.070> begin<00:05:02.250> by<00:05:02.460> applying<00:05:02.940> a<00:05:03.300> little

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
I'm going to begin by applying a little

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.950 
I'm going to begin by applying a little
bit<00:05:03.750> of<00:05:03.870> each<00:05:04.110> product<00:05:04.650> in<00:05:05.190> my<00:05:05.550> hair

bit of each product in my hair
thoroughly<00:05:06.960> from<00:05:07.350> root<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.680> end

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.520 

after<00:05:15.669> applying<00:05:16.060> all<00:05:16.419> the<00:05:16.570> products<00:05:17.050> you're

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
after applying all the products you're

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.960 
after applying all the products you're
going<00:05:17.590> to<00:05:17.740> start<00:05:17.979> by<00:05:18.039> sectioning<00:05:18.729> your<00:05:18.789> hair

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
going to start by sectioning your hair

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.110 
going to start by sectioning your hair
into<00:05:19.750> even<00:05:20.080> smaller<00:05:20.190> sections<00:05:21.190> the<00:05:21.759> smaller

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
into even smaller sections the smaller

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.749 
into even smaller sections the smaller
the<00:05:22.330> sections<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:23.470> better<00:05:23.740> the<00:05:24.190> result<00:05:24.580> of

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 
the sections the better the result of

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:33.860 
the sections the better the result of
the<00:05:24.880> twist<00:05:25.150> out<00:05:25.360> and<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:26.199> faster<00:05:26.650> it<00:05:26.800> will<00:05:26.949> dry

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.420 

you're<00:05:34.870> going<00:05:34.900> to<00:05:35.050> take<00:05:35.229> one<00:05:35.560> small<00:05:35.740> section

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
you're going to take one small section

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.300 
you're going to take one small section
split<00:05:36.880> it<00:05:37.060> into<00:05:37.210> two<00:05:37.570> and<00:05:37.810> start<00:05:38.380> twisting<00:05:39.100> it

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
split it into two and start twisting it

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.110 
split it into two and start twisting it
very<00:05:39.940> nice<00:05:40.479> and<00:05:40.750> tight<00:05:41.229> from<00:05:42.220> the<00:05:42.580> root<00:05:42.940> of

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
very nice and tight from the root of

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.570 
very nice and tight from the root of
your<00:05:43.210> hair<00:05:43.270> all<00:05:43.690> the<00:05:44.289> way<00:05:44.470> down<00:05:45.070> to<00:05:45.250> the<00:05:45.370> very

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
your hair all the way down to the very

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.640 
your hair all the way down to the very
ends<00:05:47.759> by<00:05:48.759> pulling<00:05:49.210> on<00:05:49.360> each<00:05:49.570> end<00:05:49.930> you<00:05:50.500> will

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
ends by pulling on each end you will

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.930 
ends by pulling on each end you will
tighten<00:05:51.039> the<00:05:51.190> twist<00:05:51.550> for<00:05:51.910> better<00:05:52.270> definition

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
tighten the twist for better definition

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.029 
tighten the twist for better definition
okay<00:05:54.940> so<00:05:55.000> so<00:05:55.599> far<00:05:55.870> this<00:05:56.289> is<00:05:56.349> what<00:05:56.620> the<00:05:56.740> bottom

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 
okay so so far this is what the bottom

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:04.840 
okay so so far this is what the bottom
section<00:05:57.430> looks<00:05:57.639> like

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.700 

small<00:06:05.850> sections<00:06:06.300> at<00:06:06.450> a<00:06:06.480> time<00:06:06.570> continue<00:06:07.530> to

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
small sections at a time continue to

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.400 
small sections at a time continue to
twist<00:06:07.920> your<00:06:08.190> hair<00:06:08.490> from<00:06:09.150> top<00:06:09.420> to<00:06:09.660> bottom

Here<00:06:19.530> I<00:06:19.800> am<00:06:19.860> twisting<00:06:20.490> the<00:06:20.640> last<00:06:20.970> final

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
Here I am twisting the last final

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
section now that my hair is completely

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.020

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
twisted you want to make sure it is

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:38.050 
twisted you want to make sure it is
completely<00:06:30.480> dry<00:06:30.780> before<00:06:31.290> unraveling<00:06:32.280> the<00:06:32.460> tip

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.030 

the<00:06:39.060> best<00:06:39.330> way<00:06:39.540> to<00:06:39.570> unravel<00:06:39.960> the<00:06:40.440> twist<00:06:40.770> and

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040 
the best way to unravel the twist and

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.640 
the best way to unravel the twist and
preventing<00:06:42.030> frizz<00:06:42.330> is<00:06:42.600> to<00:06:42.990> just<00:06:43.230> twist<00:06:43.500> them

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
preventing frizz is to just twist them

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.920 
preventing frizz is to just twist them
in<00:06:43.860> the<00:06:44.010> opposite<00:06:44.520> direction<00:06:44.880> that<00:06:45.360> they<00:06:45.870> were

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
in the opposite direction that they were

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.470 
in the opposite direction that they were
twisted<00:06:48.800> one<00:06:49.800> by<00:06:50.010> one<00:06:50.340> continue<00:06:51.030> to<00:06:51.210> unravel

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.480 
twisted one by one continue to unravel

00:06:51.480 --> 00:07:02.120 
twisted one by one continue to unravel
each<00:06:52.110> twist<00:06:59.180> now<00:07:00.180> I<00:07:00.480> am<00:07:00.810> finished<00:07:01.470> unraveling

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130

each twist now I am finished unraveling
all<00:07:02.310> the<00:07:02.670> twists<00:07:03.120> and<00:07:03.300> this<00:07:04.080> is<00:07:04.230> what<00:07:04.380> my<00:07:04.500> hair

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.060 
looks like so I absolutely love this
curl<00:07:08.190> pattern<00:07:08.880> and<00:07:09.150> for<00:07:09.930> more<00:07:10.110> volume<00:07:10.410> you<00:07:10.860> can

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.070 
curl pattern and for more volume you can

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.250 
curl pattern and for more volume you can
continue<00:07:11.580> to<00:07:11.820> split<00:07:12.120> each<00:07:12.360> twist<00:07:12.990> even

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:13.260 
continue to split each twist even

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.930 
continue to split each twist even
further<00:07:15.350> so<00:07:16.350> this<00:07:16.650> is<00:07:16.890> the<00:07:17.070> final<00:07:17.280> results

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 
further so this is the final results

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490 
after splitting each twist even further

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.690 
after splitting each twist even further
and<00:07:20.870> this<00:07:21.870> is<00:07:22.110> how<00:07:22.260> I<00:07:22.290> like<00:07:22.650> it<00:07:22.680> I<00:07:23.190> absolutely
