all<00:00:00.450> right<00:00:00.659> so<00:00:01.050> what<00:00:01.140> do<00:00:01.199> we<00:00:01.260> got<00:00:01.380> here<00:00:02.090> this

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
all right so what do we got here this

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.970 
all right so what do we got here this
would<00:00:03.870> be<00:00:03.899> an<00:00:04.170> other<00:00:04.440> planet<00:00:05.160> channel<00:00:05.850> truck

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:06.980 
would be an other planet channel truck

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.150 
would be an other planet channel truck
with<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.280> Roja<00:00:10.160> hybrid<00:00:11.160> bushing<00:00:11.870> it's<00:00:12.870> been

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
with a Roja hybrid bushing it's been

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.310 
with a Roja hybrid bushing it's been
superimposed<00:00:14.160> onto<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.269> design<00:00:15.780> here<00:00:17.150> and

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
superimposed onto this design here and

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.500 
superimposed onto this design here and
this<00:00:19.320> looks<00:00:19.560> like<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:20.189> very<00:00:21.150> radical<00:00:22.369> new

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
this looks like a very radical new

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.929 
this looks like a very radical new
generation<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:26.660> other<00:00:27.660> planet<00:00:28.939> longboard

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
generation of other planet longboard

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.350 
generation of other planet longboard
technology<00:00:30.750> skateboard<00:00:31.320> trucks<00:00:32.000> so<00:00:33.000> it's

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
technology skateboard trucks so it's

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.540 
technology skateboard trucks so it's
just<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.930> big<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.559> just<00:00:34.590> not<00:00:35.000> quite<00:00:36.469> solid

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
just this big is just not quite solid

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.760 
just this big is just not quite solid
all<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.610> way<00:00:38.989> it's<00:00:39.989> causing<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.469> little

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
all the way it's causing that little

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.229 
all the way it's causing that little
little<00:00:40.980> room<00:00:41.160> right<00:00:41.190> yeah<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:41.879> look<00:00:42.059> how

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
little room right yeah but look how

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.030 
little room right yeah but look how
little<00:00:42.570> there<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.260> mean<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:43.920> very

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
little there is I mean it's it's very

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.420 
little there is I mean it's it's very
difficult<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.969> pull<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.899> axle<00:00:46.379> up<00:00:46.559> out<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
difficult to pull the axle up out of the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.950 
difficult to pull the axle up out of the
channel<00:00:47.840> mm-hmm

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
channel mm-hmm

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.310 
channel mm-hmm
it<00:00:49.350> has<00:00:49.620> not<00:00:49.950> only<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.280> mechanical<00:00:51.320> returned

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it has not only the mechanical returned

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.889 
it has not only the mechanical returned
the<00:00:52.500> center<00:00:52.920> that's<00:00:53.219> inherent<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.329> you

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the center that's inherent to the you

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.319 
the center that's inherent to the you
know<00:00:55.190> cam<00:00:56.190> design<00:00:56.629> but<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.719> also<00:00:57.870> has<00:00:58.230> this

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
know cam design but it also has this

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.900 
know cam design but it also has this
unbelievably<00:01:00.329> positive<00:01:01.340> return<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.550> center

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
unbelievably positive return to center

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.350 
unbelievably positive return to center
because<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.830> orientation<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.790> these

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
because of the orientation of these

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.640 
because of the orientation of these
bolts<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.189> the<00:01:08.189> resistance<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.720> bushing

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
bolts and the resistance of this bushing

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.440 
bolts and the resistance of this bushing
so<00:01:12.500> it<00:01:13.500> has<00:01:13.770> an<00:01:13.890> incredible<00:01:14.520> return<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.090> Center

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
so it has an incredible return to Center

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.640 
so it has an incredible return to Center
and<00:01:15.990> has<00:01:16.560> an<00:01:16.680> extremely<00:01:17.210> positive<00:01:18.210> feel<00:01:19.140> from

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
and has an extremely positive feel from

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.940 
and has an extremely positive feel from
edge<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.920> edge<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.729> its<00:01:21.600> chip<00:01:21.960> not<00:01:22.740> only

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
edge to edge as its chip not only

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.820 
edge to edge as its chip not only
through<00:01:23.159> its<00:01:23.189> travel<00:01:23.930> and<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.200> really<00:01:25.350> you

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
through its travel and it's a really you

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.340 
through its travel and it's a really you
know<00:01:27.229> sanitary<00:01:28.229> design<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:30.350> restricting

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
know sanitary design for restricting

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.800 
know sanitary design for restricting
rounds<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:33.470> it's<00:01:34.520> doing<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.790> variety<00:01:36.479> of

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
rounds in it it's doing a variety of

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.120 
rounds in it it's doing a variety of
different<00:01:37.820> beneficial<00:01:38.820> things<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:41.009> can

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
different beneficial things and you can

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.350 
different beneficial things and you can
adjust<00:01:41.270> ride<00:01:42.270> quality

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
adjust ride quality

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.210 
adjust ride quality
the<00:01:44.190> durometer<00:01:45.190> and<00:01:47.100> characteristics<00:01:48.100> of

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
the durometer and characteristics of

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.560 
the durometer and characteristics of
that<00:01:48.250> bushing<00:01:48.700> yeah

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
that bushing yeah

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.730 
that bushing yeah
so<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.970> thing<00:01:52.180> I<00:01:52.300> saw<00:01:52.810> when<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:53.080> saw<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.350> raw

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
so the thing I saw when I saw the raw

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.900 
so the thing I saw when I saw the raw
husband's<00:01:54.040> are<00:01:54.130> going<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.340> realize<00:01:54.640> how<00:01:54.820> it

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
husband's are going to realize how it

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.610 
husband's are going to realize how it
worked<00:01:55.180> its<00:01:55.960> III's<00:01:56.650> like<00:01:56.890> oh<00:01:57.690> it's<00:01:58.690> kind<00:01:59.470> a

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
worked its III's like oh it's kind a

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.670 
worked its III's like oh it's kind a
identified<00:02:00.280> that<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:01.360> way<00:02:01.540> it<00:02:01.720> was<00:02:01.840> working

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
identified that the way it was working

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.150 
identified that the way it was working
when<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:02.979> was<00:02:03.100> acting<00:02:03.520> as<00:02:04.470> intention<00:02:05.470> so<00:02:05.890> for

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
when it was acting as intention so for

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.320 
when it was acting as intention so for
these<00:02:06.310> two<00:02:06.370> bolts<00:02:06.729> right<00:02:06.880> here

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
these two bolts right here

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.810 
these two bolts right here
as<00:02:07.930> they<00:02:08.110> stretch<00:02:08.380> apart<00:02:10.440> was<00:02:11.440> really<00:02:12.250> close

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
as they stretch apart was really close

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.730 
as they stretch apart was really close
to<00:02:13.060> our<00:02:13.090> utilization<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.959> o-rings<00:02:14.110> yeah

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
to our utilization of the o-rings yeah

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.970 
to our utilization of the o-rings yeah
it's<00:02:15.130> an<00:02:15.190> expansion<00:02:15.610> system<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.740> this<00:02:17.740> is

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
it's an expansion system and this is

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.460 
it's an expansion system and this is
basically<00:02:18.280> what<00:02:18.700> we<00:02:18.850> have<00:02:19.060> here<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.510> mean<00:02:19.810> we

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
basically what we have here I mean we

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.430 
basically what we have here I mean we
had<00:02:20.680> an<00:02:20.980> early<00:02:22.470> prototype<00:02:23.470> with<00:02:24.040> an<00:02:24.550> internal

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
had an early prototype with an internal

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.530 
had an early prototype with an internal
bowring<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.760> that's<00:02:27.760> basically<00:02:28.209> what<00:02:28.420> this

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
bowring and that's basically what this

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.410 
bowring and that's basically what this
is<00:02:28.600> right<00:02:29.200> here<00:02:29.410> yeah<00:02:29.920> but<00:02:30.610> it's<00:02:31.180> what's

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
is right here yeah but it's what's

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.840 
is right here yeah but it's what's
really<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:32.230> know<00:02:32.410> is<00:02:32.650> this<00:02:33.520> is<00:02:33.730> an

quality tenfold you get the benefits of
the<00:02:50.530> mechanism<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:52.060> design<00:02:52.450> of<00:02:52.750> the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
the mechanism and the design of the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.259 
the mechanism and the design of the
other<00:02:53.019> planet<00:02:53.500> truck<00:02:53.739> with<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:55.049> chemical

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
other planet truck with the chemical

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.430 
other planet truck with the chemical
engineering<00:02:58.269> properties<00:02:59.080> of<00:02:59.350> the

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
engineering properties of the

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.949 
engineering properties of the
polyurethane<00:03:00.310> so<00:03:01.030> we<00:03:01.239> really<00:03:01.510> have<00:03:01.660> something

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
polyurethane so we really have something

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.150 
polyurethane so we really have something
that<00:03:02.700> could<00:03:03.700> potentially<00:03:03.850> be<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.870> very<00:03:05.350> high

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
that could potentially be a very high

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.180 
that could potentially be a very high
quality<00:03:06.900> piece<00:03:07.900> of<00:03:08.110> skateboard<00:03:08.650> equipment

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
quality piece of skateboard equipment

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.530 
quality piece of skateboard equipment
but<00:03:10.060> hey<00:03:10.630> oh<00:03:11.590> we've<00:03:12.250> done<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:12.730> far<00:03:12.760> is<00:03:13.030> throw<00:03:13.510> it

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
but hey oh we've done so far is throw it

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.020 
but hey oh we've done so far is throw it
together<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.290> check<00:03:14.590> it<00:03:14.709> out<00:03:14.830> in<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.010> Vice<00:03:15.190> so

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
together and check it out in the Vice so

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.750 
together and check it out in the Vice so
we're<00:03:16.180> gonna<00:03:16.299> give<00:03:16.600> this<00:03:17.470> bad<00:03:17.709> boy<00:03:17.950> runs<00:03:18.489> for

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
we're gonna give this bad boy runs for

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.520 
we're gonna give this bad boy runs for
its<00:03:18.910> money<00:03:19.150> once<00:03:19.630> we<00:03:19.810> get<00:03:19.900> it<00:03:20.049> set<00:03:20.260> up<00:03:20.350> on<00:03:20.470> a

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
its money once we get it set up on a

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.979 
its money once we get it set up on a
skateboard<00:03:20.830> deck<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:22.209> this<00:03:22.450> is<00:03:22.600> gonna<00:03:22.720> go

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
skateboard deck and this is gonna go

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.810 
skateboard deck and this is gonna go
this<00:03:23.890> is<00:03:23.980> probably<00:03:24.190> gonna<00:03:24.310> be<00:03:24.370> paired<00:03:24.670> with

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
this is probably gonna be paired with

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:32.100 
this is probably gonna be paired with
the<00:03:25.030> 30-degree<00:03:25.810> Rojas<00:03:30.390> we<00:03:31.390> haven't<00:03:31.870> shown

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
the 30-degree Rojas we haven't shown

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.560 
the 30-degree Rojas we haven't shown
this<00:03:32.290> in<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.620> videos<00:03:32.950> yet<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.519> just<00:03:34.180> have<00:03:34.330> a

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
this in the videos yet I just have a

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.250 
this in the videos yet I just have a
couple<00:03:34.900> pictures<00:03:35.110> oh<00:03:35.350> really<00:03:35.830> yeah<00:03:36.519> so<00:03:37.420> that's

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
couple pictures oh really yeah so that's

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.289 
couple pictures oh really yeah so that's
right<00:03:38.440> here<00:03:38.709> runs<00:03:38.980> you<00:03:39.100> show<00:03:39.310> us<00:03:39.489> this<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:42.299> this

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
right here runs you show us this so this

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:49.199 
right here runs you show us this so this
bad<00:03:43.540> boy<00:03:43.720> right<00:03:43.989> here<00:03:44.430> was<00:03:47.579> due<00:03:48.579> to<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:48.940> fact

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
bad boy right here was due to the fact

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.160 
bad boy right here was due to the fact
that<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:50.530> roja<00:03:50.950> hybrid<00:03:51.459> truck<00:03:51.760> only<00:03:52.390> comes<00:03:52.780> in

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
that the roja hybrid truck only comes in

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.559 
that the roja hybrid truck only comes in
a<00:03:53.230> 45<00:03:53.739> degree<00:03:53.950> baseplate<00:03:54.640> yeah<00:03:54.880> so<00:03:55.239> we<00:03:55.390> went

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
a 45 degree baseplate yeah so we went

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.090 
a 45 degree baseplate yeah so we went
ahead<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:55.780> welded<00:03:56.230> together<00:03:56.349> our<00:03:56.739> own

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
ahead and welded together our own

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.520 
ahead and welded together our own
30<00:03:57.310> degree<00:03:57.730> baseplate<00:03:58.240> out<00:03:58.450> of<00:03:58.660> some<00:03:58.840> you<00:03:59.410> know

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
30 degree baseplate out of some you know

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.350 
30 degree baseplate out of some you know
scrap<00:03:59.980> steel<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.580> a<00:04:00.610> few<00:04:00.790> bolts<00:04:01.000> we<00:04:01.180> had

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
scrap steel and a few bolts we had

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.940 
scrap steel and a few bolts we had
because<00:04:01.660> we're<00:04:01.840> using<00:04:02.050> it<00:04:02.350> with<00:04:02.590> other

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
because we're using it with other

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.830 
because we're using it with other
planets<00:04:03.750> exactly<00:04:04.750> so<00:04:05.050> we<00:04:05.170> wanted<00:04:05.410> to<00:04:05.530> find<00:04:05.920> a

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
planets exactly so we wanted to find a

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.960 
planets exactly so we wanted to find a
kingpin<00:04:07.840> angle<00:04:08.440> for<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.100> roja<00:04:09.430> truck<00:04:09.790> that

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
kingpin angle for the roja truck that

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.440 
kingpin angle for the roja truck that
would<00:04:10.060> complement<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.810> opie<00:04:11.380> truck<00:04:12.450> better

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
would complement the opie truck better

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.150 
would complement the opie truck better
so<00:04:14.260> it's<00:04:15.160> extremely<00:04:15.460> simple<00:04:16.300> it<00:04:17.230> utilizes<00:04:17.739> all

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
so it's extremely simple it utilizes all

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.830 
so it's extremely simple it utilizes all
the<00:04:18.520> existing<00:04:19.290> roja<00:04:20.290> thrust<00:04:21.390> bearings<00:04:22.390> and

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
the existing roja thrust bearings and

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.650 
the existing roja thrust bearings and
the<00:04:23.590> hangar<00:04:23.920> and<00:04:24.070> everything<00:04:24.430> so<00:04:25.180> it's<00:04:25.330> just

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
the hangar and everything so it's just

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.000 
the hangar and everything so it's just
the<00:04:25.780> base<00:04:25.960> plate<00:04:27.960> this<00:04:28.960> one<00:04:29.530> holds<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:29.800> board

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
the base plate this one holds the board

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:36.770 
the base plate this one holds the board
down<00:04:30.220> for<00:04:30.490> you<00:04:34.470> goes<00:04:35.470> together<00:04:35.710> just<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.460> same

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
down for you goes together just the same

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.050 
down for you goes together just the same
on<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:37.900> other<00:04:37.930> skateboard<00:04:38.740> is<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.640> bushing

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
on the other skateboard is the bushing

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.220 
on the other skateboard is the bushing
and<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.450> thrust<00:04:40.690> bearing<00:04:41.020> and<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.650> pudding

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.420 

spacer<00:04:47.490> else<00:04:48.490> on<00:04:48.670> your<00:04:48.730> spacesuit<00:04:50.130> but<00:04:51.130> it's

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
spacer else on your spacesuit but it's

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.660 
spacer else on your spacesuit but it's
really<00:04:51.640> really<00:04:52.390> simple<00:04:52.450> just<00:04:52.720> a<00:04:52.780> piece<00:04:52.930> of

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
really really simple just a piece of

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.480 
really really simple just a piece of
square<00:04:54.670> tubing<00:04:55.060> that<00:04:55.780> we<00:04:56.050> wired<00:04:56.350> to<00:04:56.920> the<00:04:57.070> angle

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
square tubing that we wired to the angle

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.460 
square tubing that we wired to the angle
that<00:04:58.090> we<00:04:58.150> wanted<00:04:58.600> so<00:04:58.750> we<00:04:58.870> could<00:04:59.020> effectively

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
that we wanted so we could effectively

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.620 
that we wanted so we could effectively
change<00:05:00.100> this<00:05:00.400> to<00:05:00.580> whatever<00:05:00.760> angle<00:05:01.330> we<00:05:01.450> want

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
change this to whatever angle we want

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.810 
change this to whatever angle we want
just<00:05:01.900> by<00:05:02.020> cutting<00:05:02.260> it<00:05:02.470> differently<00:05:02.830> and<00:05:03.070> then

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
just by cutting it differently and then

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.220 
just by cutting it differently and then
this<00:05:04.800> is<00:05:05.800> a<00:05:05.860> little<00:05:06.130> quarter-inch<00:05:06.700> yeah<00:05:07.230> bolt

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
this is a little quarter-inch yeah bolt

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.220 
this is a little quarter-inch yeah bolt
that<00:05:08.530> I<00:05:08.560> hacked<00:05:08.860> off<00:05:09.160> to<00:05:09.430> make<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:09.850> stud<00:05:10.840> we

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
that I hacked off to make the stud we

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.410 
that I hacked off to make the stud we
broke<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.500> weld<00:05:11.860> to<00:05:12.100> experiment<00:05:12.640> with<00:05:12.760> what

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
broke the weld to experiment with what

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.650 
broke the weld to experiment with what
would<00:05:13.510> do<00:05:13.600> what<00:05:13.750> there's<00:05:13.960> only<00:05:14.110> one<00:05:15.510> so<00:05:16.510> it's

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
would do what there's only one so it's

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.570 
would do what there's only one so it's
using<00:05:16.930> only<00:05:17.050> three<00:05:17.410> pegs<00:05:17.680> instead<00:05:18.370> of<00:05:18.490> the

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
using only three pegs instead of the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.520 
using only three pegs instead of the
floor<00:05:18.850> which<00:05:19.270> would<00:05:19.510> eliminate<00:05:20.020> the

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
floor which would eliminate the

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.330 
floor which would eliminate the
compression<00:05:21.220> a<00:05:22.770> lot<00:05:23.770> of<00:05:23.890> the<00:05:23.980> compression

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
compression a lot of the compression

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.870 
compression a lot of the compression
yeah<00:05:25.500> so<00:05:26.500> it<00:05:26.650> allows<00:05:27.040> to<00:05:27.250> experiment<00:05:27.640> it

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
yeah so it allows to experiment it

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.270 
yeah so it allows to experiment it
eliminates<00:05:28.600> the<00:05:28.750> compression<00:05:29.590> element<00:05:30.130> in

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
eliminates the compression element in

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.100 
eliminates the compression element in
the<00:05:30.430> skateboard<00:05:30.970> truck<00:05:31.380> so<00:05:33.330> and<00:05:34.330> it's<00:05:34.810> really

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
the skateboard truck so and it's really

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.400 
the skateboard truck so and it's really
nifty<00:05:35.640> because<00:05:36.640> it's<00:05:36.850> such<00:05:37.270> a<00:05:37.300> simple<00:05:38.020> design

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
nifty because it's such a simple design

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.230 
nifty because it's such a simple design
it<00:05:38.890> allows<00:05:39.160> us<00:05:39.190> to<00:05:39.460> change<00:05:40.020> ride<00:05:41.020> heights

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
it allows us to change ride heights

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.050 
it allows us to change ride heights
angles<00:05:43.240> and<00:05:43.840> you<00:05:44.560> know<00:05:44.680> experiment<00:05:45.100> so<00:05:45.760> this

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
angles and you know experiment so this

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.990 
angles and you know experiment so this
the<00:05:46.450> center<00:05:46.840> bolt<00:05:47.020> is<00:05:47.610> saying<00:05:48.610> these<00:05:48.730> on<00:05:48.880> the

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
the center bolt is saying these on the

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000 
the center bolt is saying these on the
road<00:05:49.210> they're<00:05:49.510> the<00:05:50.290> regular<00:05:50.620> off-the-shelf

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
road they're the regular off-the-shelf

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.210 
road they're the regular off-the-shelf
base<00:05:51.430> plate<00:05:51.640> and<00:05:51.910> it's<00:05:52.300> a<00:05:52.390> 12<00:05:52.720> millimeter<00:05:53.500> bolt

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
base plate and it's a 12 millimeter bolt

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.060 
base plate and it's a 12 millimeter bolt
yeah<00:05:54.820> which<00:05:55.360> is<00:05:55.390> the<00:05:55.540> same<00:05:55.840> as<00:05:56.080> a<00:05:56.110> dope<00:05:56.800> board

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
yeah which is the same as a dope board

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.970 
yeah which is the same as a dope board
axle<00:05:57.520> so<00:05:58.240> one<00:05:58.420> thing<00:05:58.600> we're<00:05:58.750> wondering<00:05:59.230> is<00:05:59.380> if

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
axle so one thing we're wondering is if

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.860 
axle so one thing we're wondering is if
we<00:06:00.250> could<00:06:00.370> replace<00:06:00.730> the<00:06:01.000> thrust<00:06:01.300> bearings

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
we could replace the thrust bearings

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.010 
we could replace the thrust bearings
which<00:06:02.560> are<00:06:02.740> really<00:06:03.280> custom<00:06:04.030> machined<00:06:04.510> for

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
which are really custom machined for

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.650 
which are really custom machined for
this<00:06:05.350> particular<00:06:05.950> hanger<00:06:06.729> and<00:06:06.910> actually

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
this particular hanger and actually

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.320 
this particular hanger and actually
replace<00:06:08.020> it<00:06:08.260> with

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
replace it with

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.070 
replace it with
don't<00:06:09.509> know<00:06:09.659> word<00:06:09.840> there<00:06:10.800> Vinny's<00:06:12.080> yeah

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
don't know word there Vinny's yeah

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.830 
don't know word there Vinny's yeah
fundin<00:06:13.710> and<00:06:13.889> then<00:06:14.370> this<00:06:14.699> bolt<00:06:15.120> actually<00:06:15.599> ended

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
fundin and then this bolt actually ended

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.320 
fundin and then this bolt actually ended
up<00:06:15.930> working<00:06:16.110> and<00:06:16.409> having<00:06:17.060> exceptionally<00:06:18.060> nice

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
up working and having exceptionally nice

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.820 
up working and having exceptionally nice
tolerances<00:06:18.990> than<00:06:19.500> what<00:06:19.650> we<00:06:19.740> were<00:06:19.800> expecting

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
tolerances than what we were expecting

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.939 
tolerances than what we were expecting
we're<00:06:20.550> expecting<00:06:20.970> some<00:06:21.770> compromise<00:06:22.770> with

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:22.949 
we're expecting some compromise with

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:30.710 
we're expecting some compromise with
that<00:06:23.159> yeah<00:06:24.060> it<00:06:24.629> it<00:06:25.879> noticeably<00:06:27.440> is<00:06:28.580> as<00:06:29.720> smooth

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
that yeah it it noticeably is as smooth

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.480 
that yeah it it noticeably is as smooth
as<00:06:31.310> the<00:06:32.310> precision<00:06:33.740> parts<00:06:34.740> that<00:06:35.099> it<00:06:35.220> came<00:06:35.460> with

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
as the precision parts that it came with

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.649 
as the precision parts that it came with
and<00:06:36.949> riding<00:06:37.949> it<00:06:38.069> would<00:06:38.430> be<00:06:38.580> difficult<00:06:38.849> to<00:06:39.210> tell

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:39.659 
and riding it would be difficult to tell

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:41.930 
and riding it would be difficult to tell
whether<00:06:40.050> or<00:06:40.169> not<00:06:40.379> it's<00:06:40.470> the<00:06:41.310> original<00:06:41.759> base

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
whether or not it's the original base

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.180 
whether or not it's the original base
plate<00:06:42.210> or<00:06:42.360> not<00:06:42.389> and<00:06:43.289> this<00:06:43.500> you<00:06:43.650> are<00:06:43.740> attuned<00:06:43.979> to

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
plate or not and this you are attuned to

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.700 
plate or not and this you are attuned to
the<00:06:44.310> to<00:06:44.729> the<00:06:44.849> angle<00:06:45.180> yeah<00:06:45.539> but<00:06:46.289> I<00:06:46.319> think<00:06:46.440> that

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
the to the angle yeah but I think that

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.339 
the to the angle yeah but I think that
the<00:06:46.919> angle<00:06:47.340> is<00:06:47.870> ridiculously<00:06:48.870> steep<00:06:49.229> on<00:06:49.440> the

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:51.349 
the angle is ridiculously steep on the

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:53.540 
the angle is ridiculously steep on the
manufactured<00:06:52.349> truck<00:06:52.620> and<00:06:52.770> I<00:06:52.830> think<00:06:53.039> this<00:06:53.219> 30

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
manufactured truck and I think this 30

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.249 
manufactured truck and I think this 30
especially<00:06:54.479> this<00:06:54.659> is<00:06:54.750> already<00:06:54.900> wedged<00:06:55.169> on

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:55.259 
especially this is already wedged on

00:06:55.259 --> 00:07:00.260 
especially this is already wedged on
five<00:06:55.469> more<00:06:55.650> degrees<00:06:55.889> 50s<00:06:56.310> a<00:06:56.460> lot<00:06:56.669> yeah<00:06:58.159> so<00:06:59.270> so

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270 
five more degrees 50s a lot yeah so so

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.610 
five more degrees 50s a lot yeah so so
we<00:07:00.360> got<00:07:00.509> a<00:07:00.539> really<00:07:00.810> really<00:07:01.379> good-looking

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 
we got a really really good-looking

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.390 
we got a really really good-looking
thing<00:07:02.099> here<00:07:02.430> and<00:07:02.639> I<00:07:03.360> think<00:07:03.780> once<00:07:03.990> it<00:07:04.139> gets

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
thing here and I think once it gets

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:12.080 
thing here and I think once it gets
coupled<00:07:05.690> to<00:07:07.460> the<00:07:08.460> same<00:07:08.849> bushing<00:07:09.629> on<00:07:09.930> an<00:07:11.090> other

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.090 
coupled to the same bushing on an other

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:17.029 
coupled to the same bushing on an other
planet<00:07:12.830> baseplate<00:07:13.860> and<00:07:14.479> hanger<00:07:15.770> we<00:07:16.770> will

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 
planet baseplate and hanger we will

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:23.290
