00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.469
 he played me program undertakes the 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.390
 because 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.390
 the system 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.279
 with the tanks are contained 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:13.589
 inside the area 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.730
 two respected fish capacete pointing 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.730
 they are laden 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.179
 the reason why 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.319
 or the fuel tanks 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:33.130
 in the rooms 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.130
 is to create 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.770
 by its very principle of sustentation 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.980
 the seaweed 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.150
 whoever comes forward 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.220
 upwards 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.990
 and otherwise yes 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.030
 I was extreme 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.810
 this additional weight 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.370
 in the wings 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.100
 definitely 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.100
 they would detach from the fuselage 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.610
 they would break 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.450
 other than that 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.530
 a system 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.970
 electric 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.310
 by the way through a pump 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.940
 expressly electric 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.690
 to be commissioned 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.810
 carrying the fuel 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.610
 from both countries 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.660
 if you are injured 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.740
 of a tank 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.740
 only 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.490
 can be carried to the selection both and extracted simultaneously 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.990
 gas 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.970
 this electric pump is only used 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.230
 at the time 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.140
 to start the engine 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.140
 that this one 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.400
 yes employ 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.950
 mechanical that activates alone 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.050
 what is it 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.100
 follow 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.230
 wearing 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.230
 the flow of fuel from weapons 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:13.719
 first to the carburetor and then the engine 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.659
 during 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.759
 this is also for safety 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:22.159
 if 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.769
 mechanical fail 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.289
 we have reservations 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:27.969
 electric 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:29.659
 Now let's see 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.289
 in the cabin 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:32.659
 the command 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.909
 activate the electric pump was only start the engine 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:39.159
 they light according to the procedures 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.169
 two cars with motor again take possession 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:45.319
 are activated or mechanical pumps automatically 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.829
 obviously 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.169
 they work with the system 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:54.049
 electrical of the blogosphere 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.219
 of the current two of terror 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:58.829
 and the battery 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.010
 this indicator that
