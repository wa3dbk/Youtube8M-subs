00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
ridiculous and also we are going to have

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.179 
ridiculous and also we are going to have
a<00:00:20.340> crab<00:00:21.090> come<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.779> his<00:00:22.439> abilities<00:00:22.920> will<00:00:23.070> be

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
a crab come in his abilities will be

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.730 
a crab come in his abilities will be
surge<00:00:23.840> renewing<00:00:24.840> mist<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.670> whirlpool<00:00:27.740> I

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
surge renewing mist and whirlpool I

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.939 
surge renewing mist and whirlpool I
think<00:00:29.609> most<00:00:29.849> crabs<00:00:30.269> there's<00:00:30.869> lock<00:00:31.109> traps<00:00:31.560> and

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
think most crabs there's lock traps and

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.090 
think most crabs there's lock traps and
they<00:00:32.040> all<00:00:32.130> have<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.399> same<00:00:32.550> abilities<00:00:33.290> so<00:00:34.290> mrs.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
they all have the same abilities so mrs.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.729 
they all have the same abilities so mrs.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
well which will hit me for a 480 so I

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.420 
well which will hit me for a 480 so I
have<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:25.310> thousand<00:01:25.940> damage<00:01:26.300> coming<00:01:26.540> at<00:01:26.780> me<00:01:26.930> so

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
deflection we just always keeping out

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.999 
deflection we just always keeping out
always<00:01:35.240> do<00:01:35.390> deflection<00:01:35.990> if<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.200> bro<00:01:36.470> or<00:01:36.500> dives

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
always do deflection if a bro or dives

sort of ability that take certain amount
of<00:01:44.930> time<00:01:45.140> it's<00:01:45.410> about<00:01:45.470> ready<00:01:45.860> to<00:01:45.890> go<00:01:46.130> off<00:01:46.310> an<00:01:46.490> 84

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
of time it's about ready to go off an 84

ton

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.130 

yeah<00:02:07.430> my<00:02:07.760> deflection<00:02:08.240> was<00:02:08.390> on<00:02:08.479> cooldown<00:02:08.720> soon

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
yeah my deflection was on cooldown soon

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.170 
yeah my deflection was on cooldown soon
can't<00:02:09.890> do<00:02:10.040> anything<00:02:10.250> about<00:02:10.399> that<00:02:10.520> pump<00:02:10.970> I

this<00:02:57.040> tidal<00:02:58.040> wave<00:02:58.280> ability<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:59.000> just

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
this tidal wave ability that just

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.760 
this tidal wave ability that just
doesn't<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.630> little<00:02:59.810> bit<00:02:59.930> damage<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.410> all<00:03:00.590> my

my<00:03:06.230> idol<00:03:06.590> has<00:03:06.770> almost<00:03:07.010> no<00:03:07.190> health<00:03:07.460> I<00:03:07.640> should<00:03:07.820> be

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
my idol has almost no health I should be

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.880 
my idol has almost no health I should be
able<00:03:08.030> keep<00:03:08.270> him<00:03:08.420> up<00:03:08.510> for<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:08.900> nice<00:03:09.200> chunk<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.620> the

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
able keep him up for a nice chunk of the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:58.010 
able keep him up for a nice chunk of the
round

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.260 

that<00:03:59.020> hurt<00:03:59.350> so<00:03:59.590> this<00:03:59.740> tidal<00:04:00.010> wave<00:04:00.400> probably

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
that hurt so this tidal wave probably

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.070 
that hurt so this tidal wave probably
off<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.540> idol<00:04:02.020> yep<00:04:02.230> there<00:04:02.440> he<00:04:02.470> goes<00:04:03.930> so<00:04:04.930> now

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
off the idol yep there he goes so now
