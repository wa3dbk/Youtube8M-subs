00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 i 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.879
 hello everyone I'm good wood and 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:20.110
 we are here in a new gameplay of the 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:22.060
 good call of duty I know that for days 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.689
 I do not upload videos 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.880
 it's normal I always say it's summer and 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.380
 good me too when you see youtubers 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.259
 that they did not upload videos in many days 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.550
 He said it would be difficult for them to make a video to 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:40.390
 day I do not know is it will be very difficult but now 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.010
 I have to do it, I know it is 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.339
 quite difficult to make a video a day 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.339
 why 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.750
 while meditating if such an afternoon egg 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.039
 after you get home you are tired not 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.690
 you want to start making videos 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.640
 What you least want to do is expose yourself to 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.530
 make videos and well I do them when 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.989
 right now I go out when I feel like 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.010
 it's a hobby this is not my obligation 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:05.810
 making videos does not force me to dad like 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.610
 when he forces me to study or I do it 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.470
 so nothing was here in a 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.290
 call of duty modern warfare 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.180
 3 in a duel for teams like me 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.880
 play because team duel for me 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.250
 is a less gameplay mode that 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.130
 there are so to speak because the others 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.049
 we have to do something and under 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.549
 confirmed to choose plates but the 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.979
 people are protecting them 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.780
 that is to camp in demolition the same in 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.909
 the domain the same here at least 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.439
 you have to kill you do not have any 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.929
 target plus kill it by killing and killing 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.330
 kill kill and well we are in 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.190
 resistance and just up the prestige 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.280
 19 with total I have nothing but neither 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.750
 stable aim or hard line or anything 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.990
 took the Oscar as always in my gun 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.509
 favorite or favorite is the one for more if 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.039
 the fames and good as you see is being 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.530
 a good start doing until low 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.020
 multiple multiple casualties and they were something 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.130
 maimed so to speak there were many 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.130
 many borders divided there 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.690
 and tell you that I have another game too 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.619
 similar to this one is not we ate result 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:14.010
 and everything killed the thousand people with the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.950
 weapon and with the helicopters that remained 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.670
 schubert and I'll upload it but it's the mission 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.280
 to tell you also what 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.660
 the raffle of the meeting as it has 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.280
 pointed enough people I'll leave you some 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.520
 more days 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.020
 because it means without people to do the 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.820
 draw 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.030
 and nothing left the days anymore so 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.470
 we worry about raising the raffle 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.090
 so there are the agents 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.640
 as you can see the game is being 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.150
 pretty fast I do not know how much I'll take 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.250
 but I've been around for a long time 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.630
 looking for fashion or anything because you see that 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.900
 I have gusts I stop pulling 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.610
 helicopters credit notes be I 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.130
 I calculate by teams, not how to look very 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.990
 little will make a good game there is a 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.990
 times I stayed close to take triple 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.510
 low and there are times that I stay close and 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.670
 well you think because he has so many 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.310
 helicopters because it has so many gusts 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.020
 and now I do not have time for the game and 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.900
 this case will be one of them and the other 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.590
 It will also be one of them because I think 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.870
 I 'm 18 with the closest weapon already 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.160
 I was on march 5 or 6 and with these 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.450
 they were doing something wrong I think the 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.640
 I could have taken it out but hey 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.440
 and nothing happens 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.870
 You see that the game is going to end 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.550
 being very fast just three minutes and 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.190
 good reward for doing with the 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.170
 starting I get the last low so 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.230
 nothing chicks give life favorites 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.840
 subscribe for this game and we will 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.450
 see the last low that a gun that I 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.879
 never use 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.319
 and there is dust in the middle under a madness 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:52.849
 so nothing kids I think I did 30 and 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:55.690
 30 a good game 7 30 and 30 until the 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.690
 next kids
