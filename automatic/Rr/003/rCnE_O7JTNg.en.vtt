00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
everything so I'm really trying to make

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
it a little bit more streamlined and hey

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.759 
it a little bit more streamlined and hey
I<00:02:27.940> like<00:02:28.209> to<00:02:28.330> get<00:02:28.450> up<00:02:28.570> there<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:28.870> mash<00:02:29.110> I'm

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
I like to get up there and mash I'm

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.680 
I like to get up there and mash I'm
swinging<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.400> missing<00:02:30.430> but<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.330> timing

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
swinging and missing but the timing

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.509 
swinging and missing but the timing
feels<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.050> same<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:33.010> hole<00:02:33.220> hitting

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
feels the same the the hole hitting

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:34.830 
feels the same the the hole hitting
interface<00:02:33.910> feels<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.269> same<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:34.630> I<00:02:34.660> actually

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
interface feels the same so I actually

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.870 
interface feels the same so I actually
feel<00:02:35.140> pretty<00:02:35.170> comfortable<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:36.519> I'm<00:02:36.640> trying

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880
