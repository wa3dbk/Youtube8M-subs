particular<00:00:30.660> system<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:31.019> i<00:00:31.140> designed<00:00:31.439> today

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
particular system that i designed today

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.700 
particular system that i designed today
is<00:00:32.040> basically<00:00:32.520> an<00:00:32.640> AMD<00:00:33.059> design<00:00:33.690> system<00:00:34.200> it's

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
is basically an AMD design system it's

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.470 
is basically an AMD design system it's
geared<00:00:35.070> totally<00:00:35.460> for<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.640> gamer<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.149> it's

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
geared totally for the gamer and it's

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.740 
geared totally for the gamer and it's
geared<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.050> be<00:00:37.170> totally<00:00:37.500> upgradable<00:00:38.489> as<00:00:38.750> well

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
geared to be totally upgradable as well

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.049 
geared to be totally upgradable as well
so<00:00:40.590> that's<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.160> let's<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:41.489> jump<00:00:41.700> right<00:00:41.760> into
