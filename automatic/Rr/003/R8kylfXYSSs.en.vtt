doing<00:02:25.820> with<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:25.970> guy<00:02:26.210> because<00:02:26.480> he's<00:02:26.900> mixing

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
doing with that guy because he's mixing

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.980 
doing with that guy because he's mixing
it<00:02:27.470> up<00:02:27.530> he's<00:02:27.710> not<00:02:27.740> only<00:02:28.100> shooting<00:02:28.490> but<00:02:28.700> he's<00:02:28.850> a

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
it up he's not only shooting but he's a

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.400 
it up he's not only shooting but he's a
you<00:02:29.990> know<00:02:30.020> hop<00:02:30.710> step<00:02:30.980> doing<00:02:31.250> spinning<00:02:31.850> and

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
you know hop step doing spinning and

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.380 
you know hop step doing spinning and
generally<00:02:33.430> not<00:02:34.430> rushing<00:02:34.820> his<00:02:34.940> shot<00:02:35.180> which

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
generally not rushing his shot which

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.790 
generally not rushing his shot which
just<00:02:35.630> makes<00:02:35.900> shot-blocking<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.650> little

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
just makes shot-blocking a little

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.240 
just makes shot-blocking a little
difficult<00:02:37.190> but<00:02:37.430> here<00:02:37.820> I<00:02:37.850> throw<00:02:38.120> down<00:02:38.270> the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
difficult but here I throw down the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.300 
difficult but here I throw down the
probably<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.460> hottest<00:02:42.190> animation<00:02:43.190> you'll

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
probably the hottest animation you'll

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.230 
probably the hottest animation you'll
ever<00:02:43.460> see<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.790> 7<00:02:44.150> 45<00:02:44.450> min<00:02:44.690> uh<00:02:45.040> senator<00:02:46.040> do<00:02:46.460> in

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
ever see a 7 45 min uh senator do in

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.990 
ever see a 7 45 min uh senator do in
terms<00:02:47.450> of<00:02:47.570> taking<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.930> shot<00:02:48.140> but<00:02:48.560> I<00:02:48.980> think<00:02:49.820> I<00:02:49.880> get

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
terms of taking a shot but I think I get

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.280 
terms of taking a shot but I think I get
a<00:02:50.030> little<00:02:50.210> lucky<00:02:50.450> here<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:50.780> thought<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:50.990> was<00:02:51.050> beat

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
a little lucky here I thought I was beat

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.530 
a little lucky here I thought I was beat
by<00:02:51.320> that<00:02:51.610> computer<00:02:52.610> control<00:02:52.880> point<00:02:53.090> guard<00:02:53.330> and

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
by that computer control point guard and

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.740 
by that computer control point guard and
sure<00:02:54.350> enough<00:02:54.380> I<00:02:54.650> wasn't<00:02:55.040> but<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.450> still<00:02:56.450> gave<00:02:56.600> up

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
sure enough I wasn't but I still gave up

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.640 
sure enough I wasn't but I still gave up
the<00:02:56.840> ball<00:02:57.050> and<00:02:57.590> made<00:02:57.980> it<00:02:58.100> up<00:02:58.190> scoring<00:02:58.490> on<00:02:58.820> the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
the ball and made it up scoring on the

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.420 
the ball and made it up scoring on the
rebound<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:01.010> put<00:03:01.520> back<00:03:01.990> so<00:03:03.130> now<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:04.190> can't<00:03:04.370> be

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
rebound and put back so now it can't be

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.830 
rebound and put back so now it can't be
perfect<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:04.970> I<00:03:05.590> really<00:03:06.670> was<00:03:07.670> surprised<00:03:08.420> by

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
perfect and I really was surprised by

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.390 
perfect and I really was surprised by

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
altogether which I don't think we'll be

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.640 
altogether which I don't think we'll be
doing<00:06:14.070> we<00:06:14.669> would<00:06:14.850> look<00:06:15.300> into<00:06:15.539> that<00:06:15.750> we're<00:06:16.470> just

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
doing we would look into that we're just

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.159 
doing we would look into that we're just
really<00:06:16.770> here<00:06:17.010> to<00:06:17.039> see<00:06:17.220> what<00:06:17.310> people<00:06:18.050> want<00:06:19.050> to

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
really here to see what people want to

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:22.010 
really here to see what people want to
see<00:06:19.650> us<00:06:19.770> play<00:06:20.010> and<00:06:20.310> you<00:06:20.669> know<00:06:20.760> this<00:06:21.720> is<00:06:21.750> one<00:06:21.990> of

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
see us play and you know this is one of

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.080 
see us play and you know this is one of
the<00:06:22.169> more<00:06:22.800> interesting<00:06:23.010> plays<00:06:23.400> in<00:06:23.550> the<00:06:23.610> game<00:06:23.639> I

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
the more interesting plays in the game I

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.310 
the more interesting plays in the game I
thought<00:06:24.270> we<00:06:24.360> had<00:06:24.450> some<00:06:24.570> great<00:06:24.660> ball<00:06:24.930> moving<00:06:25.139> it

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
thought we had some great ball moving it

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.770 
thought we had some great ball moving it
and<00:06:25.470> did<00:06:26.190> not<00:06:26.370> see<00:06:26.729> this<00:06:26.940> alley-oop<00:06:27.450> coming

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
and did not see this alley-oop coming

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.000 
and did not see this alley-oop coming
I'm<00:06:27.870> not<00:06:27.990> sure<00:06:28.110> if<00:06:28.169> that<00:06:28.200> was<00:06:28.380> accidental<00:06:28.919> or

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
I'm not sure if that was accidental or

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.159 
I'm not sure if that was accidental or
what<00:06:29.250> but<00:06:29.840> definitely<00:06:30.840> caught<00:06:30.930> me<00:06:31.050> off<00:06:31.139> guard

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
what but definitely caught me off guard

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:32.750 
what but definitely caught me off guard
because<00:06:31.440> he<00:06:31.590> hadn't<00:06:31.770> thrown<00:06:31.889> any<00:06:32.099> oops<00:06:32.430> and<00:06:32.700> it

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
because he hadn't thrown any oops and it

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.290 
because he hadn't thrown any oops and it
was<00:06:32.880> a<00:06:33.200> pretty<00:06:34.200> fancy<00:06:34.410> if<00:06:34.710> you<00:06:34.800> ask<00:06:35.010> me

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
was a pretty fancy if you ask me

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.360 
was a pretty fancy if you ask me
and<00:06:36.780> that<00:06:37.169> once<00:06:37.319> I<00:06:37.409> said<00:06:37.560> once<00:06:37.770> again<00:06:37.830> that's

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
and that once I said once again that's

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.490 
and that once I said once again that's
one<00:06:38.550> of<00:06:38.639> the<00:06:38.870> defensive<00:06:39.870> plays<00:06:40.050> I<00:06:40.259> didn't<00:06:40.440> see

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
one of the defensive plays I didn't see

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.629 
one of the defensive plays I didn't see
that<00:06:40.530> one<00:06:40.680> coming<00:06:40.949> at<00:06:41.039> all<00:06:41.099> and<00:06:41.340> I<00:06:41.370> don't<00:06:41.490> think

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
that one coming at all and I don't think

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.850 
that one coming at all and I don't think
they<00:06:41.759> did<00:06:41.819> either<00:06:42.289> just<00:06:43.289> the<00:06:43.500> team's<00:06:43.680> getting

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
they did either just the team's getting

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.499 
they did either just the team's getting
completely<00:06:44.220> involved<00:06:44.550> which<00:06:44.759> is<00:06:44.879> nice<00:06:45.060> to<00:06:45.270> see

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:47.509 
completely involved which is nice to see
