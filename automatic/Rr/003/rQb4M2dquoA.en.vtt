00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.500
 hi everyone that's wrong that 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.389
 I hope you're fine with me 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.150
 super we find ourselves today for 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.160
 a very special new video since 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.590
 I was talking to you about a very predictable 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.350
 future fat maj sure sure the heater 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.170
 clan so how do I leave had or in 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.869
 anyway how do I predict it is 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.660
 very simple so it's a post 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.930
 that I read on the forum clash of cool 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.360
 in France so who said that there 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.020
 would have a meeting that would take place 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.270
 so September 1st in the night so 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.280
 French time 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.710
 so that would bring together the players that the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.180
 plan warmer so very big youtuber 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.559
 anglophones to the developers of the game but 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.010
 you must know that the last meeting 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.559
 that happened it was ago 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.250
 now over a year and so it takes 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.050
 also know that these meetings 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.360
 announces big changes in the game 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.200
 so as they put it in the post 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.870
 you can see that there was 1 for 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.470
 the arrival of the heroes so who was when 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.090
 even a big change of stakes 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.750
 also for the arrival of the game under 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.700
 android 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.830
 so you can see that these are from 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.010
 big changes and so we can 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.770
 also expect to teeth in me I 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.710
 would say to a big maj sure that the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.300
 bald clan of I inquired a 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.440
 little more and there was 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:42.570
 also one for the arrival of the leagues 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:45.330
 so crystal master champions 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.280
 gold money and so on 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.160
 so you still see that these are 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.590
 big points of the game he also notes 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.890
 that for the arrival of the wars of 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.680
 clans 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.000
 there was none at that time 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.500
 it was still a pretty big 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.360
 change is that it brought when 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.420
 even much more in the game so we 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.820
 can really expect a big thing 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.210
 so on arrival in really big 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.550
 thing 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.280
 so that's why I imagine very 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.540
 well me 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.410
 in hd the eleven which should arrive in 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:21.160
 in no I would say so here is 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.240
 so I also say the arrival of a 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.910
 young I am ashamed 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.980
 we can see that all buildings 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.410
 current are at most 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.430
 so there was very recently the age of 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.820
 facts no excuse me the level tesla 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.140
 8 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.450
 so that's it now all 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.760
 buildings are at maximum so that's 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.520
 for that now he misses a 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.280
 new age of v1 new a new 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.710
 age level of the v's to bring 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.690
 new buildings also 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.910
 new black troops because he 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.950
 must know that we still do not have 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.750
 still does not develop two tents 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.190
 black for the age of v10 also so 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.860
 that's why we must have 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.870
 surely the arrival of two new 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.360
 slices of new buildings and 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.690
 maybe a new one from a new age 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.030
 so that was really cool 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.070
 really rage or lengthen the duration 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.660
 of the game 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.490
 so here I wanted to tell you a little 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.700
 little world my point of view on all that 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.220
 so here I show you already images 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.020
 city ​​halls that were created by 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.620
 fans so that's already several 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.360
 months they were created 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.530
 you have to know that of course these are only 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:41.070
 not it's not the light and what 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.860
 even if lyon even if in one that comes out 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.850
 surely will not be this one but you 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.790
 can see that the theme of 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:51.280
 electricity for a to hdv culture 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.140
 He returns quite frequently 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.180
 so I think they were inspired by 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:01.450
 that since the walls hdv 11 are are 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.280
 electrified so they are a 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.200
 little bit of it since for the jv 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.450
 say the walls hd the ten are on fire 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.670
 so here I dedicate it was with fire 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.760
 so I think they did this 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:17.250
 link there so here is so you can see 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:20.109
 taming ideas in city ​​hall 11 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.990
 so here it is with this city hall 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.450
 There may be new buildings 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.660
 new troops especially a new 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.870
 black hole as I told you so 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.290
 here at stake I think there could be 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.919
 to have 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:40.150
 who can see them all so we're going 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:45.070
 wait for the only meeting impatiently 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:48.940
 so some pictures are going to go maybe 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.960
 go out as usual for each 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.030
 new update 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.790
 so we'll see a little bit about what 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.790
 follows after this meeting 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.440
 and then I 'll maybe do a video if 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.810
 I never have other information 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.430
 in any case if this kind of videos you 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.060
 please do not hesitate to leave a 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.340

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.710
 liked the video and then to subscribe to 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.140
 the chain so here we are going to leave there 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.880

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.140
