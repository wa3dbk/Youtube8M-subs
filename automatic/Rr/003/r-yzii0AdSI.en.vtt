organic<00:00:02.710> really<00:00:03.010> means<00:00:03.219> sustainable<00:00:04.060> it

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:04.210 
organic really means sustainable it

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.730 
organic really means sustainable it
usually<00:00:04.600> goes<00:00:04.720> hand<00:00:04.779> in<00:00:05.080> hand<00:00:05.140> with<00:00:05.319> that<00:00:05.560> so

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:05.740 
usually goes hand in hand with that so

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.580 
usually goes hand in hand with that so
not<00:00:05.920> only<00:00:06.069> are<00:00:06.490> we<00:00:06.879> growing<00:00:07.509> using<00:00:08.440> less

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
not only are we growing using less

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.580 
not only are we growing using less
chemicals<00:00:09.100> but<00:00:09.309> we're<00:00:09.459> also<00:00:09.610> trying<00:00:09.969> to<00:00:10.590> make

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
chemicals but we're also trying to make

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.820 
chemicals but we're also trying to make
this<00:00:11.830> land<00:00:12.270> be<00:00:13.270> better<00:00:13.570> into<00:00:14.139> the<00:00:14.170> future<00:00:14.440> so

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
this land be better into the future so

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.420 
this land be better into the future so
as<00:00:15.390> we<00:00:16.390> go<00:00:16.660> as<00:00:16.869> we<00:00:17.170> grow<00:00:17.380> into<00:00:17.650> the<00:00:17.770> future<00:00:17.980> this

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
as we go as we grow into the future this

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.940 
as we go as we grow into the future this
soil<00:00:18.700> is<00:00:19.150> getting<00:00:19.750> better<00:00:19.990> and<00:00:20.230> not<00:00:20.380> being

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
soil is getting better and not being

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.440 
soil is getting better and not being
depleted<00:00:21.310> by<00:00:21.640> the<00:00:21.700> things<00:00:22.180> that<00:00:22.330> we're

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
depleted by the things that we're

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.670 
depleted by the things that we're
putting<00:00:22.600> into<00:00:22.810> it's<00:00:23.080> actually<00:00:23.440> getting

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
putting into it's actually getting

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.200 
putting into it's actually getting
better<00:00:23.980> because<00:00:24.250> of<00:00:24.370> what<00:00:24.610> we're<00:00:24.760> adding<00:00:25.030> to

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
better because of what we're adding to

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.120 
better because of what we're adding to
it<00:00:25.330> so<00:00:25.930> that's<00:00:26.140> kind<00:00:26.350> of<00:00:26.380> like<00:00:26.530> the<00:00:26.680> main<00:00:26.860> goal

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
it so that's kind of like the main goal

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.730 
it so that's kind of like the main goal
of<00:00:27.160> organics<00:00:27.789> i<00:00:27.910> think<00:00:28.119> is<00:00:28.270> to<00:00:28.480> build<00:00:29.140> our<00:00:29.380> soil

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
of organics i think is to build our soil

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.069 
of organics i think is to build our soil
and<00:00:30.280> grow<00:00:30.550> the<00:00:30.760> soil<00:00:31.060> and<00:00:31.390> so<00:00:31.630> our<00:00:31.750> plans<00:00:31.990> will

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
and grow the soil and so our plans will

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.640 
and grow the soil and so our plans will
be<00:00:32.169> healthy<00:00:32.670> we<00:00:33.670> also<00:00:33.820> have<00:00:34.150> two<00:00:34.650> aquaponic

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
be healthy we also have two aquaponic

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.360 
be healthy we also have two aquaponic
greenhouses<00:00:36.040> which<00:00:36.460> is<00:00:36.989> growing<00:00:38.220> plants<00:00:39.220> with

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
greenhouses which is growing plants with

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.930 
greenhouses which is growing plants with
fish<00:00:39.610> and<00:00:40.030> in<00:00:40.570> those<00:00:41.130> locations<00:00:42.130> were<00:00:42.640> able<00:00:42.880> to

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
fish and in those locations were able to

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.370 
fish and in those locations were able to
grow<00:00:43.120> things<00:00:43.329> that<00:00:43.600> we<00:00:43.690> wouldn't<00:00:43.960> be<00:00:44.050> able<00:00:44.200> to

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
grow things that we wouldn't be able to

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.930 
grow things that we wouldn't be able to
grow<00:00:44.530> out<00:00:44.710> in<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:44.800> field<00:00:45.040> this<00:00:45.340> is<00:00:45.399> a<00:00:45.579> raft

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
grow out in the field this is a raft

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.870 
grow out in the field this is a raft
system<00:00:46.239> so<00:00:46.840> what<00:00:47.680> happens<00:00:48.040> is<00:00:48.160> our<00:00:48.340> fish<00:00:48.610> water

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
system so what happens is our fish water

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.630 
system so what happens is our fish water
gets<00:00:49.149> pumped<00:00:49.540> up<00:00:49.710> into<00:00:50.710> this<00:00:50.860> section<00:00:51.370> this<00:00:51.579> is

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
gets pumped up into this section this is

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.510 
gets pumped up into this section this is
a<00:00:51.760> filter<00:00:52.090> that<00:00:52.390> flows<00:00:52.840> into<00:00:52.870> here<00:00:53.590> and<00:00:54.399> then

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
a filter that flows into here and then

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.250 
a filter that flows into here and then
these<00:00:54.700> are<00:00:54.880> all<00:00:55.030> rafts

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.460 

and<00:01:00.399> we're<00:01:01.399> going<00:01:01.700> things<00:01:01.970> like<00:01:02.210> lettuce

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
and we're going things like lettuce

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.149 
and we're going things like lettuce
onions<00:01:03.729> watercress<00:01:04.750> some<00:01:05.750> kale<00:01:06.200> lots<00:01:07.040> of

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
onions watercress some kale lots of

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.740 
onions watercress some kale lots of
basil<00:01:07.550> going<00:01:07.790> on<00:01:07.940> right<00:01:08.150> now<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:08.570> some

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
basil going on right now and some

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.510 
basil going on right now and some
cucumbers<00:01:09.290> too<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:09.740> we're<00:01:09.860> going<00:01:09.950> lots<00:01:10.340> of

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
cucumbers too so we're going lots of

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.250 
cucumbers too so we're going lots of
different<00:01:10.790> stuff<00:01:10.940> in<00:01:11.150> a<00:01:11.330> pretty<00:01:11.630> small<00:01:11.900> space

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
different stuff in a pretty small space

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.320 
different stuff in a pretty small space
and<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.710> reason<00:01:12.890> why<00:01:13.130> we<00:01:13.310> really<00:01:13.610> love<00:01:13.820> this

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
and the reason why we really love this

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.030 
and the reason why we really love this
system<00:01:14.840> is<00:01:15.050> because<00:01:15.440> it<00:01:15.590> really<00:01:15.770> takes

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
system is because it really takes

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.240 
system is because it really takes
advantage<00:01:16.550> of<00:01:16.759> our<00:01:17.570> situation<00:01:18.410> here<00:01:18.650> in<00:01:18.950> Las

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
advantage of our situation here in Las

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.400 
advantage of our situation here in Las
there's<00:01:19.550> a<00:01:19.640> lot<00:01:19.850> of<00:01:19.880> Sun<00:01:20.240> and<00:01:20.630> not<00:01:21.140> a<00:01:21.170> lot<00:01:21.380> of

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
there's a lot of Sun and not a lot of

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:29.170 
there's a lot of Sun and not a lot of
water<00:01:21.710> I<00:01:27.009> just<00:01:28.009> think<00:01:28.159> it's<00:01:28.369> really<00:01:28.580> important

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
water I just think it's really important

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.900 
water I just think it's really important
for<00:01:29.500> community<00:01:30.500> involvement<00:01:30.950> in<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.729> food

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
for community involvement in the food

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.600 
for community involvement in the food
system<00:01:32.119> I<00:01:32.539> mean<00:01:32.800> everybody<00:01:33.800> who<00:01:34.100> volunteers

system I mean everybody who volunteers
here<00:01:34.910> all<00:01:35.149> of<00:01:35.180> our<00:01:35.390> interns<00:01:35.869> like<00:01:36.619> they<00:01:36.800> know

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
here all of our interns like they know

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.630 
here all of our interns like they know
how<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:37.550> spoons<00:01:38.119> being<00:01:38.390> grown<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:39.430> they<00:01:40.430> are

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
how the spoons being grown and they are

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.490 
how the spoons being grown and they are
able<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:41.210> buy<00:01:41.390> it<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.780> benefit<00:01:42.170> from<00:01:42.200> it

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
able to buy it and benefit from it

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.600 
able to buy it and benefit from it
little<00:01:42.740> selves<00:01:43.100> so<00:01:44.380> we<00:01:45.380> hope<00:01:45.740> that<00:01:45.770> our<00:01:46.130> farm

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
little selves so we hope that our farm

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.760 
little selves so we hope that our farm
is<00:01:46.729> not<00:01:46.910> only<00:01:47.060> growing<00:01:47.869> healthy<00:01:48.320> food<00:01:48.530> for

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
is not only growing healthy food for

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.580 
is not only growing healthy food for
people<00:01:48.890> but<00:01:49.130> also<00:01:49.660> enabling<00:01:50.660> more<00:01:51.140> people<00:01:51.530> to

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
people but also enabling more people to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.770 
people but also enabling more people to
do<00:01:51.740> just<00:01:52.009> that<00:01:52.190> so<00:01:52.640> it's<00:01:53.210> something<00:01:53.630> that

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
do just that so it's something that

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.440 
do just that so it's something that
people<00:01:53.810> can<00:01:54.200> gather<00:01:54.890> around<00:01:55.220> and<00:01:55.880> have

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
people can gather around and have

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.060 
people can gather around and have
something<00:01:56.750> in<00:01:56.869> common<00:01:56.899> and<00:01:57.500> spend<00:01:57.890> outdoors

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
something in common and spend outdoors

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.660 
something in common and spend outdoors
and<00:01:58.789> then<00:01:59.649> come<00:02:00.649> to<00:02:00.800> learn<00:02:00.920> about<00:02:01.160> organic

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
and then come to learn about organic

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.059 
and then come to learn about organic
agriculture<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:03.080> reasons<00:02:03.500> why<00:02:03.679> we<00:02:03.920> need

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
agriculture and the reasons why we need

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.130 
agriculture and the reasons why we need
it<00:02:04.190> not<00:02:04.369> only<00:02:04.490> here<00:02:04.940> but<00:02:04.970> all<00:02:05.810> over<00:02:05.869> the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
it not only here but all over the
