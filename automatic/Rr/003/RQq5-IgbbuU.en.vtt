we're<00:00:13.010> here<00:00:13.130> with<00:00:13.250> a<00:00:13.280> little<00:00:14.110> addendum<00:00:15.110> to<00:00:15.620> the

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:15.799 
we're here with a little addendum to the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.690 
we're here with a little addendum to the
Presonus<00:00:17.260> StudioLive<00:00:18.260> review<00:00:18.950> we<00:00:19.130> looked<00:00:19.550> at

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
Presonus StudioLive review we looked at

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.790 
Presonus StudioLive review we looked at
the<00:00:19.869> software<00:00:20.869> that<00:00:20.990> comes<00:00:21.110> with<00:00:21.259> it<00:00:21.560> there's

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
the software that comes with it there's

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.679 
the software that comes with it there's
a<00:00:21.890> couple<00:00:21.920> of<00:00:22.220> things<00:00:22.430> about<00:00:22.610> connecting<00:00:23.540> to

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
a couple of things about connecting to

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.249 
a couple of things about connecting to
the<00:00:23.779> board<00:00:24.020> that<00:00:24.230> need<00:00:24.830> to<00:00:24.920> be<00:00:24.980> aware<00:00:25.279> of<00:00:26.259> first

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
the board that need to be aware of first

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.490 
the board that need to be aware of first
off<00:00:27.410> it's<00:00:27.590> firewire<00:00:27.980> but<00:00:28.250> keep<00:00:28.640> in<00:00:28.759> mind<00:00:29.500> there

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
off it's firewire but keep in mind there

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.910 
off it's firewire but keep in mind there
are<00:00:30.529> two<00:00:30.800> flavors<00:00:31.070> of<00:00:31.430> firewire<00:00:31.880> this<00:00:32.149> is

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
are two flavors of firewire this is

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.319 
are two flavors of firewire this is
firewire<00:00:33.920> 400<00:00:34.309> which<00:00:34.760> is<00:00:34.910> kind<00:00:35.120> of<00:00:35.210> the

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
firewire 400 which is kind of the

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.310 
firewire 400 which is kind of the
quote-unquote<00:00:36.320> original<00:00:37.010> firewire<00:00:37.550> and

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
quote-unquote original firewire and

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.080 
quote-unquote original firewire and
that's<00:00:39.320> what<00:00:40.329> the<00:00:41.329> Presonus<00:00:41.780> takes<00:00:42.760> now<00:00:43.760> if

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
that's what the Presonus takes now if

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.880 
that's what the Presonus takes now if
you've<00:00:44.300> got<00:00:44.540> a<00:00:45.580> fairly<00:00:46.580> recent<00:00:47.890> computer

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
you've got a fairly recent computer

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.840 
you've got a fairly recent computer
especially<00:00:49.130> on<00:00:49.520> the<00:00:49.610> Mac<00:00:49.790> side<00:00:50.200> and<00:00:51.200> this<00:00:51.320> is<00:00:51.440> a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
especially on the Mac side and this is a

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.450 
especially on the Mac side and this is a
probably<00:00:52.850> two<00:00:53.120> year<00:00:53.390> old<00:00:53.600> MacBook<00:00:54.230> Pro<00:00:54.530> it

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
probably two year old MacBook Pro it

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.750 
probably two year old MacBook Pro it
does<00:00:55.790> not<00:00:56.030> have<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.980> same<00:00:58.220> connection<00:00:58.670> that

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
does not have the same connection that

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.680 
does not have the same connection that
is<00:00:58.910> firewire<00:00:59.360> 800<00:00:59.690> on<00:01:00.400> some<00:01:01.400> of<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:02.210> MacBooks

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
is firewire 800 on some of the MacBooks

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.020 
is firewire 800 on some of the MacBooks
MacBook<00:01:03.470> Pros<00:01:03.710> up<00:01:03.890> until<00:01:04.159> about<00:01:04.460> a<00:01:04.640> year<00:01:04.729> ago

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
MacBook Pros up until about a year ago

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.450 
MacBook Pros up until about a year ago
maybe<00:01:05.299> two<00:01:05.540> years<00:01:05.750> ago<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.259> had<00:01:06.680> both<00:01:06.890> firewire

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
maybe two years ago it had both firewire

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.789 
maybe two years ago it had both firewire
400<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:08.240> firewire<00:01:08.720> 800<00:01:09.020> that<00:01:09.320> is<00:01:09.380> no<00:01:09.619> longer

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
400 and firewire 800 that is no longer

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.190 
400 and firewire 800 that is no longer
the<00:01:10.009> case<00:01:10.040> so<00:01:10.970> you<00:01:11.420> need<00:01:11.570> to<00:01:11.689> make<00:01:11.810> sure<00:01:12.020> that

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
the case so you need to make sure that

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.830 
the case so you need to make sure that
you<00:01:12.320> either<00:01:12.470> have<00:01:12.829> an<00:01:12.920> adapter<00:01:13.399> to<00:01:13.579> go<00:01:14.510> from

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
you either have an adapter to go from

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.219 
you either have an adapter to go from
firewire<00:01:15.740> 400<00:01:16.430> to<00:01:16.760> 800<00:01:16.909> or<00:01:17.420> what<00:01:17.900> I've<00:01:17.990> done<00:01:18.170> is

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
firewire 400 to 800 or what I've done is

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.780 
firewire 400 to 800 or what I've done is
I've<00:01:18.320> just<00:01:18.350> bought<00:01:18.590> a<00:01:18.620> cable<00:01:19.070> that<00:01:19.610> has<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:21.790> 400

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
I've just bought a cable that has a 400

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.660 
I've just bought a cable that has a 400
connector<00:01:23.120> on<00:01:23.210> one<00:01:23.270> end<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:23.870> a<00:01:24.350> 800<00:01:25.310> on<00:01:25.460> the

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
connector on one end and a 800 on the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.810 
connector on one end and a 800 on the
other<00:01:25.790> end<00:01:26.000> okay<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:26.810> now<00:01:27.740> let's<00:01:28.010> check<00:01:28.250> when

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
other end okay so now let's check when

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.300 
other end okay so now let's check when
we<00:01:28.909> hook<00:01:29.690> this<00:01:29.810> thing<00:01:29.870> up<00:01:30.170> that<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:30.979> little<00:01:31.220> bit

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
we hook this thing up that a little bit

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.860 
we hook this thing up that a little bit
of<00:01:31.370> a<00:01:31.430> problem<00:01:31.610> getting<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:32.030> talked<00:01:32.330> getting

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
of a problem getting it talked getting

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.120 
of a problem getting it talked getting
the<00:01:32.960> two<00:01:33.080> things<00:01:33.320> talk<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:33.740> each<00:01:33.799> other<00:01:33.979> and

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
the two things talk to each other and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.039 
the two things talk to each other and
ended<00:01:34.340> up<00:01:34.400> being<00:01:34.549> something<00:01:34.760> really<00:01:35.240> minor

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
ended up being something really minor

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.410 
ended up being something really minor
and<00:01:36.500> Presonus<00:01:37.370> was<00:01:37.460> really<00:01:37.760> helpful<00:01:38.060> in

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
and Presonus was really helpful in

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.890 
and Presonus was really helpful in
getting<00:01:38.900> us<00:01:39.170> on<00:01:39.440> track<00:01:40.280> okay<00:01:41.119> so<00:01:41.299> once<00:01:41.810> again
