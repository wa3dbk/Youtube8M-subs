00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:10.760
 hello to all and all these short 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.969
 ci videos and games show you a 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.060
 club abuse then cha the diop 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:21.830
 finally I try a little bit of mamic lay up 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.630
 m - at least 200 days away is at least 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.750
 of 100 with who blows the crowd idea 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.230
 damage push but and that's just 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.300
 big rape actually so I think that's 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.550
 may be interesting I could not get it 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.400
 start of the fight but it can still 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.710
 to be interesting because cups me 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.980
 I was playing I rarely saw that 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:49.940
 it's completely smoke wait 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:53.030
 look look at this shot i found my 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.030
 overpowered with two pairs then that 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.140
 I do not find it normal 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:03.890
 see for me I just damage on 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.080
 important but from there to type 300 with 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.870
 2 p to 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.660
 it's really abused 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:16.070
 finally there are no other words that's 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:18.950
 abused or killed minus 300 in addition that does not 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.909
 not take into account the end resistances 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.190
 bright food and recent push migrants 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.820
 so I think it really exaggerated I 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.900
 find it really abused I hope that 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.210
 camargue 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.860
 we react to this problem because 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.360
 I did not realize because I was playing 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:42.530
 more than 3 ocz in recent times 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:47.240
 picked up quite actively but there the iop 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:50.540
 but that's the big fat of 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.290
 mouth I do not know who takes care of 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.200
 balancing 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:02:05.540
 in any case I can tell you that this 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:08.750
 dude gonna do anything nothing finally look 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:12.500
 we will wait for the hub turn and we will 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:16.580
 directly or even the abuse since he 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:20.510
 only I'm sure can kill at least if he 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.810
 was one against us three suri would kill 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.820
 at least two people 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.160
 in addition we have the others and the 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.740
 fight is not at all balanced but 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.250
 good here it is I have a year I can not 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.250
 come back on it 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:46.240
 but here and in addition to the fir diop 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:51.030
 who is precisely playing with her 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:54.910
 is how to say taking advantage of an abuse 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:03:00.240
 fighting Thursday lost to me we're going 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:04.480
 see how he's going to type llop here 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.980
 be careful the tenths only here 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.980
 I lost 2,300 pv 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:18.630
 322 and again it is time to 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:21.790
 to do good and he raises me of millet that's well 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.300
 Once there, what is fusion? 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.950

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.950
