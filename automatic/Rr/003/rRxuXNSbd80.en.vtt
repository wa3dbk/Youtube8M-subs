00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.469
 my name is nicolas lapointe I am 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.860
 University of Ottawa 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.560
 we want and I have you cynical 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.390
 in post in France as pointillism 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.640
 it's point by point 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.500
 so we use the stables in your 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.720
 bed but regular the machines of 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.290
 tattoo but must go further 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.830
 sometimes 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.380
 so to make a line it takes a 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.820
 hundred and more lead why of 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.700
 bison also want to bling bling to 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.080
 present we talk about thousands of points 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.380
 go to all this is a question 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.520
 of steel to also report a way 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.180
 more traditional to make 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.390
 tattoos before creating the engine 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.070
 for the tattoo it was handmade so 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.079
 people often ask if I am 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.000
 less painful it depends on the 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.510
 personality but in my opinion it's more 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.040
 peaceful almost the morning impression 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.400
 it's really a question of control 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.140
 dexterity to go into the studio that 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.690
 becomes a certain moment we are 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.950
 really in just a long time 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:16.040
 becomes something of almost 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.240
 meditative oppression machine cisse 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.820
 it's an experience completely 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.230
 different streams enough it hurts less 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.810
 do not worry about people who already have a 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:31.040
 very specific idea what he wants 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.540
 design care or a preconceived idea of 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.630
 what he wants to be there 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.140
 accompanied with water piano symbolism 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.300
 who he comes in and then he finds it just so 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.979
 the immediate they come to see dollars and 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:48.530
 then suddenly he gets tattooed 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:52.009
 often we start in childhood at 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.860
 disney you brown the steak and co which 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.990
 as a link between these two blocks are 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.270
 sometimes a little grotesque and then this 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.880
 tattoo form also say the a 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.040
 some grotesque way it's a form 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.570
 of art so often people say 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.090
 why tattooing in a gallery 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.830
 but we miss everything here 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.250
 performance field 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.900
 of all the steak and poke it's getting 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.060
 more and more popular it becomes 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.140
 more and more acceptable then we 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.790
 search all the time young people a 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.990
 change of new ways not of 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.990
 everything at the most extreme
