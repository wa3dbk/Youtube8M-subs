00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
you you know this is the cheapest option

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.250 
you you know this is the cheapest option
and<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.650> can<00:02:50.680> look<00:02:50.950> at<00:02:51.160> all<00:02:51.400> sorts<00:02:51.880> of

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
and you can look at all sorts of

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.320 
and you can look at all sorts of
different<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:54.070> know<00:02:54.190> like<00:02:54.220> slotted<00:02:55.090> bags

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
different you know like slotted bags

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.780 
different you know like slotted bags
which<00:02:55.930> are<00:02:56.049> good<00:02:56.260> but<00:02:56.500> you<00:02:56.620> can't<00:02:56.890> it's

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
which are good but you can't it's

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.450 
which are good but you can't it's
nowhere<00:02:57.940> near<00:02:58.360> it's<00:02:58.630> like<00:02:58.780> carrying<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.170> purse

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.850 

anywhere<00:03:02.460> near<00:03:02.490> as<00:03:02.820> convenient<00:03:06.590> so<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.680> just

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
anywhere near as convenient so you just

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.070 
anywhere near as convenient so you just
put<00:03:08.370> that<00:03:08.640> down<00:03:08.820> like<00:03:10.130> so<00:03:11.130> here<00:03:11.520> and<00:03:11.840> then<00:03:12.840> I

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
put that down like so here and then I

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.990 
put that down like so here and then I
think<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.620> clove<00:03:13.980> hitch<00:03:14.010> would<00:03:16.880> technically<00:03:17.880> be

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
think a clove hitch would technically be

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.940 
think a clove hitch would technically be
the<00:03:18.270> proper<00:03:18.660> knot<00:03:18.840> but<00:03:19.110> I<00:03:19.200> just<00:03:19.380> used<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.740> single

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
the proper knot but I just used a single

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:20.810 
the proper knot but I just used a single
overhand

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
overhand

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.150 
overhand
I'll<00:03:21.690> fumble<00:03:22.230> with<00:03:22.350> it<00:03:22.500> here<00:03:22.770> at<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.160> corners

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
I'll fumble with it here at the corners

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.250 
I'll fumble with it here at the corners
for<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.190> video<00:03:29.270> and<00:03:30.270> you<00:03:30.570> take<00:03:30.780> an<00:03:30.930> empty

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
for the video and you take an empty

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
for the video and you take an empty
shell<00:03:31.740> which<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.340> hopefully<00:03:32.700> have<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:35.190> know

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
shell which you hopefully have you know

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.010 
shell which you hopefully have you know
and<00:03:35.460> you<00:03:35.520> can<00:03:35.730> kind<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.240> readjust<00:03:36.450> your<00:03:36.810> shit

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
and you can kind of readjust your shit

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.560 
and you can kind of readjust your shit
better<00:03:37.200> but<00:03:38.160> then<00:03:38.340> instead<00:03:38.730> of<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:38.970> bouncy

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
better but then instead of that bouncy

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.560 
better but then instead of that bouncy
loose<00:03:42.570> noisy<00:03:43.140> pack<00:03:43.610> it's<00:03:44.610> almost<00:03:45.060> acceptable

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
loose noisy pack it's almost acceptable

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.080 
loose noisy pack it's almost acceptable
and<00:03:45.900> then<00:03:46.170> that<00:03:47.130> board<00:03:47.400> in<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.640> back<00:03:47.820> really

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
and then that board in the back really

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.260 
and then that board in the back really
really<00:03:48.360> keeps<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:48.990> off<00:03:49.110> your<00:03:49.260> back<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:53.270> there's

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
really keeps it off your back so there's

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.540 
really keeps it off your back so there's
