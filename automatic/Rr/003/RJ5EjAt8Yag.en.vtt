 Also Thank you for seeing the athlete project Kayo Morita School today 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:38.590
 Today I will introduce how to set the elbows for swimming 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:44.080
 There are people who build coffee consciously in this way of raising elbows of this swimming 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:46.329
 After all, if you raise your elbow consciously, power will be applied to your shoulders 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:53.859
 Not part 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:01:00.190
 Even in this mori 広げ る place that spreads the hand that has entered the place from which it is going to make this extremely erection 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:01:05.560
 When even though you will be allowed to introduce the place going to do naturally in the way extend the hand is absolutely 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.320
 Please be careful not to bend the elbow 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.979
 fingertip 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.820
 This second joint has from 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:21.200
 It is a little high school a little high school 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:23.450
 It is good if you bend it . If you try to spread this as it is, the elbow will be easier to bend . 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.450
 At the wrist 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:32.960
 And we'll enter after from 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.649
 If the elbow is naturally stretched by the flow, it is easy for the elbow to stand right here 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:41.360
 Become 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:42.950
 If this says this, it will be in the state where it is not in the seven dragon state where the elbow stands easily but is pulled 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.920
 Because per the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.920
 Undecided Masu especially doing taking care of the movement of the wrist 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:02:00.610
 I wonder how it was this one of Omori's advice one by one 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:05.920
 Please take a look at it carefully and then try it 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:08.090
 And it is really that now I have gotten to say that part of the park in the forest school 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.660
 But even that's still Archives 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.090
 Some places say or do not know the part I answer Anodo 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.600
 It's just because I am there 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:22.440
 In the future 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:25.740
 The road is not only the comment of the part of the video delivery but also the live delivery as far as possible 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.280
 It is that in the form of the exchange 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:33.330
 It is by all means everyone's at that time because we believe now 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.590
 Let us participate and ask questions directly 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.640
 And there is a form of answering 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:44.060

 I do Hey that their thoughts can not be at the softening land is there is an image that can not be underwater 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.550

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:10.980
 I do not know after all and this is also not confirmed 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:14.910
 Once it was this complaint because adults to scalp 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.500
 Arm even though it is what Toka do if not I pancreatitis to think this 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.430
