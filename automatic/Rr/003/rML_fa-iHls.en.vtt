00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
will we get it back we wouldn't have a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.250 
will we get it back we wouldn't have a
physical<00:00:49.440> means<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.340> not<00:00:51.180> only<00:00:51.300> mine<00:00:51.660> for<00:00:52.140> it

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
physical means to not only mine for it

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.060 
physical means to not only mine for it
but<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.620> transport<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.829> maybe<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
but to transport it so maybe in the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.250 
but to transport it so maybe in the
future<00:00:56.250> maybe<00:00:56.940> not<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> thousand<00:00:58.230> years

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
future maybe not in a thousand years

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.580 
future maybe not in a thousand years
time<00:00:58.860> we<00:00:59.160> might<00:00:59.370> be<00:00:59.489> able<00:00:59.610> to<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.290> to<00:01:01.290> spend

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
time we might be able to but to spend
