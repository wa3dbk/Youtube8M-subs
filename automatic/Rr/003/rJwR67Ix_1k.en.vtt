00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.240 
even have to have front sight big swings
down<00:00:27.539> but<00:00:27.960> it's<00:00:28.170> better<00:00:28.260> if<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.560> do<00:00:28.740> um<00:00:29.840> and

you're going to want to start out by

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.880 
you're going to want to start out by
doing<00:00:33.320> probably<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.380> same<00:00:34.440> thing<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.770> did

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
doing probably the same thing you did

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.410 
doing probably the same thing you did
when<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.070> learn<00:00:35.250> frontside<00:00:35.640> big<00:00:35.850> fins<00:00:36.120> doing

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
when you learn frontside big fins doing

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.819 
when you learn frontside big fins doing
a<00:00:36.480> front<00:00:36.660> side<00:00:36.780> shelf<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.260> then<00:00:37.350> reverting

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
a front side shelf and then reverting

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.770 
a front side shelf and then reverting
you<00:00:38.730> want<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.969> do<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.239> except<00:00:39.480> do<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.660> with<00:00:39.750> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
you want to do that except do it with a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.850 
you want to do that except do it with a

cut your heel here Reever the rest away

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.020 
cut your heel here Reever the rest away
around<00:00:47.329> just<00:00:48.329> like<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:49.190> keep<00:00:50.190> doing<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
around just like that keep doing it and

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.439 
around just like that keep doing it and
then<00:00:51.469> try<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.500> like<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.910> have<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.059> rail<00:00:54.270> or

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
then try to like if you have a rail or

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.549 
then try to like if you have a rail or
something<00:00:54.750> try<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.960> do<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.379> were

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
something try to do it like you were

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.220 
something try to do it like you were
doing<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.860> varial<00:00:56.160> heel<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.579> board<00:00:56.989> like<00:00:57.989> that

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
doing a varial heel to board like that

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.889 
doing a varial heel to board like that
because<00:00:59.219> if<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.550> notice<00:00:59.879> instead<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.750> just

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
because if you notice instead of just

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.590 
because if you notice instead of just
flipping<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.350> their<00:01:01.590> you're<00:01:02.430> flipping<00:01:02.789> to

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
flipping to their you're flipping to

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.390 
flipping to their you're flipping to
there<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.350> get<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> little<00:01:04.979> bit<00:01:05.220> more

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
there and you just get a little bit more

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.039 
there and you just get a little bit more
and<00:01:07.280> then<00:01:08.280> eventually<00:01:09.119> just<00:01:09.540> going<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.960> keep

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
and then eventually just going to keep

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.160 
and then eventually just going to keep
turning<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:13.130> until<00:01:14.479> you<00:01:15.479> can<00:01:15.659> get<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.900> all<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
turning it until you can get it all the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.100 
turning it until you can get it all the
way<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.430> lot<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.939> lot<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.750> tricks<00:01:18.960> are

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
way it's a lot of a lot of tricks are

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.289 
way it's a lot of a lot of tricks are
you<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:19.409> got<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.530> keep<00:01:19.790> getting<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.909> pushing

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
you just got to keep getting it pushing

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.880 
you just got to keep getting it pushing
it<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.450> pushing<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.869> till<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.110> get<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.770> know

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
it and pushing it till you get you know

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.880 
it and pushing it till you get you know
where<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.250> need<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.610> be<00:01:25.189> so<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:28.619> way<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.710> do

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
where you need it to be so the way I do

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.179 
where you need it to be so the way I do
it<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.369> when<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.700> pop<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.650> spin<00:01:31.650> my<00:01:31.710> fingers

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
it is I when I pop it I spin my fingers

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.050 
it is I when I pop it I spin my fingers
out<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.430> kind<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.850> just<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:34.850> flip<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
out and kind of just like that flip the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.569 
out and kind of just like that flip the
side<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.600> it'll<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.560> flip<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:37.979> around<00:01:38.159> for

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
side and it'll just flip it around for

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:47.840 
side and it'll just flip it around for
me<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:39.350> can<00:01:40.350> catch<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:45.619> it's<00:01:46.619> really<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.280> pretty

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
me I can catch it it's really a pretty

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.899 
me I can catch it it's really a pretty
easy<00:01:48.030> trick<00:01:49.340> it's<00:01:50.340> tough<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.759> get<00:01:50.850> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
easy trick it's tough to get a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.569 
easy trick it's tough to get a
consistent<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.750> when<00:01:52.619> first<00:01:52.860> learning<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.399> or

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
consistent but when first learning it or

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.950 
consistent but when first learning it or
when<00:01:53.759> i<00:01:53.850> was<00:01:54.030> i<00:01:54.210> could<00:01:54.240> get<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.720> one<00:01:54.869> out

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
when i was i could get it like one out

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.600 
when i was i could get it like one out
of<00:01:55.020> five<00:01:55.200> tries<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.009> for<00:01:56.130> me<00:01:56.219> that's<00:01:56.310> really

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
of five tries and for me that's really

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.959 
of five tries and for me that's really
cool<00:01:56.820> there's<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.930> hard<00:01:58.799> trick<00:01:59.009> necessarily

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
cool there's a hard trick necessarily

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.760 
cool there's a hard trick necessarily
but<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.210> seems<00:02:00.420> hard<00:02:00.659> there's<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:01.710> much

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
but it seems hard there's so much

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.380 
but it seems hard there's so much
involved<00:02:02.930> so<00:02:04.430> getting<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.579> consistent<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.180> hard

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
involved so getting a consistent is hard

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.779 
involved so getting a consistent is hard
at<00:02:06.540> first<00:02:06.810> but<00:02:07.740> eventually<00:02:07.979> you'll<00:02:08.610> be<00:02:08.700> able

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
at first but eventually you'll be able

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.920 
at first but eventually you'll be able
to<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.090> it

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.940 

but<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.049> course<00:02:13.079> we<00:02:13.379> never<00:02:13.560> talk<00:02:13.799> about

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
but of course we never talk about

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.569 
but of course we never talk about
