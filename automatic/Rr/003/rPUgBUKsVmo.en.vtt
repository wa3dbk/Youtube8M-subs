00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.720
 Hello everyone, well, I'm going to comment 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.430
 about a rumor that has claimed 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.480
 a lot of strength 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:19.420
 I get the impression that I could 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:22.220
 stay only in that though www 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.310
 mana each year and in this case they add up 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.730
 the 31st will spare no effort in 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.230
 try to get back to the undercard as 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.710
 possible media has already done 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.890
 previously with floyd mayweather by 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.199
 example pete rose when i wear it for 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.470
 that to appear and be a victim of 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:45.460
 good kane this time 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.340
 the good rumor the story that 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.360
 effectively if it was carried out 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.700
 arises from the party in which the 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.970
 manchester united beat preston 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:01.520
 north end by the fed cup and with good a 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.610
 wayne rooney falls in the penalty area 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.820
 quite discussed and was sanctioned as 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.840
 penal 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.560
 it just happened that way barrett bad news 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.480
 barbie is currently in a manifest 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.860
 in your twitter account 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.720
 saying that he manifested saying that 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.650
 look nailed Wayne Rooney EC 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.310
 launched in the area to which 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.960
 wayne rooney what he answered for his 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.900
 twitter was 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.370
 I'm going to ask my friend is a goal that 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.940
 leave the retreat just for you 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:45.180
 what to what way barrett in turn 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.580
 responded and stated that 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.060
 he has no problem that he would say that davis 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.840
 the forward of the preston that is 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.430
 known to be pretty seasoned 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.460
 fighter fighter 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.800
 inside and outside the ring the forgiveness inside 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.800
 and outside of the court 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.630
 and then I would tell him why not 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.630
 so 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.720
 way swept and kevin davies versus wayne 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.010
 rooney stone cold steve austin abstract 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.850
 31 which replied if you read twitter 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.240
 let's go 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.150
 well and added that the 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:37.980
 Six-week training begins 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:41.050
 If this were to happen I think that www 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.880
 Bone billboard man and attention and 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.040
 the expectation that normally 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.640
 generates a kiss to mania would increase 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.920
 very much as we have seen throughout 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.720
 of time as I told others 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.580
 celebrities other figures that have been 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.660
 used even to a lesser extent 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.810
 that the one that would be used 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.970
 a wayne rooney now I see very 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.380
 complicated the subject we know who is the 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.380
 technical director manchester united 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:14.650
 is a guy who privileges a lot the 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:18.120
 stay with your team training the 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.470
 do not get distracted, I do not think it's good for you 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.340
 united although it is true it is very far 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.500
 of winning the premier league but 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:33.400
 he has to secure champions' posts 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:37.150
 because the manchester failed and a great 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.650
 economic loss then we already have 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.080
 as an example what happens this year 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.489
 so I doubt it will allow Wayne 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.430
 rooney despite being the symbol of 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:50.349
 Manchester United and the spoiled ones 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:53.080
 Hence he abandon or leave a time 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:56.019
 being focused one hundred percent for 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.590
 what is your professional activity in the 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:02.360
 football to dedicate 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.810
 to other worlds not to other things 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.210
 nevertheless of that nor seeing it from 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.910
 the other side is something that could perhaps 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.460
 be for mutual benefit because we know 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.609
 that Manchester United is one of the 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.290
 institutions that more profitable in 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.109
 As far as football is concerned in the world 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.310
 it's not a global phenomenon it's team and 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.220
 has fans everywhere then 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.550
 this would be a way to spread and 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.960
 even expand your horizons not 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.450
 let's forget that even the owners of 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.370
 Manchester United are people from the USA 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.080
 so they think a lot too 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.610
 in what is the business beyond even 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.129
 of soccer 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.349
 let's see what happens I say to me I do not 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:46.050
 would displease a considered that wayne 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:48.780
 rooney can I contribute to an eventual 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.729
 bresson man fight and the expectation 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:56.030
 that a lot of the roster does not 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:58.400
 he would never be lent him then 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.120
 let's see what happens we hope to see 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.370
 if it is that the conditions are 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.560
 give if this goes beyond a 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.500
 media war by twitter or by a 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.110
 fever moment 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.900
 it's obvious that barrett for my concept 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.220
 I was trying to gain notoriety with 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.350
 those comments but the surprising thing 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.530
 was that Rooney answered them and that 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:24.250
 continue in a back and forth 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.650
 generating expectation and obviously 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.200
 they involve two worlds the world of 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.790
 wrestling and the world of football or 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.820
 soccer as they are called there in states 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:37.520
 united in exchange 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:39.990
 I tell them I would pay to see 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.090
 barbetti and if they do 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.650
 jim with stone cold steve austin and the 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.760
 preston front of me seem so 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.400
 imperfect 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.260
 let's see how everything goes and I also look forward to your 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.080
 comments and what do you think of 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.500
 this wayne rooney fight versus bad news 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.500
 vaart
