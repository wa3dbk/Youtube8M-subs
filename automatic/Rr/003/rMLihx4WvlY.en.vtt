I wasn't I didn't even want a rage quit

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.130 
I wasn't I didn't even want a rage quit
this<00:01:43.979> game<00:01:44.189> because<00:01:44.640> we<00:01:44.909> were<00:01:45.060> winning<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.600> was

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
this game because we were winning I was

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.370 
this game because we were winning I was
hoping<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.850> you<00:01:47.850> know<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.600> would<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:48.899> make

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
hoping that you know it would just make

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.050 
hoping that you know it would just make
it<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.710> where<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> enemies<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.880> guess

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
it is where the enemies like I guess

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.460 
it is where the enemies like I guess
forfeit<00:01:51.570> because<00:01:51.720> there<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.200> been<00:01:52.350> plenty

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
forfeit because there have been plenty

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.639 
forfeit because there have been plenty
of<00:01:52.680> times<00:01:52.860> where<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:54.329> host<00:01:54.450> migrates<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.290> it

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
of times where the host migrates and it

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.020 
of times where the host migrates and it
boots<00:01:55.890> everyone<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.579> other<00:01:56.790> team<00:01:57.000> and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
boots everyone on the other team and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.459 
boots everyone on the other team and
then<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.780> know<00:01:57.869> says<00:01:58.079> enemies

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469
