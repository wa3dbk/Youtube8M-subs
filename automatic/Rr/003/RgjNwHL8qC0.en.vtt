00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.220
 fly 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.490
 you will not have everything in europe now of 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.430
 true 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.000
 God wants you tear it up 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.710
 the field of people to five copies of 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:43.250
 music I run potato potato friend god 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:43.250
 respect your kids peanuts look 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.820
 assassin's creed roe begins in 1750 and 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.340
 28 years before you were born inscrip 3 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.380
 start to control mouse to mouse 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.960
 with brad tan tan 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.180
 hey look at the story because it comes to be what 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.460
 same as always you are a bar killer 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.619
 messenger bar slave bar 5 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.210
 the story really is not that bad 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.210
 to be an assassin's creed 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.300
 if there is patrick cormac our 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.900
 protagonist is a character 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.360
 transcendental but deep 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.610
 for his behavior it could well be 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.660
 a ruth woman basically no one 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.730
 you understand 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.620
 He is sad because seeing us kill 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.960
 people who do not think they deserve it 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.240
 because it 's closer to the cemetery with 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.420
 an average American 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.390
 mb look at that cocksucker look 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.490
 pushed to fuck today they are having dinner 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.710
 Blood sausages but wait for a 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.420
 moment in the quiet plot that you do not 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.470
 you are losing nothing that releases a 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.470
 pearl of this caliber 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.400
 hears 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.920
 and you are, you are smelling it, no, I am not 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.650
 just me is not it or is it the sweet taste 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.570
 of schizophrenia is to say I can kill 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.119
 to those who are not going to touch a hair 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.710
 If it's a neutral zone, I can kill my 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.860
 goals without my pulse trembling 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.300
 but crazy I 'm going to feel bad to me the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.010
 truth is that it reminds me when I was going to 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.050
 give the notes to my parents you touch 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:23.140
 the balls all the course penca 7 te 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.140
 you eat two pieces and reconsider or not 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.830
 as a stealth game assassin's creed 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.230
 it has always been a parody is so 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.540
 simple killing is even rewarding 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.340
 you feel powerful but it's not like this 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.379
 honor in which killing was simple but 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.269
 doing so was optional and had its 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.220
 consequences here is almost a 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.769
 obligation hey the base of the game is 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.930
 kill the templar bosses and if by the 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.300
 you take 30 guards as it is 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.920
 what happens collateral damage yes that is 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.660
 true that it is an adventure that if you 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.299
 submerge can take you tens of hours 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.580
 complete it but it's worth it to say 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.260
 I need to buy a better sword for 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.780
 make the fighting easier by the 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.500
 God's love these combats are 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.500
 ridiculous 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.360
 so and then you become a templar 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.630
 Templar do not fuck me with you not being 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.090
 a spoiler is true it has not been the 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.880
 ubisoft claim to sell you the 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.410
 game nor has it hardly appeared in 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.540
 the analyzes wait 18 but let's go back to 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.420
 the templar serves this to give you 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:49.600
 another touch to the plot if something changes the 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:51.700
 game not now we kill other guys the 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.860
 gameplay does not change at all like 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.840
 we have been murderers we have all of us 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.990
 your skills but now in our 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.830
 dni says we are templars this 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.830
 it's good 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.650
 you remember when I complained about the 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.080
 overexploitation of fact auditors other 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.510
 time fucking done auditor age your whore 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.330
 mother is a joke trade is throwing 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.430
 left to die in peace as good as I 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.410
 bishop has evolved the concept 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.510
 gone one step further now not 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:26.210
 overexploit characters he does with 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:27.440
 tok tok tok tok tok tok tok settings 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.440
 tok tok 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.780
 these guys never disappoint not only 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.139
 they repeat country period and atmosphere 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:40.669
 they repeat secondary to achilles 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:43.610
 here it has returned to you what is this 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:46.130
 means sir ernest we put 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.889
 locations that children observe 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.130
 some geniuses here and that is fucking 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.710
 identical is that the olé your games 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.620
 ubisoft because mother of god I think that 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.900
 this time you have surpassed macho ni ni 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.229
 the modern warfare building 3 in that 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.830
 you've stuck it in, mile by mile 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:08.020
 centimeters by centimeters 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.820
 these I take them to arms that is much 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.710
 less songs or the problem is in that 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.450
 in that they do not even do it well because 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.700
 they choose the poorest setting in the 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.010
 saga to make it sure it's not 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.920
 because in this way they can put 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:24.940
 million kilometers of sea and the 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:28.630
 chronicles and not currárselo new no or that 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.760
 It is that what has us in 1700 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.250
 yes yes there is nothing emblematic and if they are 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.320
 virtually shantytowns in the system 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.400
 the watchtowers for example only serves to 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.400
 put that in evidence 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.940
 but hey well not everything was going to be bad 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:52.840
 We also travel to Lisbon during I do not know 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.480
 like half an hour to a cathedral that 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.020
 it could be that of the d 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.020
 Let's see 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:04.460
 for example in Lisbon you live one of the 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.400
 saddest moments is not even bad 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.110
 yes it is worth good thing is the 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.610
 next you go to lisboa you take a 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.160
 fragment of Eden and everything goes to 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.960
 fuck literally escapes a 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.360
 scene more like call of duty than other 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.780
 thing and hear what happens when I do not 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.780
 you follow her 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.660
 what is this shit I notice this this is 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.820
 sad even for you there was no 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.080
 need or could live without success without 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.750
 this fucking scene 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.789
 it's a blow but good then 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.280
 cameos arrive lean al dion 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:46.620
 marston and morpheus and hear everything is solved 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.599
 also thank goodness they removed everything 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.370
 this roll of abstergo that what enemy 

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:52.530
 of miss they were removed from the area less 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.919
 bad that it ended with desmond mails and not 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:07:01.879
 we will never see it again 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:07:01.879
 you were in the animus animus fuck 

00:07:02.799 --> 00:07:08.229
 great think well
