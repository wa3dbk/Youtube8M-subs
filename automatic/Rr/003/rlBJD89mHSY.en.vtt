00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:08.650
 this is a macro two device for that 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.090
 canon ef bayonet but also for the 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.860
 could the f bayonet 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.280
 this movie will do it with me 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.439
 wire the nikon both presented 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.330
 So came gets past times is just as 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.520
 has built up any other bayonet 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.220
 yes that's the whole thing 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.320
 here on the back then have the 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.130
 So part of the ballet of the camera 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.990
 is used 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.510
 on the front becomes the objective 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.129
 attached and then you can do the whole thing 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.199
 additionally change below as well 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.050
 with the front of brazil have the 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.120
 Camera then up to then on a tripod 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.649
 attach or a tripod head that 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.059
 measured in the screw inside that 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.160
 tie in and then you can do that 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.450
 Constancy, this is what it is 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.390
 next step just first here 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:53.110
 the camera and an objective with this 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.700
 marco baldi device still connect here 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.620
 for a better understanding 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.539
 So here's the macro soon with it 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.379
 the camera and the front are the 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:04.509
 object I can take now only the 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.159
 camera and connects the camera with the 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.990
 ball device then close with 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.340
 One knows markings of one 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.770
 Another system is also a subsection 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.859
 Button red dot on the net with the whole 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:20.020
 just set and then easy 

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:23.770
 once it turns and that's the only one 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.450
 attached to solve logically then 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.899
 here simply with the kidnapping victim 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.549
 camera the whole country again evil of 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.929
 logically, then comes the objective 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.279
 were also here with the markings with 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.619
 the points as we are used to from 

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:38.020
 national lens change simply says 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.590
 Turning once turn and that's it 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.240
 all locked tight and now I can 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.799
 either here as it is here 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.569
 have built on the table or halt 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.459
 of course better then, of course 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.859
 tripod we remember down here 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:52.149
 the tripod thread my macro shots 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:55.090
 then the whole will be over the 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.009
 standard of this simply excites with this 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.719
 he moved on the side here too 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.130
 markings on it or on the other 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.029
 page in centimeters then can step 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.189
 So you also get the points 

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:04.479
 Remember to write down and then 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.920
 accordingly again and again to the 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.570
 point back 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.459
 we jump and that he sharp again 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.840
 always ask that would like a page here 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.860
 is then the screw holds that is 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.480
 if somehow I'm after 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.800
 has found and says so now every one 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.090
 Sheep and I do not want it that 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.709
 created then I just take this 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.209
 screw on the handle and turned properly fixed 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.010
 but can not incidentally 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.410
 More represented to solve where providers 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.330
 then solve the whole and I can 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.410
 Just like that here again 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.100
 take pictures 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.800
 that 's macro photography for right 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.790
 little money and you have to say that too 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.620
 and of course you can too 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.060
 accordingly here in front with a 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.989
 adapter also other focal lengths 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.760
 they may not do it now 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.590
 necessarily in the case is the 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.750
 problem in that no electronic 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.030
 connection between objective is ungar 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.130
 this separated by the two here 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.930
 Of course you can do it manually too 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.920
 focus the lenses on the blender 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.209
 So still do the 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.150
 affect the depth of field 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.019
 but as I said for the very rough 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.430
 standard value or 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.530
 For the simplest market you have to do it 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.450
 can there so now uses in principle 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.650
 on your on objective just that 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.540
 blossoming I can be quite different 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.890
 Objectives still pretend such a 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.790
 I have to be objective 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.790
 play along 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.350
 there is quite a lot possible I like 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.780
 it's just a simple one 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.730
 marco for demonstration purposes approximate 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.799
 imagination have what because there so exactly 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.989
 happened I could be here now initiative 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.820
 building but I am a friend small 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.709
 Solution off because there is such a floor here 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.040
 Sack got so in our pot 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.840
 it was just such a small thing for me 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.570
 Tripod or small ball head like that 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.640
 Just make the camera on top of it 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.100
 Look, now we have with this 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.200
 pen here a macro make the whole 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.660
 put it in front of the lens and then you will 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.120
 I just hang out with the two of them 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.170
 to focus all and look like 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.630
 Arrive after judge 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.400
 in the case of the city maybe 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.569
 been better 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.300
 So do not give in here right now 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.530
 can also 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.700
 the damage then I can easily 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.340
 to do my marco 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.870
 I have to go there but never 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:10.700
 When to do that is an enlargement of that 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:14.600
 is already say I say that 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.100
 I've done something here 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.870
 hope you can reasonably well 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.940
 see the problem bit foreground 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.000
 stand the soft boxes and headlights 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.950
 but I guess so they can 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.710
 at least on display so see the 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.910
 is now here from this pen 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.830
 practically the area up here is easy 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.540
 the transition from the cap to the pen 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.040
 myself so I'm pretty 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.540
 I come to it had previously been 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.080
 Shots made for another movie 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.550
 with macro between ring so be sure 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.180
 practically there I am as close ran 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.980
 come 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.810
 of course it is with the two now 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.670
 again a bigger one 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.500
 I can do so 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.670
 get even closer that is from 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.040
 size comparison like if you do not 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.480
 let's see that the pen youth of 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.040
 Oberkappel and you can see that too 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.500
 how roosters have become and how I manage 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.610
 that is and there is already every one 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.990
 lot mackrodt one wants to join in 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.940
 So we summarize we have here 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.630
 really with little financial effort 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.800
 a possibility very very good markus 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.470
 to do with a big one 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.600
 picture scale and that is in 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.470
 the end effect is that you can do that 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.000
 whole topic first a bit 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.750
 of course there are also 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.580
 systems 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.680
 there you have autofocus there you have it 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.880
 all dazzle transmission and so on 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.890
 and so on, but I guess they are 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.210
 sometimes like to do it now and then or 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.830
 did not first have him with you 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.030
 would like to deal with that is 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.340
 anything for me and so on 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.530
 then something is definitely for me 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.180
 at least the first choice and before I 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.710
 that somehow spend hundreds of euros 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.450
 should and then later determine well 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.430
 however by 1 then I do that 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.770
 Also we were there with the yes so 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.580
 now here is the marco two devices in the 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:49.970
 example for the canon dfb eg sap system 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.840
 and the whole negative on how nikon that 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.700
 Of course, this is also here in the 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.740
 product sales nikon linked but how 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:58.330
 said they are just different from 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.330
 bayonetta have fun with it
