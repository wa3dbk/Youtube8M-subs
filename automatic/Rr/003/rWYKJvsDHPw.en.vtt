protection<00:01:38.310> issue<00:01:38.850> has<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.540> raised<00:01:40.409> bezel

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
protection issue has that raised bezel

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.920 
protection issue has that raised bezel
so<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.340> your<00:01:41.820> screen<00:01:42.270> isn't<00:01:42.479> going<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.750> get

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
so that your screen isn't going to get

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.399 
so that your screen isn't going to get
ruined<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.500> nice<00:01:44.250> case<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.759> stays<00:01:45.000> together<00:01:45.899> and

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
ruined a nice case it stays together and

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.069 
ruined a nice case it stays together and
it's<00:01:47.130> nice<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:47.850> super<00:01:48.210> easy<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.570> remove

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
it's nice that it's super easy to remove

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.319 
it's nice that it's super easy to remove
so<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> great<00:01:49.920> case<00:01:50.159> it's<00:01:50.430> not<00:01:50.579> completely

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
so a great case it's not completely

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.880 
so a great case it's not completely
clear<00:01:51.689> which<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:51.930> why<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:52.320> didn't<00:01:52.500> rank<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.799> at

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
clear which is why we didn't rank it at

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.980 
clear which is why we didn't rank it at
the<00:01:53.009> top<00:01:53.220> but<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> great<00:01:54.509> case<00:01:54.750> than<00:01:54.960> any

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the top but it is a great case than any

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.959 
the top but it is a great case than any
of<00:01:55.320> these<00:01:55.409> are<00:01:55.590> great<00:01:55.799> cases<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.700> kind<00:01:56.939> of

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
of these are great cases it's kind of

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.760 
of these are great cases it's kind of
hard<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.420> say<00:01:57.630> which<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.110> best<00:01:58.380> because<00:01:58.619> it

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
hard to say which is the best because it

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.810 
hard to say which is the best because it
really<00:01:58.979> depends<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.369> what<00:01:59.520> you're<00:01:59.729> looking

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
really depends on what you're looking

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.660 
really depends on what you're looking
for<00:02:00.210> next<00:02:01.110> up<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.439> most<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> glazed<00:02:02.159> xt

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
for next up is the most you I glazed xt

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.480 
for next up is the most you I glazed xt
for<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.149> iphone<00:02:03.479> 5<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.710> most<00:02:05.009> simple

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
for the iphone 5 this is the most simple

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.160 
for the iphone 5 this is the most simple
out<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.729> all<00:02:05.850> these<00:02:06.030> cases<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.750> it's<00:02:06.869> just<00:02:07.020> a

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
out of all these cases so it's just a

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.859 
out of all these cases so it's just a
simple<00:02:07.530> snap<00:02:07.860> case<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.940> barely<00:02:09.300> comes<00:02:09.720> up

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
simple snap case just barely comes up

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.840 
simple snap case just barely comes up
over<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.200> edge<00:02:10.379> so

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
over the edge so

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.580 
over the edge so
