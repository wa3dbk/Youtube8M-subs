00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:41.929 
really chocolate so that's sending on

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:43.779 
really chocolate so that's sending on
the<00:06:42.050> chocolate<00:06:42.409> that's<00:06:42.559> bad<00:06:42.769> but<00:06:43.129> no<00:06:43.309> my<00:06:43.580> eggs

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789 
the chocolate that's bad but no my eggs

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:46.299 
the chocolate that's bad but no my eggs
though<00:06:44.269> my<00:06:44.959> eggs<00:06:45.169> I<00:06:45.649> mean<00:06:45.800> I<00:06:45.919> know<00:06:45.979> they're

00:06:46.299 --> 00:06:46.309 
though my eggs I mean I know they're

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:47.499 
though my eggs I mean I know they're
like<00:06:46.429> really<00:06:46.580> cheap<00:06:46.849> but<00:06:46.969> it's<00:06:47.059> like<00:06:47.179> some<00:06:47.449> of

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:47.509 
like really cheap but it's like some of

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:50.290 
like really cheap but it's like some of
the<00:06:47.569> best<00:06:47.989> chocolate<00:06:48.649> ever<00:06:48.769> no<00:06:49.369> rocks<00:06:49.699> out<00:06:49.909> ok

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300 
the best chocolate ever no rocks out ok

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.749 
the best chocolate ever no rocks out ok
so<00:06:50.749> that's<00:06:50.989> cheap<00:06:51.379> isn't<00:06:51.889> necessarily<00:06:52.369> bad

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 
so that's cheap isn't necessarily bad

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:55.540 
so that's cheap isn't necessarily bad
