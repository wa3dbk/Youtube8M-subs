00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.540 
so have you looked at kind of an

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.240 
so have you looked at kind of an
internal<00:00:14.260> bottom<00:00:14.530> bracket<00:00:14.860> which<00:00:14.980> is<00:00:15.070> a<00:00:15.100> bit

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
internal bottom bracket which is a bit

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.000 
internal bottom bracket which is a bit
more<00:00:15.400> of<00:00:15.460> a<00:00:15.700> faff<00:00:16.150> really<00:00:16.650> in<00:00:17.650> this<00:00:17.800> day<00:00:17.980> and

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
more of a faff really in this day and

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.440 
more of a faff really in this day and
age<00:00:18.220> a<00:00:18.280> lot<00:00:18.490> of<00:00:18.580> the<00:00:18.640> bottom<00:00:18.880> brackets<00:00:19.240> and<00:00:19.390> the

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450 
age a lot of the bottom brackets and the

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.380 
age a lot of the bottom brackets and the
external<00:00:20.050> the<00:00:20.619> bearings<00:00:21.010> are<00:00:21.100> external<00:00:21.670> makes

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
external the bearings are external makes

external the bearings are external makes
things<00:00:22.600> a<00:00:22.660> bit<00:00:22.689> easier<00:00:22.840> really<00:00:23.410> in<00:00:23.470> terms<00:00:23.650> of

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
things a bit easier really in terms of

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.890 
things a bit easier really in terms of
removal<00:00:24.400> certainly<00:00:25.119> modern<00:00:25.420> crank<00:00:25.660> arm

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
removal certainly modern crank arm

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.240 
removal certainly modern crank arm
systems<00:00:26.320> as<00:00:26.439> well<00:00:26.470> as<00:00:26.650> a<00:00:26.860> little<00:00:27.040> bit<00:00:27.130> more

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
systems as well as a little bit more

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.120 
systems as well as a little bit more
easy<00:00:27.460> they<00:00:27.970> vary<00:00:28.210> between<00:00:28.390> manufacturers<00:00:29.130> but

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
easy they vary between manufacturers but

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.519 
easy they vary between manufacturers but
we're<00:00:30.730> looking<00:00:30.970> at<00:00:31.060> a<00:00:31.119> Shimano<00:00:31.480> here<00:00:31.900> couple

you'll not be able to undo this ok you

risk match me that you will need to undo

risk match me that you will need to undo
the<00:01:17.830> interval<00:01:18.340> all<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.940> way<00:01:19.440> because<00:01:20.440> there's

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
the interval all the way because there's

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.640 
the interval all the way because there's
a<00:01:20.740> locking<00:01:21.190> mechanism<00:01:22.080> which<00:01:23.080> will<00:01:23.500> not

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
a locking mechanism which will not

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.180 
a locking mechanism which will not
unlock<00:01:23.910> unless<00:01:24.910> you<00:01:25.120> extract<00:01:25.540> that<00:01:26.170> fully<00:01:26.500> so

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
unlock unless you extract that fully so

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.930 
unlock unless you extract that fully so
it<00:01:27.280> should<00:01:27.430> allow<00:01:27.610> us<00:01:27.760> then<00:01:27.940> to<00:01:28.000> lift<00:01:28.330> up<00:01:29.940> the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
it should allow us then to lift up the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.970 
it should allow us then to lift up the
locking<00:01:31.240> mechanism<00:01:31.410> and<00:01:32.410> then<00:01:32.500> off<00:01:32.620> she<00:01:32.650> comes

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
locking mechanism and then off she comes

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.040 
locking mechanism and then off she comes
i'll<00:01:33.190> just<00:01:33.370> pop<00:01:33.640> that<00:01:33.670> back<00:01:33.940> in<00:01:34.150> for<00:01:34.330> a<00:01:34.390> second

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.840 

so<00:01:40.050> they<00:01:40.200> need<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.410> tease<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.920> with<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.100> rubber

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
so they need to tease it with a rubber

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.250 
so they need to tease it with a rubber
mallet<00:01:42.120> or<00:01:42.270> anything<00:01:42.600> else<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.020> get<00:01:43.140> it

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
mallet or anything else if you get it

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.630 
mallet or anything else if you get it
right<00:01:43.410> you<00:01:43.650> just<00:01:43.770> slide<00:01:44.040> up<00:01:44.130> nicely<00:01:46.640> flipside

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
right you just slide up nicely flipside

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.280 
right you just slide up nicely flipside
we're<00:01:48.030> going<00:01:48.150> to<00:01:48.240> remove<00:01:48.510> the<00:01:48.720> chain<00:01:48.930> from<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
we're going to remove the chain from the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:57.860 
we're going to remove the chain from the
Rings<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.950> here<00:01:56.940> we<00:01:57.090> might<00:01:57.210> need<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.480> tease<00:01:57.720> it

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
Rings and here we might need to tease it

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:10.250 
Rings and here we might need to tease it
slightly<00:01:58.190> with<00:01:59.190> a<00:01:59.220> valid<00:02:07.070> thumb<00:02:08.070> well<00:02:09.200> now<00:02:10.200> she

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
slightly with a valid thumb well now she

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:25.240 
slightly with a valid thumb well now she
gums

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.720 

which<00:02:26.250> leaves<00:02:26.490> this<00:02:27.950> with<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.070> removal<00:02:29.400> of

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
which leaves this with the removal of

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.420 
which leaves this with the removal of
our<00:02:30.120> BB<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.950> external<00:02:32.370> pairings<00:02:34.310> now<00:02:35.310> these

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
our BB the external pairings now these

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.730 
our BB the external pairings now these
are<00:02:35.610> nicely<00:02:35.760> marked<00:02:36.270> with<00:02:36.540> Titan<00:02:37.050> untighten

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
are nicely marked with Titan untighten

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.170 
are nicely marked with Titan untighten
which<00:02:38.160> makes<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.460> a<00:02:38.550> lot<00:02:38.610> easier<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.940> get<00:02:39.060> the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
which makes it a lot easier to get the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.370 
which makes it a lot easier to get the
angles<00:02:39.480> right<00:02:39.570> again<00:02:39.840> you're<00:02:39.990> going<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.290> need

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
angles right again you're going to need

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.170 
angles right again you're going to need
a<00:02:40.440> specific<00:02:40.590> tool<00:02:41.100> which<00:02:41.670> simply<00:02:42.060> fits<00:02:42.270> over
