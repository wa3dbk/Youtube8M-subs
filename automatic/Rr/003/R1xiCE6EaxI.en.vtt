00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:06.109
 Ahearn 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.029
 no 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.859
 my youngest age 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.060
 a new landscape because of a calendar to mediate not 

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:21.539
 disoriented you 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.519
 the issue is especially in addition to the cases foreseen in London in the center 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.589
 national fundamentals study and we have taught the nar 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.439
 we tried to prepare at best it's this race 1 like water as much as 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.530
 mechanically 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.790
 % and on the men we practiced a lot and we made a 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.380
 a lot of endurance this year 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.610
 it is true I was not too much trouble at a jump on this point 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.470
 but it must be said and I think that it does not remember it will be at 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.359
 dakar who will be physically and difficult 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.799
 he has counted many years who imagine that the world at his two 

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:52.420
 guns now it will be to dakar that will be complicated hard 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.880
 because a lot more turns 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.110
 so she who says steering bend and hippie the hostage of the shot more effort 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.870
 physical 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.210
 for some times in africa we still had the idea to help special 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.260
 who was one could not dream a little about them we can rest on the 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.100
 distance but there it will help days that will be for everything 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.060
 the world 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.960
 the car we talk a lot about the diesel engine but it has also evolved 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.590
 and not bad without the split leader and if you have to do a little comparison 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.859
 between them 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.260
 the car of the previous one and this one 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.500
 as the chassis has arrived and it's fine and I'm here for now we've 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.360
 did it from the 17th kilometer of the season that we really discovered a 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.000
 car 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.580
 with a longer wheelbase 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.860
 she behaved better danton still walking in life often this effect of 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.570
 of which is actually rebound from behind on the older generation 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.840
 we worked a lot with the shock absorbers to try to have 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.170
 a car that are as comfortable as possible and we try to get 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.810
 lead 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.920
 of course the performance and this army 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.350
 and keeping some performance a lot worked on the comfort 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.170
 the comfort in eci is still well on the fate of our steps in 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.799
 level 2 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.889
 of physical resistance are the least shaken a sector badly and so we 

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:57.900
 also preserves being a little maybe a little bit more soft 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.200
 at the ump a lot of two mechanical parts and in those cars that is 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.690
 well born 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.690
 and I would not say the unknown but hey the big change for us it's 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.670
 especially the noc engine with a diesel engine have 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.540
 we won a lot of couples have to win 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.979
 some powerful 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:15.099
 different versions with gasoline engine 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.519
 it is a big change but in any case in pure performance we look at that 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.239
 and still we have not yet 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.199
 of direct comparison with the competition 

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.769
 Well, I hope we meet in the match 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.040
 at that level a petrol engine the diesel engine is round is it 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.730
 the song his riding habits and then I still may have a 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.920
 physical advantage 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.680
 it is in turn opposed to the level of noise we expect the car on a 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.340
 big day of special - exactly in front of her 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.840
 in the breeze the price is quite different we ironed our 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.410
 souls 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.350
 on ideas and letters in his skin instead of two figures for 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.109
 change gears because we are a bit lost lost 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.370
 all these engines are boiling level of pebbles and splashing against 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.239
 his car has known to the engine have been a few times laureate than otherwise 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.790
 change of scenery but it's true that on a day to complete even on a 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.790
 race level the headache level the concentration of this momentum and 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.620
 it's better 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.640
 marketing so the noise comfort better so I think we can 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.959
 run there will be a little better at major milestones 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.840
 in a more personal point of view 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.840
 e linking everything out of africa to discover something else is the 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.870
 the motivation is different compaorÃ© how do you approach this race for 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.370
 motivations the allies always had the same motivation to 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.269
 Elysium 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.269
 double very clear I think everyone wants to win this first dakar 

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:31.299
 in south america that was a first 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.860
 by the way be motivated to sion the second is to win in diesel I 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.609
 think that this is a challenge that is of interest to the most technologically 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.370
 many ask a lot of 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.959
 a lot of marc too 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.009
 and I think mitsubishi would really be the first to 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.970
 win in diesel 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.589
 and then third set have regained anyway I think 

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:49.799
 I was lucky so with gilles 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.689
 we did twice the stampa this rally 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:55.200
 so% and at 4 5 stages where we know roughly the places 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.269
 the characteristics of the field 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.609
 I am delighted to go to a country of car enthusiasts 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.709
 to leave a variety of landscapes 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.729
 different driving also of two teeth that should have greeted today 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:10.410
 according to a passable rating 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.560
 in the mountain will have peaceful coasts on the atacama desert 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.760
 the kings of the stampa will have trucks this will be really dedicated a rally that 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.769
 is that is magic so I'm happy it's sure it's a turn 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.469
 important for the dakar 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:25.559
 at 5 pm this African image I think somewhere of their allies 

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:27.900
 one day i hope to go back to africa but 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.680
 for the moment 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.099
 the southern mayor who was a 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:31.030
 stopping 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.800
 a trail reservoir of two surprises of natural beauty that 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.189
 equals impressive 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:39.479
 I go to quite another thing and I come back a little bit on this 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.699
 season was born knew that victory in gt1 who are your plans for this 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.270
 year season 2009 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.550
 the project hubs so with attention 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.030
 but what can we say about it 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.689
 at the moment we will have 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:55.979
 a car that will run in gt and fia with guillaume moreau and eddy has 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.699
 declared kim who has us one who has joined us so young 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.180
 who I think are 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.040
 quite efficient very quickly 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.860
 enrich on a cause format ensures shorter then I think the 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.680
 24hdu mans of course francs our program with a car that is 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.190
 qualified for shame after rating our beautiful season in the mans series ago 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.529
 close on the program of the second car we do not know 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:17.279
 and maybe from the rising 16 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:19.210
 % to 3 drivers 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.919
 but there are still a lot of unknowns it's the situation is difficult for 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.319
 them for everyone 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:26.179
 for the team will continue to exist if it's already that so we do not have 

00:05:26.179 --> 00:05:28.770
 not lived the worst but I think it must be said 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.400
 reduce a little wing and stand a little bit because we know how to find them 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.499
 good solutions 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:34.410
 for the 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.130
 to reduce a little bit by wearing the layers of the club so the 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.960
 day of 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.740
 test has been removed for mans 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.289
 we are disappointed with doral to shorten oscillate 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:48.300
 lewis stand up from the mans series start at just the bed 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.740
 to bale on thursday and saturday morning so with - deceased - taxiing 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.930
 for this cd solution who are good in one in a moment that is gone he 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.890
 a year ago m difficult for all types
