00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.100
 but 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.630
 in the last decades several species 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.540
 of fish have been affected 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.920
 drastically because of man since 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:31.070
 pollution to overfishing 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.460
 to continue with the same behavior 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:39.090
 soon the number of extinct species 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.879
 will increase currently are eight species 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.860
 of fish in danger of extinction 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.860
 below we will show you 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.680
 catfish of iberÃ¡ 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.590
 of elongated body and pigmentation 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.630
 yellow with black dots is found 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.710
 within the list of species in 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.810
 danger thanks to overfishing 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.260
 pollution and destruction of their 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.479
 habitat currently do not have 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.110
 some approximate number of copies 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:20.890
 but it is said that they are less than 10,000 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:25.260
 throughout the world declared species in 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.260
 danger in 2005 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:38.400
 peladilla although its appearance 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:42.030
 resembles a pejerrey has no scales and 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.300
 its color is quite different every 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.460
 It is more difficult to find this 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.830
 fish that in the past 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.520
 reigned the continental waters of 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:57.030
 Argentina with the pejerrey puches and 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.700
 perch the arrival of trout and 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.090
 salmon decimated the population of the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.729
 dragees making it currently 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.729
 an endangered species declare it in 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.729
 1998 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.240
 wet naked 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.730
 one of its peculiarities which 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.240
 gives the name is that they are completely lacking 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.750
 of scales although the specimens 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:36.170
 juveniles own them up to 42 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.210
 millimeters in length the current species 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.590
 It is composed of a few 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:45.050
 individuals a few thousand given that 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.890
 various natural factors and 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.770
 artificial attacks against 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:57.580
 preservation of the species declared in 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.580
 danger of extinction in 1988 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.650
 I'm asking mermaid today only 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.370
 There are four genera belonging to 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.770
 this group which are respectively the 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.819
 fish lung two of australia 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:24.200
 South America and Africa 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:26.739
 these fish only breathe air and can 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.740
 survive even if the rivers dry 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.500
 totally 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.710
 sinks in the mud leaving a small 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.290
 hole for breathing and can 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.430
 remain in this state for at least 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.700
 six months 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.769
 at this moment they place their mouth against 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.379
 the narrow opening of the camera that 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:52.370
 have built to pass the time of 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:55.490
 drought and thus breathe the little air that 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.120
 come from the surface 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:02.780
 in this way the fish will remain in a 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.570
 deep lethargy during which you can 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.900
 reduce your weight by half a 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:14.680
 extraordinary weight declared in danger 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.680
 of extinction in 1994 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.490
 it's needle or sword was a rare species 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.129
 of needlefish measuring approximately 2 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:35.000
 centimeters is in danger 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:37.639
 critical extinction was located by 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.539
 several marine biologists makes 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:43.729
 approximately three years is found 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:47.569
 from the south of the Mediterranean and sea 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:50.409
 Unfortunately, we do not have 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:52.490
 a lot of information about this fish 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:56.800
 classified as endangered 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.800
 since 2011 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.950
 steelhead trout 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.800
 the steelhead trout or steel head is 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.680
 a rainbow trout that passes part of 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.040
 its life cycle at sea and comes from 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:23.240
 the rivers of california since the decade 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:27.620
 of the 50 its population has decreased in 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:30.800
 90% many of the currents that this 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.590
 species runs have disappeared due 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.010
 to the construction of land and roads 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:40.100
 transport destroying its waters 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:46.510
 reproduction entered the list of 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:46.510
 endangered species in 1970 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:06:00.260
 giant cat this species that lives in 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.930
 the mekong river in thailand is one of the 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.900
 largest freshwater fish of the 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:09.380
 world coming to measure up to three 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.270
 meters long and weigh up to 300 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.490
 kilograms 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:18.530
 from the construction of the dam 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:21.470
 hydroelectric plant in the Mekong in 1994 the 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:27.660
 population of this catfish has decreased 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:29.910
 from 256 to only 96 fish 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:35.540
 it was declared a species in danger of 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:35.540
 extinction on June 2, 1970 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:47.599
 chinook salmon 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.759
 at one time Chinook salmon played a 

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:53.810
 great role in the culture of the Indians 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:56.330
 Americans in recent years the number 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:59.509
 of Chinook salmon that 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:02.240
 inhabits the Pacific Northwest region of 

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:06.080
 the united states has decreased 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:09.319
 drastically at one time it used to be very 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:14.389
 Normal fish a chinook of up to 45 

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:18.259
 kilograms but in 1998 they were counted 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:21.770
 less than 5000 fish in the river snake of 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:24.500
 state of ohio and now according to 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:27.460
 Scientists Chinook Salmon 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:31.460
 will extinguish in our world for the year 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:36.190
 2016 declared in danger of extinction 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.190
 in 1999
