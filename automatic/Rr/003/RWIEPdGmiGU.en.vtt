quite<00:02:30.769> easily<00:02:30.830> be<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.370> big<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:31.849> could

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
quite easily be that big and it could

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.820 
quite easily be that big and it could
have<00:02:32.090> vehicles<00:02:32.510> in<00:02:32.660> it<00:02:32.780> but<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.500> be<00:02:33.560> able<00:02:33.650> to

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
have vehicles in it but to be able to

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.000 
have vehicles in it but to be able to
search<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.280> successfully<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:36.230> make<00:02:36.890> sure

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
search that successfully and make sure

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.199 
search that successfully and make sure
that<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.250> do<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.459> properly<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:37.940> if<00:02:38.060> you're

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
that you do it properly and if you're

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.210 
that you do it properly and if you're
trying<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.540> locate<00:02:38.810> casualties<00:02:39.349> then<00:02:39.980> you'd

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
trying to locate casualties then you'd

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.009 
trying to locate casualties then you'd
need<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.430> guide<00:02:40.700> around<00:02:40.940> around<00:02:41.569> that<00:02:41.720> garage

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
need a guide around around that garage

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.380 
need a guide around around that garage
so<00:02:42.709> you<00:02:42.769> lay<00:02:43.069> out<00:02:43.099> a<00:02:43.670> line<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.209> follow

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
so you lay out a line to follow

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.210 
so you lay out a line to follow
basically<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.049> off<00:02:45.140> that<00:02:45.349> line<00:02:45.560> if<00:02:45.830> you<00:02:46.069> go

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
basically and off that line if you go

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.130 
basically and off that line if you go
further<00:02:46.489> into<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:46.790> we<00:02:46.940> have<00:02:47.060> more<00:02:47.209> people<00:02:47.450> you

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
further into it we have more people you

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.110 
further into it we have more people you
could<00:02:48.349> bring<00:02:48.500> other<00:02:48.680> lines<00:02:48.920> off<00:02:49.190> off<00:02:49.640> of<00:02:49.700> that

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
could bring other lines off off of that

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.000 
could bring other lines off off of that
so<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:50.900> nobody<00:02:51.200> actually<00:02:51.290> then<00:02:51.620> gets<00:02:51.829> lost

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
so that nobody actually then gets lost

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:03.729 
so that nobody actually then gets lost
in<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.340> area<00:02:56.049> by<00:02:57.049> making<00:03:01.750> such<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:02.780> basic<00:03:03.380> idea

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
in the area by making such a basic idea

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:04.930 
in the area by making such a basic idea
I<00:03:03.799> think<00:03:03.890> guidelines<00:03:04.459> have<00:03:04.640> been<00:03:04.670> in<00:03:04.880> the

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
I think guidelines have been in the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.910 
I think guidelines have been in the
flats<00:03:05.150> ever<00:03:05.450> since<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.870> first<00:03:06.019> began<00:03:06.200> it's

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
flats ever since it first began it's

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.410 
flats ever since it first began it's
literally<00:03:07.459> a<00:03:07.489> bit<00:03:07.670> of<00:03:07.730> spring<00:03:07.970> with<00:03:08.329> some

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
literally a bit of spring with some

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.660 
literally a bit of spring with some
knots<00:03:08.630> on<00:03:08.780> it<00:03:08.900> but<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:09.709> that<00:03:09.739> is<00:03:10.040> how<00:03:10.160> basic<00:03:10.549> it

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
knots on it but and that is how basic it

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:22.000 
knots on it but and that is how basic it
is<00:03:10.750> but<00:03:11.750> it<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:12.140> works<00:03:20.410> cinder<00:03:21.410> cones<00:03:21.769> are<00:03:21.920> the

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
is but it it works cinder cones are the

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.990 
is but it it works cinder cones are the
most<00:03:22.220> attacks<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:26.090> go<00:03:26.269> it<00:03:26.870> was<00:03:26.989> right<00:03:28.000> got

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
most attacks that go it was right got

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.729 
most attacks that go it was right got
you<00:03:29.299> know<00:03:29.420> we've<00:03:29.630> got<00:03:29.810> varied<00:03:30.230> equipment<00:03:30.590> and

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
you know we've got varied equipment and

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.979 
you know we've got varied equipment and
we've<00:03:30.950> got<00:03:31.639> a<00:03:31.970> lot<00:03:32.359> of<00:03:32.389> different<00:03:32.690> ways<00:03:32.810> of

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
we've got a lot of different ways of

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.860 
we've got a lot of different ways of
using<00:03:33.019> it<00:03:34.030> equipment<00:03:35.030> over<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:35.420> years<00:03:35.569> again

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
using it equipment over the years again

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.530 
using it equipment over the years again
is<00:03:36.109> really<00:03:36.859> come<00:03:37.310> up<00:03:37.430> Lots<00:03:37.880> we've<00:03:38.180> got<00:03:38.359> them

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
is really come up Lots we've got them

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.349 
is really come up Lots we've got them
you<00:03:39.319> know<00:03:39.350> there's<00:03:39.859> specific<00:03:40.549> equipment<00:03:41.060> for

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
you know there's specific equipment for

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.539 
you know there's specific equipment for
specific<00:03:41.750> instance<00:03:42.079> flooding<00:03:42.829> again<00:03:42.950> because

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
specific instance flooding again because

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:44.949 
specific instance flooding again because
we<00:03:43.639> weren't<00:03:43.790> funded<00:03:44.030> for<00:03:44.209> flooding<00:03:44.450> up<00:03:44.660> until

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
we weren't funded for flooding up until

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.990 
we weren't funded for flooding up until
I<00:03:44.989> think<00:03:45.079> last<00:03:45.440> year<00:03:45.739> so<00:03:46.310> that's<00:03:46.670> up<00:03:46.880> and

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
I think last year so that's up and

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.550 
I think last year so that's up and
coming<00:03:47.090> as<00:03:47.389> well<00:03:47.569> and<00:03:47.870> we're<00:03:47.989> getting<00:03:48.170> formal

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
coming as well and we're getting formal

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.210 
coming as well and we're getting formal
stuff<00:03:49.040> for<00:03:49.579> that

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.220 

for<00:03:54.220> some<00:03:54.370> hoes<00:03:54.550> inflation<00:03:55.120> stuff<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.900> fulfill

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
for some hoes inflation stuff to fulfill

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.089 
for some hoes inflation stuff to fulfill
us<00:03:56.319> so<00:03:56.650> sort<00:03:56.950> of<00:03:56.980> a<00:03:57.160> fall<00:03:57.940> in<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.180> river<00:03:59.099> flows

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
us so sort of a fall in the river flows

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.559 
us so sort of a fall in the river flows
push<00:04:00.610> it<00:04:00.760> out<00:04:00.849> to<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.120> making<00:04:01.420> rat<00:04:01.599> hole<00:04:01.810> bit

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
push it out to the making rat hole bit

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.350 
push it out to the making rat hole bit
just<00:04:04.569> want<00:04:04.810> to<00:04:04.900> simulate<00:04:05.730> certain<00:04:06.730> scenario

just want to simulate certain scenario

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.759 
just want to simulate certain scenario
that<00:04:08.230> this<00:04:08.530> big<00:04:08.739> is<00:04:08.860> a<00:04:08.980> breach<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:11.260> down<00:04:11.470> below

yeah but once a nice one see jobs if

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.140 
yeah but once a nice one see jobs if
they're<00:04:38.560> helping<00:04:38.919> on<00:04:39.070> today<00:04:39.340> and<00:04:39.520> he<00:04:39.610> jobs

they're helping on today and he jobs

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.629 
they're helping on today and he jobs
they<00:04:41.080> could<00:04:41.139> they<00:04:41.650> could<00:04:41.680> come<00:04:42.070> out<00:04:42.220> because

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
they could they could come out because

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:59.169 
they could they could come out because

00:04:59.169 --> 00:04:59.179 

00:04:59.179 --> 00:05:02.329 

the<00:05:00.179> cashew<00:05:00.389> will<00:05:00.659> come<00:05:00.899> in<00:05:01.080> for<00:05:01.769> each<00:05:02.069> style

00:05:02.329 --> 00:05:02.339 
the cashew will come in for each style

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:04.639 
the cashew will come in for each style
flat<00:05:02.729> here<00:05:02.969> I'm<00:05:03.689> sure<00:05:03.869> you<00:05:03.989> first<00:05:04.229> drop<00:05:04.469> in

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:04.649
