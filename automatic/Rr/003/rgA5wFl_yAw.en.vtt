00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.919

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:25.519

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.080

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.850

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.870
 the world's biggest musical in ruins 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.760
 a bit like he says he really wants to go 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.820
 I wanted to go with a certain person 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.379

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.370
 I was thinking you can't do yourself 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.840
 panic whenever 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.450
 try to show your feelings to 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.369
 nick red purple but stronger than me but 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.229
 what does it mean you are a female and a 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.630
 male is normal to be stronger than 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.150
 I mean panic stronger than me 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.700
 viola tries to understand so you won't help me 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.979

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.940
 pure negative energy wanted energy

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.000
 notice I was already tried yoga 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.800
 stuck cross-legged for a 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.200
 day ok then you could try with i 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.600

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.070
 the question of sciences then miss e 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.479
 done all the language and I have 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.610
 started saying meaningless words 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.410
 sorry because I'm afraid you leave me too 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:04.810
 concentrating will give me an idea 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:06.670
 drawing fiat managers and maybe the universe 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.850
 believing certain things the nyt is not simple 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.959
 how they explain it transfers it to how 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.970
 write a song 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.940
 in short, something I know how to do better 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.510
 bad son 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.280
 you don't like living the song not 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.910
 seemed so obsessed with writing one 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.470
 song found the voice mackie 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.250
 the energy of the universe spoke to me 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:34.860
 he told me to communicate cornetto you have to 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:37.050

 idea then I'm going to write it and you 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.770
 meanwhile he tries to throw out some 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:46.280
 energy because I know your head is born 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.280
 of energy 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.830
 So what do you think best in 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.239

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.879

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.470
 what do you feel for him but this is it 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:05.420

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.700

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.799

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.069

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.510
 I think of something useful while loose 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:45.340
 closes his eyes and thinks of something that 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.340
 you like something I like 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.180
 nothing just links to something that is not 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.060
 knicks and we're not at the head 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.220
 then think of a big green lawn there 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.769
 the little flowers are so many balloons 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.579
 colorful children running on the lawn 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:05.730

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.380

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.729
