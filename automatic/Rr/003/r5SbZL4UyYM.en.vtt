00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
your breath and as soon as you you know

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.620 
your breath and as soon as you you know
shoot<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.530> first<00:01:19.770> bullet<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.390> sniper

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
shoot that first bullet that the sniper

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.020 
shoot that first bullet that the sniper
scope<00:01:21.930> starts<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.470> sway<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.340> if<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.670> turn<00:01:23.880> that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
scope starts to sway so if you turn that

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.999 
scope starts to sway so if you turn that
you<00:01:24.150> know<00:01:24.270> scope<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> scar<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.369> a<00:01:27.770> ACR<00:01:28.770> or

you know scope with a scar or a ACR or
anything<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.430> at<00:01:29.700> automatic<00:01:30.180> weapon

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
anything like that at automatic weapon

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.929 
anything like that at automatic weapon
it<00:01:30.840> does<00:01:31.290> not<00:01:31.439> work<00:01:31.740> whatsoever<00:01:32.369> because<00:01:32.700> that

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
it does not work whatsoever because that

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.060 
it does not work whatsoever because that
first<00:01:33.180> bullet<00:01:33.420> will<00:01:33.630> hit<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:34.409> it's<00:01:34.590> not<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> one

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
first bullet will hit but it's not a one

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.620 
first bullet will hit but it's not a one
shot<00:01:35.250> kill<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.880> rest<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.240> bullets<00:01:36.540> are

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
shot kill so the rest of the bullets are

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.370 
shot kill so the rest of the bullets are
it'll<00:01:37.170> start<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.590> sway<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.009> start<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:39.170> it<00:01:40.170> was

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
it'll start to sway and start to it was

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.649 
it'll start to sway and start to it was
such<00:01:40.619> start<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.159> go<00:01:41.250> everywhere<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.119> do<00:01:42.420> not

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
such start to go everywhere so I do not

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.350 
such start to go everywhere so I do not
like<00:01:42.920> infrared<00:01:43.920> scopes<00:01:44.310> on<00:01:44.549> assault<00:01:45.000> rifles

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
like infrared scopes on assault rifles

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.030 
like infrared scopes on assault rifles
but<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.899> try<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.110> out<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.649> works<00:01:46.890> pretty

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
but if you try this out it works pretty

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.370 
but if you try this out it works pretty
