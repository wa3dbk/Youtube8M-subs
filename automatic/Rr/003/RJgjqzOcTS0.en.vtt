 game of goldman 2 and we are with a 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.959
 new unlocking of vehicles for 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:16.170
 guys for this unlocking we have to 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.970
 come to the police station 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.369

 over here we have the wayne tower 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.250
 and we're going to take it as a point of 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.920
 reference we have to come flying by 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.280
 here 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.470
 and here will be the vehicle that we are going 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.350
 to unblock in this case is a 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.910
 water vehicle 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.910
 it's very good here we have 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.930
 the vehicle we were looking for so 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.930
 what are we going for him 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.740
 lets try 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:59.340
 approach him little by little 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.440

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.770
 this is the penguin's submarine and 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.530
 we can buy it for 150 thousand coins 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.740
 or lego pieces 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.350
 guys so let's go ride in the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.320
 penguin submarine 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.080
 well there you have it 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.030
 and what we have in front of us 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:27.150
 It is a small circuit of coins 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.320
 where at the end we find it as 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.540
 prize a brick of the golden lego 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.990
 we have to go through the cones these of 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.990
 Orange 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.500
 very well 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.830
 We do not have to skip any because 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.920
 we would have to start over if 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.660

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.030

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.130
 arriving at the end and in this way 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.140
 they're going to get an ego brick 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.270
