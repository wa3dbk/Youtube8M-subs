for space are really our needs is a

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.040 
for space are really our needs is a
classroom<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.259> has<00:01:43.440> more<00:01:44.899> elements<00:01:45.899> that

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
that means passive solar gain we talk a

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.210 
that means passive solar gain we talk a
lot<00:01:50.100> about<00:01:50.690> the<00:01:51.690> design<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.380> houses<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.130> of

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
architecture as we go through our

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.870 
architecture as we go through our
curriculum<00:01:55.319> throughout<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.039> year<00:01:56.220> energy

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
curriculum throughout the year energy

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.730 
curriculum throughout the year energy
was<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.179> huge<00:01:57.569> part<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.899> our<00:01:57.990> study<00:01:58.289> this<00:01:58.500> year
