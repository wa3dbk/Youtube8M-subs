of that before so I'm gonna kind of look

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.190 
of that before so I'm gonna kind of look
around<00:06:08.080> because<00:06:08.560> I<00:06:08.740> can't<00:06:09.160> spawn<00:06:09.460> one<00:06:09.760> I<00:06:10.200> just

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
around because I can't spawn one I just

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.280 
around because I can't spawn one I just
don't<00:06:11.650> know<00:06:11.919> where<00:06:12.400> they<00:06:12.669> could<00:06:12.850> be<00:06:12.880> I<00:06:13.290> it

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.380 
don't know where they could be I it
would<00:06:14.380> probably<00:06:14.590> help<00:06:14.770> if<00:06:14.919> I<00:06:15.040> said

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
would probably help if I said

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.840 
would probably help if I said
too<00:06:15.480> hard<00:06:15.780> or<00:06:15.960> something<00:06:16.700> maybe<00:06:17.700> I<00:06:17.790> could

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
too hard or something maybe I could

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.510 
too hard or something maybe I could
spawn<00:06:18.570> one<00:06:18.780> in<00:06:18.960> the<00:06:19.080> spawner<00:06:19.380> GUI<00:06:19.860> mode<00:06:20.190> we'll

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
spawn one in the spawner GUI mode we'll

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.690 
spawn one in the spawner GUI mode we'll
try<00:06:20.760> that<00:06:20.790> out<00:06:20.970> globe<00:06:21.300> mod<00:06:21.540> options<00:06:22.020> and<00:06:22.700> spawn

try that out globe mod options and spawn

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.210 
try that out globe mod options and spawn

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
settings no not spawn settings if we got

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.390 
settings no not spawn settings if we got
to<00:06:26.310> do<00:06:26.370> with<00:06:26.400> insta<00:06:26.850> spawner<00:06:27.150> so<00:06:28.020> that<00:06:28.980> would

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
to do with insta spawner so that would

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.200 
to do with insta spawner so that would
be<00:06:29.430> a<00:06:29.610> n<00:06:30.000> for<00:06:30.720> a<00:06:30.750> nether<00:06:31.080> ostrich<00:06:32.150> wouldn't<00:06:33.150> it

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
be a n for a nether ostrich wouldn't it

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.040 
be a n for a nether ostrich wouldn't it
it<00:06:33.780> would<00:06:34.430> if<00:06:35.430> there<00:06:36.270> was<00:06:36.390> an<00:06:36.480> ostrich<00:06:36.840> back

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
it would if there was an ostrich back

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.470 
it would if there was an ostrich back
there<00:06:37.260> but<00:06:37.350> there<00:06:37.470> was<00:06:37.590> no<00:06:37.680> nether<00:06:37.950> ostrich<00:06:38.480> so

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:39.480 
there but there was no nether ostrich so

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.140 
there but there was no nether ostrich so
that's<00:06:39.900> kind<00:06:40.200> of<00:06:40.260> weird<00:06:40.440> you<00:06:41.370> obviously<00:06:41.940> can't

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
that's kind of weird you obviously can't

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:47.690 
that's kind of weird you obviously can't
spawn<00:06:42.510> one<00:06:42.780> yet<00:06:42.990> and<00:06:44.120> I<00:06:45.120> don't<00:06:45.240> think<00:06:46.140> I<00:06:46.710> can

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:47.700 
spawn one yet and I don't think I can

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.350 
spawn one yet and I don't think I can
