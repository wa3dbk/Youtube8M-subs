00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.570
 good is martí bikers today we are here 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.820
 to present the dainese chrono suit 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.369
 divisible of two stones 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.450
 the dainese chrono divisible suit of two 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.980
 pieces is a range entry 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.250
 quality-price is very good we can 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.289
 point out basically how do you see 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.960
 aesthetic level is very well designed 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.150
 because with the logo the colors look like this 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.100
 quite and above all, good at level 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.760
 of protection is a range entry 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.229
 but with enough technique not because 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.870
 when you see here I already have the 

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:45.120
 aluminum protections in the area of 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.030
 the shoulders that are always mounted 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.220
 on a fairly novel protection 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.290
 that is developing dainese that is 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.510
 call bronze and vanessa you have an example 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.830
 of pro 6 the next would be this this is not 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.440
 you see but it is what comes mounted 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.110
 right here under the plate is of 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.979
 aluminum and it's quite a protection and 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.780
 normative because it is able to absorb 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:10.220
 very well you see the impacts because it is 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.520
 formed by small hexagons 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.160
 a good material quite resistant 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.780
 but the best thing about this material is that it's 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.310
 very adaptable so then good if 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.160
 you have to make moves on top of 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.410
 the motorcycle etcetera the protection is 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.780
 it's still pretty good and it's tested in 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.630
 case of impact in case of abrasion and 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.580
 can give more or less the same service 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.140
 so the typical protection 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.060
 rigid to which we are accustomed 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.690
 both in Dainese and in other brands 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.390
 another novelty that brings this suit is 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.820
 micro elastic the micro elastic is 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.820
 found in this costume in the area of 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.990
 back this what's the use are insects 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:55.130
 elastic that are under the leather that 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:59.270
 allows and then the leather allows that 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.670
 have a higher density has a double 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.950
 function because it is also more resistant 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.890
 to abrasion that a suit that does not wear 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:15.150
 this system because of course when 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:17.970
 and drag in a fall touch the micro 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.760
 elastic first and it's not leather is let's say 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.610
 as if we took and piece of leather 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.580
 we did so we would do it 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.950
 simple get a double and then by 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.390
 under this double there is elastic that is 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.920
 what he said to vanessa as a kind 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.470
 that speaks elastic that allows you 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.450
 well the movement and especially if 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.880
 of fall what would drag by the 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.950
 then it's the double then 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.040
 what we get then the typical 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.800
 dragged you have all this scraped 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.840
 and that is boring and so you avoid it because 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.209
 what is skimming are the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.620
 folds they have as they were double and 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.300
 what is being spent is double leather 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.340
 and what is below will not be until 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.110
 then urban even if you have multiple 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.290
 falls is a suit that in principle 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.200
 have a long enough life we ​​could 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.510
 say good is a valid good suit 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.900
 for any type of motorcycle racing bike 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.580
 motorcycle tourism does not carry hump or that 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.560
 when it also happens a little 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.310
 unnoticed you will also see that not only 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.230
 there is this color 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.870
 taken from blue as a representative color 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.840
 but well there the green there the black and 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.849
 the white and the red present was 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.220
 pretty well you can see it in our 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.500
 web if you want I can sit in the 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.840
 motorbike and so it's worth that explained a little 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.150
 because the theme of kevlar elastics 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.519
 and from the position in my hands my coconut is 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.220
 a suit that adapts very well to 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.519
 motorcycle positions thanks to their 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.769
 elastic and etxarte we can find 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.860
 behind the shoulder it is important to talk 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:49.140
 of elastic biacs is already a project that 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.870
 they call the Italians a patent 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.390
 is an elastic that we say that flexes 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.489
 towards forward but that is also 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.250
 able to flex from top to bottom by 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.410
 that 's what we owed hearing 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.049
 this elastic we also return it to 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.440
 find in the part of the pants for 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:11.580
 a more or less racing position and 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.020
 also above the knee for a 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.780
 bending more or less 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.329
 racing 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.340
 in principle that's all little more 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.190
 we can explain this deal and as already 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.440
 we have said it is a range entry 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.600
 just tell you, well, as we say in 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.700
 all our videos that the price that 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.830
 you will see on our website this costume is 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.750
 the price that dainese recommends us is 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.639
 the price that the manufacturer recommends and 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.770
 we try to respect it can be 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.320
 that on the internet then on another website 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.760
 you see it a little cheaper the only thing 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.440
 that we ask since you are seeing 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.020
 this video is that you do not inform yourself of that 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.240
 price and we commit to the 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.320
 match that cheaper price or even 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.050
 to get over it just over a lot more bikers 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:05:02.649
 Thank you 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:05:02.649
