00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.560
 good morning i'm elizabeth s have done 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.830
 Today we want to explain how to perform 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.470
 this cushion with only four seams and 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.660
 without twisting zippers or anything is from a 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.789
 very simple way ahead 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.760
 we will put a cloth and from behind 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.930
 we will place two of the crusades that will be 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.930
 the closure of the cushion 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.010
 to make this cushion we will need 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.790
 two pieces 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:40.160
 of this measure to cover all the cushion 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.220
 two pieces because because in this case 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.700
 the figures have an address if 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.870
 we would not cut out we would put the 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.980
 dolls to the right however here we 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.980
 they would appear inside out 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.680
 for the same reason we should cut it 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.680
 and so they will appear 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.220
 the 2 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.880
 with the correct address and then 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.650
 we will need 30 centimeters of a cloth 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.150
 that combines with rope 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.480
 The first thing we will do is unite 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.310
 these two fabrics right against the 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.650
 straight 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.740
 and in the same direction 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.100
 the dolls both up and 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.020
 we will make a seam in the margin 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.700
 higher or lower is the same is 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.810
 indistinct 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.000
 to 0.5 centimeters 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.850
 well now we have joined the two 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.399
 fabrics as we said right against 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.860
 right we have said that a margin 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.140
 from 0-5 you can leave a centimeter of 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.230
 margin maybe better and then with the 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.410
 another piece of cloth 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.130
 we have united the same right against 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.590
 right with one of the fabrics 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.810
 so that it stays with one of the fabrics 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.470
 also in the upper margin to a 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.820
 centimeter in this way we get a 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.240
 long strip 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.090
 then in both margins we have made a 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.459
 We have folded the small hem 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.590
 piece then we have doubled again and 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.800
 we have made a seam in both 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.640
 sides both here and here and we can 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.860
 go to do the cushion assembly 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.250
 we will fold the first fabric the first 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.620
 fabric will be what will be seen that will be in 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.630
 the back of the cushion then 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.560
 we place 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.560
 the other fabric 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.580
 online and now it will be as simple as 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.210
 perform a straight seam here on the 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.240
 right margin and a straight seam on the 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.800
 left margin the same seams a 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.490
 a centimeter like we have done 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.190
 previously 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:02.290
 we already have the cushion we have made 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:08.710
 Both lateral seams are ready 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:10.790
 open with the opening we turn the cushion 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.879
 we get it right 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.530
 the tips that we can then out we can 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.630
 help 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:23.050
 with rounded scissors with a 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:25.580
 pen here yes that everyone 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.360
 how do you do better 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.360
 and once 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.989
 is rotated the plans we will see and already 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.220
 we have the cover this is the part 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.470
 later 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.200
 as we said this was the part that 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.710
 I was touching the right side of the cloth 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.660
 therefore it is the one that will be seen and this is the 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.560
 front 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.240
 and now what would only be ironed what 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.880
 We hope you liked it and that you 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.920
 be of great help, thank you very much 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.900

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:05.920
