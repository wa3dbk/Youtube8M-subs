ghetto they've judged me in the work
that<00:01:09.770> I<00:01:10.009> do<00:01:10.220> I<00:01:10.460> do<00:01:10.759> think<00:01:10.789> it's<00:01:11.119> having

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
that I do I do think it's having

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.749 
that I do I do think it's having
specific<00:01:11.899> energy<00:01:12.410> so<00:01:12.619> I<00:01:12.649> think<00:01:12.800> I'd<00:01:13.160> encourage

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
specific energy so I think I'd encourage

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:24.540 
specific energy so I think I'd encourage
kids<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:14.300> get<00:01:14.539> both

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.040 

of<00:01:25.550> course<00:01:25.790> is<00:01:25.940> our<00:01:26.270> caffeine-free<00:01:26.840> well

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
of course is our caffeine-free well

courses really good time enjoying it so
far<00:01:47.090> I've<00:01:47.660> really<00:01:47.990> enhanced<00:01:48.500> our<00:01:48.650> maths<00:01:48.979> and

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
far I've really enhanced our maths and

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.920 
far I've really enhanced our maths and
physics<00:01:49.280> skills<00:01:49.760> as<00:01:49.970> well<00:01:50.090> as<00:01:50.150> my<00:01:50.360> hand<00:01:50.630> skills

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
physics skills as well as my hand skills

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.780 
physics skills as well as my hand skills
while<00:01:51.500> they<00:01:51.619> were<00:01:51.740> learning<00:01:51.890> about<00:01:52.010> pumps<00:01:52.580> and

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
while they were learning about pumps and

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.760 
while they were learning about pumps and
the<00:01:53.030> chemical<00:01:53.390> devices<00:01:53.810> would<00:01:53.990> be<00:01:54.229> good<00:01:54.650> in

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
the chemical devices would be good in

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.230 
the chemical devices would be good in
our<00:01:54.890> Spade<00:01:55.340> like<00:01:55.490> you're<00:01:55.640> learning<00:01:55.910> more<00:01:56.060> than

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
our Spade like you're learning more than

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.240 
our Spade like you're learning more than
electrical<00:01:56.750> there's<00:01:57.229> been<00:01:57.680> a<00:01:57.710> very<00:01:57.979> good

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
electrical there's been a very good

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.680 
electrical there's been a very good
development<00:01:58.490> for<00:01:58.880> them<00:01:59.030> so<00:01:59.210> when<00:01:59.330> I<00:01:59.360> get<00:01:59.540> in

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
development for them so when I get in
