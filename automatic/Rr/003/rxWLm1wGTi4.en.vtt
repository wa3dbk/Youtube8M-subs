demonstrate my metering technique this

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.010 
demonstrate my metering technique this
is<00:00:20.310> nothing<00:00:20.609> revolutionary<00:00:20.730> it's<00:00:21.480> kind<00:00:21.990> of

textbook in a way but I now I'm
confident<00:00:25.140> enough<00:00:25.260> with<00:00:25.439> my<00:00:25.920> metering

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
confident enough with my metering

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.009 
confident enough with my metering
technique<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.480> share<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.779> with<00:00:27.869> other

558 I've been using this one for a few
years<00:00:33.420> now<00:00:33.530> works<00:00:34.530> great<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.219> modern

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
years now works great the modern

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.950 
years now works great the modern
equivalent<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.329> psychotic<00:00:36.630> range

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
equivalent to this in a psychotic range

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.830 
equivalent to this in a psychotic range
is<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> 758<00:00:38.010> they're<00:00:38.309> basically<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.879> same<00:00:39.090> they

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
is a 758 they're basically the same they

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.840 
is a 758 they're basically the same they
both<00:00:40.050> have<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.590> incident<00:00:41.129> light<00:00:41.280> meter<00:00:41.489> which

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
both have the incident light meter which

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.090 
both have the incident light meter which
is<00:00:41.879> great<00:00:42.180> for<00:00:42.390> I'm<00:00:42.930> shooting<00:00:43.350> picture<00:00:43.980> like

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
is great for I'm shooting picture like

meter reading the spot meter however is

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.580 
meter reading the spot meter however is
a<00:00:51.239> bit<00:00:51.329> more<00:00:51.570> important<00:00:52.079> for<00:00:52.170> landscape

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
a bit more important for landscape

through there and meter is seen at a
distance<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.390> great<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:57.840> sunrise

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
distance this is great for sunrise

on the principle of if you pointed

something<00:01:06.960> which<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.260> medium<00:01:07.590> grey<00:01:07.830> you're

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
something which is medium grey you're

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.609 
something which is medium grey you're
going<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.060> good<00:01:09.270> exposure<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.900> nature

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
going to have a good exposure in nature

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.950 
going to have a good exposure in nature
we<00:01:10.770> don't<00:01:10.920> always<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.430> medium<00:01:11.790> grey<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
we don't always have medium grey the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.740 
we don't always have medium grey the
easiest<00:01:13.380> way<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:14.010> really<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.790> take<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> meter

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
easiest way is really to take a meter

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.570 
easiest way is really to take a meter
reading<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> darkest<00:01:16.860> subject<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.490> you

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
reading of the darkest subject that you

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.880 
reading of the darkest subject that you
want<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.790> maintain<00:01:17.880> detail<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.600> log<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.619> into

want to maintain detail in log that into

want to maintain detail in log that into
the<00:01:19.979> memory<00:01:20.250> also<00:01:20.909> meter<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.930> brightest

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
the memory also meter the brightest

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.560 
the memory also meter the brightest
subject<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.920> want<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.369> maintain<00:01:23.729> detail<00:01:24.240> and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
subject you want to maintain detail and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.870 
subject you want to maintain detail and
log<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.990> into<00:01:25.320> memory<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:26.670> use<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
log that into memory I can then use a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.819 
log that into memory I can then use a
meter<00:01:27.240> here<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:28.020> average<00:01:28.500> those<00:01:28.680> two

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
meter here to average those two

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.319 
meter here to average those two
functions<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.610> going<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.790> give<00:01:29.970> me<00:01:30.150> a

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
functions and it's going to give me a

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.910 
functions and it's going to give me a
good<00:01:30.659> meeting<00:01:30.900> which<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.229> going<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.590> expose

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
good meeting which is going to expose

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.010 
good meeting which is going to expose
right<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.850> middle<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.240> both<00:01:33.600> settings

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
right in the middle of both settings

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.170 
right in the middle of both settings
this<00:01:34.979> may<00:01:35.189> not<00:01:35.369> always<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> accurate

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
this may not always be the accurate

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.700 
this may not always be the accurate
meter<00:01:36.360> reading<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> really<00:01:37.590> good

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710
