00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.369

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.960
 tomato but raised with a little bit of 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.750
 spicy you'll see it's very 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.099
 simple all the steps in video then 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.689
 before starting this recipe we go 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.520
 already cook the penne so in a 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.500
 large volume of salt water wanted to dive 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.690
 and you cook them the indicated otan 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.910
 while it's cooking we'll take care of it 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.649
 from the sauce preparation so you 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.300
 take care a big jumper is a 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.699
 large stove you will heat 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.710
 on a medium-high heat of olive oil 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.620
 you will then add a spoon 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.749
 Coffee 2 chili paste so we'll 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.820
 simmer this puree of peppers 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:52.800
 for 10 15 seconds so on a fire 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.440
 lively way and then you will be able to 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.649
 add the chopped onions 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.690
 you mix well the preparation you 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.089
 will bring back this mixture for at 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.400
 about 3 4 minutes so always without 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.740
 a really brisk fire when the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.520
 onions have become more tender a little 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.380
 translucent 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.060
 there you will be able to add 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.740
 point at you so you cut him 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.420
 then in big pieces or a little like 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.490
 you want it and you're fine 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.290
 to mix you cook everything 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.060
 for three four minutes it's going pretty 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.340
 quickly it is necessary that the pancetta jump when 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.990
 even a little bit cooked 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.070
 once the tip at ta is cooked 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.329
 we see that she listens because she has 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.100
 changed color go higher if 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.049
 translucent so when it is ready 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.420
 you will add the tomato pulp 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.890
 you mix then we add that 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.939

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.890

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.200
 it's a mixture of red peppers 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.460
 green peppers and chilies so you 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.439
 look at the composition you need 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.240

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.829
 united they call it paper flex so 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.079
 that's giving you an indication 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.439
 then you will add parmesan 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.020
 fresh we put the angel back and we go 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.659
