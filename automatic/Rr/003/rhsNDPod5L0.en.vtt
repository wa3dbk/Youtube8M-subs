in<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:17.430> presentation<00:00:17.880> we're<00:00:18.180> going<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.330> see

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
in this presentation we're going to see

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.359 
in this presentation we're going to see
two<00:00:18.720> examples<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.350> editable<00:00:19.770> motion<00:00:20.130> trails

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
two examples of editable motion trails

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.310 
two examples of editable motion trails
motion<00:00:21.330> trails<00:00:21.540> provide<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.900> visual

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
motion trails provide a visual

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.050 
motion trails provide a visual
representation<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:23.100> keys<00:00:23.340> right<00:00:23.700> around<00:00:23.910> your

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
representation of keys right around your

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.000 
representation of keys right around your
animated<00:00:24.390> models<00:00:24.869> letting<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.710> adjust

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
animated models letting you adjust

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.010 
animated models letting you adjust
timing<00:00:26.490> keys<00:00:26.790> canyon<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.570> position<00:00:27.930> of

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
timing keys canyon and position of

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.230 
timing keys canyon and position of
animation<00:00:28.470> directly<00:00:28.950> in<00:00:29.009> the<00:00:29.099> viewport<00:00:29.580> when

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
animation directly in the viewport when

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.850 
animation directly in the viewport when
we<00:00:30.330> playback<00:00:30.660> our<00:00:30.810> animation<00:00:31.290> you'll<00:00:31.710> see

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
we playback our animation you'll see

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.110 
we playback our animation you'll see
that<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.070> have<00:00:32.189> some<00:00:32.310> motion<00:00:32.489> capture<00:00:32.940> data

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
that we have some motion capture data

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.880 
that we have some motion capture data
that's<00:00:33.600> been<00:00:33.750> applied<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> human<00:00:34.560> eye<00:00:34.650> cave

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
that's been applied to a human eye cave

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.680 
that's been applied to a human eye cave
rig<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.340> we<00:00:35.579> want<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.880> use<00:00:36.000> editable<00:00:36.390> motion

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
rig and we want to use editable motion

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.360 
rig and we want to use editable motion
trails<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.320> help<00:00:37.470> us<00:00:37.560> fix<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:37.950> foot<00:00:38.220> that

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
trails to help us fix this foot that

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.220 
trails to help us fix this foot that
passes<00:00:38.730> through<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> hovercraft<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
passes through the hovercraft so the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.780 
passes through the hovercraft so the
first<00:00:40.500> thing<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.710> I'm<00:00:40.860> going<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.399> just

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
first thing that I'm going to do is just

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.760 
first thing that I'm going to do is just
grab<00:00:41.970> the<00:00:42.300> ika<00:00:42.690> handle<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.380> foot<00:00:43.649> and

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
grab the ika handle on this foot and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.680 
grab the ika handle on this foot and
create<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> new<00:00:44.520> animation<00:00:44.670> layer<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.600> that

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
create a new animation layer so that

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.880 
create a new animation layer so that
whatever<00:00:45.960> changes<00:00:46.320> we<00:00:46.380> make<00:00:46.649> will<00:00:46.800> be

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
whatever changes we make will be

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.099 
whatever changes we make will be
non-destructive<00:00:47.730> now<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.449> can<00:00:48.690> create<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
non-destructive now we can create the

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:50.630 
non-destructive now we can create the
editable<00:00:49.350> motion<00:00:49.769> trail<00:00:49.980> well<00:00:50.489> bring<00:00:50.609> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
editable motion trail well bring the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.729 
editable motion trail well bring the
options<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.269> for<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:52.170> want<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.440> set<00:00:52.620> my

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
options up for this and I want to set my

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.979 
options up for this and I want to set my
pre<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.160> post<00:00:53.340> frames<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> value<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.149> 50<00:00:54.539> so

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
pre and post frames to a value of 50 so

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.389 
pre and post frames to a value of 50 so
this<00:00:55.170> motion<00:00:55.350> trailer<00:00:55.679> will<00:00:55.769> be<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:56.070> screen

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
this motion trailer will be on screen

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.220 
this motion trailer will be on screen
around<00:00:56.670> my<00:00:56.969> character<00:00:57.329> for<00:00:57.510> basically<00:00:57.809> 100

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
around my character for basically 100

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.110 
around my character for basically 100
frames<00:00:58.500> will<00:00:59.160> also<00:00:59.429> increase<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.879> trail

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
frames will also increase the trail

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.669 
frames will also increase the trail
thickness<00:01:00.600> or<00:01:00.780> something<00:01:01.050> kind<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.320> fat<00:01:01.530> like

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
thickness or something kind of fat like

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.349 
thickness or something kind of fat like
a<00:01:01.739> value<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.160> 4<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.609> we'll<00:01:03.059> go<00:01:03.149> ahead<00:01:03.210> and

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
a value of 4 and we'll go ahead and

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.509 
a value of 4 and we'll go ahead and
create<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.710> now<00:01:04.830> as<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.010> scrub<00:01:05.250> through<00:01:05.400> my

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
create it so now as I scrub through my

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.980 
create it so now as I scrub through my
time<00:01:05.760> slider<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.300> see<00:01:06.480> that<00:01:06.630> editable

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
time slider you can see that editable

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.180 
time slider you can see that editable
motion<00:01:07.290> trade-offs<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.650> are<00:01:07.740> bleeding<00:01:08.100> on

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
motion trade-offs that are bleeding on

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.220 
motion trade-offs that are bleeding on
and<00:01:08.310> off<00:01:08.430> based<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.909> my<00:01:09.030> current<00:01:09.270> frame<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.870> we

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
and off based on my current frame and we

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.990 
and off based on my current frame and we
get<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.470> really<00:01:10.830> clear<00:01:11.130> representation<00:01:11.580> as

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
get this really clear representation as

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.760 
get this really clear representation as
to<00:01:12.090> where<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.360> foots<00:01:12.630> going<00:01:12.870> you<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.680> also

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
to where that foots going you can also

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.350 
to where that foots going you can also
see<00:01:14.159> all<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.490> subtle<00:01:14.760> detail<00:01:15.120> that<00:01:15.240> that

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
see all the subtle detail that that

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.690 
see all the subtle detail that that
motion<00:01:15.540> capture<00:01:15.990> has<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:17.130> what<00:01:17.280> we<00:01:17.370> want<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.550> do

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
motion capture has so what we want to do

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.399 
motion capture has so what we want to do
is<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:18.000> modify<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.480> slight<00:01:18.810> tweak<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.290> this

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
is just modify a slight tweak of this

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.560 
is just modify a slight tweak of this
foot<00:01:19.650> as<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.860> passes<00:01:20.220> over<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.579> hovercraft<00:01:20.850> so

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
foot as it passes over the hovercraft so

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.060 
foot as it passes over the hovercraft so
we'll<00:01:21.689> set<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.869> keyframe<00:01:22.079> with<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.470> foot<00:01:22.649> lands

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
we'll set a keyframe with the foot lands

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.920 
we'll set a keyframe with the foot lands
we'll<00:01:23.520> rewind<00:01:23.939> our<00:01:24.030> time<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> bit<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.720> where<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
we'll rewind our time a bit to where the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.240 
we'll rewind our time a bit to where the
foot<00:01:25.110> takes<00:01:25.320> off<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.619> set<00:01:25.770> another<00:01:25.979> keyframe

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
foot takes off and set another keyframe

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.010 
foot takes off and set another keyframe
and<00:01:26.729> we'll<00:01:27.060> finish<00:01:27.210> off<00:01:27.509> by<00:01:27.689> setting<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
and we'll finish off by setting the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.719 
and we'll finish off by setting the
third<00:01:28.229> keyframe<00:01:28.680> right<00:01:28.860> where<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.399> foots

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
third keyframe right where that foots

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.700 
third keyframe right where that foots
passing<00:01:30.149> through<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.450> hovercraft<00:01:30.720> as<00:01:31.590> I

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
passing through the hovercraft as I

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.289 
passing through the hovercraft as I
bleed<00:01:31.979> back<00:01:32.159> my<00:01:32.340> animation<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.909> bit<00:01:33.090> here

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
bleed back my animation a bit here

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.789 
bleed back my animation a bit here
you'll<00:01:33.750> see<00:01:33.899> that<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.229> grab<00:01:34.590> those

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
you'll see that I can grab those

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.620 
you'll see that I can grab those
keyframes<00:01:35.310> directly<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:35.969> that<00:01:36.060> motion<00:01:36.240> trail

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
keyframes directly on that motion trail

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.899 
keyframes directly on that motion trail
and<00:01:36.810> begin<00:01:37.320> reposition<00:01:37.890> them<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.250> my<00:01:38.490> viewport

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
and begin reposition them in my viewport

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.429 
and begin reposition them in my viewport
so<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.780> think<00:01:39.930> about<00:01:40.049> what<00:01:40.290> we're<00:01:40.409> doing

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
so if you think about what we're doing

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.319 
so if you think about what we're doing
here<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:40.920> we're<00:01:41.070> just<00:01:41.100> modifying<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.060> dense

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
here is we're just modifying this dense

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.120 
here is we're just modifying this dense
motion<00:01:42.689> capture<00:01:42.990> data<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.560> three<00:01:43.829> simple

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
motion capture data with three simple

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.249 
motion capture data with three simple
keyframes<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.119> editable<00:01:45.420> motion<00:01:45.840> trail<00:01:46.020> lets

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
keyframes the editable motion trail lets

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.840 
keyframes the editable motion trail lets
me<00:01:46.409> see<00:01:46.530> exactly<00:01:47.039> where<00:01:47.189> that's<00:01:47.280> going<00:01:47.579> and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
me see exactly where that's going and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.639 
me see exactly where that's going and
you<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:48.299> see<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.539> we<00:01:48.659> still<00:01:48.960> are<00:01:49.020> preserving

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
you can see that we still are preserving

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.319 
you can see that we still are preserving
all<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:50.219> subtle<00:01:50.490> detail<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.030> motion

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
all that subtle detail that the motion

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.300 
all that subtle detail that the motion
capture<00:01:51.509> has<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.740> other<00:01:52.829> thing<00:01:53.070> that's<00:01:53.159> kind

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
capture has the other thing that's kind

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.950 
capture has the other thing that's kind
of<00:01:53.399> cool<00:01:53.579> about<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.180> because<00:01:54.390> we've<00:01:54.719> done

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
of cool about this is because we've done

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.779 
of cool about this is because we've done
this<00:01:55.049> on<00:01:55.200> an<00:01:55.289> animation<00:01:55.649> layer<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.159> can<00:01:56.549> turn<00:01:56.759> on

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
this on an animation layer I can turn on

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.639 
this on an animation layer I can turn on
and<00:01:57.060> off<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.270> effect<00:01:57.600> simply<00:01:58.110> by<00:01:58.320> enabling

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
and off the effect simply by enabling

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.099 
and off the effect simply by enabling
the<00:01:58.920> layer<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.399> can<00:01:59.789> also<00:02:00.149> start<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.600> adjust<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109 
the layer I can also start to adjust the

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:02.330 
the layer I can also start to adjust the
weighting<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.619> you'll<00:02:01.890> notice<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.219> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
weighting and you'll notice that the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.130 
weighting and you'll notice that the
editable<00:02:02.640> motion<00:02:03.030> trail<00:02:03.210> respects<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
editable motion trail respects the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.679 
editable motion trail respects the
animation<00:02:04.560> layer<00:02:04.710> weighting<00:02:05.100> properly<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.570> no

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
animation layer weighting properly so no

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.150 
animation layer weighting properly so no
matter<00:02:06.869> what<00:02:07.140> I'm<00:02:07.259> doing<00:02:07.560> I'm<00:02:07.649> always<00:02:07.859> getting

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
matter what I'm doing I'm always getting

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.010 
matter what I'm doing I'm always getting
a<00:02:08.220> nice<00:02:08.430> visual<00:02:09.000> representation<00:02:09.330> as<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.750> where

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
a nice visual representation as to where

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.660 
a nice visual representation as to where
that<00:02:10.170> foots<00:02:10.440> going<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.680> go<00:02:10.800> regardless<00:02:11.190> of

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
that foots going to go regardless of

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.190 
that foots going to go regardless of
what<00:02:11.850> attributes<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.420> have<00:02:12.570> set<00:02:12.870> in<00:02:13.080> my

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
what attributes I have set in my

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.470 
what attributes I have set in my
animation<00:02:13.710> layers<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.940> other<00:02:15.120> thing<00:02:15.360> that's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
animation layers the other thing that's

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.820 
animation layers the other thing that's
really<00:02:15.570> kind<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.110> cool<00:02:16.290> about<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:16.680> is

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
really kind of cool about this is

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.320 
really kind of cool about this is
because<00:02:16.980> we're<00:02:17.310> doing<00:02:17.610> this<00:02:17.700> on<00:02:17.880> top<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.120> a

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
because we're doing this on top of a

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.420 
because we're doing this on top of a
human<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.690> can<00:02:18.750> control<00:02:19.410> rig<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.800> still<00:02:20.310> have

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
human I can control rig I still have

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.980 
human I can control rig I still have
that<00:02:20.520> full<00:02:20.880> power<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.450> human<00:02:21.720> eye<00:02:21.780> case

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
that full power of the human eye case

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.230 
that full power of the human eye case
solver<00:02:22.380> at<00:02:22.530> my<00:02:22.680> disposal<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.730> if<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:23.940> take<00:02:24.120> this

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
solver at my disposal so if I take this

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.910 
solver at my disposal so if I take this
editable<00:02:24.660> motion<00:02:24.960> trail<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.320> push<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.710> back

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
editable motion trail and I push it back

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.140 
editable motion trail and I push it back
to<00:02:26.100> an<00:02:26.190> area<00:02:26.400> where<00:02:26.490> that<00:02:26.640> limb

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
to an area where that limb

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.270 
to an area where that limb
actually<00:02:27.689> make<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.769> just<00:02:28.950> go<00:02:29.040> into<00:02:29.159> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
actually make it I can just go into the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.339 
actually make it I can just go into the
attributes<00:02:29.909> for<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.480> can't<00:02:30.780> handle<00:02:31.049> for

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
attributes for the I can't handle for

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.140 
attributes for the I can't handle for
that<00:02:31.379> leg<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.010> start<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.519> dial<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:32.909> a<00:02:32.970> little

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
that leg and start the dial and a little

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.970 
that leg and start the dial and a little
bit<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.329> pull<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:34.079> let's<00:02:34.319> let<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.650> energy

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
bit of pull so let's let the energy

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.220 
bit of pull so let's let the energy
travel<00:02:35.400> past<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:36.000> body<00:02:36.180> part<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.720> start<00:02:37.140> to

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
travel past the body part and start to

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.050 
travel past the body part and start to
use<00:02:37.409> that<00:02:37.439> full<00:02:37.860> body<00:02:38.040> rig<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.640> we<00:02:38.760> saw<00:02:38.939> in

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
use that full body rig that we saw in

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.000 
use that full body rig that we saw in
the<00:02:39.120> previous<00:02:39.269> demos<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.530> if<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.680> start<00:02:40.920> to

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
the previous demos so if I start to

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.740 
the previous demos so if I start to
increase<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.489> pole<00:02:41.700> value<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.329> can<00:02:42.480> see<00:02:42.599> that

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
increase the pole value you can see that

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.210 
increase the pole value you can see that
my<00:02:42.840> foot<00:02:43.110> has<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.349> ability<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.680> reach<00:02:43.950> past

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
my foot has the ability to reach past

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.490 
my foot has the ability to reach past
that<00:02:44.459> body<00:02:44.700> part<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.180> actually<00:02:45.629> make<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.349> to

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
that body part and actually make it to

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.259 
that body part and actually make it to
that<00:02:46.650> editable<00:02:47.129> motion<00:02:47.430> trail<00:02:47.609> even<00:02:47.879> if<00:02:48.150> it's

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
that editable motion trail even if it's

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.910 
that editable motion trail even if it's
really<00:02:48.569> far<00:02:48.750> back<00:02:48.989> over<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.379> end<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.709> ship

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
really far back over the end of the ship

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.349 
really far back over the end of the ship
obviously<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:51.000> doesn't<00:02:51.150> look<00:02:51.329> that

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
obviously that doesn't look that

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.819 
obviously that doesn't look that
realistic<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.049> we'll<00:02:52.170> just<00:02:52.319> push<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.620> back<00:02:52.799> to

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
realistic so we'll just push it back to

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.220 
realistic so we'll just push it back to
where<00:02:53.129> it<00:02:53.189> sort<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.459> was<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.840> by<00:02:55.019> combining

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
where it sort of was so by combining

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.410 
where it sort of was so by combining
human<00:02:55.829> I<00:02:55.920> came<00:02:56.220> with<00:02:56.430> epidural<00:02:56.849> motion<00:02:57.180> trails

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
human I came with epidural motion trails

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.089 
human I came with epidural motion trails
and<00:02:57.540> animation<00:02:57.989> layers<00:02:58.170> we<00:02:58.590> have<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.739> really

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
and animation layers we have a really

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.949 
and animation layers we have a really
powerful<00:02:59.280> set<00:02:59.700> of<00:02:59.730> tools<00:03:00.030> when<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.659> comes<00:03:00.840> to

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
powerful set of tools when it comes to

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.990 
powerful set of tools when it comes to
manipulating<00:03:01.109> motion<00:03:01.859> capture<00:03:02.159> data<00:03:02.190> inside

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
manipulating motion capture data inside

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.270 
manipulating motion capture data inside
of<00:03:03.120> Maya<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:04.440> next<00:03:04.709> example<00:03:05.099> that<00:03:05.190> we're

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
of Maya the next example that we're

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.920 
of Maya the next example that we're
gonna<00:03:05.370> do<00:03:05.639> is<00:03:05.849> looking<00:03:06.389> at<00:03:06.480> how<00:03:06.569> we<00:03:06.629> can<00:03:06.810> use

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
gonna do is looking at how we can use

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.750 
gonna do is looking at how we can use
editable<00:03:07.290> motion<00:03:07.590> trails<00:03:07.859> on<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.250> spaceship

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
editable motion trails on the spaceship

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.009 
editable motion trails on the spaceship
so<00:03:08.970> let's<00:03:09.120> go<00:03:09.269> ahead<00:03:09.329> and<00:03:09.450> create<00:03:09.629> the<00:03:09.870> motion

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
so let's go ahead and create the motion

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.289 
so let's go ahead and create the motion
trail<00:03:10.260> for<00:03:10.470> this<00:03:10.620> will<00:03:11.519> bring<00:03:11.609> up<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.790> options

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
trail for this will bring up the options

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.210 
trail for this will bring up the options
in<00:03:12.450> this<00:03:12.930> example<00:03:13.409> I<00:03:13.500> don't<00:03:13.560> want<00:03:13.859> to<00:03:13.920> have<00:03:14.010> pre

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
in this example I don't want to have pre

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.470 
in this example I don't want to have pre
and<00:03:14.340> post<00:03:14.489> frames<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.000> want<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.329> motion

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
and post frames so I want the motion

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.330 
and post frames so I want the motion
trail<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.840> be<00:03:15.959> on<00:03:16.170> for<00:03:16.439> my<00:03:16.530> whole<00:03:16.769> time<00:03:16.980> slider

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
trail to be on for my whole time slider

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.160 
trail to be on for my whole time slider
and<00:03:17.579> we'll<00:03:18.299> make<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.569> trail<00:03:18.780> thickness<00:03:19.109> a

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
and we'll make the trail thickness a

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.750 
and we'll make the trail thickness a
little<00:03:19.409> bit<00:03:19.530> less<00:03:19.709> we'll<00:03:20.189> also<00:03:20.370> show<00:03:20.639> the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
little bit less we'll also show the

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.330 
little bit less we'll also show the
frames<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.239> we'll<00:03:21.329> just<00:03:21.450> create<00:03:21.720> that<00:03:22.340> so

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
frames and we'll just create that so

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.949 
frames and we'll just create that so
it's<00:03:23.489> important<00:03:23.879> to<00:03:23.909> realize<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.329> the

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
it's important to realize that the

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.809 
it's important to realize that the
motion<00:03:25.290> trails<00:03:25.500> inside<00:03:25.799> of<00:03:25.920> Maya<00:03:26.129> are<00:03:26.489> just

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
motion trails inside of Maya are just

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.520 
motion trails inside of Maya are just
nodes<00:03:27.060> so<00:03:27.569> any<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.930> attributes<00:03:28.379> that<00:03:28.470> you

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
nodes so any of the attributes that you

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.319 
nodes so any of the attributes that you
set<00:03:28.829> on<00:03:28.859> one<00:03:29.099> motion<00:03:29.310> trail<00:03:29.639> can<00:03:29.909> be<00:03:30.000> unique

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
set on one motion trail can be unique

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.729 
set on one motion trail can be unique
for<00:03:30.569> it<00:03:30.689> so<00:03:30.840> in<00:03:30.959> this<00:03:31.019> example<00:03:31.349> we'll<00:03:31.590> have

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
for it so in this example we'll have

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.099 
for it so in this example we'll have
this<00:03:31.889> guy<00:03:32.099> become<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.430> different<00:03:32.790> color<00:03:33.109> so

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
this guy become a different color so

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.119 
this guy become a different color so
what<00:03:34.260> we're<00:03:34.410> going<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.560> do<00:03:34.769> is<00:03:34.859> we're<00:03:34.980> going<00:03:35.069> to

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.009 
what we're going to do is we're going to
use<00:03:35.370> some<00:03:35.579> of<00:03:35.669> the<00:03:35.760> interactive<00:03:36.180> controls<00:03:36.810> on

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
use some of the interactive controls on

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.539 
use some of the interactive controls on
the<00:03:37.109> emotion<00:03:37.560> trail<00:03:37.799> that<00:03:38.010> we<00:03:38.129> have<00:03:38.340> in<00:03:38.459> the

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
the emotion trail that we have in the

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.520 
the emotion trail that we have in the
viewport<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.389> start<00:03:39.629> adjusting<00:03:40.139> timing

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
viewport to start adjusting timing

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.319 
viewport to start adjusting timing
information<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:41.220> tangent<00:03:41.579> information<00:03:42.120> I'm

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
information and tangent information I'm

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.180 
information and tangent information I'm
going<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.810> bring<00:03:42.930> up<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.109> graph<00:03:43.319> editor<00:03:43.500> not

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
going to bring up the graph editor not

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.470 
going to bring up the graph editor not
because<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:44.549> want<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.819> use<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.239> to

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
because I want to use it to to

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.149 
because I want to use it to to
manipulate<00:03:45.930> this<00:03:46.019> curve<00:03:46.349> I<00:03:46.560> just<00:03:46.949> want<00:03:47.069> to

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
manipulate this curve I just want to

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.189 
manipulate this curve I just want to
have<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.280> up<00:03:47.430> so<00:03:47.579> you<00:03:47.639> can<00:03:47.849> visualize<00:03:48.299> what<00:03:49.079> I'm

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
have it up so you can visualize what I'm

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.750 
have it up so you can visualize what I'm
doing<00:03:49.470> in<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.650> viewport<00:03:50.129> and<00:03:50.159> how<00:03:50.280> it<00:03:50.400> affects

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
doing in the viewport and how it affects

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.309 
doing in the viewport and how it affects
the<00:03:50.909> key<00:03:51.090> frames<00:03:51.389> and<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.629> tangents<00:03:52.079> and<00:03:52.230> the

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
the key frames and the tangents and the

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.990 
the key frames and the tangents and the
actual<00:03:52.620> graph<00:03:52.799> editor<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:53.639> let's<00:03:53.790> go<00:03:53.879> ahead

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
actual graph editor so let's go ahead

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.759 
actual graph editor so let's go ahead
and<00:03:54.090> get<00:03:54.180> that<00:03:54.329> graph<00:03:54.510> editor<00:03:54.690> up<00:03:55.049> and<00:03:55.530> for

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
and get that graph editor up and for

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.140 
and get that graph editor up and for
this<00:03:55.859> example<00:03:56.190> I'm<00:03:56.400> going<00:03:56.549> to<00:03:56.609> switch<00:03:56.819> over<00:03:56.970> to

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
this example I'm going to switch over to

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.180 
this example I'm going to switch over to
out<00:03:57.659> of<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.930> Classic<00:03:58.409> Maya<00:03:58.680> graph<00:03:59.040> editor

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
out of the Classic Maya graph editor

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.729 
out of the Classic Maya graph editor
into<00:03:59.849> the<00:03:59.970> unified<00:04:00.389> graph<00:04:00.659> editor<00:04:00.870> this<00:04:01.530> graph

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
into the unified graph editor this graph

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.199 
into the unified graph editor this graph
editor<00:04:01.889> is<00:04:02.129> consistent<00:04:02.729> across<00:04:02.909> media

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
editor is consistent across media

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.759 
editor is consistent across media
entertainment<00:04:03.449> products<00:04:04.019> so<00:04:04.199> if<00:04:04.319> you<00:04:04.409> work<00:04:04.590> in

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
entertainment products so if you work in

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.559 
entertainment products so if you work in
max<00:04:05.069> or<00:04:05.310> motion<00:04:05.790> builder<00:04:05.909> you'd<00:04:06.359> have<00:04:06.479> the

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
max or motion builder you'd have the

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:07.909 
max or motion builder you'd have the
exact<00:04:06.840> same<00:04:06.870> graph<00:04:07.290> editor<00:04:07.470> so<00:04:07.739> if<00:04:07.829> you're

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
exact same graph editor so if you're

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.140 
exact same graph editor so if you're
jumping<00:04:08.069> from<00:04:08.280> app<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:08.489> app<00:04:08.669> it<00:04:08.909> actually

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
jumping from app to app it actually

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.189 
jumping from app to app it actually
makes<00:04:09.329> it<00:04:09.419> a<00:04:09.510> little<00:04:09.599> bit<00:04:09.780> easier<00:04:10.079> to<00:04:10.109> work

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
makes it a little bit easier to work

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.170 
makes it a little bit easier to work
with<00:04:10.409> so<00:04:11.250> what<00:04:11.400> we<00:04:11.519> have<00:04:11.699> here<00:04:11.729> is<00:04:12.000> we've<00:04:12.150> got

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
with so what we have here is we've got

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.930 
with so what we have here is we've got
this<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.930> zoom<00:04:13.199> layer<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:13.769> on<00:04:14.579> this<00:04:14.760> zoom

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
this the zoom layer and on this zoom

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.909 
this the zoom layer and on this zoom
layer<00:04:15.120> we've<00:04:15.329> got<00:04:15.510> obviously<00:04:16.019> three<00:04:16.560> function

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
layer we've got obviously three function

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.439 
layer we've got obviously three function
curves<00:04:17.130> for<00:04:17.220> XY<00:04:17.579> and<00:04:17.729> Z<00:04:17.849> and<00:04:17.970> that<00:04:18.060> really<00:04:18.329> is

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
curves for XY and Z and that really is

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.539 
curves for XY and Z and that really is
the<00:04:18.599> positional<00:04:19.109> information<00:04:19.199> for<00:04:20.010> this<00:04:20.220> for

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
the positional information for this for

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.029 
the positional information for this for

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
this ships movement and notice that I've

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.710 
this ships movement and notice that I've
got<00:04:23.070> this<00:04:23.280> kind<00:04:23.460> of<00:04:23.490> weird<00:04:23.699> spike<00:04:24.150> in<00:04:24.360> there<00:04:24.539> so

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
got this kind of weird spike in there so

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.909 
got this kind of weird spike in there so
what<00:04:24.840> I<00:04:24.870> want<00:04:25.080> to<00:04:25.110> do<00:04:25.199> is<00:04:25.289> I<00:04:25.349> want<00:04:25.530> to<00:04:25.590> smooth

what I want to do is I want to smooth

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.070 
what I want to do is I want to smooth
that<00:04:26.099> out<00:04:26.159> a<00:04:26.370> little<00:04:26.580> bit<00:04:26.820> and<00:04:27.000> try<00:04:27.599> to<00:04:27.630> do<00:04:27.900> that

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
that out a little bit and try to do that

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.990 
that out a little bit and try to do that
with<00:04:28.139> by<00:04:28.680> adjusting<00:04:29.130> tangents<00:04:29.639> in<00:04:29.699> my<00:04:29.789> graph

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
with by adjusting tangents in my graph

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.640 
with by adjusting tangents in my graph
editor<00:04:30.210> it's<00:04:30.750> really<00:04:31.080> kind<00:04:31.260> of<00:04:31.320> hard<00:04:31.500> because

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
editor it's really kind of hard because

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.379 
editor it's really kind of hard because
you're<00:04:31.800> trying<00:04:31.949> to<00:04:32.070> balance<00:04:32.310> you<00:04:32.639> know<00:04:32.760> XY<00:04:33.210> and

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
you're trying to balance you know XY and

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.930 
you're trying to balance you know XY and
z<00:04:33.539> to<00:04:33.570> kind<00:04:33.960> of<00:04:34.020> shape<00:04:34.500> this<00:04:34.650> overall<00:04:34.979> fact<00:04:35.430> so

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
z to kind of shape this overall fact so

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.670 
z to kind of shape this overall fact so
inside<00:04:36.270> of<00:04:36.300> Maya<00:04:36.659> now<00:04:36.930> we<00:04:37.349> have<00:04:37.469> the<00:04:37.590> ability

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
inside of Maya now we have the ability

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.440 
inside of Maya now we have the ability

editor motion trails

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.409 
editor motion trails
and<00:04:40.830> simply<00:04:41.130> turn<00:04:41.400> on<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.639> in-and-out

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
and simply turn on the in-and-out

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.779 
and simply turn on the in-and-out

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
tangent in the 3d viewer so now when I

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.300 
tangent in the 3d viewer so now when I

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
select this edit this keyframe I can

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.920 
select this edit this keyframe I can
just<00:04:47.460> grab<00:04:47.639> those<00:04:47.819> tangents<00:04:48.360> and<00:04:48.509> begin

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
just grab those tangents and begin

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.870 
just grab those tangents and begin
position<00:04:49.380> them<00:04:49.590> so<00:04:50.009> you<00:04:50.099> can<00:04:50.220> see<00:04:50.370> how<00:04:50.460> simply

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
position them so you can see how simply

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.969 
position them so you can see how simply
it<00:04:51.000> is<00:04:51.120> for<00:04:51.569> me<00:04:51.720> to<00:04:52.110> go<00:04:52.199> ahead<00:04:52.289> and<00:04:52.470> modify<00:04:52.680> the

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
it is for me to go ahead and modify the

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.700 
it is for me to go ahead and modify the
shape<00:04:53.460> or<00:04:53.729> change<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.720> overall<00:04:54.960> position<00:04:55.259> of

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
shape or change the overall position of

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.990 
shape or change the overall position of
what<00:04:56.099> these<00:04:56.220> changes<00:04:56.400> are<00:04:56.669> doing<00:04:56.819> in<00:04:56.910> the

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
what these changes are doing in the

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.490 
what these changes are doing in the
graph<00:04:57.210> editor<00:04:57.389> but<00:04:57.780> essentially<00:04:58.259> I'm

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
graph editor but essentially I'm

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.830 
graph editor but essentially I'm
changing<00:04:59.009> the<00:04:59.099> shape<00:04:59.340> of<00:04:59.490> that<00:04:59.759> curve<00:04:59.819> in<00:05:00.360> my

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
changing the shape of that curve in my

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.760 
changing the shape of that curve in my
3d<00:05:01.229> view

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
3d view

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.040 
3d view
this<00:05:02.250> is<00:05:02.370> really<00:05:02.580> awesome<00:05:03.000> tool<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.900> other

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
this is really awesome tool the other

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.330 
this is really awesome tool the other
thing<00:05:04.199> that<00:05:04.259> we<00:05:04.440> can<00:05:04.590> do<00:05:04.740> with<00:05:04.949> the<00:05:05.069> editable

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
thing that we can do with the editable

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.370 
thing that we can do with the editable
motion<00:05:05.729> trails<00:05:05.970> is<00:05:06.270> we<00:05:06.539> can<00:05:06.660> start<00:05:06.870> to<00:05:06.990> adjust

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
motion trails is we can start to adjust

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.659 
motion trails is we can start to adjust
the<00:05:07.560> weighting<00:05:07.919> of<00:05:08.009> these<00:05:08.160> tangents

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
the weighting of these tangents

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.309 
the weighting of these tangents
basically<00:05:09.569> the<00:05:09.660> timing<00:05:10.080> are<00:05:10.169> we're<00:05:10.259> gonna

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
basically the timing are we're gonna

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.439 
basically the timing are we're gonna
have<00:05:10.470> fast<00:05:10.770> ends<00:05:11.069> or<00:05:11.190> fast<00:05:11.400> outs<00:05:11.699> and<00:05:11.970> we<00:05:12.300> can

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
have fast ends or fast outs and we can

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:13.670 
have fast ends or fast outs and we can
do<00:05:12.539> that<00:05:12.630> with<00:05:12.780> these<00:05:12.930> things<00:05:13.110> called<00:05:13.229> timing

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
do that with these things called timing

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.649 
do that with these things called timing
beads<00:05:14.009> so<00:05:14.430> all<00:05:14.610> I<00:05:14.669> have<00:05:14.789> to<00:05:14.849> do<00:05:14.970> is<00:05:15.090> again<00:05:15.300> right

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:15.659 
beads so all I have to do is again right

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:16.969 
beads so all I have to do is again right
mouse<00:05:15.870> click<00:05:15.900> on<00:05:16.259> top<00:05:16.440> of<00:05:16.590> the<00:05:16.680> editable

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
mouse click on top of the editable

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.249 
mouse click on top of the editable
motion<00:05:17.400> trail<00:05:17.610> in<00:05:18.060> this<00:05:18.300> example<00:05:18.599> bring<00:05:19.169> up

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
motion trail in this example bring up

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:20.629 
motion trail in this example bring up
the<00:05:19.349> timing<00:05:19.620> beep<00:05:19.860> so<00:05:20.069> we'll<00:05:20.190> say<00:05:20.340> show<00:05:20.520> the

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
the timing beep so we'll say show the

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.210 
the timing beep so we'll say show the
timing<00:05:20.940> bead<00:05:21.090> in<00:05:21.300> for<00:05:21.900> this<00:05:22.020> keyframe<00:05:22.259> so<00:05:23.159> you

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
timing bead in for this keyframe so you

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.830 
timing bead in for this keyframe so you
can<00:05:23.400> see<00:05:23.490> that<00:05:23.610> I<00:05:23.669> have<00:05:23.789> little<00:05:24.000> X's<00:05:24.419> going

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
can see that I have little X's going

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.950 
can see that I have little X's going
down<00:05:24.990> that<00:05:25.280> curve<00:05:26.280> those<00:05:26.940> X's<00:05:27.449> represent

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
down that curve those X's represent

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.469 
down that curve those X's represent
every<00:05:28.259> single<00:05:28.289> keyframe<00:05:28.740> so<00:05:29.370> if<00:05:30.030> I<00:05:30.120> grab<00:05:30.180> the

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
every single keyframe so if I grab the

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.540 
every single keyframe so if I grab the
timing<00:05:30.840> bead<00:05:30.990> and<00:05:31.199> I<00:05:31.259> start<00:05:31.500> to<00:05:31.620> expand<00:05:32.400> them

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
timing bead and I start to expand them

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.820 
timing bead and I start to expand them
out<00:05:32.729> what<00:05:33.240> I'm<00:05:33.360> doing<00:05:33.690> is<00:05:33.810> I'm<00:05:33.930> scaling<00:05:34.380> out<00:05:34.650> my

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
out what I'm doing is I'm scaling out my

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.350 
out what I'm doing is I'm scaling out my
kangan<00:05:35.250> so<00:05:35.370> you<00:05:35.460> can<00:05:35.580> see<00:05:35.759> here<00:05:35.970> I'm<00:05:36.060> scaling

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
kangan so you can see here I'm scaling

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.120 
kangan so you can see here I'm scaling
this<00:05:36.569> kangas<00:05:36.930> out<00:05:37.110> so<00:05:37.530> essentially<00:05:38.009> I'm

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
this kangas out so essentially I'm

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.980 
this kangas out so essentially I'm
getting<00:05:38.520> a<00:05:38.610> slow<00:05:38.909> out<00:05:39.120> so<00:05:39.330> I'm<00:05:39.389> gonna<00:05:39.509> get<00:05:39.690> more

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
getting a slow out so I'm gonna get more

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.629 
getting a slow out so I'm gonna get more
keyframes<00:05:40.229> stacked<00:05:40.770> up<00:05:40.979> at<00:05:41.099> the<00:05:41.220> end<00:05:41.400> of<00:05:41.550> this

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
keyframes stacked up at the end of this

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.760 
keyframes stacked up at the end of this
curve<00:05:41.940> if<00:05:42.180> I<00:05:42.539> take<00:05:42.750> them<00:05:42.900> and<00:05:43.050> push<00:05:43.500> them<00:05:43.530> the

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
curve if I take them and push them the

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.649 
curve if I take them and push them the
other<00:05:43.919> way<00:05:44.130> it's<00:05:44.639> gonna<00:05:44.820> accelerate<00:05:45.330> the

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.659 
other way it's gonna accelerate the

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:47.120 
other way it's gonna accelerate the
curve<00:05:45.870> so<00:05:46.139> you're<00:05:46.320> those<00:05:46.560> keyframes<00:05:46.800> will

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
curve so you're those keyframes will

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.560 
curve so you're those keyframes will
start<00:05:47.340> to<00:05:47.460> space<00:05:47.729> out<00:05:47.969> so<00:05:48.180> I'm<00:05:48.240> gonna<00:05:48.389> have<00:05:48.539> a

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
start to space out so I'm gonna have a

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.469 
start to space out so I'm gonna have a
fast<00:05:48.900> end<00:05:49.259> now<00:05:49.469> so<00:05:50.280> again<00:05:50.430> what<00:05:51.030> we've<00:05:51.150> tried

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
fast end now so again what we've tried

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.270 
fast end now so again what we've tried
to<00:05:51.539> do<00:05:51.840> with<00:05:51.960> the<00:05:52.080> editable<00:05:52.380> motion<00:05:52.800> trails<00:05:53.070> is

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
to do with the editable motion trails is

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.100 
to do with the editable motion trails is
bring<00:05:53.849> the<00:05:53.969> controls<00:05:54.419> that<00:05:54.539> you'd<00:05:54.719> be<00:05:54.810> doing

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
bring the controls that you'd be doing

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.839 
bring the controls that you'd be doing
down<00:05:55.259> in<00:05:55.380> the<00:05:55.469> graph<00:05:55.680> editor<00:05:55.860> up<00:05:56.430> into<00:05:56.729> the

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
down in the graph editor up into the

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.700 
down in the graph editor up into the
viewport<00:05:57.389> to<00:05:57.750> make<00:05:57.930> them<00:05:58.080> really<00:05:58.259> easy<00:05:58.500> to

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
viewport to make them really easy to

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.830 
viewport to make them really easy to
access<00:05:58.860> and<00:05:59.370> make<00:05:59.820> them<00:05:59.969> really<00:06:00.150> fast<00:06:00.389> to<00:06:00.659> work

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
access and make them really fast to work

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.480 
access and make them really fast to work
with<00:06:01.110> so<00:06:01.800> the<00:06:01.889> last<00:06:02.039> thing<00:06:02.219> that<00:06:02.280> we're<00:06:02.430> gonna

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
with so the last thing that we're gonna

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.640 
with so the last thing that we're gonna
look<00:06:02.699> at<00:06:02.849> is<00:06:02.969> the<00:06:03.000> modify<00:06:03.479> attribute<00:06:04.050> so<00:06:04.500> if<00:06:04.590> I

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
look at is the modify attribute so if I

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.499 
look at is the modify attribute so if I
go<00:06:04.770> into<00:06:04.919> modify<00:06:05.250> keys<00:06:05.639> I<00:06:05.880> can<00:06:06.030> start<00:06:06.240> adding

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:06.509 
go into modify keys I can start adding

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:08.060 
go into modify keys I can start adding
new<00:06:06.599> keys<00:06:06.840> simply<00:06:07.169> by<00:06:07.320> clicking<00:06:07.530> on<00:06:07.830> it<00:06:07.949> and

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
new keys simply by clicking on it and

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.899 
new keys simply by clicking on it and
then<00:06:08.159> obviously<00:06:08.280> I<00:06:08.580> could<00:06:08.699> start

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:08.909 
then obviously I could start

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:11.240 
then obviously I could start
repositioning<00:06:09.659> that<00:06:09.840> I<00:06:10.050> can<00:06:10.620> also<00:06:10.830> go<00:06:11.069> into

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
repositioning that I can also go into

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.920 
repositioning that I can also go into
modify<00:06:11.520> keys<00:06:11.880> to<00:06:12.060> start<00:06:12.270> adjusting<00:06:12.389> the

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
modify keys to start adjusting the

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.170 
modify keys to start adjusting the
overall<00:06:13.349> keyframe<00:06:13.830> value<00:06:14.250> so<00:06:14.669> if<00:06:14.789> I<00:06:14.849> go<00:06:14.969> back

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
overall keyframe value so if I go back

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.850 
overall keyframe value so if I go back
into<00:06:15.360> modify<00:06:15.719> and<00:06:15.990> I<00:06:16.020> hold<00:06:16.199> down<00:06:16.319> my<00:06:16.380> shift<00:06:16.560> key

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
into modify and I hold down my shift key

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.770 
into modify and I hold down my shift key
and<00:06:17.039> start<00:06:17.280> to<00:06:17.370> swipe<00:06:17.669> here<00:06:17.909> you<00:06:18.360> can<00:06:18.509> see<00:06:18.659> that

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
and start to swipe here you can see that

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.300 
and start to swipe here you can see that
I<00:06:18.840> get<00:06:18.900> tick<00:06:19.229> marks<00:06:19.500> that<00:06:19.620> represent<00:06:19.680> every

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
I get tick marks that represent every

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.249 
I get tick marks that represent every
keyframe<00:06:20.789> and<00:06:21.210> I'm<00:06:21.300> actually<00:06:21.449> just<00:06:21.630> changing

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 
keyframe and I'm actually just changing

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:24.170 
keyframe and I'm actually just changing
the<00:06:22.349> position<00:06:22.800> of<00:06:22.979> where<00:06:23.190> that<00:06:23.340> key<00:06:23.639> lives<00:06:23.940> in

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
the position of where that key lives in

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.300 
the position of where that key lives in
time<00:06:24.630> so<00:06:25.169> I'm<00:06:25.259> not<00:06:25.380> changing<00:06:25.590> the<00:06:25.830> positional

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
time so I'm not changing the positional

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.680 
time so I'm not changing the positional
information<00:06:26.400> I'm<00:06:27.030> changing<00:06:27.330> the<00:06:27.449> timing

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
information I'm changing the timing

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.379 
information I'm changing the timing
information<00:06:27.960> for<00:06:28.940> so<00:06:29.940> the<00:06:30.030> last<00:06:30.180> thing<00:06:30.330> that

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:30.389 
information for so the last thing that

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:31.820 
information for so the last thing that
we're<00:06:30.539> gonna<00:06:30.630> do<00:06:30.870> is<00:06:31.080> go<00:06:31.650> ahead<00:06:31.740> and

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
we're gonna do is go ahead and

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.589 
we're gonna do is go ahead and
accelerate<00:06:32.550> the<00:06:32.669> whole<00:06:32.849> animation<00:06:33.210> a<00:06:33.419> little

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
accelerate the whole animation a little

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:35.629 
accelerate the whole animation a little
bit<00:06:33.719> by<00:06:34.169> using<00:06:34.380> my<00:06:34.590> region<00:06:34.919> selection<00:06:35.190> tool<00:06:35.430> so

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 
bit by using my region selection tool so

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:37.790 
bit by using my region selection tool so
this<00:06:35.729> is<00:06:35.880> a<00:06:35.909> very<00:06:36.300> fast<00:06:36.569> tool<00:06:36.840> that<00:06:37.349> allows<00:06:37.590> me

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
this is a very fast tool that allows me

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.589 
this is a very fast tool that allows me
to<00:06:37.830> grab<00:06:38.069> a<00:06:38.099> bunch<00:06:38.370> of<00:06:38.580> curves<00:06:38.819> then<00:06:39.330> I<00:06:39.419> can<00:06:39.569> use

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 
to grab a bunch of curves then I can use

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:40.999 
to grab a bunch of curves then I can use
that<00:06:39.750> to<00:06:39.960> start<00:06:40.080> moving<00:06:40.440> those<00:06:40.530> curves<00:06:40.860> around

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:41.009 
that to start moving those curves around

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:43.550 
that to start moving those curves around
or<00:06:41.909> I<00:06:41.940> can<00:06:42.330> use<00:06:42.479> it<00:06:42.630> to<00:06:42.659> go<00:06:42.840> ahead<00:06:42.960> and<00:06:43.199> start<00:06:43.380> to

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
or I can use it to go ahead and start to

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.990 
or I can use it to go ahead and start to
just<00:06:43.740> do<00:06:43.860> some<00:06:44.009> basic<00:06:44.130> timing<00:06:44.699> so<00:06:44.789> I<00:06:44.849> could

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
just do some basic timing so I could

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.969 
just do some basic timing so I could
either<00:06:45.120> scale<00:06:45.569> them<00:06:45.810> or<00:06:46.110> in<00:06:46.319> this<00:06:46.409> example<00:06:46.770> I'm

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
either scale them or in this example I'm

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:48.529 
either scale them or in this example I'm
gonna<00:06:47.099> scale<00:06:47.550> the<00:06:47.669> time<00:06:47.880> down<00:06:48.090> as<00:06:48.210> opposed<00:06:48.509> to

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 
gonna scale the time down as opposed to

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:50.329 
gonna scale the time down as opposed to
scaling<00:06:48.839> value<00:06:49.289> so<00:06:49.860> we'll<00:06:49.979> just<00:06:50.130> kind<00:06:50.310> of

00:06:50.329 --> 00:06:50.339 
scaling value so we'll just kind of

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:52.370 
scaling value so we'll just kind of
compress<00:06:50.729> this<00:06:50.909> down<00:06:51.120> so<00:06:51.330> that<00:06:51.449> my<00:06:51.539> ship<00:06:51.960> flies

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 
compress this down so that my ship flies

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.900 
compress this down so that my ship flies
through<00:06:52.560> this<00:06:52.710> very<00:06:52.919> fast

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910 
through this very fast

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.700 
through this very fast
so<00:06:54.390> that<00:06:54.540> was<00:06:54.660> just<00:06:54.780> a<00:06:54.900> quick<00:06:55.020> example<00:06:55.590> of<00:06:55.620> how

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
so that was just a quick example of how

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.620 
so that was just a quick example of how
we<00:06:55.800> can<00:06:56.010> use<00:06:56.190> editable<00:06:56.580> motion<00:06:56.880> trails<00:06:57.150> to

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:57.630 
we can use editable motion trails to

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.480 
we can use editable motion trails to
interact<00:06:57.990> with<00:06:58.050> our<00:06:58.200> keyframes<00:06:58.650> directly<00:06:59.370> in

00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.490 
interact with our keyframes directly in

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.940 
interact with our keyframes directly in
our<00:06:59.580> viewport
