I'm doing it this direction so you can
see<00:01:40.220> exactly<00:01:40.369> how<00:01:41.360> I<00:01:41.390> hold<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.990> brush<00:01:42.200> when<00:01:42.439> I

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
see exactly how I hold the brush when I

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.880 
see exactly how I hold the brush when I
do<00:01:42.649> my<00:01:42.829> own<00:01:42.860> hair<00:01:44.049> you<00:01:45.049> need<00:01:45.200> stronger<00:01:45.619> arm

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
do my own hair you need stronger arm

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.370 
do my own hair you need stronger arm
size<00:01:46.100> because<00:01:46.369> this<00:01:46.579> does<00:01:46.939> ache<00:01:47.210> but<00:01:47.869> it's<00:01:47.929> so

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
size because this does ache but it's so

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.669 
size because this does ache but it's so
worth<00:01:48.619> it<00:01:49.720> you<00:01:50.720> can<00:01:50.899> see<00:01:51.079> I'm<00:01:51.170> rolling<00:01:51.560> the

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
worth it you can see I'm rolling the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.969 
worth it you can see I'm rolling the
brush<00:01:52.149> into<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:53.299> hair<00:01:53.630> blowing<00:01:54.020> air<00:01:54.380> onto<00:01:54.860> the

over again until the hair is very very

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.960 
over again until the hair is very very
dry<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:03.560> heat<00:02:03.799> is<00:02:04.039> not<00:02:04.069> touching<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.759> hair

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
dry the heat is not touching the hair

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.669 
dry the heat is not touching the hair
directly<00:02:05.209> because<00:02:05.840> that's<00:02:06.049> can<00:02:06.259> break<00:02:06.500> the
