this doesn't seem right then that's when
I<00:02:24.570> realized<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.620> had<00:02:26.010> not<00:02:26.670> drink<00:02:27.270> a

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
I realized that I had not drink a

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.240 
I realized that I had not drink a
protein<00:02:27.690> shake<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:28.260> yeah<00:02:28.980> it's<00:02:29.190> very

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
protein shake so yeah it's very

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.560 
protein shake so yeah it's very
important<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.090> weight<00:02:30.180> loss<00:02:30.390> surgery

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
important for weight loss surgery

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.870 
important for weight loss surgery
patients<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.320> drink<00:02:31.470> protein<00:02:31.800> shakes<00:02:32.040> but

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
patients to drink protein shakes but

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.550 
patients to drink protein shakes but
then<00:02:33.030> whenever<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.570> have<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.720> major<00:02:34.020> surgery

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
then whenever you have a major surgery

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.260 
then whenever you have a major surgery
like<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.100> 360<00:02:35.340> body<00:02:35.880> lift<00:02:37.430> or<00:02:38.430> any<00:02:38.940> kind<00:02:39.240> of

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
like the 360 body lift or any kind of

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.040 
like the 360 body lift or any kind of
major<00:02:39.450> surgery

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
major surgery

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.700 
major surgery
it<00:02:40.320> is<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:40.770> so<00:02:41.160> so<00:02:41.520> so<00:02:42.030> important<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:43.200> get<00:02:43.320> like

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
it is so so so so important to get like

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.090 
it is so so so so important to get like
twice<00:02:44.160> as<00:02:44.430> much<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.060> protein<00:02:45.480> in<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:46.140> you

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
twice as much of the protein in that you

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.420 
twice as much of the protein in that you
would<00:02:47.220> normally<00:02:47.370> drink<00:02:48.060> on<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.270> daily<00:02:48.570> basis<00:02:48.960> so

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
would normally drink on a daily basis so

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.940 
would normally drink on a daily basis so
I've<00:02:50.430> got<00:02:50.730> my<00:02:51.240> protein<00:02:51.450> here<00:02:52.050> I<00:02:52.260> tried<00:02:52.800> this

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
I've got my protein here I tried this

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.320 
I've got my protein here I tried this
kind<00:02:53.190> because<00:02:53.520> this<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.630> designer<00:02:55.020> whey<00:02:55.320> I

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
kind because this is designer whey I

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.970 
kind because this is designer whey I
tried<00:02:57.330> this<00:02:57.450> kind<00:02:57.690> because<00:02:58.020> I<00:02:58.110> didn't<00:02:58.530> want<00:02:58.920> to

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
tried this kind because I didn't want to

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.100 
tried this kind because I didn't want to
go<00:02:59.070> all<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.250> way<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.490> Walmart<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.360> was<00:03:00.930> just

Katzen<00:04:05.220> today<00:04:05.460> so<00:04:05.520> I<00:04:05.730> can<00:04:06.270> see<00:04:07.080> if<00:04:07.350> I<00:04:07.530> should<00:04:07.740> be

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
Katzen today so I can see if I should be

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.220 
Katzen today so I can see if I should be
concerned<00:04:08.430> about<00:04:08.580> this<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:09.360> know<00:04:09.870> if<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:10.050> should

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
concerned about this I know if I should

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.050 
concerned about this I know if I should
do<00:04:10.380> something<00:04:10.860> or<00:04:11.250> if<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.460> should<00:04:11.670> just<00:04:11.700> let<00:04:12.000> it

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
do something or if I should just let it

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.790 
do something or if I should just let it
go<00:04:12.180> because<00:04:12.690> my<00:04:12.720> body<00:04:13.080> is<00:04:13.200> rejecting<00:04:13.350> it

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
go because my body is rejecting it

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.590 
go because my body is rejecting it
therefore<00:04:14.010> it's<00:04:14.490> you<00:04:14.880> know<00:04:15.000> it's<00:04:15.240> okay<00:04:15.510> so<00:04:16.290> I

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
therefore it's you know it's okay so I

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.080 
therefore it's you know it's okay so I
still<00:04:18.770> the<00:04:19.770> fourth<00:04:20.040> one<00:04:20.280> is<00:04:20.400> still<00:04:20.549> in<00:04:20.790> and

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
still the fourth one is still in and
