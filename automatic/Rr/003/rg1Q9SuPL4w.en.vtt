and<00:01:20.620> well<00:01:21.620> AQ<00:01:22.220> here<00:01:22.549> obviously<00:01:22.729> I've<00:01:23.150> been<00:01:23.540> in

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
and well AQ here obviously I've been in

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.600 
and well AQ here obviously I've been in
a<00:01:23.750> queue<00:01:23.960> in<00:01:24.049> a<00:01:24.110> while<00:01:24.260> but<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:24.710> this<00:01:25.190> boss<00:01:25.400> was

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
a queue in a while but and this boss was

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.190 
a queue in a while but and this boss was
pretty<00:01:25.790> cool<00:01:25.970> because<00:01:26.090> it's<00:01:26.299> a<00:01:26.360> new<00:01:26.390> model<00:01:26.900> at

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
same time well we may not not all level

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.950 
same time well we may not not all level
at<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.159> same<00:01:58.340> time<00:01:58.549> or<00:01:59.240> level<00:01:59.540> in<00:01:59.659> same<00:01:59.840> spot

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
at the same time or level in same spot

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.810 
at the same time or level in same spot
but<00:02:00.290> we'll<00:02:00.530> all<00:02:00.680> be<00:02:00.860> at<00:02:01.070> least<00:02:01.460> around<00:02:01.610> the

still<00:02:17.870> do<00:02:18.409> some<00:02:18.709> decent<00:02:19.040> damage<00:02:19.129> what

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
still do some decent damage what

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.530 
still do some decent damage what
you<00:02:20.060> know<00:02:20.150> maybe<00:02:20.300> love<00:02:20.600> link<00:02:20.810> by<00:02:20.930> myself<00:02:22.540> so

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
you know maybe love link by myself so

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.140 
you know maybe love link by myself so
basically<00:02:24.410> my<00:02:24.440> goal<00:02:24.950> here<00:02:25.160> was<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.460> get

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
basically my goal here was to get

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.410 
basically my goal here was to get
maximum<00:02:27.070> nana<00:02:28.070> efficiency<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:29.290> holy<00:02:30.290> damage

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
maximum nana efficiency and holy damage

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.590 
maximum nana efficiency and holy damage
so<00:02:32.420> I<00:02:32.690> went<00:02:33.470> into<00:02:33.650> all<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.550> talents<00:02:35.330> like<00:02:35.450> that

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
so I went into all the talents like that

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.990 
so I went into all the talents like that
talent<00:02:36.050> in<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.290> first<00:02:36.530> tier<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.550> discs<00:02:37.850> that

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
talent in the first tier of discs that

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.510 
talent in the first tier of discs that
reduces<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.870> instant<00:02:39.170> costs<00:02:39.470> instant<00:02:40.340> cast

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
reduces the instant costs instant cast

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.180 
reduces the instant costs instant cast
spells<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.270> also<00:02:42.050> went<00:02:42.260> into<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.560> shadow<00:02:42.830> tree

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
spells I also went into the shadow tree

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.190 
spells I also went into the shadow tree
two<00:02:43.430> points<00:02:43.820> you'll<00:02:43.940> see<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.660> get<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.870> reduced

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
two points you'll see to get the reduced

suspect into a reflective shield because

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.720 
suspect into a reflective shield because
you're<00:02:57.500> going<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.650> have<00:02:57.770> melee<00:02:57.980> mobs<00:02:58.310> on<00:02:58.550> you

you're going to have melee mobs on you

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.860 
you're going to have melee mobs on you
it's<00:02:58.940> going<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.150> just<00:02:59.240> make<00:02:59.450> them<00:02:59.570> go<00:02:59.690> down<00:02:59.720> a

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
it's going to just make them go down a

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.130 
it's going to just make them go down a
little<00:03:00.080> bit<00:03:00.200> faster<00:03:01.990> expecting<00:03:02.990> the

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
little bit faster expecting the

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.500 
little bit faster expecting the
evangelism<00:03:03.920> in<00:03:04.160> Archangel<00:03:04.550> and<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.180> second

evangelism in Archangel and the second
tier<00:03:05.690> of<00:03:05.870> disk<00:03:06.110> because<00:03:07.010> I'm<00:03:07.850> going<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.030> be

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
tier of disk because I'm going to be

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.740 
tier of disk because I'm going to be
smiting<00:03:08.660> mainly<00:03:09.020> due<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.320> do<00:03:09.950> damage<00:03:10.160> and<00:03:10.750> then

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
smiting mainly due to do damage and then

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.960 
smiting mainly due to do damage and then
obviously<00:03:12.290> when<00:03:12.740> you<00:03:12.830> get<00:03:12.980> five<00:03:13.280> secs<00:03:13.610> you<00:03:13.790> can

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
obviously when you get five secs you can

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.120 
obviously when you get five secs you can
archangel<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:14.840> get<00:03:15.020> some<00:03:15.170> mana<00:03:15.350> back<00:03:15.590> so<00:03:16.100> that

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
archangel and get some mana back so that

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.660

to actually do some healing oh and also

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.259 
to actually do some healing oh and also
in<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.750> holy<00:03:32.930> tree<00:03:33.230> at<00:03:33.350> first<00:03:33.970> tier<00:03:34.970> there<00:03:35.239> i

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
in the holy tree at first tier there i

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.690 
in the holy tree at first tier there i
took<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.660> reduced<00:03:36.050> cast<00:03:36.410> time<00:03:36.620> on<00:03:36.890> he'll

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
took the reduced cast time on he'll

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.040 
took the reduced cast time on he'll
greater<00:03:37.970> heal<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:38.830> smite<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:40.760> i<00:03:41.390> think<00:03:41.930> it

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
greater heal and smite and i think it

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.140 
greater heal and smite and i think it
may<00:03:42.170> affect<00:03:42.350> holy<00:03:42.769> fire<00:03:43.040> too<00:03:44.260> so<00:03:45.260> as<00:03:45.820> I<00:03:46.820> level

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
may affect holy fire too so as I level
