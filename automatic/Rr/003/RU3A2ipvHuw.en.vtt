00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.570
 I also have a video with my top 10 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.189
 I've been thinking of making the products 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.150
 and have wished for many 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.490
 that I first look for 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.950
 my five products under five euros 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.300
 more and I have so in 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.950
 this added mainspitz collection 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.239
 cleaned out what maybe otherwise good 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.680
 was because I'm looking for the right time 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.270
 Although I had a lot of points 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.040
 may have yours but me 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.660
 wanted to stop the favorite products 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.780
 take and I wanted to take products 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.940
 the even higher are currently available 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.680
 and take off the e is at the 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.449
 have not seen a thousand times amis 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.789
 as well as ben lipps the maxi brings too 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.289
 like or manhattan casemodder what 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.820
 I often use a few things 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.410
 so far in the wrong of me know 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.329
 that's why I did not take her and 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.100
 Japan right on the first product 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.480
 lawyer so that video could be quite 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.870
 so long and that is not so 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.059
 bad 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.280
 and I have her the p2 many 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.589
 natural concealer in color 10 and 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.079
 have 5000 youtube in the camera 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.780
 and I'm the deaf first 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.340
 the 1000 first update important to many 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.870
 also very good because a very natural one 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.730
 You have opacity there, too 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.540
 on it and I was producing for 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.160
 bring my eyes 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.110
 I never have to say that to myself 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.180
 so it is 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.130
 is not distracting anyone but now 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.450
 otherwise it fits very well with mine 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.370
 skin tone and that I find now in the 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.280
 Drugstore always so hard to find for 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.410
 very bright skin is somehow I think 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.820
 almost impossible and costs everyone 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.140
 Fall under five euros I do not know 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.850
 just how much the prices stand up 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.340
 any case you down there somewhere and 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.720
 That's why I think that means very well 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.610
 Product I wanted to show you is 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.970
 a eyeshadow quattro of essens and 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.590
 that still has 0 5 3 before me but 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.720
 meanwhile I hardly have it any different 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.820
 behind what it is called now and that 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.940
 are simply super beautiful neutral colors 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.950
 a bright creamy white do a beige tone 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.480
 a mittelbronn a darker women 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.130
 All farms are dull and are with me 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.750
 the super and pigmented i can 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.940
 I do not complain because I have 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.530
 that's already two years or so 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.850
 and I think it's super good I think so 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.710
 Neutral colors should be on everyone 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.240
 case of his make-up collection if 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.159
 one uses the acts and I am 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.200
 Maybe they are very good 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.209
 perfect for everyday life under five euros 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.920
 that can be done again runs for 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.510
 I say more the product was 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.940
 wanted to show you is not out of time 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.120
 drogerie surprise price but is it 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.340
 from sap and although it is this quiet or 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.349
 This industry in color as well as great 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.819
 and I think the color is just mega 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.250
 nice that is right then right 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.110
 cool pink tone of voice or 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.209
 chemnitzer has a really cool one 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.239
 note I believe I wanted me 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.349
 times how much longer express ja nee 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.420
 So I think that's for me 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.860
 really cool yes really cool finish 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.769
 water for each case on each group 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.810
 looks rather lax or the rouge is 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.430
 very good as already contains so that 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.769
 you have to be very careful but me 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.390
 I always prefer to comment on than even 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.069
 not that I had ever I 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.900
 believe that cock in cosmetics more general 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.459
 have you been rated in the front is or 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.260
 not as well known there of 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.000
 this blanches in any case 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.930
 Anlauf have the synonymous very good 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.730
 are so I can only 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.739
 representative of the color is like 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.910
 big say but I think I have to 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.859
 at this time again a few things 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.329
 look at it mostly the product goes 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.190
 what I meanwhile learned to live real 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.620
 have and almost every day associations is 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.010
 this kajalstift from the p2 from the 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.319
 fantastic chrome kajal series fantastique 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.690
 rome good english good english to you 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.239
 No, I can actually do it 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.310
 the colors sting the ground amber and that is 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.340
 just super nice I think this rough 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.560
 to which I kia it can be very nice the 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.000
 is a golden metallic tone and 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.799
 I like to wear them lower 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.269
 Eyelash wreath maintains the rookie of 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.700
 I can not stand there all day 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.139
 complain for the super nice the 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.790
 I think it all goes by itself 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.260
 somehow fits better room in green 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.239
 so if he is looking for 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.040
 a kohl pencil since he's been there all day 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.870
 which has a metallic effect 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.430
 and then under five euros will cost 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.470
 should ye the four warnings 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.970
 comment on my last product and 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.130
 I definitely wanted one more 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.139
 Apple product show it off almost 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.609
 every category is a matter and 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.889
 actually I wanted you this here 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:03.379
 by patrice manager stan smith the 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:06.290
 polish in the fable russ became short 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.879
 but show this registration office polish 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.349
 have already shown so many youtubers 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.510
 and I 'll just tell you on a short note 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.519
 edge finds 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.230
 good and wearing the two favorite color 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.269
 I also just come now 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.120
 the actual fifth product and indeed 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.100
 is the astra lipstick from the heidi 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.840
 Klum series and I think the packaging 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.760
 from these current shops ever 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.360
 very beautiful and I have the now 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.669
 color 0 082 she and that is a darker one 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.930
 would be quiet and I think so 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.330
 beautiful now in any case too 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.400
 blue cast thus leaves the teeth whiter 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.389
 which always seems good to you 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.520
 if the color is so kind 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.949
 I am very wintry, but I thought 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.300
 of silver from because I also think that 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.400
 dark lips with a simple 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.139
 Also in spring, cover the spring 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.760
 tanned skin can look quite cool 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.590
 And I think I'll watch the series 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.090
 because I make the consistency of the 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.100
 lipsticks really good find and comes 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.720
 after the summery color on each 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.580
 case was now lacking five 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.350
 products under five euros the me 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.000
 really liked and the me 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.460
 no longer need my life 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.199
 So do not want to do without them 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.240
 Of course, I want to be totally crazy now 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.400
 Which products are under five euros 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.440

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.120
