their guns next up a news we saw the
release<00:01:42.610> today<00:01:42.970> of<00:01:43.300> two<00:01:43.599> titles<00:01:44.229> that<00:01:44.349> I<00:01:44.410> was

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
release today of two titles that I was

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.740 
release today of two titles that I was
looking<00:01:44.950> forward<00:01:45.160> to<00:01:45.310> that<00:01:45.520> is<00:01:45.970> transistor

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
looking forward to that is transistor

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.139 
looking forward to that is transistor
and<00:01:47.009> wolfenstein<00:01:48.009> and<00:01:48.340> it<00:01:48.640> looks<00:01:48.729> like<00:01:48.880> both

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
and wolfenstein and it looks like both

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:50.999 
and wolfenstein and it looks like both
of<00:01:49.179> them<00:01:49.450> appear<00:01:49.989> to<00:01:50.080> be<00:01:50.140> doing<00:01:50.259> very<00:01:50.649> well

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
of them appear to be doing very well

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.309 
of them appear to be doing very well
just<00:01:51.819> taking<00:01:52.119> a<00:01:52.209> quick<00:01:52.390> glance<00:01:52.690> at<00:01:52.989> some<00:01:53.170> of

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
just taking a quick glance at some of

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.050 
just taking a quick glance at some of
the<00:01:53.470> scores<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.130> reviews<00:01:54.250> that<00:01:54.670> are<00:01:54.700> coming

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
the scores and reviews that are coming

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.059 
the scores and reviews that are coming
up<00:01:55.119> across<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.660> board<00:01:55.899> it<00:01:56.229> looks<00:01:56.649> like<00:01:56.709> both

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
up across the board it looks like both

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:00.240 
up across the board it looks like both
games<00:01:57.429> are<00:01:57.700> getting<00:01:58.300> between<00:01:59.160> somewhere<00:02:00.160> in

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
games are getting between somewhere in

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.100 
games are getting between somewhere in
the<00:02:00.310> vicinity<00:02:00.369> of<00:02:00.640> seven<00:02:01.030> eight<00:02:01.239> or<00:02:01.509> nine<00:02:01.810> out

very<00:02:07.149> happy<00:02:07.530> specifically<00:02:08.530> transistor<00:02:09.429> is

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
very happy specifically transistor is

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.670 
very happy specifically transistor is
really<00:02:10.420> what<00:02:10.599> I'm<00:02:10.720> most<00:02:10.959> interested<00:02:11.349> in

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
really what I'm most interested in

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.010 
really what I'm most interested in
Wolfenstein<00:02:12.580> I<00:02:12.610> just<00:02:12.970> sort<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.209> have<00:02:13.690> always

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
Wolfenstein I just sort of have always

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.600 
Wolfenstein I just sort of have always
have<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.319> little<00:02:14.800> bit<00:02:14.950> of<00:02:14.980> an<00:02:15.129> interest<00:02:15.430> in

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
have a little bit of an interest in

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.210 
have a little bit of an interest in
first-person<00:02:16.360> shooter<00:02:16.989> games<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:18.099> know

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
first-person shooter games and you know

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.400 
first-person shooter games and you know
having<00:02:18.640> played<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.209> older<00:02:19.599> Wolfenstein<00:02:20.200> s

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
having played the older Wolfenstein s

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.170 
having played the older Wolfenstein s
way<00:02:20.500> back<00:02:20.739> when<00:02:20.920> i<00:02:20.980> was<00:02:21.069> a<00:02:21.220> youngin<00:02:21.520> i

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
way back when i was a youngin i

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.760 
way back when i was a youngin i
definitely<00:02:22.810> would<00:02:22.959> like<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.379> give<00:02:23.560> this<00:02:23.709> a

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
definitely would like to give this a

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.039 
definitely would like to give this a
look<00:02:24.069> but<00:02:24.220> i<00:02:24.280> am<00:02:24.640> most<00:02:24.969> intrigued<00:02:25.450> by

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
look but i am most intrigued by

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.869 
look but i am most intrigued by
transistor<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.829> can't<00:02:27.280> wait<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.459> give<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.700> a

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
transistor I can't wait to give that a

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.039 
transistor I can't wait to give that a
look<00:02:28.060> unfortunately<00:02:28.390> I'm<00:02:28.719> going<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.900> be<00:02:28.959> going

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
look unfortunately I'm going to be going

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.360 
look unfortunately I'm going to be going
away<00:02:29.230> for<00:02:29.349> a<00:02:29.560> few<00:02:29.739> days

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
away for a few days

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.589 
away for a few days
won't<00:02:30.459> have<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.700> opportunity<00:02:31.209> to<00:02:31.360> sit<00:02:31.540> down

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
won't have the opportunity to sit down

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.020 
won't have the opportunity to sit down
with<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.930> game<00:02:32.200> until<00:02:32.620> later<00:02:32.920> this<00:02:33.129> week<00:02:33.370> but<00:02:33.879> it

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
with a game until later this week but it

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.580 
with a game until later this week but it
makes<00:02:34.209> me<00:02:34.360> happy<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.720> hear<00:02:35.049> that<00:02:35.080> whether<00:02:35.440> or

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
makes me happy to hear that whether or

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.630 
makes me happy to hear that whether or
not<00:02:35.709> you're<00:02:35.920> looking<00:02:36.159> forward<00:02:36.459> to<00:02:36.519> playing

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
not you're looking forward to playing

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.720 
not you're looking forward to playing
transistor<00:02:37.330> or<00:02:37.799> Wolfenstein<00:02:38.799> both<00:02:39.430> games

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
transistor or Wolfenstein both games

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.500 
transistor or Wolfenstein both games
appear<00:02:40.299> to<00:02:40.480> be<00:02:40.659> fairly<00:02:41.230> well<00:02:41.890> reviewed<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:43.150> far

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
appear to be fairly well reviewed so far

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.229 
appear to be fairly well reviewed so far
so<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.500> seems<00:02:44.860> like<00:02:45.069> it's<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.340> fairly<00:02:45.580> safe<00:02:45.940> bet

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
so it seems like it's a fairly safe bet

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.880 
so it seems like it's a fairly safe bet
as<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.510> whether<00:02:47.019> or<00:02:47.170> not<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.440> should<00:02:47.470> pick<00:02:47.829> it

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
as to whether or not you should pick it

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.069 
as to whether or not you should pick it
up<00:02:48.129> and<00:02:48.340> last<00:02:48.640> up<00:02:48.849> in<00:02:49.000> news<00:02:49.209> today<00:02:49.480> Blizzard<00:02:49.930> is
