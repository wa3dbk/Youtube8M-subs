being closer to your tower meaning

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.989

there's less chance of a gank so you can

out into this Lane is because hard

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.160 
out into this Lane is because hard

in terms of last hits and denies you

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.100 
in terms of last hits and denies you
should<00:01:10.310> focus<00:01:10.700> heavily<00:01:10.910> on<00:01:11.150> last<00:01:11.510> hitting<00:01:11.810> and

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
should focus heavily on last hitting and

will cause you to miss a last hit this

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.870 
will cause you to miss a last hit this
is<00:01:17.780> because<00:01:18.170> last<00:01:18.560> hitting<00:01:18.860> gets<00:01:19.460> you<00:01:19.640> gold

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
is because last hitting gets you gold

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.360 
is because last hitting gets you gold
whereas<00:01:20.330> denying<00:01:20.750> only<00:01:21.380> stops<00:01:21.680> your<00:01:21.830> opponent

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
whereas denying only stops your opponent

whereas denying only stops your opponent
your<00:01:22.880> supports<00:01:23.480> in<00:01:23.720> Lane<00:01:24.080> should<00:01:24.440> also<00:01:24.680> be

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
your supports in Lane should also be

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.010 
your supports in Lane should also be
looking<00:01:25.010> for<00:01:25.550> denying<00:01:25.880> creep<00:01:26.330> as<00:01:26.570> well<00:01:26.870> as

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
looking for denying creep as well as

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.580 
looking for denying creep as well as
harassing<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.710> enemy<00:01:28.510> last<00:01:29.510> hit<00:01:29.750> only<00:01:30.140> in<00:01:30.350> the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
harassing the enemy last hit only in the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.980 
harassing the enemy last hit only in the
early<00:01:30.950> game<00:01:31.160> and<00:01:31.340> do<00:01:31.700> not<00:01:31.910> auto<00:01:32.150> attack<00:01:32.600> creeps

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
early game and do not auto attack creeps

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.260 
early game and do not auto attack creeps
as<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:33.590> would<00:01:33.710> push<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.190> lane<00:01:34.370> this<00:01:34.880> is<00:01:35.060> bad

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
as it would push the lane this is bad

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.090 
as it would push the lane this is bad
for<00:01:35.600> you<00:01:35.690> as<00:01:35.900> it<00:01:36.020> increases<00:01:36.530> your<00:01:36.560> risk<00:01:36.710> of

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
for you as it increases your risk of

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.870 
for you as it increases your risk of
being<00:01:37.310> ganked

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
being ganked

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.510 
being ganked
so<00:01:38.480> you<00:01:38.870> want<00:01:39.110> to<00:01:39.260> keep<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.770> enemy<00:01:40.070> creep<00:01:40.340> as

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
so you want to keep the enemy creep as

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.730 
so you want to keep the enemy creep as
close<00:01:40.790> to<00:01:41.000> your<00:01:41.150> tower<00:01:41.390> as<00:01:41.690> possible<00:01:42.260> this<00:01:42.680> is

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
close to your tower as possible this is

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.510 
close to your tower as possible this is
done<00:01:43.040> by<00:01:43.220> you

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
done by you

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.270 
done by you
strictly<00:01:44.450> only<00:01:44.870> last<00:01:45.140> hitting<00:01:45.440> and<00:01:45.710> by

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
strictly only last hitting and by
