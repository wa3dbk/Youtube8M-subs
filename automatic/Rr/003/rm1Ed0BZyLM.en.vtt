down i think you know when you're when

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.940 
down i think you know when you're when
you're<00:01:29.899> going<00:01:30.109> losing<00:01:30.469> streaks<00:01:30.770> and

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
you're going losing streaks and

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
different things like that the criticism

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.319 
different things like that the criticism
is<00:01:33.439> going<00:01:33.619> to<00:01:33.710> come<00:01:33.889> and<00:01:34.100> when<00:01:34.639> you<00:01:34.759> win<00:01:34.969> it's

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
is going to come and when you win it's

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.929 
is going to come and when you win it's
quiet<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:35.990> i<00:01:36.469> think<00:01:37.009> it's<00:01:37.249> up<00:01:37.429> and<00:01:37.579> down<00:01:37.639> it

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
quiet so i think it's up and down it

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.160 
quiet so i think it's up and down it
just<00:01:37.969> depends<00:01:38.479> on<00:01:38.600> how<00:01:38.719> the<00:01:38.780> flow<00:01:39.020> of<00:01:39.049> the

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
just depends on how the flow of the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.139 
just depends on how the flow of the
season<00:01:39.530> is<00:01:39.649> going<00:01:39.829> is<00:01:40.100> it<00:01:40.159> bothersome<00:01:40.850> because

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
season is going is it bothersome because

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.080 
season is going is it bothersome because
your<00:01:41.270> body<00:01:41.450> works<00:01:41.780> pretty<00:01:41.960> good<00:01:42.189> haha<00:01:43.189> I<00:01:43.399> mean
