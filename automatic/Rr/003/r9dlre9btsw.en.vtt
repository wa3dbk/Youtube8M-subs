00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.930
 Today it is about another or new 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.820
 subotic may now finally like fashion like that 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.230
 I would have read silver 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.220

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.770
 to wait 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.019
 the whole is supposed to be a book april so 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.999
 yes, I'm really excited about what 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:35.289
 since it will come out now and I would 

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:36.789
 say I have five here 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.949
 picked out and am already 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.030
 really right curious which you 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.699
 to choose from 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.069
 the first book is from jessica spots 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.600
 were daughters of the moon kate that is 

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:48.280
 the first bank of this trilogy 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.109
 and he is already so crazy 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.639
 insanely long on mine 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.260
 I look for it and I thought I would give it 

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:54.639
 Now witch my chance and if you have it 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:58.409
 read and hopefully love too 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.549
 this is about three sisters who 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:03.609
 somehow part of a great prophecy 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:04.840
 sense and something with texts and power 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:07.150
 and I do not know, I'll just leave it 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.380
 I'm surprised and I'm looking forward to that 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.450
 already very much points this can also 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.810
 simply find beautiful and I hope 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.100
 that the content will be just as great 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.550

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.460

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.800

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.600
 read and me by a little bit of 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.800
 let fix and I want that now 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.080
 also necessarily read 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:35.470
 it is a dystopia, and indeed of bern 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:37.290
 perthel dropped all over academies 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.520
 Katie and my god 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.190
 it's kind of like a world here 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.960
 with inquisitors and everything and the best 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.490
 the friend of the friend of the best 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.090
 girlfriend of the protagonist comes 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.710
 somehow in prison and friends god 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.510
 Total weirdness was just out there 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.640
 comes the protagonist tries this 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.050
 then save and but it gets 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.450
 somehow self retracted that has 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.469
 getting so exciting and me 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.649
 but just the three chambers 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.390
 or see the b3 spine 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.439
 together just so pretty shelf out 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.670
 that but who wants to have absolutely 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.410
 I will not get it until I have the 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.420
 first read and loved and 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.500
 so I would like to be in the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.230
 I chose april then I chose 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.900
 traffic in winter star in the storm that is 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.709
 the first part of this trilogy and the 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.420
 is unfortunately only as a print that 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.540
 I'll tell you because here today no the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.799
 is unfortunately only available as e book version 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.080
 I 've got you lucky 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.400
 still as printversion and i love you 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.959
 simply I think the cover right 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.190
 fantastic and she has unfortunately 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.599
 somehow not that much either 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.390
 received attention 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.489
 neither on castle nor in any way so 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.019
 general senses and that's why 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.480
 I read that now and maybe you 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.440
 also convince and maybe yes 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.180
 I do not know either 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.590
 I have no idea what it's about me 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.450
 do not let it surprise you 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.290
 and if you feel like it 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.030
 what it is about then it was for it 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.540
 the penultimate book I have what me 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.040
 I also chose a dystopia 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.600
 and I think so 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.400
 already many many of you have read 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.510
 and loved and I hang there somehow 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.090
 still afterwards, although I do the whole 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.359
 Trilogy stand on the shelf 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.310
 deleted and there I am called weapons 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.989
 I would really like to read it now 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.200
 Slowly it's real time after me 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.549
 really at 123 on the shelf and have 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.139
 if you want me to see you 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.760
 Then imagine that then write 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.799
 I like the comments that her 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.370
 what you want me to read this 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.470
 my God 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.630
 this video and zeal conflicts i hope 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.959
 you forgive me but sometimes well 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.519
 you have that unfortunately and the last book 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.230
 what I chose and there I am 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.900
 I actually rather by clarion fixed 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.190
 because she always has that as a profile picture 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.430
 and you probably already know of 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.650
 I'm talking about the kiss of the tiger and 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.840
 I think this cover is so pretty 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.010
 and then I have a two and three in the 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.019
 shelf stand and the fourth year 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.910
 meanwhile also appeared and it 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.669
 I would like to go crazy with you now 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.010
 did not like to start 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.810
 God, yes, I want that in any case 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.410
 so I will not be here right away 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.630
 still 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.280
 nature and you do not care anymore 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.710
 I would understand I link 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.450
 you all books in the infobox three 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.360
 I will be interested in the content and 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.400
 then was killed 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.019
 I'm curious what book in the end 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.060
 it comes out and I'm glad 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.950
 Insane on it is then read 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.180

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.550

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:32.779
