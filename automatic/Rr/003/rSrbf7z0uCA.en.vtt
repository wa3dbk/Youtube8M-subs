00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
pigments and I'm just gonna randomly

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.970 
pigments and I'm just gonna randomly
apply<00:00:46.760> them<00:00:47.030> all<00:00:47.239> over<00:00:47.539> the<00:00:47.750> nail<00:00:47.930> so<00:00:48.800> I'm<00:00:48.859> just

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
apply them all over the nail so I'm just

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.150 
apply them all over the nail so I'm just
gonna<00:00:49.160> start<00:00:49.520> over<00:00:49.910> here<00:00:50.120> and<00:00:50.710> just<00:00:51.710> really

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
gonna start over here and just really

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.619 
gonna start over here and just really
randomly<00:00:53.590> pop<00:00:54.590> them<00:00:54.800> on<00:00:55.239> this<00:00:56.239> one<00:00:56.449> actually

randomly pop them on this one actually

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.229 
randomly pop them on this one actually
really<00:00:57.109> reminds<00:00:57.530> me<00:00:57.590> of<00:00:57.739> rose<00:00:58.190> notion<00:00:58.879> which

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
really reminds me of rose notion which

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.569 
really reminds me of rose notion which
is<00:00:59.269> in<00:00:59.719> the<00:00:59.809> new<00:01:00.019> modern<00:01:00.320> folklore<00:01:00.739> collection

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
is in the new modern folklore collection

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.580 
is in the new modern folklore collection

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.610 
that's cured now and what I'm gonna do
is<00:02:35.550> I'm<00:02:36.180> gonna<00:02:36.239> go<00:02:36.480> back<00:02:36.690> in<00:02:36.870> with<00:02:36.900> my<00:02:37.230> black

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
is I'm gonna go back in with my black

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:46.160 
is I'm gonna go back in with my black
pool<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.640> put<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.720> over<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.500> top<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:45.989> I'll

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
pool and put this over the top and I'll

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.759 
pool and put this over the top and I'll
see<00:02:46.549> just<00:02:47.549> remember<00:02:48.030> not<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.140> go<00:02:49.260> too<00:02:49.320> thick

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
see just remember not to go too thick

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.710 
see just remember not to go too thick
with<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.010> black<00:02:50.130> pool<00:02:52.820> because<00:02:53.820> it<00:02:54.299> likes<00:02:54.570> to

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
with the black pool because it likes to

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:05.600 
with the black pool because it likes to
wrinkle<00:02:55.290> in<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.650> lamp<00:02:55.890> if<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.400> do<00:02:57.680> excuse<00:02:58.680> me

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:14.410 

okay<00:03:06.240> so<00:03:06.300> pull<00:03:06.810> off<00:03:07.370> any<00:03:08.370> excess

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.900 

like<00:03:15.290> that<00:03:15.500> now<00:03:16.100> i<00:03:16.400> will<00:03:16.580> be<00:03:16.610> doing<00:03:16.760> some

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
like that now i will be doing some

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.790 
like that now i will be doing some
carving<00:03:17.510> on<00:03:17.630> this<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.170> i'm<00:03:18.440> going<00:03:18.590> to<00:03:18.709> leave

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
carving on this so i'm going to leave

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.300 
carving on this so i'm going to leave
that<00:03:18.830> to<00:03:18.950> set<00:03:19.400> off<00:03:19.610> for<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:19.940> little<00:03:20.209> bit<00:03:20.390> just<00:03:21.310> to

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
that to set off for a little bit just to

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.860 
that to set off for a little bit just to
let<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.580> solvents<00:03:23.150> evaporate<00:03:23.690> in<00:03:23.840> the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
let the solvents evaporate in the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.020 
let the solvents evaporate in the
shellac<00:03:24.319> and<00:03:24.650> then<00:03:25.069> it'd<00:03:25.190> be<00:03:25.340> easier<00:03:25.670> to<00:03:25.730> carve

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
shellac and then it'd be easier to carve

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.699 
shellac and then it'd be easier to carve
in<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.390> meantime<00:03:29.569> i've<00:03:29.959> got<00:03:30.170> a<00:03:30.200> little<00:03:30.530> pad

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
in the meantime i've got a little pad

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.010 
in the meantime i've got a little pad
here<00:03:31.010> with<00:03:31.190> some<00:03:31.400> disperse<00:03:31.880> or<00:03:32.660> 99%<00:03:33.410> IPA<00:03:34.250> on<00:03:35.020> a

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
here with some disperse or 99% IPA on a

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.080 
here with some disperse or 99% IPA on a
limb<00:03:36.230> free<00:03:36.530> pad<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:37.100> then<00:03:37.670> what<00:03:37.850> you'll<00:03:37.970> be

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
limb free pad and then what you'll be

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.190 
limb free pad and then what you'll be
needing<00:03:38.420> is<00:03:38.690> a<00:03:39.400> smallish<00:03:40.660> stylus<00:03:41.660> because<00:03:41.989> i'm

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
needing is a smallish stylus because i'm

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.750 
needing is a smallish stylus because i'm
gonna<00:03:42.290> be<00:03:42.350> carving<00:03:42.650> out<00:03:42.920> some<00:03:42.950> flowers<00:03:43.730> in

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
gonna be carving out some flowers in

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.100 
gonna be carving out some flowers in
this<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:45.459> then<00:03:46.459> we'll<00:03:46.790> use<00:03:47.060> this<00:03:47.330> to<00:03:47.570> wipe<00:03:47.810> off

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
this and then we'll use this to wipe off

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.780 
this and then we'll use this to wipe off
the<00:03:48.290> excess<00:03:48.620> blackpool<00:03:49.280> as<00:03:49.580> we<00:03:50.090> carve<00:03:51.730> okay<00:03:52.730> so

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
the excess blackpool as we carve okay so

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.090 
the excess blackpool as we carve okay so
I<00:03:52.940> think<00:03:53.060> that's<00:03:53.239> good<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:53.660> go<00:03:53.810> now<00:03:54.019> so<00:03:54.590> what

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
I think that's good to go now so what

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:02.100 
I think that's good to go now so what
I'm<00:03:55.190> gonna<00:03:55.310> do<00:03:56.650> is<00:03:57.650> start<00:03:58.220> with<00:03:59.739> cleaning<00:04:00.940> and

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
I'm gonna do is start with cleaning and

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.180 
I'm gonna do is start with cleaning and
then<00:04:03.110> I'm<00:04:03.380> just<00:04:03.530> going<00:04:03.650> to<00:04:03.680> be<00:04:03.769> doing<00:04:03.890> some

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
then I'm just going to be doing some

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:12.340 
then I'm just going to be doing some
leaves<00:04:10.239> so<00:04:11.239> we<00:04:11.360> need<00:04:11.540> to<00:04:11.600> do<00:04:11.720> is<00:04:11.810> carve<00:04:12.170> out

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
leaves so we need to do is carve out

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.220 
leaves so we need to do is carve out
your<00:04:12.380> design<00:04:12.800> and<00:04:13.269> just<00:04:14.269> wipe<00:04:14.690> off<00:04:16.810> in<00:04:17.810> between

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
your design and just wipe off in between

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:41.760 
your design and just wipe off in between
carving

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.320 

and<00:04:42.770> I'm<00:04:42.860> just<00:04:42.979> making<00:04:43.340> up<00:04:43.400> a<00:04:43.550> random<00:04:43.969> flower

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
and I'm just making up a random flower

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:53.700 
and I'm just making up a random flower
design<00:04:46.120> but<00:04:47.120> you<00:04:47.180> can<00:04:47.360> do<00:04:47.509> whatever<00:04:48.169> you<00:04:48.560> want

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.589 

the<00:04:54.710> thing<00:04:54.919> I<00:04:55.009> like<00:04:55.159> about<00:04:55.189> this<00:04:55.610> is<00:04:56.150> it's

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
the thing I like about this is it's

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:58.330 
the thing I like about this is it's
quite<00:04:56.780> messy<00:04:57.139> but<00:04:57.469> it<00:04:57.560> looks<00:04:57.770> all<00:04:57.979> quite

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
quite messy but it looks all quite

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:05.920 
quite messy but it looks all quite
abstract<00:05:03.340> all<00:05:04.340> right<00:05:04.460> then<00:05:05.240> if<00:05:05.330> you<00:05:05.389> can<00:05:05.599> see

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
abstract all right then if you can see

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.929 
abstract all right then if you can see
that<00:05:06.139> I'm<00:05:06.800> just<00:05:06.979> going<00:05:07.099> to<00:05:07.129> look<00:05:07.310> that<00:05:07.580> for<00:05:07.789> 10

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:07.939 
that I'm just going to look that for 10

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:10.240 
that I'm just going to look that for 10
seconds<00:05:08.599> I<00:05:08.810> just<00:05:09.319> quickly<00:05:09.500> lock<00:05:09.770> that<00:05:09.889> for<00:05:10.099> 10

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
seconds I just quickly lock that for 10

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.070 
seconds I just quickly lock that for 10
seconds<00:05:10.759> because<00:05:10.849> I<00:05:11.000> wanted<00:05:11.360> you<00:05:11.509> just<00:05:11.539> to<00:05:11.810> see

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
seconds because I wanted you just to see

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.879 
seconds because I wanted you just to see
the<00:05:12.229> design<00:05:12.560> and<00:05:13.930> then<00:05:14.930> if<00:05:15.050> you<00:05:15.139> can<00:05:15.319> see<00:05:15.650> the

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
the design and then if you can see the

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:20.709 
the design and then if you can see the
actual<00:05:17.379> metallic<00:05:18.379> pigments<00:05:19.330> showing<00:05:20.330> through

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:20.719 
actual metallic pigments showing through

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:24.159 
actual metallic pigments showing through
there<00:05:20.990> and<00:05:21.289> they<00:05:21.409> did<00:05:21.560> really<00:05:22.009> really<00:05:22.250> nice<00:05:23.169> so

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
there and they did really really nice so

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.679 
there and they did really really nice so
if<00:05:24.259> I<00:05:24.319> was<00:05:24.439> doing<00:05:24.650> this<00:05:24.740> on<00:05:24.860> a<00:05:24.889> client<00:05:25.430> I<00:05:25.689> would

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:26.689 
if I was doing this on a client I would

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:29.580 
if I was doing this on a client I would
I<00:05:27.259> would<00:05:27.500> probably<00:05:27.740> do<00:05:28.009> one<00:05:28.310> finger<00:05:28.759> at<00:05:28.849> a<00:05:28.879> time

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
I would probably do one finger at a time

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.439 
I would probably do one finger at a time
lock<00:05:30.590> it<00:05:30.800> for<00:05:30.979> 10<00:05:31.159> seconds<00:05:31.669> and<00:05:31.939> go<00:05:32.120> on<00:05:32.240> to<00:05:32.360> the

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
lock it for 10 seconds and go on to the

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.779 
lock it for 10 seconds and go on to the
next<00:05:32.599> one<00:05:32.900> etc<00:05:33.560> and<00:05:33.770> then<00:05:33.860> cure<00:05:34.159> them<00:05:34.370> all<00:05:34.520> for

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
next one etc and then cure them all for

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:36.999 
next one etc and then cure them all for
two<00:05:34.939> minutes<00:05:35.300> at<00:05:36.020> the<00:05:36.169> end<00:05:36.319> so<00:05:36.650> I'll<00:05:36.710> just<00:05:36.860> go

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 
two minutes at the end so I'll just go

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.399 
two minutes at the end so I'll just go
and<00:05:37.129> cure<00:05:37.370> this<00:05:37.550> now<00:05:37.789> and<00:05:38.090> topcoat<00:05:38.689> it<00:05:39.169> and

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
and cure this now and topcoat it and

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:41.110 
and cure this now and topcoat it and
I'll<00:05:39.680> show<00:05:39.710> you<00:05:40.009> okay<00:05:40.400> here's<00:05:40.669> the<00:05:40.819> finished

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
I'll show you okay here's the finished

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.760 
I'll show you okay here's the finished
