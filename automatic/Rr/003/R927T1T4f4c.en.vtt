00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 in science says that the crest puts 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.690
 more affectionate to women and they 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.700
 you put faithful listen well do not look 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.349
 our cell phones today at the academy 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.559
 national science 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.289
 cnh a study applied in 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.760
 prairie mice 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.529
 that were used to investigate the effect 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.529
 of alcohol in social bonds 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.170
 and it was proven that it has very 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.689
 different in males means women 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.730
 Republicans of the mice after 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.620
 of drinking more than usual people 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.100
 he wants to tell but they do not drink them much and 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.920
 I wonder if the anklet is 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.980
 influenced by elliptical effluvia to 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.780
 ethyl person when to be before her 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.030
 he approaches his partner to show him 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.390
 how much he wants it however the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.430
 object of his love in the same state he 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.430
 footprint priest will despise his 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.140
 attention and prefer to meet that 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.140
 suddenly unknown so 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.119
 interesting that just happened this area 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.520
 of longer tail and leaves larger 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.799
 the mice mice farmers do not 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.000
 like the color mice all I like 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.299
 a the laboratory 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.030
 choose and not be the drunk mouse looking for 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.310
 your macho and the drunk mouse look for a 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.189
 Rat a new old man not his partner 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.640
 who likes more pink canaries 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:29.369
 Maybe the reader has lived or suffered 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.710
 a similar scene in a bar after 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.390
 a night of drinks a crazy night but 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.240
 this is the experience of a group of 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.909
 kart and two prairie mice leaves 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.159
 prairie known for its monogamy when 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.119
 they are literally deleted 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.100
 wang titles edited in status or not in 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.990
 normal state are monogamous but when 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:56.700
 they are drunk they are infidels those who 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:57.509
 they speak in mice of father of the first 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.920
 Lady 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.349
 the research was published in the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.679
 Journal of the National Academy of 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:06.539
 sciences line s pradena mice 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.390
 they were used to investigate the effects 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.780
 of alcohol in social bonds and it 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.490
 found that it has multiple effects 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.880
 while drunkenness reinforces the union 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.240
 and sociability of the females the males 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.540
 show a behavior I said I 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.460
 I like you seen 'sons and hell , 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.860
 Prairie mice that take 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:34.950
 attention microtus 28 do not spend hours and 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.590
 they are in state I am an example of 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.200
 fidelity thanks the bonds of the couple 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.910
 They are very strong and last a lifetime by 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.410
 what scientists use them 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.110
 habitually to know the essence 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.959
 biological love home I learn from 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.890
 the mice on this occasion the team of 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.480
 Oregon Health and Science University 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.690
 in portland and 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.450
 sorry that nothing delays you decided 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.569
 cheer up the matter a little with a sip of 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.569
 vodka 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.330
 I'm sorry 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.780
 what to do 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.849
 I think it's the same with the tie 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.769
 against the travel gent today I hope 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.470
 know a newspaper like that makes like super 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.299
 good show and why go but I told him 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.329
 he hears that song like fire against fire 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.250
 is love or chose today forgiveness does not help me 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:46.200
 the same 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:48.210
 except the thing that the vodkas gave him 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.460
 the rats 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.830
 a vodka with orange they gave him 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.770
 they explain in a very funny way in 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.570
 the smithsonian magazine the scientists 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.450
 they introduced male mice and 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.610
 females that were still cleaning in a 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.940
 controlled environment in the laboratory and 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.590
 they offered pure and clean water and on the other 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.510
 side a mixture of water and vodka and 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.660
 remained for a nucleus of hours in a 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.850
 kind of party mice and parties 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.070
 good as we lived from the system because 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.940
 in the background the mice and we are 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.769
 the same 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.970
 true matured in curing all the 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.620
 world behaves the same with him 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.090
 including the ration 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.090
 let's see other aspects, look what
