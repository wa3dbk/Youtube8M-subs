00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.850 
under fifty cents I don't know if other
stores<00:02:23.410> do<00:02:23.650> that<00:02:23.890> but<00:02:24.280> ours<00:02:25.090> does<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:25.989> I<00:02:26.350> mean<00:02:26.590> I

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
stores do that but ours does so I mean I

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.420 
stores do that but ours does so I mean I
was<00:02:27.130> pretty<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:27.820> was<00:02:27.940> pretty<00:02:28.090> good<00:02:28.299> and<00:02:29.430> the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
was pretty that was pretty good and the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.400 
was pretty that was pretty good and the
toll<00:02:31.170> for<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.290> entire<00:02:32.590> bill<00:02:32.860> was<00:02:33.630> 8202<00:02:34.630> with

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
toll for the entire bill was 8202 with

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.360 
toll for the entire bill was 8202 with
40<00:02:35.890> items<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:38.170> if<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:38.739> had<00:02:38.890> not<00:02:39.010> had<00:02:39.280> those

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
40 items and so if I had not had those

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.370 
40 items and so if I had not had those
coupons<00:02:39.760> or<00:02:40.120> just<00:02:40.450> bought<00:02:40.660> whatever<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:41.019> wanted

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
coupons or just bought whatever I wanted

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.020 
coupons or just bought whatever I wanted
and<00:02:41.530> stuff<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.880> would<00:02:43.120> have<00:02:43.209> been<00:02:43.360> 8202<00:02:43.959> plus

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
and stuff it would have been 8202 plus

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.780 
and stuff it would have been 8202 plus
50<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.150> 54<00:02:46.630> so<00:02:47.200> some<00:02:48.070> people<00:02:48.340> think<00:02:48.519> that

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
50 to 54 so some people think that

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.250 
50 to 54 so some people think that
clipping<00:02:49.120> coupons<00:02:49.150> as<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.630> ways<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.900> tie<00:02:50.049> or

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
clipping coupons as the ways to tie or

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.840 
clipping coupons as the ways to tie or
whatever<00:02:50.560> but<00:02:50.830> I<00:02:50.890> totally<00:02:51.220> think<00:02:51.489> it's<00:02:51.670> worth

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
whatever but I totally think it's worth

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.949 
whatever but I totally think it's worth
it<00:02:52.000> because<00:02:52.680> for<00:02:53.680> driving<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:54.940> store<00:02:55.480> and

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
it because for driving to the store and

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.690 
it because for driving to the store and
getting<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.500> newspaper<00:02:57.040> bringing<00:02:57.489> it<00:02:57.549> home

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
getting the newspaper bringing it home

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.509 
getting the newspaper bringing it home
clipping<00:02:58.209> it<00:02:58.330> and<00:02:58.510> then<00:02:58.600> organizing<00:02:59.200> it

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
clipping it and then organizing it

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.880 
clipping it and then organizing it
that's<00:03:00.519> like<00:03:00.610> an<00:03:00.820> hour<00:03:00.970> out<00:03:01.269> of<00:03:01.299> my<00:03:01.510> day<00:03:01.570> and<00:03:02.019> I

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
that's like an hour out of my day and I

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.110 
that's like an hour out of my day and I
just<00:03:03.220> got<00:03:03.370> fifty<00:03:03.970> two<00:03:04.120> dollars<00:03:05.040> worth<00:03:06.040> of<00:03:06.400> free

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
just got fifty two dollars worth of free

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.360 
just got fifty two dollars worth of free
stuff<00:03:07.299> so<00:03:08.080> I<00:03:08.410> definitely<00:03:08.980> think<00:03:09.160> it's<00:03:09.340> worth

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
stuff so I definitely think it's worth

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.320 
stuff so I definitely think it's worth
it<00:03:09.700> and

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
it and

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.450 
it and
I think<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:10.780> should<00:03:10.930> give<00:03:11.020> it<00:03:11.050> a<00:03:11.200> try<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.590> I

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
I think you should give it a try and I

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.420 
I think you should give it a try and I
need<00:03:12.670> any<00:03:12.880> help<00:03:13.000> let<00:03:13.300> me<00:03:13.330> know
