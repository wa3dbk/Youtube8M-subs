00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
depending on where you are in the first

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.030 
depending on where you are in the first
round<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.950> take<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.579> quarterback<00:01:48.030> there<00:01:49.040> but

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
round and take a quarterback there but

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.370 
round and take a quarterback there but
that's<00:01:50.189> just<00:01:50.430> me<00:01:50.700> now<00:01:51.180> talking<00:01:52.170> about

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
that's just me now talking about

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.840 
that's just me now talking about
quarterbacks<00:01:53.009> where's<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.399> top<00:01:53.610> three

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
quarterbacks where's the top three

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.310

quarterbacks<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.570> draft<00:01:54.840> class<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.200> got

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320

Mike London Geno Smith and Matt Barkley

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.389 
Mike London Geno Smith and Matt Barkley
I<00:01:58.610> think<00:01:59.610> in<00:01:59.759> my<00:02:00.450> opinion<00:02:01.159> Glennon<00:02:02.159> will<00:02:02.310> be

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
I think in my opinion Glennon will be

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.830 
I think in my opinion Glennon will be
the<00:02:02.520> first<00:02:02.729> quarterback<00:02:03.090> taken<00:02:03.600> off<00:02:03.719> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
the first quarterback taken off the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.810 
the first quarterback taken off the
board<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.200> then<00:02:04.649> again<00:02:04.920> there's<00:02:05.100> always<00:02:05.700> that

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
board and then again there's always that

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.330 
board and then again there's always that
quarterback<00:02:06.299> who<00:02:06.450> does<00:02:06.630> sneak<00:02:06.930> up<00:02:07.140> later<00:02:08.129> on

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
quarterback who does sneak up later on

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.880 
quarterback who does sneak up later on
after<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.819> combine<00:02:09.239> after<00:02:09.599> interviews<00:02:10.110> after

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.370 
after the combine after interviews after
free<00:02:11.340> agency<00:02:11.819> who<00:02:12.060> will<00:02:12.510> be<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> talks

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.870 
will be I don't know as for these three
guys<00:02:18.740> let's<00:02:19.740> talk<00:02:19.890> about<00:02:19.950> Geno<00:02:20.370> Smith<00:02:20.670> real

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
guys let's talk about Geno Smith real

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.320 
guys let's talk about Geno Smith real
quick<00:02:21.120> he's<00:02:21.330> he's<00:02:21.810> 63<00:02:22.230> 208<00:02:22.980> pounds<00:02:23.190> he's<00:02:24.090> got<00:02:24.300> a

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
quick he's he's 63 208 pounds he's got a

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.360 
quick he's he's 63 208 pounds he's got a
quick<00:02:24.570> release<00:02:24.630> he<00:02:25.410> shows<00:02:25.620> patients<00:02:26.160> in<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
quick release he shows patients in the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.220 
quick release he shows patients in the
pockets<00:02:26.790> but<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:26.970> think<00:02:27.270> his<00:02:27.450> biggest<00:02:27.660> flaw<00:02:28.050> was

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
pockets but I think his biggest flaw was

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.840 
pockets but I think his biggest flaw was
his<00:02:28.410> big<00:02:28.620> games<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.220> reason<00:02:29.490> why<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.640> say

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
his big games and the reason why I say

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.210 
his big games and the reason why I say
that<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.060> when<00:02:30.810> watching<00:02:31.080> tape<00:02:31.470> on<00:02:31.650> Geno<00:02:31.890> Smith

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
that is when watching tape on Geno Smith

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.160 
that is when watching tape on Geno Smith
a<00:02:32.400> lot<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.730> his<00:02:32.880> big<00:02:33.090> place<00:02:33.420> were<00:02:33.630> just<00:02:33.900> awful

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
a lot of his big place were just awful

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.310 
a lot of his big place were just awful
blown<00:02:34.740> coverages<00:02:35.250> he<00:02:35.820> had<00:02:36.600> his<00:02:36.780> receivers

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
blown coverages he had his receivers

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.430 
blown coverages he had his receivers
wide<00:02:37.470> open<00:02:37.980> he<00:02:38.430> exploited<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.480> that's<00:02:40.200> why

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
wide open he exploited it and that's why

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.020 
wide open he exploited it and that's why
he<00:02:40.590> had<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.860> game<00:02:41.190> where<00:02:41.400> head<00:02:41.550> I<00:02:41.580> don't<00:02:41.910> even

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
he had a game where head I don't even

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.790 
he had a game where head I don't even
know<00:02:42.270> what<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.480> was<00:02:42.510> over<00:02:42.870> 500<00:02:43.410> yards<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.770> think

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
know what it was over 500 yards I think

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.890 
know what it was over 500 yards I think
it<00:02:44.100> was<00:02:44.250> eight<00:02:44.640> touchdowns<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.720> was

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
it was eight touchdowns it was

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.810 
it was eight touchdowns it was
ridiculous<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.740> was<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.860> marshal<00:02:47.130> defense<00:02:47.640> that

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
ridiculous it was a marshal defense that

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.230 
ridiculous it was a marshal defense that
was<00:02:48.290> it's<00:02:49.290> not<00:02:49.440> an<00:02:49.620> LSU<00:02:49.950> in<00:02:50.250> Alabama<00:02:50.700> or<00:02:51.000> Notre

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
was it's not an LSU in Alabama or Notre

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.990 
was it's not an LSU in Alabama or Notre
Dame<00:02:51.510> defense<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.710> mean<00:02:52.950> let's<00:02:53.070> let's<00:02:53.400> put

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
Dame defense so I mean let's let's put

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.540 
Dame defense so I mean let's let's put
things<00:02:54.180> into<00:02:54.360> perspective<00:02:54.450> here<00:02:55.200> but<00:02:55.740> I<00:02:56.160> think

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
things into perspective here but I think

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.340 
things into perspective here but I think
he's<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.240> biggest<00:02:57.450> he's<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.080> quarterback

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
he's the biggest he's the quarterback

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.800 
he's the biggest he's the quarterback
with<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.800> biggest<00:02:59.220> upside<00:02:59.700> I<00:02:59.970> think<00:03:00.540> he's<00:03:00.690> the

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
with the biggest upside I think he's the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.140 
with the biggest upside I think he's the
quarterback<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:01.740> boom<00:03:02.370> or<00:03:02.580> bust<00:03:02.790> and

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
quarterback that is boom or bust and

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.450 
quarterback that is boom or bust and
just<00:03:03.720> because<00:03:03.900> I'm<00:03:04.230> gonna<00:03:04.620> say<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.040> because

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
just because I'm gonna say it because

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.770 
just because I'm gonna say it because
you<00:03:05.640> know<00:03:05.760> I'm<00:03:05.910> not<00:03:06.060> saying<00:03:06.300> anything<00:03:06.510> wrong

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
you know I'm not saying anything wrong

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.540 
you know I'm not saying anything wrong
or<00:03:06.900> just<00:03:06.930> because<00:03:07.320> he's<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.500> black<00:03:07.830> quarterback

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
or just because he's a black quarterback

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.180 
or just because he's a black quarterback
does<00:03:08.970> not<00:03:09.210> mean<00:03:09.480> he's<00:03:09.630> an<00:03:09.780> rg3<00:03:10.440> or<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.710> cam

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
does not mean he's an rg3 or a cam

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.010 
does not mean he's an rg3 or a cam

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
does show patience in the pocket which

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.370 
does show patience in the pocket which
is<00:03:18.570> what<00:03:18.750> i<00:03:18.780> like<00:03:19.080> about<00:03:19.460> Geno<00:03:20.460> Smith<00:03:21.380> another

is what i like about Geno Smith another

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.760 
is what i like about Geno Smith another
flaw<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.920> Geno<00:03:23.610> Smith<00:03:23.970> is<00:03:24.150> he<00:03:24.540> throws<00:03:24.870> passes

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
flaw of Geno Smith is he throws passes

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.080 
that are kind of high they're overthrown
and<00:03:28.140> when<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.500> do<00:03:28.680> that<00:03:28.860> in<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.190> NFL<00:03:29.670> your

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
and when you do that in the NFL your

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.090 
and when you do that in the NFL your
receivers<00:03:30.600> are<00:03:30.750> going<00:03:30.960> to<00:03:31.110> tip<00:03:31.320> those<00:03:31.590> passes

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
receivers are going to tip those passes

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.790 
receivers are going to tip those passes
which<00:03:32.280> result<00:03:32.700> in<00:03:32.880> turn<00:03:33.060> in<00:03:33.210> interceptions<00:03:34.080> so

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
which result in turn in interceptions so

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.050 
which result in turn in interceptions so
that's<00:03:34.980> something<00:03:35.220> i<00:03:35.430> didn't<00:03:35.700> know<00:03:35.790> down<00:03:36.030> i

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
that's something i didn't know down i

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.900 
that's something i didn't know down i
did<00:03:36.420> jet<00:03:36.630> down<00:03:36.810> on<00:03:37.020> Geno<00:03:37.290> Smith<00:03:37.590> but<00:03:38.190> overall<00:03:38.760> I

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
did jet down on Geno Smith but overall I

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.460 
did jet down on Geno Smith but overall I
think<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.210> the<00:03:39.330> biggest<00:03:39.450> boom<00:03:39.870> or<00:03:40.020> bust<00:03:40.170> guy

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
think is the biggest boom or bust guy

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.740 
think is the biggest boom or bust guy
you<00:03:41.280> got<00:03:41.400> Matt<00:03:41.730> Barkley<00:03:42.180> who<00:03:42.270> I<00:03:42.330> think<00:03:42.420> is<00:03:42.660> the

you got Matt Barkley who I think is the

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.360 
you got Matt Barkley who I think is the
biggest<00:03:42.900> disappointment<00:03:43.830> in<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.100> draft

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370

he took four losses he was hurt can't

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150 
he took four losses he was hurt can't
really<00:04:09.270> evaluate<00:04:09.900> him<00:04:10.080> anymore<00:04:10.290> his<00:04:10.620> accuracy

um he his decision-making at times is

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.080 
um he his decision-making at times is
questionable<00:04:18.590> I<00:04:19.590> thought<00:04:20.430> Matt<00:04:20.609> Barkley<00:04:20.970> was

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
questionable I thought Matt Barkley was

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.550 
questionable I thought Matt Barkley was
going<00:04:21.330> to<00:04:21.450> be<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.720> number<00:04:21.960> one<00:04:21.989> guy<00:04:22.290> in<00:04:22.320> this

you<00:05:15.110> put<00:05:15.350> pressure<00:05:15.560> you<00:05:15.800> have<00:05:15.919> a<00:05:15.950> guy<00:05:16.190> in<00:05:16.220> his

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
you put pressure you have a guy in his

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.279 
you put pressure you have a guy in his
face<00:05:16.610> he's<00:05:16.910> not<00:05:17.120> moving<00:05:17.419> he's<00:05:17.870> not<00:05:18.050> going<00:05:18.260> to

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
face he's not moving he's not going to

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.800 
face he's not moving he's not going to
go<00:05:18.470> anywhere<00:05:18.710> that's<00:05:19.220> his<00:05:19.460> biggest<00:05:19.700> flaw<00:05:20.120> but

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
go anywhere that's his biggest flaw but

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.960 
go anywhere that's his biggest flaw but
as<00:05:20.960> for<00:05:21.139> his<00:05:21.169> accuracy<00:05:21.650> in<00:05:21.919> my<00:05:22.220> opinion<00:05:22.639> I

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
as for his accuracy in my opinion I

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.790 
as for his accuracy in my opinion I
think<00:05:23.000> it's<00:05:23.479> better<00:05:23.690> than<00:05:23.810> Geno<00:05:24.260> Smith<00:05:24.530> and<00:05:24.740> I

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
think it's better than Geno Smith and I

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.690 
think it's better than Geno Smith and I
think<00:05:25.039> it's<00:05:25.190> better<00:05:25.400> than<00:05:25.520> Matt<00:05:25.850> Barkley's<00:05:26.300> um

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
think it's better than Matt Barkley's um

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.520 
think it's better than Matt Barkley's um
he<00:05:28.700> does<00:05:29.150> throw<00:05:29.330> a<00:05:29.419> lot<00:05:29.600> of<00:05:29.630> short<00:05:29.990> routes<00:05:30.229> so

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
he does throw a lot of short routes so

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.740 
he does throw a lot of short routes so
his<00:05:30.680> deep<00:05:30.919> ball<00:05:31.160> accuracy<00:05:31.789> hasn't<00:05:32.450> really<00:05:32.720> I

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
his deep ball accuracy hasn't really I

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.050 
his deep ball accuracy hasn't really I
don't<00:05:32.990> think<00:05:33.350> has<00:05:33.470> been<00:05:33.650> tested<00:05:34.460> fully<00:05:34.789> but

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
don't think has been tested fully but

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.879 
don't think has been tested fully but
his<00:05:35.180> arm<00:05:35.419> strength<00:05:35.690> is<00:05:35.930> not<00:05:36.080> a<00:05:36.139> question<00:05:36.470> his

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
his arm strength is not a question his

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:38.740 
his arm strength is not a question his
arm<00:05:37.130> strength<00:05:37.340> one<00:05:37.700> when<00:05:38.000> he<00:05:38.120> does<00:05:38.360> throw<00:05:38.570> his

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
arm strength one when he does throw his

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.680 
arm strength one when he does throw his
deep<00:05:38.960> ball<00:05:39.169> there<00:05:39.740> is<00:05:39.950> he<00:05:40.910> can<00:05:41.090> throw<00:05:41.270> a<00:05:41.300> Depot

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
deep ball there is he can throw a Depot

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.430 
deep ball there is he can throw a Depot
so<00:05:41.960> um<00:05:43.270> his<00:05:44.270> biggest<00:05:44.510> flaw<00:05:44.810> like<00:05:45.020> i<00:05:45.110> said<00:05:45.320> is

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
so um his biggest flaw like i said is

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.200 
so um his biggest flaw like i said is
he's<00:05:45.800> heavy<00:05:46.010> footed<00:05:46.310> in<00:05:46.520> the<00:05:46.610> pocket<00:05:47.000> so

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
he's heavy footed in the pocket so

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.210 
he's heavy footed in the pocket so
between<00:05:48.110> the<00:05:48.289> three<00:05:48.470> like<00:05:48.650> i<00:05:48.770> mentioned<00:05:48.830> i

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
between the three like i mentioned i

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.680 
between the three like i mentioned i
think<00:05:49.430> mike<00:05:49.610> glennon<00:05:49.880> will<00:05:50.180> be<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.419> number

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
think mike glennon will be the number

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.379 
think mike glennon will be the number
one<00:05:50.720> guy<00:05:51.050> to<00:05:51.110> go<00:05:51.349> but<00:05:52.070> as<00:05:52.580> for<00:05:52.910> number<00:05:53.240> one

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
one guy to go but as for number one

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.659 
one guy to go but as for number one
overall<00:05:53.570> pick<00:05:54.080> between<00:05:54.830> these<00:05:55.130> guys<00:05:55.370> there's

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
overall pick between these guys there's

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.040 
overall pick between these guys there's
no<00:05:55.820> way<00:05:56.000> a<00:05:56.030> quarterback<00:05:56.570> is<00:05:56.720> going<00:05:56.900> to<00:05:56.960> go

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
no way a quarterback is going to go

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.839 
no way a quarterback is going to go
number<00:05:57.260> one<00:05:57.349> overall<00:05:57.590> there's<00:05:58.099> no<00:05:58.280> way<00:05:58.490> and<00:05:58.729> if

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:58.849 
number one overall there's no way and if

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:00.670 
number one overall there's no way and if
there<00:05:59.000> is<00:05:59.030> you<00:05:59.630> can<00:05:59.660> point<00:05:59.990> it<00:06:00.139> left<00:06:00.380> because

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
there is you can point it left because

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.080 
there is you can point it left because
that<00:06:00.830> would<00:06:00.919> be<00:06:00.950> the<00:06:01.099> dumbest<00:06:01.460> pick<00:06:01.700> a<00:06:01.880> team

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
that would be the dumbest pick a team

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.260 
that would be the dumbest pick a team
can<00:06:02.330> make<00:06:03.400> what<00:06:04.400> do<00:06:04.490> I<00:06:04.580> think<00:06:04.789> these<00:06:04.910> guys<00:06:05.090> will

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
can make what do I think these guys will

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.020 
can make what do I think these guys will
go<00:06:05.510> I<00:06:05.830> think<00:06:06.830> Glennon<00:06:07.220> can<00:06:07.370> take<00:06:07.610> a<00:06:07.639> look<00:06:07.880> at

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
go I think Glennon can take a look at

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.300 
go I think Glennon can take a look at
the<00:06:08.780> arizona<00:06:09.200> cardinals<00:06:09.470> at<00:06:09.830> 7i<00:06:10.280> believe

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
the arizona cardinals at 7i believe

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.400 
the arizona cardinals at 7i believe
they're<00:06:10.639> drafting<00:06:11.090> or<00:06:11.240> Geno<00:06:11.840> Smith<00:06:12.139> can<00:06:12.320> go

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
they're drafting or Geno Smith can go

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.180 
they're drafting or Geno Smith can go
seven<00:06:12.710> to<00:06:12.800> the<00:06:12.830> two<00:06:13.220> the<00:06:13.340> Cardinals<00:06:13.520> um<00:06:15.190> the

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
seven to the two the Cardinals um the

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.070 
seven to the two the Cardinals um the
Chiefs<00:06:16.490> I<00:06:16.849> just<00:06:17.479> I<00:06:17.660> don't<00:06:17.720> know<00:06:17.900> what<00:06:18.050> they're

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
Chiefs I just I don't know what they're

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.450 
Chiefs I just I don't know what they're
gonna<00:06:18.229> do<00:06:18.500> I<00:06:18.740> don't<00:06:19.130> know<00:06:19.190> what<00:06:19.250> they're<00:06:19.340> gonna

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
gonna do I don't know what they're gonna

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.360 
gonna do I don't know what they're gonna
do<00:06:19.700> I<00:06:19.729> had<00:06:20.090> I<00:06:20.330> don't<00:06:20.810> know<00:06:20.990> its<00:06:21.380> head<00:06:21.830> that's

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
do I had I don't know its head that's

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.100 
do I had I don't know its head that's
why<00:06:22.520> I<00:06:22.550> love<00:06:22.760> this<00:06:23.000> you<00:06:23.419> just<00:06:23.660> don't<00:06:23.900> know

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
why I love this you just don't know

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.730 
why I love this you just don't know
until<00:06:24.500> it<00:06:24.680> happens<00:06:24.710> so<00:06:26.530> Barkley<00:06:27.530> though<00:06:27.710> I

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
until it happens so Barkley though I

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.490 
until it happens so Barkley though I
think<00:06:27.950> he's<00:06:28.310> gonna<00:06:28.460> be<00:06:28.520> late<00:06:28.880> a<00:06:29.180> late<00:06:30.139> first

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
think he's gonna be late a late first

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.529 
think he's gonna be late a late first
and<00:06:30.800> early<00:06:31.070> second<00:06:31.490> I<00:06:31.610> don't<00:06:32.060> see<00:06:32.300> him<00:06:32.510> being

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
and early second I don't see him being

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:35.500 
and early second I don't see him being
up<00:06:32.960> there<00:06:33.200> I<00:06:33.440> think<00:06:33.860> he'll<00:06:34.039> he'll<00:06:34.340> go<00:06:34.550> late<00:06:35.270> um

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:35.510 
up there I think he'll he'll go late um

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.519 
up there I think he'll he'll go late um
late<00:06:36.380> first<00:06:36.680> early<00:06:36.919> second

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:37.529 
late first early second

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:40.189 
late first early second
probably<00:06:37.889> really<00:06:38.099> second<00:06:38.489> but<00:06:38.869> gina<00:06:39.869> smith

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 
probably really second but gina smith

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:42.259 
probably really second but gina smith
and<00:06:40.559> and<00:06:40.919> mike<00:06:41.219> glennon<00:06:41.489> I<00:06:41.789> think<00:06:42.089> we'll<00:06:42.239> be

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:42.269 
and and mike glennon I think we'll be

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:45.439 
and and mike glennon I think we'll be
gone<00:06:42.629> by<00:06:42.899> the<00:06:42.959> 20<00:06:43.439> 20th<00:06:44.039> pick<00:06:44.309> I<00:06:44.549> think<00:06:45.149> it's

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:45.449 
gone by the 20 20th pick I think it's

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:46.999 
gone by the 20 20th pick I think it's
fair<00:06:45.689> to<00:06:45.719> say<00:06:45.869> they'll<00:06:46.139> be<00:06:46.259> gone<00:06:46.379> by<00:06:46.559> the<00:06:46.619> 20th

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:47.009 
fair to say they'll be gone by the 20th

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:49.309 
fair to say they'll be gone by the 20th
pick<00:06:47.219> because<00:06:47.459> teams<00:06:48.209> have<00:06:48.749> shown<00:06:49.049> to<00:06:49.169> get

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 
pick because teams have shown to get

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:51.829 
pick because teams have shown to get
desperate<00:06:49.559> and<00:06:50.449> they'll<00:06:51.449> take<00:06:51.659> that

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:51.839 
desperate and they'll take that

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:55.099 
desperate and they'll take that
quarterback<00:06:52.939> early<00:06:53.939> like<00:06:54.599> the<00:06:54.719> Minnesota

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:55.109 
quarterback early like the Minnesota

00:06:55.109 --> 00:06:57.469 
quarterback early like the Minnesota
