00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
presentation is pretty weak then you can

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.699 
presentation is pretty weak then you can
provide<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:30.060> appropriate<00:03:30.390> intervention<00:03:31.380> at

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
provide the appropriate intervention at

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.500 
provide the appropriate intervention at
the<00:03:31.890> end<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.160> lesson<00:03:32.489> provides<00:03:32.850> some<00:03:33.239> sort

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
the end of the lesson provides some sort

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.050 
the end of the lesson provides some sort
of<00:03:33.540> test<00:03:33.870> quiz<00:03:34.530> or<00:03:34.560> assessment<00:03:35.519> so<00:03:35.940> the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
of test quiz or assessment so the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.699 
of test quiz or assessment so the
students<00:03:36.390> realize<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:36.930> this<00:03:37.080> information

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
students realize that this information

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.020 
students realize that this information
that<00:03:37.800> they're<00:03:37.950> learning<00:03:38.130> is<00:03:38.370> valuable<00:03:38.730> and

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
that they're learning is valuable and

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.640 
that they're learning is valuable and
that<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:39.360> find<00:03:39.630> these<00:03:39.780> sessions<00:03:39.989> important

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
that you find these sessions important

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.350 
that you find these sessions important
as<00:03:41.190> we<00:03:41.400> all<00:03:41.489> know<00:03:41.610> there's<00:03:41.820> a<00:03:41.910> variety<00:03:42.030> of

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
students that like being dominant will

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.140 
students that like being dominant will
be<00:03:52.350> forced<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.800> take<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.040> back<00:03:53.310> seat<00:03:53.550> and<00:03:53.880> allow
