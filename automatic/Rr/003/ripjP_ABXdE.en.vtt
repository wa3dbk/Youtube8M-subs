spanner<00:00:16.670> screwdriver<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.300> math<00:00:18.449> sensor

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
spanner screwdriver and the math sensor

itself<00:00:19.220> no<00:00:20.220> I'm<00:00:20.580> not<00:00:20.760> gonna<00:00:20.880> go<00:00:21.060> from<00:00:21.510> this

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
itself no I'm not gonna go from this

itself no I'm not gonna go from this
instance<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.949> spanner<00:00:23.279> essentially<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.390> to

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
instance this spanner essentially is to

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.470 
instance this spanner essentially is to
just<00:00:25.890> disconnect<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.519> negative<00:00:26.670> terminal<00:00:27.330> so

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
just disconnect the negative terminal so

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.810 
just disconnect the negative terminal so

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
you know back to square one so

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.870 
you know back to square one so
essentially<00:01:51.259> sooner<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.439> say<00:01:53.159> old<00:01:53.310> one<00:01:53.490> taken
