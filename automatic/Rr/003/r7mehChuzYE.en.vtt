00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.539 

this<00:00:01.290> is<00:00:01.500> my<00:00:01.680> model<00:00:01.890> of<00:00:02.190> ATP<00:00:02.790> synthase<00:00:03.360> and

00:00:04.539 --> 00:00:04.549 
this is my model of ATP synthase and

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.299 
this is my model of ATP synthase and
it's<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.759> working<00:00:06.120> model<00:00:06.330> because<00:00:07.020> top<00:00:07.830> portion

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
it's a working model because top portion

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.890 
it's a working model because top portion
rotates<00:00:10.190> just<00:00:11.190> like<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.340> normal<00:00:11.570> ATP<00:00:12.570> synthase

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
rotates just like a normal ATP synthase

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.029 
rotates just like a normal ATP synthase
molecule<00:00:13.620> would<00:00:14.420> so<00:00:15.420> have<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.859> marbles<00:00:16.859> here

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
molecule would so have is marbles here

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.590 
molecule would so have is marbles here
and<00:00:17.539> they<00:00:18.539> represent<00:00:19.080> hydrogen<00:00:19.619> ions<00:00:20.600> and

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
and they represent hydrogen ions and

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.800 
and they represent hydrogen ions and
come<00:00:22.109> into<00:00:22.380> an<00:00:22.529> opening<00:00:23.240> right<00:00:24.240> here<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
come into an opening right here in the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.750 
come into an opening right here in the
top<00:00:25.019> part<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.760> this<00:00:26.760> portion<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:28.670> let<00:00:29.670> me

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
top part of this this portion and let me

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.780 
top part of this this portion and let me
demonstrate<00:00:29.970> how<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.570> works<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:34.790> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
demonstrate how this works so the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.290 
demonstrate how this works so the
hydrogen<00:00:36.120> ion<00:00:36.450> falls<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.879> it's<00:00:38.879> picked<00:00:39.180> up

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
hydrogen ion falls in and it's picked up

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.979 
hydrogen ion falls in and it's picked up
by<00:00:39.450> these<00:00:39.510> receptors<00:00:40.910> then<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.239> molecule

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
by these receptors then the molecule

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.940 
by these receptors then the molecule
rotates<00:00:43.640> like<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.320> it's<00:00:46.320> ready<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.649> accept

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
rotates like so and it's ready to accept

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.750 
rotates like so and it's ready to accept
another<00:00:48.140> hydrogen<00:00:49.140> ion<00:00:49.469> or<00:00:49.649> marble<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.640> this

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
another hydrogen ion or marble in this

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.900 
another hydrogen ion or marble in this
case<00:00:51.890> so<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.010> does<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.980> protein

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
case so it does that and the protein

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.599 
case so it does that and the protein
eventually<00:00:57.539> after<00:00:58.079> accepting<00:00:58.920> more<00:00:59.100> marbles

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
eventually after accepting more marbles

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.720 
eventually after accepting more marbles
it<00:01:00.420> will<00:01:00.510> rotate<00:01:00.690> all<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.170> way<00:01:01.289> around<00:01:01.730> until

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
it will rotate all the way around until

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.679 
it will rotate all the way around until
it<00:01:03.719> gets<00:01:03.930> back<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.580> plate<00:01:05.580> Samsung<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
it gets back to this plate Samsung the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.899 
it gets back to this plate Samsung the
same<00:01:06.900> spot<00:01:07.140> where<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.320> started<00:01:07.619> at<00:01:07.909> and

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
same spot where it started at and

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.609 
same spot where it started at and
there's<00:01:09.030> an<00:01:09.210> opening<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> bottom<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.470> this

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
there's an opening on the bottom of this

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.179 
there's an opening on the bottom of this
structure<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.210> it<00:01:12.210> allows<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.860> hydrogen<00:01:13.860> ions

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
structure to it allows the hydrogen ions

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.499 
structure to it allows the hydrogen ions
or<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.790> marbles<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.689> leave<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:18.030> once<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.360> gets

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
or the marbles to leave so once it gets

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.920 
or the marbles to leave so once it gets
the<00:01:18.689> right<00:01:18.720> position<00:01:21.830> let's<00:01:22.830> see<00:01:23.070> here<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.930> have

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the right position let's see here I have

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:33.170 
the right position let's see here I have
to<00:01:25.080> get<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> test<00:01:25.439> right<00:01:30.380> yep<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:32.729> hydrogen

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
to get a test right yep and the hydrogen

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:41.179 
to get a test right yep and the hydrogen
ion<00:01:33.509> or<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> marble<00:01:34.259> will<00:01:34.409> drop<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:40.130> there<00:01:41.130> we

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
ion or the marble will drop out there we

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.010 
ion or the marble will drop out there we
go<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.049> how<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:44.659> ATP<00:01:45.659> synthase

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
go so that is how the ATP synthase

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.399 
go so that is how the ATP synthase
molecule<00:01:46.920> would<00:01:47.100> actually<00:01:47.670> work<00:01:48.229> how<00:01:49.229> it

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
molecule would actually work how it

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.990 
molecule would actually work how it
actually<00:01:49.759> generates<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.180> energy<00:01:51.329> to

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
actually generates the energy to

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.230 
actually generates the energy to
recharge<00:01:54.000> your<00:01:54.360> ATP<00:01:55.250> molecules<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.490> I

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
recharge your ATP molecules and I

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.429 
recharge your ATP molecules and I
actually<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.659> representation<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.409> that

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
actually have a representation of that

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.109 
actually have a representation of that
here

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
here

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.940 
here
this<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.329> ADP<00:02:01.079> which<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:03.590> uncharged<00:02:04.590> form

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
this is ADP which is the uncharged form

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.020 
this is ADP which is the uncharged form
and<00:02:05.700> here<00:02:06.390> we<00:02:06.540> have<00:02:07.099> the<00:02:08.099> extra<00:02:08.670> phosphate

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
and here we have the extra phosphate

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.180 
and here we have the extra phosphate
group

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
group

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.050 
group
and<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:12.470> two<00:02:12.740> will<00:02:13.070> come<00:02:13.310> together<00:02:13.520> on<00:02:13.760> the

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
and the two will come together on the

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.340 
and the two will come together on the
enzyme<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.660> then<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:16.870> phosphate<00:02:17.870> attaches

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
enzyme and then the phosphate attaches

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.870 
enzyme and then the phosphate attaches
onto<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:19.810> ADP<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:21.170> form<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.590> ATP<00:02:22.340> molecule

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
onto the ADP to form the ATP molecule

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.110 
onto the ADP to form the ATP molecule
and<00:02:23.500> then<00:02:24.500> this<00:02:24.650> is<00:02:24.860> released<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.460> you<00:02:26.060> know

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
and then this is released and you know

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.030 
and then this is released and you know
it's<00:02:26.480> usable<00:02:26.990> for<00:02:27.500> your<00:02:28.490> cells<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.830> without

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
it's usable for your cells so without

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.510 
it's usable for your cells so without
getting<00:02:31.340> into<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:31.610> complicated<00:02:33.160> process<00:02:34.160> on

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
getting into the complicated process on

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.670 
getting into the complicated process on
the<00:02:34.610> bottom<00:02:34.970> now<00:02:35.870> this<00:02:36.050> molecule<00:02:36.230> that's

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
the bottom now this molecule that's

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.980 
the bottom now this molecule that's
basically<00:02:37.220> how<00:02:37.460> it<00:02:37.550> would<00:02:37.640> be<00:02:37.810> molecule<00:02:38.810> works

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
basically how it would be molecule works

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.730 
basically how it would be molecule works
with<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.130> rotation<00:02:40.550> of<00:02:40.880> this<00:02:41.180> top<00:02:41.480> harsh<00:02:41.870> top

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
with the rotation of this top harsh top

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.610 
with the rotation of this top harsh top
