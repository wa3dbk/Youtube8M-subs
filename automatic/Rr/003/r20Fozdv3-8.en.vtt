00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.040
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.580
 pokemon channel episode very well 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.650
 this time I bring a lot of people the 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.309
 it's quite simple but 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.709
 well you know nothing I hope that this 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.090
 video we get to the 50 likes how it 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.410
 they are developing all the videos of 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.750
 pokemon channel that from what I see 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.430
 they triumph enough but also please 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.320
 give it a little importance in the guide 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.600
 from pokémon heartgold to have warned 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.140
 how important I wanted but fuck 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.509
 that giving a little more man and nothing 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.339
 now start with joe has one of the 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.120
 ibi evolutions 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:41.359
 first of all what you see is 50 and you 252 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:45.199
 points in speed 252 points in attack 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:47.960
 special and the remaining 6 in ps do not 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.499
 see is what the super workout is worth 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.920
 of the soccer ball very well 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:58.010
 movements ray volt change or the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.980
 shadow and loud voice all the attacks 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.890
 all learn by m 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.810
 even lightning I do not know why later 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.490
 nature let's take nature 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.760
 scary to raise our speed 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.110
 since it has an incredible speed 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.770
 and let us down the attack because we do not want 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.720
 Attack skill absorb electric is 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.130
 a very good skill but that very 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.630
 good that every time he makes an attack 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.540
 electric you cure or you can 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.570
 predict a change and get it out and heal and 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.409
 is very good and object chosen glasses 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.890
 that goes up 1.5 the special attack if 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.479
 we add that plus the speed it has 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.759
 solutions we would arrive but one 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.680
 barbarity to the now statistics 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.070
 final I will tell you how much we will get to 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.750
 paste load of accumulated energies 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.850
 and here you can see the statistics 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.830
 end of holten when it reaches the 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.450
 100 surprising level since the 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.380
 defense and special defense are very 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.840
 low 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.970
 It is a pokémon that dies very fast but 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.950
 Well let's pass and show you the 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:03.800
 comment one by one 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:07.130
 ps 272 good is not bad attack 149 we 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.580
 you need attack for nothing defense 156 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.510
 very little defense special attack 319 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.670
 It was worth more to absorb the chosen 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.390
 sorry you have wrong the glasses 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.690
 chosen we can achieve an attack 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.340
 special I think of 400 if something does not 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.290
 I have the calculation well but we have a 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.510
 good special attack summation glasses 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.810
 chosen 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.790
 the special event 226 how good is 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.230
 better than defense very remarkably 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:41.500
 but I do not think we'll last long and 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.049
 speed 394 to this is the strong point 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.190
 of on its speed 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.349
 then we put you elected to 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.030
 take advantage of its great speed to paste 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.950
 with a good special attack adding 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.450
 the ranges chosen for that we have 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.730
 put flipping changes let's say the 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.709
 rival 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.690
 powerful before us and we know that no 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.370
 we are going to kill him with a volt change 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.260
 apart from changing pokemon like 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.720
 we are and take out the counter of primal 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.360
 let's take a great life but with 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.790
 a damn volt change then we say 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.470
 that I have very good pokemon and apart 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.510
 colombo the shadow we load gamers 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.810
 sobradísimo saves to have so many 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.450
 focus but good even with bolt or 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.459
 change we would also load so 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.200
 well then I liked the episode of 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.940
 today to give like I told you if 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.480
 we got 50 likes and until next time 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.480
 see you
