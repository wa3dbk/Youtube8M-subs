00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.750 

so<00:00:01.860> on<00:00:01.979> my<00:00:02.129> wife's<00:00:02.810> Passat<00:00:04.609> 2005<00:00:05.609> Passat<00:00:06.180> wagon

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:07.760 
so on my wife's Passat 2005 Passat wagon

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.120 
so on my wife's Passat 2005 Passat wagon
with<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.880> 1/8<00:00:09.269> turbo<00:00:09.719> engine<00:00:10.080> in<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:10.349> she's

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
with the 1/8 turbo engine in it she's

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.339 
with the 1/8 turbo engine in it she's
been<00:00:11.340> complaining<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.570> heat<00:00:12.929> isn't

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
been complaining that the heat isn't

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.189 
been complaining that the heat isn't
very<00:00:13.740> warm<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.570> correct<00:00:15.809> it's<00:00:16.139> not

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
very warm and that is correct it's not

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.779 
very warm and that is correct it's not
very<00:00:16.529> warm

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
very warm

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.090 
very warm
it<00:00:18.180> looks<00:00:18.330> like<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.720> heater<00:00:18.960> cores<00:00:19.529> on<00:00:19.949> these

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
it looks like the heater cores on these

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.400 
it looks like the heater cores on these
cars<00:00:20.430> tend<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.180> fill<00:00:21.660> up<00:00:21.779> with<00:00:21.960> deposits<00:00:22.680> and

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
cars tend to fill up with deposits and

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.019 
cars tend to fill up with deposits and
would<00:00:25.410> restrict<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.250> flow<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.789> coolant

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
would restrict the flow of coolant

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.670 
would restrict the flow of coolant
through<00:00:27.630> them<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.140> don't<00:00:28.289> get<00:00:28.439> enough

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
through them so you don't get enough

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.370 
through them so you don't get enough
heat<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> passenger<00:00:29.490> compartment

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
heat in the passenger compartment

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.380 
heat in the passenger compartment
unfortunately<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:32.120> replacing<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.210> heater

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
unfortunately the replacing the heater

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.040 
unfortunately the replacing the heater
core<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.809> probably<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.350> best<00:00:34.620> choice<00:00:35.840> to<00:00:36.840> fix

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
core is probably the best choice to fix

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.650 
core is probably the best choice to fix
it<00:00:37.230> but<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.489> behind<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> dash<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.570> have

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
it but it's behind the dash and you have

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.090 
it but it's behind the dash and you have
take<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> center<00:00:40.140> console<00:00:40.500> out<00:00:40.680> probably

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
take the center console out probably

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.799 
take the center console out probably
take<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> seed<00:00:41.340> set<00:00:41.790> take<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.149> dash<00:00:42.390> apart

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
take the seed set take the dash apart

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.319 
take the seed set take the dash apart
it's<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> big<00:00:43.559> job<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:44.010> change<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.180> I'm

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
and I've already done one one flow step

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.609 
and I've already done one one flow step
of<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> flush<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.240> then<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.080> bucket<00:01:22.439> here<00:01:22.590> I

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
of the flush and then this bucket here I

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.200 
of the flush and then this bucket here I
don't<00:01:22.740> know<00:01:22.920> how<00:01:23.040> well<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.400> camera<00:01:23.909> will<00:01:24.119> pick

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
don't know how well the camera will pick

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.249 
don't know how well the camera will pick
it<00:01:24.240> up<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:24.630> there's<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.840> fair<00:01:25.049> amount<00:01:25.140> of

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
it up but there's a fair amount of

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.920 
it up but there's a fair amount of
sediment<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:26.009> has<00:01:26.070> already<00:01:26.340> come<00:01:26.729> out<00:01:26.930> so

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
sediment that has already come out so

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.050 
sediment that has already come out so
that's<00:01:28.049> that's<00:01:28.530> good<00:01:31.460> so<00:01:32.460> for<00:01:32.610> my<00:01:32.759> flush

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
that's that's good so for my flush

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:47.919 
that's that's good so for my flush
process

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:55.480 

I'm<00:01:48.929> going<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.350> start<00:01:49.530> by<00:01:49.770> pouring<00:01:50.039> in<00:01:51.920> some

CLR calcium lime rust remover got from

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.660 
CLR calcium lime rust remover got from
the<00:02:00.630> hardware<00:02:00.959> store<00:02:01.189> this<00:02:02.189> was<00:02:02.429> to<00:02:02.549> help

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
the hardware store this was to help

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.440 
the hardware store this was to help
dissolve<00:02:03.209> scaly<00:02:03.840> deposits<00:02:05.209> it's<00:02:06.209> kind<00:02:06.390> of
