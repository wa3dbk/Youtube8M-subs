anything but when I started linseed oil
was<00:00:47.629> very<00:00:47.899> much<00:00:48.079> used<00:00:48.409> to<00:00:48.589> look<00:00:48.800> after<00:00:48.980> the

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
was very much used to look after the

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.310 
was very much used to look after the
willow<00:00:49.519> we<00:00:50.120> would<00:00:50.269> linseed<00:00:50.839> the<00:00:50.960> bat<00:00:51.140> at<00:00:51.289> the

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
willow we would linseed the bat at the

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.040 
willow we would linseed the bat at the
end<00:00:51.649> of<00:00:51.769> every<00:00:52.010> season<00:00:52.249> and<00:00:52.690> store<00:00:53.690> it<00:00:53.809> nicely

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
end of every season and store it nicely

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.549 
end of every season and store it nicely
onto<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:55.010> winter<00:00:55.670> nets<00:00:55.879> as<00:00:56.179> I<00:00:56.239> got<00:00:57.109> older<00:00:57.140> and

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
onto the winter nets as I got older and

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.160 
onto the winter nets as I got older and
wiser<00:00:57.850> realize<00:00:58.850> it<00:00:59.059> was<00:00:59.210> best<00:00:59.420> to<00:00:59.600> be<00:00:59.719> kept<00:00:59.960> in

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
wiser realize it was best to be kept in

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.500 
wiser realize it was best to be kept in
that<00:01:00.350> in<00:01:00.499> a<00:01:00.620> room<00:01:00.859> with<00:01:01.100> a<00:01:01.280> more<00:01:01.640> consistent

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
that in a room with a more consistent

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.990 
that in a room with a more consistent
room<00:01:03.260> temperature<00:01:03.859> rather<00:01:04.250> than<00:01:04.519> a<00:01:04.550> heated

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
room temperature rather than a heated

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.420 
room temperature rather than a heated
room<00:01:05.210> which<00:01:05.510> can<00:01:05.659> dry<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:05.960> bat<00:01:06.229> out

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
room which can dry the bat out

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.670 
room which can dry the bat out
unnecessarily<00:01:07.430> so<00:01:08.120> sometimes<00:01:08.960> I<00:01:09.050> would<00:01:09.530> keep

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
unnecessarily so sometimes I would keep

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.469 
unnecessarily so sometimes I would keep
it<00:01:09.860> in<00:01:09.950> that<00:01:10.010> in<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.400> garage<00:01:10.790> or<00:01:11.180> something

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
it in that in the garage or something

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.780 
it in that in the garage or something
like<00:01:11.540> that<00:01:11.600> which<00:01:12.290> is<00:01:12.320> a<00:01:12.470> lot<00:01:12.830> cooler<00:01:13.100> end<00:01:13.549> of

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
like that which is a lot cooler end of

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.450 
like that which is a lot cooler end of
the<00:01:13.909> season<00:01:14.360> maybe<00:01:14.840> take<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:15.440> actual<00:01:16.010> grips

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
the season maybe take the actual grips

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.880 
the season maybe take the actual grips
off<00:01:16.700> which<00:01:17.210> might<00:01:17.540> be<00:01:17.690> a<00:01:17.720> little<00:01:17.900> bit<00:01:18.049> worn<00:01:18.320> but

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890
