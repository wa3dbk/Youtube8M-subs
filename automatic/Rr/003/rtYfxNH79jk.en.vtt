this is pure speculation if you look at

i<00:03:16.530> believe<00:03:16.830> it's<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.130> two-shot<00:03:17.580> magazine<00:03:18.180> now<00:03:18.690> i

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
i believe it's a two-shot magazine now i

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.530 
i believe it's a two-shot magazine now i
don't<00:03:18.840> know<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.230> exact<00:03:19.560> math<00:03:19.830> but<00:03:20.580> maybe<00:03:21.030> the

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
don't know the exact math but maybe the

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.259 
don't know the exact math but maybe the
original<00:03:22.050> slip<00:03:22.320> magazine<00:03:22.830> may<00:03:23.580> not<00:03:23.910> have<00:03:24.120> been

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
original slip magazine may not have been

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.210 
original slip magazine may not have been
enough<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.660> take<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:25.019> up<00:03:25.080> two<00:03:25.320> maybe<00:03:25.530> three

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
enough to take that up two maybe three

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.130 
enough to take that up two maybe three
shots<00:03:26.519> or<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:26.880> this<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.239> pure<00:03:27.450> speculation<00:03:27.480> but

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
shots or so this is pure speculation but

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.729 
shots or so this is pure speculation but
let's<00:03:28.290> just<00:03:28.350> assume<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:28.830> does<00:03:29.010> even<00:03:29.940> if<00:03:30.739> this

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
let's just assume it does even if this

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.580 
let's just assume it does even if this
mod<00:03:32.070> were<00:03:32.610> to<00:03:33.090> give<00:03:33.300> you<00:03:33.450> one<00:03:33.690> extra<00:03:33.989> shot<00:03:34.320> on

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
mod were to give you one extra shot on

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.890 
mod were to give you one extra shot on
some<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.250> lower<00:03:35.550> magazine<00:03:36.000> weapons<00:03:36.690> with

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
some of the lower magazine weapons with

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.979 
some of the lower magazine weapons with
two<00:03:37.080> or<00:03:37.200> three<00:03:37.230> shots<00:03:37.670> it's<00:03:38.670> still<00:03:39.150> not<00:03:39.540> worth

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
two or three shots it's still not worth

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.590 
two or three shots it's still not worth
the<00:03:40.620> fusion<00:03:41.100> cores<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.730> credits<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.360> time

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
the fusion cores the credits the time

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.210 
the fusion cores the credits the time
the<00:03:42.900> grind<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.320> is<00:03:43.440> going<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.709> take<00:03:43.769> them<00:03:44.130> you

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
the grind that is going to take them you

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.740 
the grind that is going to take them you
could<00:03:44.370> just<00:03:44.459> absolutely<00:03:45.180> just<00:03:45.420> go<00:03:45.570> get<00:03:45.690> a

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
could just absolutely just go get a

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.979 
could just absolutely just go get a
better<00:03:46.019> weapon<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:46.709> on<00:03:47.459> top<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.700> that<00:03:47.850> i<00:03:48.209> still

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
better weapon and on top of that i still

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.590 
better weapon and on top of that i still
think<00:03:49.290> that<00:03:49.790> reload<00:03:50.790> speed<00:03:51.060> especially<00:03:51.300> on

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
think that reload speed especially on

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.420 
think that reload speed especially on
sidearms<00:03:52.200> is<00:03:52.290> going<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.500> be<00:03:52.590> far<00:03:52.860> superior<00:03:53.070> to

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
sidearms is going to be far superior to

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.220 
sidearms is going to be far superior to
magazine<00:03:54.030> size<00:03:54.300> especially<00:03:54.510> when<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.080> comes

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
magazine size especially when it comes

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.280 
magazine size especially when it comes
to<00:03:55.410> adding<00:03:55.620> mods<00:03:55.950> so<00:03:56.820> this<00:03:57.690> is<00:03:57.900> one<00:03:58.110> of<00:03:58.140> the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
to adding mods so this is one of the

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.710 
to adding mods so this is one of the
first<00:03:58.530> mas<00:03:58.890> that<00:03:59.220> i<00:03:59.280> can<00:03:59.459> say<00:03:59.670> unless<00:03:59.880> i'm<00:04:00.239> just

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
first mas that i can say unless i'm just

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.180 
first mas that i can say unless i'm just
personally<00:04:01.230> missing<00:04:01.530> something<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:01.980> not

understanding the way it works it's

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.870

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
hopes that it'll get buffed especially

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.140 
hopes that it'll get buffed especially
since<00:04:21.840> ice<00:04:22.080> storm<00:04:22.590> is<00:04:22.800> clearly<00:04:23.370> superior<00:04:23.640> in

since ice storm is clearly superior in

almost every way

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
exist when ice storm exists to just

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:29.930 
exist when ice storm exists to just
maybe<00:04:28.860> hope<00:04:29.100> that<00:04:29.280> it<00:04:29.370> gets<00:04:29.460> bumped<00:04:29.820> but

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
maybe hope that it gets bumped but

let's go ahead and jump on over to

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.750 
let's go ahead and jump on over to

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
the original color of two weeks ago you

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.400 
the original color of two weeks ago you
can<00:05:05.730> actually<00:05:05.880> do<00:05:06.150> it<00:05:06.270> now<00:05:06.450> which<00:05:07.140> is<00:05:07.260> actually

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
can actually do it now which is actually

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.290 
can actually do it now which is actually
cool<00:05:07.680> because<00:05:07.860> the<00:05:08.070> colors<00:05:08.400> is<00:05:08.760> a<00:05:08.790> pretty<00:05:09.120> nice

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
cool because the colors is a pretty nice

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.580 
cool because the colors is a pretty nice
color<00:05:10.070> so<00:05:11.070> the<00:05:11.490> other<00:05:11.700> two<00:05:11.940> items<00:05:12.360> for<00:05:13.080> console

color so the other two items for console

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.760 
color so the other two items for console
yes<00:05:14.040> prime<00:05:14.910> continuity<00:05:15.660> which<00:05:16.140> the<00:05:16.680> original

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
yes prime continuity which the original

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.500 
yes prime continuity which the original
continuity<00:05:17.580> was<00:05:17.760> plus<00:05:18.000> thirty<00:05:18.240> percent

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
continuity was plus thirty percent
