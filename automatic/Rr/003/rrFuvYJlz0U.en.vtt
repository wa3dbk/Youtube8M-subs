 do this by pressing this button it is also completely gone so before 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:07.360
 people with the big fingers off people who don't like nails and that's how it is waste 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.709
 bah difficult to press 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:13.059
 can make a quick impression sprinter club a little bit open 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.509
 then you can open further 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.070
 it's a smart magnetic clasp like some will have 8 at the 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.050
 new series with boxing will be present it's pure 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.949
 closure with a 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.009
 you can still see a little bit here 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.789
 is the one on the left and right side of the doctor 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.710
 camera is built into the screen 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.710
 something I sometimes noticed that noble can not go as far as they sell 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.660
 that is also because it is of course here 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.850
 is stopped at the dog ranter 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.960
 what is actually the maximum angle 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.570
 another possible open can so you can give it nice and completely flat 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.050
 to lay 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.360
 and also when you enter a standard set in an open book standard 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.760
 then you probably won't be able to get the screen well enough 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.050
 person came there a minus it is a shame that he is not that far 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.790
 come 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.370
 open for normal use 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.400
 if it's just flat on 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.400
 the table stands or you put it on him then to the garage 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.460
 he looks at the rest of the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.810
 of the connection starting with the keyboard being the first to notice 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.670
 the trainer 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.060
 post are actually that is that comparison 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.760
 with the keyboard with almost half that 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.300
 of the width of the entire country that is much more than with the three 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.540
 other ss 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.540
 say one and a half percent on 5 May 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.570
 while the back until she is feeling a keyboard herself will be best so the 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.120
 keys that they are not smaller 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.159
 and you can 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.090
 did you come here 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.970
 very much 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.030
 with support for browsing the internet while typing 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.620
 very pleasant 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.900
 in the management aspect 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.540
 but with his 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.480
 ing is about an art 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.430
 pieter small not too big I have quite well that of the brands there too 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.820
 the pain on my and drawing tablet has become a lot bigger I think this is you 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.120
 own about a third of the entire width from his motor skills 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.120
 theme 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.640
 there is a button on the bottom that I hereby and that is for me as a PC 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.620
 user incredibly gang 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.330
 a fight with click on the left on ourselves a coat of fagot 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.540
 on the right so the helicopter service is actually called as a left mouse button 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.469
 and not as a right mouse button 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.909
 the more so that many banks do need a very clear turning point 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.939
 is in trouble, the striker was pulling 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.419
 meet the state 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:23.539
 stick there 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.219
 so that is in itself 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.689
 that became a different expectation 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:31.729
 then comments about the keyboard itself 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:33.989
 being as I said are full of heavy 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.910
 keyboardist you can have can have the row with your fingers 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.109
 you can also just look 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.659
 normal type i am myself a municipality with 10 fingers typing after it goes here 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.119
 excellent on 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.209
 a few small dots that have stood out in recent days 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.959
 here this is the capslock key which i think is too large 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:56.930
 points at the moment I left with the tears type people I need the notebook 

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:59.119
 just as stuck to super farmers cinema 

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:02.659
 then my little finger is on the a and it is very soon on a white Christmas key 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:03.940
 his ride-on mower 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.930
 in my case, nothing sees in the way and that while the shift key below it 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:07.460
 sit 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.989
 it is smaller 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.019
 while you yes in daily use you probably have multiple uses 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.469
 and the shift key then the Christmas run key the city falls my dad roach that 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:18.049
 that it is different 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.299
 I think they don't like it so much 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.310
 but maybe something is very different for you, but at least I had to wear it 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.859
 get used to 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.549
 and the language test the ball of animals that do take time 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.469
 just in the normal way 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:31.729
 well that may i have nothing to do with the hardware with keyboard itself 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:33.919
 what i am very clear about that is 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.539
 perfect as far as I am concerned the crowded attack moment is very good you follow 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:39.159
 a very clear resistance 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.290
 I really think the article itself is just very pleasant 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:47.389
 but also thought of what happened instead of missing in the past is here the ten 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:47.799
 says 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.689
 working out doutzen 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:54.129
 with that the CD or DVD in the drive set I get rejected 

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:58.569
 that is also the function keys director top row 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.809
 we see if it can get a good picture 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:05.809
 this with the right one key f2 f3 presenter tom egbers 12 that's it 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:07.170
 exactly the same as it 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.679
 the operation on a pc keyboard 

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:12.350
 what is different is that the function keys pass 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.840
 last year was normally function keys no comment with the fn key pressed 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.019
 You are already standing here symbolically, I do not know if they are clearly visible 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:20.999
 the video 

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:24.129
 but if you press on the ftc compressed air on the screen lighter 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:26.439
 but also less slightly higher in the afternoon trade 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:28.919
 has three opens the dashboard 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.780
 9 the export rules for a fourth premium exactly despatched it 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:36.729
 a brief memo is therefore needed to be able to make those names precisely 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.930
 at least what stands out is the integration of the software and 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.990
 hardware has gone enormously far we have this product 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.990
 I like it very well I must say I think it is very beautiful 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.229
 the function keys there seven nights 9 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.610
 10 11 and 12 those are the media keys you see on the outside 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.809
 you don't have to stop the CD player for 30 seconds 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:02.740
 but regrets that they can also forward a nickname here 

00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:04.719
 posing city and stopping 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:05.819
 and with this 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:07.870
 with velveweg 12 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.939
 what the volume is turned up and down 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:13.120
 and then the device collapsed when addressed 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.860
 on two sides of the keyboard door you will find further from the 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.430
 speakers yes 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.720
 I can be brief about that there is not for compassion quality 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.039
 therefore for an emergency team fikse and I as good as the among others 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.070
 Worth the effort but really enjoy the sound that headphones have 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:30.900
 use a role of external parties 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.669
 beh 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.089
 because here it is little further in and the sound is little that celebrates 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.430
 what's really nice is that really good 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.539
 newspaper 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:42.810
 so that you are very clear and stereo effect people 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.139
 you can listen 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.139
 for example if a reindeer wants to be sent then you will hear 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.110
 opportunities 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.080
 keyboard rained when the sound starts here and ends there and that is 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.479
 very nice done very subtle but nice 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.349
 yes I can always do some more things like that 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:01.479
 herein the clock of the 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.999
 the on off button 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:06.900
 it is also completely healthy and the one with bizarre 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.190
 and so tasty in the next video 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.170
 elaborate on the operation from which the operation of the on / off button is 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.830
 of course logical but then you would namely turn the computer on and off 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.360
 but then the operation of the on off button and the display that it is in 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.449
 next video a little more on one 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:24.830
 thanks for looking ahead and maybe see you soon for this video 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.810
 today from another reviews 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.309
 Do you have a 

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:31.699
 comments about you think it's good or not good what he can tell 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:34.870
 just let me know after writing a ticket to the video where can I 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.490
 rightly wants the next version 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.569
 but further improve 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:39.020
 at fort Kijkduin and see you soon
