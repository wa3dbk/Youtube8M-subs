00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.410
 the presence of vines and varicose veins in 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.599
 legs is a reason for dissatisfaction 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.940
 aesthetics for men and women 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.500
 to understand this subject we will see 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.500
 first as they are today 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.790
 blood is pumped from the heart to 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.180
 within the arteries which in turn 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:34.090
 take this blood to all cells 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.060
 already have the function of training the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.489
 blood back to the heart all this 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.820
 The way the blood travels is called 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.520
 circulation in some cases due to the 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.790
 weakness of the vein wall may 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.330
 occur, but the blood 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.070
 have difficulty getting back to the heart 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.620
 this process causes the pressure of the 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.750
 blood within the veins increases 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.670
 describing the wall of these vessels and 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.260
 originating the screens of ectasy the 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.260
 and varicose veins 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.650
 The cell g caxies are very thin voids and 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.810
 present on the skin has the 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.869
 width is similar to a hair 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.180
 and are distributed with a network along the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.270
 surface of the skin due to its 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.330
 are reddish or bluish 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.080
 very visible making too much discomfort 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.960
 aesthetic 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.960
 already the varicose veins in greater caliber and are 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.810
 tortuosity forming palpable strands and 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.950
 visible just below the skin may 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.500
 to cause pain, tiredness, swelling of the legs 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.850
 often require treatments 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.009
 surgical 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.009
 both screens as the caxias 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.520
 varicose veins in uncertain origin but are 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.390
 associated with several factors such as 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.670
 genetics obesity poor circulation due 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.119
 to the habit of sitting or standing 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.520
 for a long period of time 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.289
 contraceptives and gestation or 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.049
 hormone replacement 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.269
 the most common sites of appearance 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.630
 are thighs and legs 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:18.510
 the practice of physical activity using 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.850
 elastic compression stockings and suspension 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.470
 the use of hormones may improve the 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.850
 blood circulation in the limbs 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.010
 inferior 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.500
 helping to prevent the onset of 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.500
 of these undesirable voids 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.030
 sclerotherapy consists of applying 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.030
 substances inside the vessels 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.700
 that they close and be absorbed 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.950
 by the body to get a good 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.980
 results are needed some 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.980
 sessions the amount the interval between 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.900
 they will be defined by your doctor 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.480
 according to your case 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.019
 after the treatment a dressing is made 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.660
 to fulfill the vessels treated by helping 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:07.230
 in their closure and reducing stains 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.599
 purple dressing should be removed after 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.130
 the period of time determined by your 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.590
 doctor 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.810
 on the following days the 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.180
 are gradually absorbed 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.849
 by the body allowing the skin 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.459
 regain its uniform appearance 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:26.060
 patients are advised not to 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.950
 weight lifting and moderate walking 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:37.079
 should also refuse with the legs 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:40.290
 elevated sclerotherapy should not be 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:43.350
 performed by pregnant women who 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:47.160
 are breastfeeding patients who have 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.920
 allergy substances used patients 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.950
 with arterial disease patients with 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:57.049
 advanced diabetes and patients with 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.049
