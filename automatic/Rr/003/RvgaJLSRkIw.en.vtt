was<00:01:26.149> but<00:01:26.659> basically<00:01:27.050> it<00:01:27.380> I<00:01:27.590> guess<00:01:28.420> Maui<00:01:29.420> was<00:01:29.810> a

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
was but basically it I guess Maui was a

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.920 
was but basically it I guess Maui was a
demigod<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:30.890> think<00:01:31.640> everybody<00:01:32.240> that's

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
demigod I think everybody that's

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.160

basically it Maui was a demigod so this
is<00:01:36.470> basically<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.550> demigod<00:01:38.890> anyways<00:01:39.890> so<00:01:40.190> this

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
is basically a demigod anyways so this

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
than a drop because most of these

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.110 
than a drop because most of these
prehistoric<00:02:11.900> creatures<00:02:12.890> are<00:02:13.130> bigger<00:02:13.670> than

prehistoric creatures are bigger than
most<00:02:14.390> animals<00:02:15.019> today<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:18.110> as<00:02:18.440> you<00:02:18.890> can<00:02:19.010> see<00:02:19.070> it

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
most animals today so as you can see it

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.539 
most animals today so as you can see it
has<00:02:19.579> a<00:02:19.610> really<00:02:20.060> kind<00:02:20.540> of<00:02:20.660> clear<00:02:21.110> skin<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:21.950> I'm

has a really kind of clear skin and I'm
I'm<00:02:23.000> pretty<00:02:23.269> sure<00:02:23.540> as<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:23.930> evolve<00:02:24.320> the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
I'm pretty sure as you evolve the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.590 
I'm pretty sure as you evolve the
creature<00:02:24.829> he<00:02:25.220> will<00:02:25.370> have<00:02:25.579> some<00:02:25.850> dots<00:02:26.299> or

first<00:02:54.709> section<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.310> was<00:02:55.459> saying<00:02:55.700> that<00:02:55.970> I<00:02:56.420> did<00:02:56.690> a

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
first section I was saying that I did a

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.660 
first section I was saying that I did a
bit<00:02:56.930> of<00:02:56.959> google<00:02:57.500> search<00:02:57.829> about<00:02:58.100> some<00:02:58.400> kind<00:02:58.640> of

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
bit of google search about some kind of

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.039 
bit of google search about some kind of
demigod<00:02:59.359> now<00:03:00.200> as<00:03:00.320> you<00:03:00.440> can<00:03:00.560> see<00:03:01.180> this<00:03:02.180> is<00:03:02.420> the

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
demigod now as you can see this is the

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.710 
demigod now as you can see this is the
second<00:03:03.859> form<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.609> this<00:03:05.329> water<00:03:06.049> creature<00:03:06.440> and

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
second form of this water creature and

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.610 
second form of this water creature and
what<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:08.840> looks<00:03:09.049> like<00:03:09.290> is<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.560> there's<00:03:10.370> some

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
what it looks like is that there's some

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.949 
what it looks like is that there's some
splash<00:03:12.620> or<00:03:13.160> maybe<00:03:13.639> stripes<00:03:14.060> or<00:03:14.359> stripes<00:03:14.690> I

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
splash or maybe stripes or stripes I

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.170 
splash or maybe stripes or stripes I
guess<00:03:15.169> I<00:03:15.350> call<00:03:15.769> it<00:03:15.949> stripes

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
guess I call it stripes

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.160 
guess I call it stripes
and<00:03:18.159> that's<00:03:19.159> pretty<00:03:19.730> pretty<00:03:20.239> much<00:03:20.510> it<00:03:20.750> for<00:03:21.079> the

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
and that's pretty pretty much it for the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.990 
and that's pretty pretty much it for the
change<00:03:21.500> is<00:03:21.709> everything<00:03:22.159> else<00:03:22.280> still<00:03:22.760> looks

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849 
why actually we just passed the point

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:43.120 
why actually we just passed the point
but<00:04:41.389> if<00:04:41.479> you<00:04:41.630> look<00:04:41.870> at<00:04:42.050> it<00:04:42.169> from<00:04:42.380> a<00:04:42.530> side<00:04:42.860> you

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
but if you look at it from a side you

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.230 
but if you look at it from a side you
see<00:04:43.370> that<00:04:44.000> dark<00:04:44.419> parts<00:04:45.020> basically<00:04:45.740> looks<00:04:46.340> it's

see that dark parts basically looks it's

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.730 
see that dark parts basically looks it's
it<00:04:47.900> has<00:04:48.289> a<00:04:48.729> feel<00:04:49.729> of<00:04:49.759> depth<00:04:50.419> and<00:04:50.599> then<00:04:51.289> the

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
it has a feel of depth and then the

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.070 
it has a feel of depth and then the
white<00:04:52.070> part<00:04:52.580> portion<00:04:52.970> usually<00:04:53.630> feels<00:04:53.930> like

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
white part portion usually feels like

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.830

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.260 
it's embossed up from the skin of the
creature<00:04:57.139> I<00:04:57.620> just<00:04:58.430> thought<00:04:58.580> that<00:04:58.639> it's<00:04:59.030> pretty

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
creature I just thought that it's pretty

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.350 
creature I just thought that it's pretty
cool<00:04:59.690> compared<00:05:00.620> it<00:05:00.770> when<00:05:01.039> you<00:05:01.130> fall<00:05:01.490> I<00:05:01.729> guess

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
cool compared it when you fall I guess

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.930 
cool compared it when you fall I guess
if<00:05:02.509> you<00:05:02.630> go<00:05:02.810> back<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.830> its<00:05:03.979> first<00:05:04.250> form<00:05:04.669> and

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
if you go back to its first form and

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.629 
if you go back to its first form and
then<00:05:05.030> look<00:05:05.210> at<00:05:05.330> this<00:05:05.570> form<00:05:05.930> you<00:05:06.710> notice<00:05:07.099> there

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
then look at this form you notice there

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.270 
then look at this form you notice there
is<00:05:07.880> a<00:05:07.909> difference<00:05:08.509> it<00:05:08.870> it<00:05:09.710> looks<00:05:09.949> much

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
is a difference it it looks much

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:17.040 
is a difference it it looks much
smoother<00:05:10.940> on<00:05:11.380> the<00:05:12.380> first<00:05:12.650> floor

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.020 

all<00:05:18.050> right<00:05:18.230> so<00:05:18.410> this<00:05:18.590> is<00:05:18.830> the<00:05:19.130> creature<00:05:19.460> in<00:05:19.790> its

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
all right so this is the creature in its

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.990 
all right so this is the creature in its
adult<00:05:20.420> form<00:05:20.540> right<00:05:21.170> now<00:05:21.200> as<00:05:21.650> you<00:05:21.890> can<00:05:22.010> see<00:05:22.070> it

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
adult form right now as you can see it

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.050 
adult form right now as you can see it
does<00:05:23.330> this<00:05:23.570> sort<00:05:23.870> of<00:05:24.050> swim<00:05:24.650> okay<00:05:25.400> that<00:05:25.820> looks

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
does this sort of swim okay that looks

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.550 
does this sort of swim okay that looks
like<00:05:26.270> it<00:05:26.450> was<00:05:26.540> going<00:05:26.600> for<00:05:27.110> a<00:05:27.140> fray<00:05:27.530> or

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
like it was going for a fray or

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.880 
like it was going for a fray or
something<00:05:28.130> like<00:05:28.250> that<00:05:32.620> good

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
something like that good

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.280 
something like that good
so<00:05:34.310> that's<00:05:35.180> pretty<00:05:35.420> cool<00:05:35.720> I<00:05:35.780> think<00:05:35.930> the

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
so that's pretty cool I think the

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.880 
so that's pretty cool I think the
animation<00:05:36.830> of<00:05:36.920> that<00:05:37.450> we<00:05:38.450> are<00:05:38.660> back<00:05:39.260> with<00:05:39.620> the

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
animation of that we are back with the

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.890 
animation of that we are back with the
fourth<00:05:40.190> form<00:05:40.670> and<00:05:40.970> this<00:05:41.180> is<00:05:41.360> the<00:05:41.570> evolution

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
fourth form and this is the evolution

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.350 
fourth form and this is the evolution
screen<00:05:42.530> basically<00:05:43.160> it<00:05:43.280> says<00:05:43.490> this<00:05:43.730> dinosaur

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
screen basically it says this dinosaur

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.870 
screen basically it says this dinosaur
is<00:05:44.420> one<00:05:44.780> of<00:05:44.900> the<00:05:45.080> few<00:05:45.620> fossils<00:05:45.980> from<00:05:46.520> the

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
is one of the few fossils from the

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.170 
is one of the few fossils from the
dinosaur<00:05:47.600> age<00:05:47.840> to<00:05:48.740> be<00:05:48.920> discovered<00:05:49.640> in<00:05:49.820> New

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
dinosaur age to be discovered in New

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.490 
dinosaur age to be discovered in New
Zealand<00:05:50.650> so<00:05:51.650> it<00:05:52.040> has<00:05:52.280> a<00:05:52.310> stamp<00:05:53.110> based<00:05:54.110> on<00:05:54.320> this

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
Zealand so it has a stamp based on this

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.320 
Zealand so it has a stamp based on this
dinosaur<00:05:55.010> now<00:05:55.220> one<00:05:55.580> of<00:05:55.610> the<00:05:55.730> things<00:05:55.940> I<00:05:56.030> want<00:05:56.240> to

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
dinosaur now one of the things I want to

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.200 
dinosaur now one of the things I want to
say<00:05:56.540> is<00:05:56.860> I'm<00:05:57.860> not<00:05:58.130> a<00:05:58.160> researcher<00:05:58.880> I<00:05:58.910> don't

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
say is I'm not a researcher I don't

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.830 
say is I'm not a researcher I don't
really<00:05:59.420> know<00:05:59.780> much<00:06:00.110> about<00:06:00.170> dinosaurs<00:06:01.010> but

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
really know much about dinosaurs but

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.890 
really know much about dinosaurs but
assuming<00:06:02.840> that<00:06:03.670> they<00:06:04.670> made<00:06:04.880> a<00:06:04.910> stamp<00:06:05.330> out<00:06:05.630> of<00:06:05.810> a

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
assuming that they made a stamp out of a

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.930 
assuming that they made a stamp out of a
dinosaur<00:06:06.470> that's<00:06:06.620> found<00:06:06.950> in<00:06:07.100> New<00:06:07.280> Zealand<00:06:07.310> in

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
dinosaur that's found in New Zealand in

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.420 
dinosaur that's found in New Zealand in
that<00:06:08.150> I<00:06:08.420> guess<00:06:09.080> this<00:06:09.320> game<00:06:09.620> has<00:06:09.950> said

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
that I guess this game has said

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.510 
that I guess this game has said
something<00:06:11.140> about<00:06:12.140> that<00:06:12.530> would<00:06:13.250> mean<00:06:13.490> that

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
something about that would mean that

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.420 
something about that would mean that
there<00:06:14.240> weren't<00:06:14.480> many<00:06:14.960> dinosaurs<00:06:15.710> found<00:06:16.160> on

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
there weren't many dinosaurs found on

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.330 
there weren't many dinosaurs found on
New<00:06:16.610> Zealand<00:06:17.060> so<00:06:17.870> that's<00:06:18.860> my<00:06:19.010> assumption

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
New Zealand so that's my assumption

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.580 
New Zealand so that's my assumption
that's<00:06:19.700> all<00:06:19.910> I<00:06:20.120> just<00:06:20.420> wanted<00:06:20.870> to<00:06:21.080> say<00:06:21.350> that

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
that's all I just wanted to say that

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.950 
that's all I just wanted to say that
because<00:06:21.830> that's<00:06:22.760> what<00:06:22.910> I<00:06:23.030> feel<00:06:23.360> when<00:06:23.600> I<00:06:23.660> first

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
because that's what I feel when I first

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.410 
because that's what I feel when I first
read<00:06:24.260> this<00:06:24.530> and<00:06:24.920> then<00:06:25.100> the<00:06:25.460> last<00:06:25.730> evolution

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:26.420 
read this and then the last evolution

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:36.520 
read this and then the last evolution
script<00:06:29.680> now<00:06:30.680> this<00:06:31.100> is<00:06:31.340> the<00:06:31.850> third<00:06:32.420> form<00:06:35.500> or<00:06:36.500> I

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
script now this is the third form or I

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.190 
script now this is the third form or I
mean<00:06:37.040> four<00:06:37.400> form<00:06:37.760> this<00:06:37.970> is<00:06:38.180> the<00:06:38.210> last<00:06:38.540> form<00:06:38.960> as

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 
mean four form this is the last form as

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.100 
mean four form this is the last form as
you<00:06:39.350> can<00:06:39.470> see<00:06:39.710> it's<00:06:40.400> much<00:06:40.850> more<00:06:41.120> bright<00:06:41.630> in<00:06:41.870> the

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
you can see it's much more bright in the

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.200 
you can see it's much more bright in the
colours<00:06:42.410> of<00:06:42.440> yellow<00:06:43.010> and<00:06:44.140> D<00:06:45.580> there's<00:06:46.580> no<00:06:46.790> depth

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
colours of yellow and D there's no depth

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.080 
colours of yellow and D there's no depth
any<00:06:47.510> mono<00:06:47.750> feel<00:06:48.080> there's<00:06:48.380> a<00:06:48.470> depth<00:06:48.850> from<00:06:49.850> those

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
any mono feel there's a depth from those

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.140 
any mono feel there's a depth from those
colors<00:06:50.660> because<00:06:51.340> there<00:06:52.340> is<00:06:52.610> a<00:06:52.640> white

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
colors because there is a white

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.360 
colors because there is a white
outlining<00:06:53.930> it<00:06:54.170> it<00:06:54.380> looks<00:06:54.590> like<00:06:54.770> it's<00:06:54.950> a<00:06:55.100> paint

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.370 
outlining it it looks like it's a paint

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.340 
outlining it it looks like it's a paint
job<00:06:55.460> that's<00:06:56.270> why<00:06:56.450> it<00:06:56.570> looks<00:06:56.810> like<00:06:56.990> to<00:06:57.140> me<00:06:57.320> I

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:57.350 
job that's why it looks like to me I

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.140 
job that's why it looks like to me I
think<00:06:57.530> the<00:06:57.770> last<00:06:57.950> one<00:06:58.160> little<00:06:58.550> more<00:06:58.700> realistic

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 
think the last one little more realistic

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.260 
think the last one little more realistic
and<00:06:59.660> this<00:07:00.380> one<00:07:00.620> well<00:07:01.340> I<00:07:01.370> guess<00:07:01.970> we<00:07:02.120> have<00:07:02.150> to

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 
and this one well I guess we have to

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:08.700 
and this one well I guess we have to
look<00:07:02.540> at<00:07:02.690> the<00:07:02.810> adult<00:07:03.140> form<00:07:03.440> first

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:08.710 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:15.160 

so<00:07:09.710> this<00:07:10.010> is<00:07:10.220> the<00:07:10.550> adult<00:07:10.910> form<00:07:11.360> and<00:07:11.780> I<00:07:13.120> guess<00:07:14.170> it

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.170 
so this is the adult form and I guess it

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.760 
so this is the adult form and I guess it
doesn't<00:07:15.530> look<00:07:15.650> that<00:07:15.680> bad<00:07:16.040> but<00:07:17.440> did<00:07:18.440> you<00:07:18.560> see

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.770 
doesn't look that bad but did you see

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.850 
doesn't look that bad but did you see
his<00:07:18.950> mouth<00:07:19.130> open<00:07:19.760> he<00:07:20.360> has<00:07:20.450> a<00:07:20.480> purple<00:07:21.110> internal

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:21.860 
his mouth open he has a purple internal

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.810 
his mouth open he has a purple internal
mouth<00:07:22.790> or<00:07:23.390> whatever<00:07:23.780> yes<00:07:24.110> his<00:07:24.830> skin<00:07:25.130> inside<00:07:25.580> is

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:25.820 
mouth or whatever yes his skin inside is

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:32.110 
mouth or whatever yes his skin inside is
purple<00:07:29.800> all<00:07:30.800> right<00:07:30.890> he's<00:07:31.130> going<00:07:31.400> for<00:07:31.700> his<00:07:31.850> prey

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:32.120 
purple all right he's going for his prey

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.120 
purple all right he's going for his prey
again<00:07:32.270> maybe<00:07:32.750> we<00:07:32.900> can<00:07:33.200> zoom<00:07:33.440> up<00:07:33.650> when<00:07:33.830> he<00:07:33.950> does

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.130 
again maybe we can zoom up when he does

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.240 
again maybe we can zoom up when he does
that

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:36.250 
that

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.920 
that
all<00:07:37.250> right<00:07:37.490> see<00:07:37.700> you<00:07:37.910> see<00:07:38.090> that<00:07:38.240> purple<00:07:38.570> mouth

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:38.930 
all right see you see that purple mouth

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.680 
all right see you see that purple mouth
