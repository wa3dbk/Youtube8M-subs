00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.580
 Do you have a car, a truck, a boat that uses gasoline or diesel? 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:14.669
 the interview that he presented next interests him 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.079
 very importantly 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:21.649
 Well I have the pleasure of presenting a new product here then the millennium 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:26.939
 It is a product that can help you to make efficient the use of your 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.789
 difficult gasoline fuel 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.190
 with the results are extraordinary I already tried it 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.540
 I know what certified it after the second tank I had to use it 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.450
 in several tanks 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.289
 after two full tanks 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.420
 the savings that I started to give 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.420
 it was 15% 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.240
 plus 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.790
 zero emissions 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.130
 Awesome 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.020
 davids to the young mexican businessman 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.000
 after this product in Mexico that was developed by a Mexican engineer 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.210
 here 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.240
 but he had to go abroad to succeed there 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.380
 and go that brings it back to mexico 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.090
 if indeed the product development and gender is around 20 years 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.030
 we are from ten years ago 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.380
 doing studies 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.110
 the chepo to sell it to other parts of the world because still the culture in 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.320
 Mexico or saving 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.800
 in ecological matters this data has been in place for two years 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.460
 We are developing the commercial way so that all people have 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.490
 access to it no 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.920
 is a product that orders the molecular chains of hydrocarbons and makes 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.979
 that the ones that do not flow freely result in a better 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.890
 combustion and therefore lower polluting emissions but what impresses me 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.190
 will come is an rtp letter 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.160
 the public transport company of the city of mexico 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.470
 it says some studies all last year with people suddenly with 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.480
 metrobus specifically 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.790
 they did all the tests and they got out 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.630
 9 between 9 and 10 percent index 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.740
 is now all units and 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.390
 they made opacities of being zero pollution zero pollution but 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.570
 you walk some specific tests for diesel to measure it 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.479
 the degrees of pollutants to be sewn so if an agent that a flotilla of 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.070
 trucks 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.459
 it's funny I talk a lot they say 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.209
 I value a lot of money if he says that design is a problem for 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.370
 carriers had 33 at least last year he says already the date inhabited 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.889
 calculations six increases plus index detest the range of eight 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.180
 is with 42 cents above the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.200
 green line case two horitas and it's a must for carriers I know 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.340
 that now of 10 thousand sheets of 20% and until June 20 of the conditions 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.759
 of the engine is not a product that fixes a 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:34.939
 a Roman ghetto a bad carburization 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.249
 but in conditions the engine does not keep debts with 20 dead as sid 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:43.449
 you will lose 10% to the price of diesel, and, above all, what less pollutes us 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.779
 global warming is an emergency relationship very carefully all 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:49.600
 those who have flotillas that has change listens to him a lot says 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.419
 the fishermen who go to the sea 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.899
 and that they are complaining about the price of diesel 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:57.569
 I understand that boilers also see a hospital missives with tests 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.519
 of the military hospital and the boilers of 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.730
 one result and 33% why 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.690
 that the caldera the city flame is stable that no sensors no habits 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.310
 driving in a boiler you do not have to accelerate or brake if he keeps 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.040
 a whole flare results of 30 and 40% in process will save the savings is 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.039
 cash 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:18.929
 Wherever gasoline is used with a lot to the one that harasses it burn 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:21.279
 fuels is a pure people like as 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:25.009
 you can acquire this that can make your contribution a lot of people are like this we 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:27.939
 We are trying to find distributors throughout the republic 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:30.560
 also sold in our offices here in Mexico 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.740
 the numbers will appear on the screen 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.830
 and we are on trips, it requires information that we would like to communicate 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.330
 best electronic electronic internet page this print is asked 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.680
 or curro david an extraordinary success thank you very much and hopefully people have 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.620
 the culture must 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.150
 eta knows that persevered opened the doors to all this type of products 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.009
 first the certificates I did personally 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:56.299
 and I assure you it is true that yes 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.459
 Really 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.309
 I've saved myself like 60 or 70 kilometers playing others 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.969
 in my gasoline car but 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:09.040
 this if you want a change that says puleva is will that of a thousand liters 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.909
 seek to save 100 150 liters 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:13.840
 how much is the money 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.900
 montevideo - especially for the price of diesel fishermen who saints 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.220
 are fixed in the bases that happens here is the solution 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.919
 plus 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.600
 it does not pollute and also makes it more efficient for 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.760
 these vehicular checks 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.610
 the physio on track plus admission for maintenance increases to 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.080
 works everywhere the sides especially in the environmental issue digesa 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.120
 the package and closing boxes of today where is the treatment headquarters for 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.960
 three months iberia the diesel is per kilo if they sell a presentation that 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.080
 is stopped at 50 liters because diesel tanks subjection of a thousand 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.330
 liters then this type and if you are already going to put your deposit 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.360
 here we will continue and you will continue to inform me, hesitations, thank you very much 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.110
 david yachts 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.659
 he knows it and to hate I spoke 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:01.150
 the scientific report that this suits you with God in the third millennium 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.490
 p 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:09.199
 p 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.889
 everyone pauses and we come back with more with this Mexican wonder 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.889
 this fish publish 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:17.770
 nothing 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.080
 moment we return to 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.860
 must be the leader of a new one and the one used
