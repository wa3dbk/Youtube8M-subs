hey guys so hey guys so it's Shane hear
from<00:00:05.009> later<00:00:05.160> mobile<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.850> today<00:00:06.480> it<00:00:06.690> would

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
from later mobile and today it would

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.290 
from later mobile and today it would
normally<00:00:06.990> be<00:00:07.410> our<00:00:07.620> rumor<00:00:08.040> roundup<00:00:08.610> video<00:00:08.940> but

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
normally be our rumor roundup video but

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.410 
normally be our rumor roundup video but
since<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.200> first<00:00:10.920> week<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.429> 2014<00:00:12.240> i

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
since it is the first week of 2014 i

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.419 
since it is the first week of 2014 i
thought<00:00:12.690> i<00:00:12.719> would<00:00:12.809> do<00:00:13.110> top<00:00:13.410> 5<00:00:13.710> /<00:00:14.070> most

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
thought i would do top 5 / most

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.109 
thought i would do top 5 / most
anticipated<00:00:14.880> bones<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.719> 2014<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.000> a

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
anticipated bones of 2014 so this is a

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.640 
anticipated bones of 2014 so this is a
list<00:00:18.510> but<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.080> list<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.500> based<00:00:19.830> off<00:00:20.189> that

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
list but the list is based off that

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.009 
list but the list is based off that
previous<00:00:22.650> flagships<00:00:23.539> rankings<00:00:24.539> from<00:00:24.720> last

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
previous flagships rankings from last

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.740 
previous flagships rankings from last
year<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:26.039> for<00:00:26.279> example<00:00:26.340> say<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.849> thought<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
year so for example say I thought the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.040 
year so for example say I thought the
galaxy<00:00:28.529> s4<00:00:28.949> was<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.429> best<00:00:29.699> phone<00:00:30.150> last<00:00:30.480> year<00:00:30.869> i

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
galaxy s4 was the best phone last year i

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.530 
galaxy s4 was the best phone last year i
put<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.769> galaxy<00:00:32.189> s5<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.520> number<00:00:32.940> one<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.180> this

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
put the galaxy s5 is number one on this

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.540 
put the galaxy s5 is number one on this
list<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.559> that's<00:00:34.860> just<00:00:34.980> how<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.340> will<00:00:35.520> work

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
list so that's just how this will work

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.880 
list so that's just how this will work
so<00:00:36.360> let's<00:00:36.510> start<00:00:36.750> out<00:00:36.840> at<00:00:36.960> number<00:00:37.260> five<00:00:37.559> with

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
so let's start out at number five with

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.910 
so let's start out at number five with

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
the front camera now this will probably

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.059 
the front camera now this will probably
not<00:03:12.389> work<00:03:12.450> well<00:03:12.840> vyas<00:03:13.109> is<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.380> first<00:03:13.650> one<00:03:13.859> but

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
not work well vyas is the first one but

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.069 
not work well vyas is the first one but
if<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.430> does<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:15.120> would<00:03:15.299> be<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.450> pretty<00:03:15.780> cool

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
if it does this would be a pretty cool

if it does this would be a pretty cool
