hi welcome to simply scoober the

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.250 
hi welcome to simply scoober the
Aqualung<00:00:07.140> pro<00:00:07.500> HD<00:00:08.160> BCD<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.599> fantastic

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
Aqualung pro HD BCD is a fantastic

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.009 
Aqualung pro HD BCD is a fantastic
lightweight<00:00:10.769> BCD<00:00:11.429> but<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.179> most<00:00:12.330> interesting

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
lightweight BCD but the most interesting

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.169 
lightweight BCD but the most interesting
feature<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.469> find<00:00:13.799> on<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.099> BCD<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.730> that

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
feature that I find on this BCD is that

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.450 
feature that I find on this BCD is that
they're<00:00:15.389> using<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.870> new<00:00:16.080> resist<00:00:16.500> Tec<00:00:16.710> material

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
they're using a new resist Tec material

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.150 
they're using a new resist Tec material
which<00:00:17.970> prevents<00:00:18.449> fading<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.260> sunlight

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
which prevents fading in sunlight

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.279 
which prevents fading in sunlight
so<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.760> BCD<00:00:21.180> will<00:00:21.330> stay<00:00:21.600> black<00:00:21.930> with<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
so this BCD will stay black with the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.070 
so this BCD will stay black with the
blue<00:00:22.500> details<00:00:23.039> much<00:00:23.760> longer<00:00:24.269> than<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> more

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
blue details much longer than a more

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.470 
blue details much longer than a more
conventional<00:00:25.439> BCD<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.460> lot<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.060> them<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.300> see

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
out around dive sites they tend to go to

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.179

the side of your BCD what you can do is

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.210 
the side of your BCD what you can do is
thread<00:02:50.609> your<00:02:50.849> gauge<00:02:51.200> inside<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.530> BCD<00:02:52.889> and

thread your gauge inside the BCD and

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.819 
thread your gauge inside the BCD and
then<00:02:53.400> pop<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.849> out<00:02:54.000> there<00:02:54.389> that<00:02:55.049> holds<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.620> in

then pop it out there that holds it in

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.129 
then pop it out there that holds it in
that<00:02:56.220> position<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:57.239> keeps<00:02:57.510> your<00:02:57.659> hose<00:02:57.840> nice

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139
