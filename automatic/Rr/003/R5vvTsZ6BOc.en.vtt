mattify<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:43.980> but<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.850> doesn't<00:00:45.270> make<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.480> skin

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899

look powdery and that's something I

sandstorm<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.570> can't<00:01:00.840> use<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
sandstorm you can't use it in the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.020 
sandstorm you can't use it in the
translucent<00:01:02.039> one<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.370> do<00:01:02.460> find<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
translucent one but I do find the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.359 
translucent one but I do find the
translucent<00:01:03.780> kind<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.680> gives<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> white

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
translucent kind of gives you a white

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.760 
translucent kind of gives you a white
cast<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.970> way<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.689> got<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.560> color

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
cast in a way so I got it in this color

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.230 
cast in a way so I got it in this color
because<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.189> has<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> little<00:01:08.549> bit<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.939> yellow

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
because it has a little bit of a yellow

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.500 
because it has a little bit of a yellow
tint<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.590> works<00:01:10.830> perfectly<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:11.700> me<00:01:11.880> even

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
tint and it works perfectly for me even

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.840 
tint and it works perfectly for me even
if<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.720> use<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.530> really<00:01:13.890> light<00:01:14.159> concealer

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
if I use like a really light concealer

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.480 
if I use like a really light concealer
or<00:01:15.060> really<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:16.439> don't<00:01:16.860> know<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> color<00:01:17.220> that

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
or really I don't know a color that

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.010 
or really I don't know a color that
doesn't<00:01:17.549> really<00:01:17.970> match<00:01:18.210> me<00:01:18.390> as<00:01:18.509> well<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.810> can

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
doesn't really match me as well I can

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.480 
doesn't really match me as well I can
just<00:01:19.170> set<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.950> then<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.220> just

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
just set it with this and then it just

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.399 
just set it with this and then it just
really<00:01:21.000> helps<00:01:21.330> blend<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.720> into<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> skin<00:01:22.049> and

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
really helps blend it into the skin and

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.399 
really helps blend it into the skin and
make<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.710> look<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.159> my<00:01:23.610> color<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.600> really

those amazing non crease concealers but
what<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.450> do<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:13.840> like<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:13.989> use<00:02:14.170> it<00:02:14.410> in<00:02:14.500> areas

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
what I do is I like to use it in areas

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.550

where<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.069> don't<00:02:15.160> have<00:02:15.700> creases<00:02:16.330> so<00:02:16.930> anywhere

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
where I don't have creases so anywhere

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.080 
where I don't have creases so anywhere
around<00:02:17.739> here<00:02:18.190> where<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.430> have<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.670> lot<00:02:18.880> of<00:02:18.910> the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
around here where I have a lot of the

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.360 
around here where I have a lot of the
purple<00:02:19.480> colors<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:20.140> don't<00:02:20.739> go<00:02:20.920> all<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.160> way

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
into the creasing area but I do think

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.550 
into the creasing area but I do think
that<00:02:24.819> it<00:02:25.030> works<00:02:25.270> all<00:02:25.510> really<00:02:26.050> well<00:02:26.230> for<00:02:26.500> a

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.240 
like this you guys the reason why I like
it<00:02:45.790> is<00:02:46.120> because<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:46.930> really<00:02:47.230> sets<00:02:47.590> my<00:02:47.799> eyebrows

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
it is because it really sets my eyebrows

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.699 
it is because it really sets my eyebrows
in<00:02:48.489> place<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:49.060> have<00:02:49.569> those<00:02:49.840> straight<00:02:50.319> thick

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
in place I have those straight thick

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.220 
in place I have those straight thick
eyebrows<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:52.030> tend<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.480> just<00:02:52.660> flop<00:02:52.959> down

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
eyebrows that tend to just flop down

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.140 
eyebrows that tend to just flop down
because<00:02:53.530> they're<00:02:53.680> so<00:02:53.950> thick<00:02:54.250> but<00:02:54.700> they're<00:02:54.849> so

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
because they're so thick but they're so

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.850 
because they're so thick but they're so
straight<00:02:55.569> that<00:02:55.599> you<00:02:56.080> can't<00:02:56.349> really<00:02:56.530> just

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
straight that you can't really just

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.000 
straight that you can't really just
brush<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.400> in<00:02:57.580> and<00:02:57.880> have<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.450> hold<00:02:58.840> together<00:02:59.019> so

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
brush it in and have it hold together so

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.770 
brush it in and have it hold together so
it's<00:03:00.250> hard<00:03:00.519> for<00:03:00.580> me<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.849> find<00:03:01.090> like<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.360> really

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
it's hard for me to find like a really

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.440 
it's hard for me to find like a really
great<00:03:02.140> brow<00:03:02.799> gel<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:03.400> this<00:03:03.880> I<00:03:04.150> think<00:03:04.180> it's

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
great brow gel and this I think it's

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.910 
great brow gel and this I think it's
great<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:04.900> doesn't<00:03:05.170> have<00:03:05.260> that<00:03:05.410> crunchy

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
great it doesn't have that crunchy

great it doesn't have that crunchy
feeling<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.580> doesn't<00:03:08.970> accumulate<00:03:09.970> dust<00:03:10.390> or

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
feeling it doesn't accumulate dust or

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.420 
feeling it doesn't accumulate dust or
anything<00:03:11.260> like<00:03:11.470> that<00:03:11.530> at<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.040> end<00:03:12.069> of<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.310> day

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
anything like that at the end of the day

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.069 
anything like that at the end of the day
where<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:12.670> look<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:13.239> looks<00:03:13.269> kind<00:03:13.840> of<00:03:13.900> like

have<00:05:31.210> a<00:05:31.240> lot<00:05:31.419> of<00:05:31.450> wrinkly<00:05:31.900> crevasses<00:05:32.500> on<00:05:32.620> my

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
have a lot of wrinkly crevasses on my

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.010 
have a lot of wrinkly crevasses on my
lips<00:05:32.950> and<00:05:33.160> a<00:05:33.639> lot<00:05:33.760> of<00:05:33.789> glosses<00:05:34.360> tend<00:05:34.539> to<00:05:34.660> settle

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
lips and a lot of glosses tend to settle

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.800 
lips and a lot of glosses tend to settle
a<00:05:35.260> lot<00:05:35.830> of<00:05:36.070> lipsticks<00:05:36.729> tends<00:05:37.000> to<00:05:37.240> dry<00:05:37.450> them<00:05:37.660> out

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
a lot of lipsticks tends to dry them out

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.020 
a lot of lipsticks tends to dry them out
so<00:05:38.530> it's<00:05:38.950> hard<00:05:39.160> for<00:05:39.250> me<00:05:39.340> to<00:05:39.460> find<00:05:39.610> a<00:05:39.700> formula

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
so it's hard for me to find a formula

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.000 
so it's hard for me to find a formula
where<00:05:40.270> I<00:05:40.330> actually<00:05:40.570> really<00:05:41.289> really<00:05:41.320> like<00:05:41.740> it

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
where I actually really really like it

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.879 
where I actually really really like it
so<00:05:42.610> this<00:05:42.940> one<00:05:43.150> is<00:05:43.360> so<00:05:43.599> comparable<00:05:44.139> to<00:05:44.349> the

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
so this one is so comparable to the

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.279 
so this one is so comparable to the
Chanel<00:05:45.310> glosses<00:05:45.789> a<00:05:46.030> very<00:05:46.510> fraction<00:05:47.080> of<00:05:47.169> the

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
Chanel glosses a very fraction of the
