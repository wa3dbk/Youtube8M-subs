00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.500
 It is a very family and quality school 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.349
 the most important advantage is the attention 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.000
 personalized would define as a school 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.960
 of business with future a tool 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.730
 that allows you to study the career that 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.270
 you want and grow on a personal level and 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.270
 professional 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.629
 the personal touch of the team 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.190
 teacher as well as the administration the 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.190
 Closeness you have with teachers 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.050
 that the groups in the classes will be 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.839
 reduced opportunities that I can 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.549
 then have both the master's offer 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.549
 that they offer me at company level as 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:56.500
 the possibility of working in good 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:58.449
 sector or in a good company I like 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.789
 that we are very few in class because 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.039
 I learn a lot more that makes you learn 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:06.460
 faster the relationship with the 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:08.950
 teachers in him has been in all all 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.570
 the cases in which I am concerned have 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.340
 It was unbeatable to have a university in 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.170
 which they are for you and if you have 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.179
 some doubt because they solve it to you 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.240
 they try to help in class we have them 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:22.539
 not ashamed to ask about things 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.100
 You can stay and make an appointment with a 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.840
 teacher to solve your doubts 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.390
 personal and you have the relationship 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.320
 with the students I think it's very good 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.960
 in general 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.940
 I try to get interested in the 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.760
 I invite you to ask questions 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.620
 in the cafeteria sometimes even 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.620
 sit with us for breakfast 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.960
 positive I think the experience 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.400
 erasmus is positive for everyone 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.900
 that since you leave until you return 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.970
 they are like they make you the 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.619
 Follow-up so you're not lost 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.170
 for something for the world to me it seems to me that 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.880
 is very helpful for the student in 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.530
 concrete and for students who 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.020
 they share a classroom with these people and there are 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.720
 many universities, especially schools 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.789
 business by europe interesting that is 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.709
 a new experience an experience 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.239
 totally different you have the 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.670
 opportunity to study in the 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.100
 overseas experience that changes you 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.380
 life so to speak at the time of 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.330
 bag that have work and practice 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.959
 in college you can give the option 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.340
 to access many companies or many 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.900
 jobs that may not be in another site 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.410
 you had on the part of the university 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.370
 come out with a counterpoint that I think 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.989
 it's very very useful obviously very obviously 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.910
 as long as it can be combined with 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.290
 perform the studies that is also 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.120
 they agreed that I could 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.610
 combine what the whole part was 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.920
 theoretical and all the part of the degree in ade 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.230
 and in the end then the practice that in the end 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.879
 is that we find work 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.879
 good in the sector that we like 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.060
 to a high school student what 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.980
 first he studied something he wants 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.580
 the part about studying something you want to 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.160
 look for a way out or something for the future 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.989
 not only think about how it will be 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.239
 with whom you will study but in what 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.550
 wants to be older and I think it's 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.459
 important then change the chip and 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.680
 study every day and mentalize 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.900
 do the exercises on everything to do 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.110
 Therefore, the recommendations of the 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.180
 teachers I would recommend that you fight 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.160
 so he wants them to look for the 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.510
 university that really convinces you 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.270
 that comes there can be 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.070
 what is a very good experience and 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.660
 and nothing and above all that I study that 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.270
 study a lot that the situation is very 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.680
 complicated and worth it 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.370
 it's worth it both professionally 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.370
 as a staff
