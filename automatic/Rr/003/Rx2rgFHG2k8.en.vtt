the information for you especially with

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.880 
the information for you especially with
the<00:00:20.670> new<00:00:20.700> system<00:00:21.030> coming<00:00:21.420> out<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:22.620> first

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
the new system coming out the first

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.200 
the new system coming out the first
piece<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.310> did<00:00:23.460> want<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.730> give<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.940> heads<00:00:24.090> up

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
piece I did want to give you a heads up

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.410 
piece I did want to give you a heads up
on<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.600> controller<00:00:25.020> is<00:00:25.260> sixty<00:00:26.130> dollars<00:00:26.520> so

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
on the controller is sixty dollars so

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.270 
on the controller is sixty dollars so
set<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.900> aside<00:00:28.020> your<00:00:28.410> mind<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.130> have

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.280 
set that aside your mind that you have

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.850 
set that aside your mind that you have
to<00:00:29.490> essentially<00:00:30.180> budget<00:00:30.720> one<00:00:31.050> extra<00:00:31.590> game<00:00:31.620> in

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
to essentially budget one extra game in

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.979 
to essentially budget one extra game in
order<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.339> get<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> second<00:00:32.879> controller<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
order to get a second controller the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.869 
order to get a second controller the
first<00:00:34.320> controller<00:00:34.739> does<00:00:35.129> actually<00:00:35.429> come<00:00:35.850> with

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
first controller does actually come with

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.930 
first controller does actually come with
the<00:00:36.269> system<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.530> we'll<00:00:37.710> jump<00:00:37.920> right<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
the system so we'll jump right in to the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.060 
the system so we'll jump right in to the
controller<00:00:39.420> itself<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.739> first<00:00:40.980> thing

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
controller itself and the first thing

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.729 
controller itself and the first thing
you<00:00:41.190> notice<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.789> is<00:00:41.940> vastly<00:00:42.899> bigger<00:00:43.289> than

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
you notice is it is vastly bigger than

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.669 
you notice is it is vastly bigger than
PS<00:00:44.249> controllers<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:44.999> the<00:00:45.030> past<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:46.050> does<00:00:46.379> have

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:46.679 
PS controllers in the past it does have

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.770 
PS controllers in the past it does have
really<00:00:47.070> nice<00:00:47.249> rubber<00:00:47.760> grips<00:00:48.149> along<00:00:48.449> the<00:00:48.600> back

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
really nice rubber grips along the back

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.709 
really nice rubber grips along the back
which<00:00:49.050> makes<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.409> easier<00:00:49.769> to<00:00:49.829> hold<00:00:50.390> they<00:00:51.390> tone

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
which makes it easier to hold they tone

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.439 
which makes it easier to hold they tone
down<00:00:51.929> and<00:00:52.170> they<00:00:52.230> did<00:00:52.469> updates<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
down and they did updates the the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.479 
down and they did updates the the
triggers<00:00:54.929> and<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.649> bumpers<00:00:56.069> you<00:00:56.219> could<00:00:56.370> see

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
triggers and the bumpers you could see

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.459 
triggers and the bumpers you could see
that<00:00:56.579> hill<00:00:56.730> before<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.420> had<00:00:57.659> a<00:00:57.899> more

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
that hill before it had a more

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.709 
that hill before it had a more
pronounced<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.850> really<00:01:00.030> easy<00:01:00.420> i<00:01:00.600> would

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
pronounced it's really easy i would

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.959 
pronounced it's really easy i would
actually<00:01:01.079> come<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.409> use<00:01:01.620> them<00:01:01.769> now<00:01:01.969> you're

and one of the uses that i have found
for<00:01:21.480> it<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.750> when<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.050> open<00:01:22.410> up<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.680> map<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.340> a

either<00:01:25.650> use<00:01:25.770> your<00:01:26.010> analog<00:01:26.460> stick<00:01:26.940> to<00:01:27.540> control

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960

either use your analog stick to control
the<00:01:28.110> map<00:01:28.290> or<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.680> actually<00:01:28.830> pinch<00:01:29.310> and

zoom and move it it's kind of a nice

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.710 
zoom and move it it's kind of a nice
feature<00:01:31.410> kind<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.130> speeds<00:01:32.400> things<00:01:32.640> up<00:01:32.910> though

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720

I<00:01:33.750> was<00:01:34.140> said<00:01:34.380> there's<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.830> key<00:01:35.160> thing<00:01:35.370> to

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
I was said there's one key thing to

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.900 
I was said there's one key thing to
notice<00:01:35.700> because<00:01:36.180> those<00:01:36.960> then<00:01:37.460> turn<00:01:38.460> zoom<00:01:38.760> in

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
notice because those then turn zoom in

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.500 
notice because those then turn zoom in
here<00:01:39.050> there<00:01:40.050> was<00:01:40.140> an<00:01:40.230> option<00:01:40.440> button<00:01:40.980> and<00:01:41.510> then

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
here there was an option button and then

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.530 
here there was an option button and then
those<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:43.230> shell<00:01:43.770> button<00:01:44.130> gone<00:01:44.820> all<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.240> start

then<00:01:59.010> the<00:01:59.670> one<00:01:59.910> thing<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.210> they<00:02:00.450> did<00:02:00.510> a<00:02:00.630> great

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
then the one thing that they did a great

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.390 
then the one thing that they did a great
job<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.650> is<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:03.090> thumbsticks<00:02:03.660> now<00:02:04.650> much

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
job on is on the thumbsticks now much

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.359 
job on is on the thumbsticks now much
like<00:02:05.610> all<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.000> old<00:02:06.210> um<00:02:07.039> playstation<00:02:08.039> sticks

it<00:02:08.609> actually<00:02:08.939> is<00:02:09.149> beveled<00:02:09.450> up<00:02:09.780> at<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.079> top<00:02:10.289> you

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829 
it actually is beveled up at the top you

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.890 
it actually is beveled up at the top you
can<00:02:10.920> kind<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.189> see<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.489> right<00:02:11.670> here<00:02:11.719> which<00:02:12.719> is

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
can kind of see it right here which is

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.970 
can kind of see it right here which is
one<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.290> things<00:02:13.499> i'd

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
one of the things i'd

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.800 
one of the things i'd
truly<00:02:14.400> always<00:02:14.700> loved<00:02:14.879> about<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.209> PlayStation

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
truly always loved about the PlayStation

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.170 
truly always loved about the PlayStation
controller<00:02:16.379> but<00:02:17.129> what<00:02:17.250> they've<00:02:17.400> done<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:18.000> they

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
controller but what they've done is they

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.330 
controller but what they've done is they
made<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.599> little<00:02:18.810> bit<00:02:18.989> more<00:02:19.140> responsive<00:02:19.890> so

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
made it a little bit more responsive so

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.670 
made it a little bit more responsive so
in<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.549> past<00:02:20.730> if<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.090> remember<00:02:21.720> if<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.560> put

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
in the past if you remember if you put

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.199 
in the past if you remember if you put
it<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.159> left<00:02:23.370> there's<00:02:23.640> really<00:02:23.819> no

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
it to the left there's really no

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.780 
it to the left there's really no
resistance<00:02:24.840> going<00:02:25.110> back<00:02:25.319> now<00:02:26.159> you<00:02:26.220> could<00:02:26.580> see

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
resistance going back now you could see

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.089 
resistance going back now you could see
the<00:02:26.940> quick<00:02:27.209> snap<00:02:27.510> resistance<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.500> not

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
the quick snap resistance it's not

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.009 
the quick snap resistance it's not
enough<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.430> be<00:02:29.549> detrimental<00:02:29.879> but<00:02:30.629> it<00:02:30.720> is

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
enough to be detrimental but it is

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.320 
enough to be detrimental but it is
enough<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.739> feel<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.519> difference<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.150> it's<00:02:33.269> a

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
enough to feel the difference and it's a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.289 
enough to feel the difference and it's a
nice<00:02:33.569> low<00:02:33.870> half<00:02:34.170> change<00:02:34.670> they<00:02:35.670> do<00:02:35.730> incorporate

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
nice low half change they do incorporate

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.089 
nice low half change they do incorporate
a<00:02:36.720> PS<00:02:37.110> button<00:02:37.349> in<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.650> bottom<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.010> the

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
a PS button in the bottom of the

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.729 
a PS button in the bottom of the
controller<00:02:38.489> this<00:02:39.060> operates<00:02:39.660> very<00:02:39.989> similarly

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
controller this operates very similarly

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.610 
controller this operates very similarly
to<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.220> xbox<00:02:42.000> controller<00:02:42.569> what<00:02:42.840> they<00:02:42.989> are<00:02:43.170> the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
to the xbox controller what they are the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.869 
to the xbox controller what they are the
control<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.129> middle<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.459> as<00:02:44.579> you<00:02:44.700> notice

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
control in the middle and as you notice

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.069 
control in the middle and as you notice
it<00:02:45.659> also<00:02:46.049> works<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.440> sync<00:02:46.950> your<00:02:47.190> controller

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
it also works to sync your controller

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.819 
it also works to sync your controller
they<00:02:49.079> actually<00:02:49.410> installing<00:02:49.739> a<00:02:51.530> speak<00:02:52.530> on<00:02:52.709> the

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
they actually installing a speak on the

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.619 
they actually installing a speak on the
debt<00:02:53.010> under<00:02:53.310> control<00:02:53.340> which<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.329> a<00:02:54.359> nice

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
debt under control which is a nice

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.569 
debt under control which is a nice
little<00:02:54.900> addition<00:02:55.109> and<00:02:55.620> then<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.340> have<00:02:56.549> your

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
little addition and then you have your

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.910 
little addition and then you have your
port<00:02:57.030> at<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.390> bottom<00:02:57.750> for<00:02:57.780> your<00:02:58.109> headsets<00:02:58.620> as

port at the bottom for your headsets as

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.910 
port at the bottom for your headsets as
well<00:02:59.640> as<00:02:59.790> your<00:03:00.030> mini<00:03:00.629> USB<00:03:00.989> connector<00:03:01.799> on<00:03:01.859> the

controller up or to play wild now the

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.020 
controller up or to play wild now the
one<00:03:07.319> thing<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.560> did<00:03:07.739> want<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:08.010> show<00:03:08.040> off<00:03:08.400> because

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
one thing I did want to show off because

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.220 
one thing I did want to show off because
I<00:03:09.090> said<00:03:09.329> this<00:03:09.390> is<00:03:09.450> bigger<00:03:09.840> than<00:03:09.989> the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
I said this is bigger than the

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.900 
I said this is bigger than the
traditional<00:03:10.379> one<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:11.069> what<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:11.760> actually

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
traditional one is what it actually

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.420 
traditional one is what it actually
looks<00:03:12.150> like<00:03:12.450> compared<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:13.109> an<00:03:13.230> xbox<00:03:13.709> 360

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
looks like compared to an xbox 360

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.000 
looks like compared to an xbox 360
controller<00:03:14.629> so<00:03:15.629> the<00:03:16.290> one<00:03:16.470> reason<00:03:16.769> why<00:03:16.829> people

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
controller so the one reason why people

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.550 
controller so the one reason why people
love<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.459> xbox<00:03:18.030> 360<00:03:18.599> controllers<00:03:19.109> was

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
love the xbox 360 controllers was

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.559 
love the xbox 360 controllers was
because<00:03:20.069> it<00:03:20.280> was<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:20.730> much<00:03:20.880> bigger<00:03:21.120> in<00:03:21.419> the

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
because it was so much bigger in the

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.289 
because it was so much bigger in the
size<00:03:21.870> was<00:03:22.590> much<00:03:22.889> easier<00:03:23.160> on<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.609> hand<00:03:23.880> so<00:03:24.209> you

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
size was much easier on the hand so you

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.780 
size was much easier on the hand so you
see<00:03:24.599> on<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.840> right<00:03:25.049> heel<00:03:25.319> it's<00:03:25.950> that<00:03:26.220> p<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.669> the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
see on the right heel it's that p is the

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.539 
see on the right heel it's that p is the
xbox<00:03:27.060> 360<00:03:27.750> controller<00:03:27.840> when<00:03:28.739> I<00:03:28.769> get<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.010> xbox

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
xbox 360 controller when I get a xbox

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.360 
xbox 360 controller when I get a xbox
one<00:03:29.970> I'll<00:03:30.209> run<00:03:30.419> the<00:03:30.510> comparison<00:03:31.250> into<00:03:32.250> the

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
one I'll run the comparison into the

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.050 
one I'll run the comparison into the
left<00:03:32.639> is<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.780> ps4<00:03:34.109> now<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.069> ps4<00:03:35.459> controller

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
left is the ps4 now the ps4 controller

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.599 
left is the ps4 now the ps4 controller
or<00:03:36.359> the<00:03:36.480> ps3<00:03:36.900> was<00:03:37.109> originally<00:03:37.500> about<00:03:37.709> like<00:03:37.919> me

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
or the ps3 was originally about like me

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.030 
or the ps3 was originally about like me
about<00:03:38.910> half<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.810> three-quarters<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.620> size<00:03:40.859> of

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
about half to three-quarters the size of

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.680 
about half to three-quarters the size of
the<00:03:41.099> xbox<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.150> can<00:03:42.329> see<00:03:42.480> there<00:03:42.599> is<00:03:42.660> a

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
the xbox so you can see there is a

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.610 
the xbox so you can see there is a
marked<00:03:43.319> increase<00:03:43.440> in<00:03:44.040> size<00:03:44.430> between<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:45.090> two

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
marked increase in size between the two

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.780 
marked increase in size between the two
the<00:03:46.620> last<00:03:46.859> thing<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.099> really<00:03:47.370> want<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.579> show<00:03:47.639> I

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
the last thing I really want to show I

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.460 
the last thing I really want to show I
think<00:03:48.090> this<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.329> really<00:03:48.540> kind<00:03:48.810> of<00:03:48.959> telling<00:03:49.319> is

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
think this is really kind of telling is

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.020 
think this is really kind of telling is
if<00:03:50.130> you<00:03:50.250> look<00:03:50.400> at<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.609> back<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:50.819> the

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
if you look at the back of the

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.759 
if you look at the back of the
controller<00:03:51.510> so<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:51.840> have<00:03:51.989> your<00:03:52.019> two<00:03:52.349> triggers

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
controller so you have your two triggers

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.979 
controller so you have your two triggers
here<00:03:52.950> on<00:03:53.040> your<00:03:53.130> bumpers<00:03:53.519> up<00:03:53.669> top<00:03:53.940> then<00:03:54.840> you

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
here on your bumpers up top then you

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.490 
here on your bumpers up top then you
look<00:03:55.169> at<00:03:55.380> your<00:03:56.269> xbox<00:03:57.269> 360<00:03:57.930> controller<00:03:57.959> I'll

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
look at your xbox 360 controller I'll

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.879 
look at your xbox 360 controller I'll
try<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.680> zoom<00:03:58.799> in<00:03:59.160> here<00:03:59.299> he'll<00:04:00.299> is<00:04:00.540> your<00:04:01.500> start

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
try to zoom in here he'll is your start

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.970 
try to zoom in here he'll is your start

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
where the trail ends for the xbox here

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.849 
where the trail ends for the xbox here
is<00:04:07.889> where<00:04:08.099> it<00:04:08.220> is<00:04:08.370> for<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.299> PS<00:04:09.660> sell<00:04:10.440> me<00:04:10.590> till<00:04:10.829> I

so it is mortally father oval which was

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.640 
so it is mortally father oval which was
someone<00:04:24.090> who<00:04:24.180> has<00:04:24.330> huge<00:04:24.690> hands<00:04:24.990> like<00:04:25.140> me<00:04:25.289> plays

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
someone who has huge hands like me plays

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.300 
someone who has huge hands like me plays
it

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
it

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.490 
it
a<00:04:26.370> big<00:04:26.669> factor<00:04:26.910> so<00:04:27.360> back<00:04:27.540> in<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.780> day<00:04:27.900> do<00:04:28.380> this

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
a big factor so back in the day do this

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.220 
a big factor so back in the day do this
and<00:04:28.710> it<00:04:29.040> was<00:04:29.190> fairly<00:04:29.669> comfortable<00:04:30.300> with<00:04:31.050> this

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
and it was fairly comfortable with this

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.870 
and it was fairly comfortable with this
new<00:04:31.470> control<00:04:31.889> of<00:04:32.070> what<00:04:32.190> it<00:04:32.280> actually<00:04:32.460> gives

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
new control of what it actually gives

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.409 
new control of what it actually gives
you<00:04:33.060> is<00:04:33.240> some<00:04:33.720> more<00:04:33.960> spacing<00:04:34.740> in<00:04:34.950> between

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
you is some more spacing in between

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.730 
you is some more spacing in between
which<00:04:36.419> is<00:04:36.540> what<00:04:36.720> this<00:04:36.840> pad<00:04:37.110> is<00:04:37.139> needed<00:04:37.560> for

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
which is what this pad is needed for

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.350 
which is what this pad is needed for
because<00:04:38.100> it<00:04:38.220> does<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.580> press<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:39.090> it<00:04:39.180> does

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
because it does the press and it does

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.240 
because it does the press and it does
feel<00:04:39.630> but<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.470> problem<00:04:40.680> is<00:04:40.740> if<00:04:40.800> you<00:04:40.889> do<00:04:41.100> not

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
feel but the problem is if you do not

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.100 
feel but the problem is if you do not
have<00:04:41.490> that<00:04:41.730> additional<00:04:42.030> spacing<00:04:42.870> that<00:04:42.990> is

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
have that additional spacing that is

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.230 
have that additional spacing that is
required<00:04:43.470> by<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.710> triggers<00:04:44.130> this<00:04:44.610> becomes<00:04:45.060> a

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
required by the triggers this becomes a

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.080 
required by the triggers this becomes a
moot<00:04:45.450> point<00:04:45.510> and<00:04:46.020> becomes<00:04:46.320> hard<00:04:46.590> you<00:04:46.830> use<00:04:47.090> it

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
moot point and becomes hard you use it

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.780 
moot point and becomes hard you use it
is<00:04:48.450> a<00:04:48.480> nicer<00:04:48.900> controller<00:04:49.290> is<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.620> big<00:04:50.220> deal

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
is a nicer controller is a big deal

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.379 
is a nicer controller is a big deal
hefty<00:04:51.540> I<00:04:51.570> can't<00:04:52.230> stress<00:04:52.860> that<00:04:52.889> enough<00:04:53.100> on<00:04:53.639> the

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
hefty I can't stress that enough on the

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.470 
hefty I can't stress that enough on the
original<00:04:54.840> one<00:04:55.100> maybe<00:04:56.100> like<00:04:56.340> half<00:04:56.639> a<00:04:56.790> gram<00:04:57.060> this

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
original one maybe like half a gram this

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.810 
original one maybe like half a gram this
is<00:04:57.660> probably<00:04:57.960> about<00:04:58.110> double<00:04:58.590> that<00:04:58.669> it's<00:04:59.669> not

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
is probably about double that it's not

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.270 
is probably about double that it's not
enough<00:05:00.180> to<00:05:00.210> be<00:05:00.389> cumbersome<00:05:01.080> and<00:05:01.139> weighty<00:05:01.560> but

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
enough to be cumbersome and weighty but

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.909 
enough to be cumbersome and weighty but
it<00:05:02.400> is<00:05:02.550> enough<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.510> feel<00:05:03.750> substantial<00:05:03.990> and<00:05:04.680> not

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
it is enough to feel substantial and not

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.950 
it is enough to feel substantial and not
cheap<00:05:05.310> because<00:05:05.520> none<00:05:05.790> of<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:05.940> old<00:05:05.970> ones<00:05:06.360> it

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
cheap because none of the old ones it

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.379 
cheap because none of the old ones it
had<00:05:07.169> this<00:05:07.320> cheap<00:05:07.740> plastic<00:05:08.040> feel<00:05:08.580> well<00:05:09.210> this

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
had this cheap plastic feel well this

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.600 
had this cheap plastic feel well this
does<00:05:09.570> feel<00:05:09.990> plastic<00:05:10.560> it<00:05:10.740> has<00:05:10.919> the<00:05:11.100> heft<00:05:11.340> in<00:05:11.520> the

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
does feel plastic it has the heft in the

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.460 
does feel plastic it has the heft in the
rumble<00:05:11.970> function<00:05:12.360> to<00:05:12.479> kind<00:05:12.690> of<00:05:12.720> make<00:05:12.990> up<00:05:13.020> for

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
rumble function to kind of make up for

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.129 
rumble function to kind of make up for
the<00:05:13.560> difference<00:05:13.820> so<00:05:14.820> I<00:05:15.060> think<00:05:15.389> it's<00:05:15.780> a<00:05:15.870> huge

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
the difference so I think it's a huge

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.890 
the difference so I think it's a huge
upgrade<00:05:16.820> it's<00:05:17.820> a<00:05:17.910> nice<00:05:18.120> stiff<00:05:18.479> since<00:05:18.750> and

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
upgrade it's a nice stiff since and

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.840 
upgrade it's a nice stiff since and
that's<00:05:19.020> nice<00:05:19.260> welcome<00:05:19.740> I'm<00:05:19.950> intrigued<00:05:20.700> to<00:05:20.820> see

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
that's nice welcome I'm intrigued to see

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.670 
that's nice welcome I'm intrigued to see
going<00:05:21.180> forward<00:05:21.270> how<00:05:21.930> people<00:05:22.229> are<00:05:22.470> going<00:05:22.590> to

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
going forward how people are going to
