00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:10.889
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:14.120
 multiplayer gameplay by call of duty 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.330
 black Ops 2 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:23.430
 we're playing a local game 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.710
 a project team the match but unfortunately 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.050
 not with other multiplayer game 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.149
 but I have considered I make one 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.489
 I still had two friends 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.609
 or two allied I then played to 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.280
 third against six opponents on the 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:42.719
 difficulty on the field a one 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.030
 So two were held 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.359
 I think it will not be that easy 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:53.239
 I hope things will be funniest 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:56.339
 start 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.319
 I have three classes that I take 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:03.510
 will 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:09.570
 once I have the mp 7 once the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:13.140
 followers of the b 33 we believe in 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.840
 eighth 1 and the a 1 490 this is yes 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.500
 my own favorite weapon i find 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.820
 They just hammer like you 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.880
 See, I have four with me 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.870
 ally 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:34.190
 then we start playing that team 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.190
 play over ten minutes 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.770
 limit is unlimited points limit there 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:47.579
 we have our first child 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:52.409
 cool so my holidays are once hunter 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:57.229
 killer lightning dragon fire the i 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.159
 hopefully everyone will be able to show 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.820
 can use and thus make money 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.820
 can 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:20.410
 then let's start the point series 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:25.150
 until 31 today are right in one 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:27.220
 I do not chat near my guy and we have 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.840
 sometimes our first hunter 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.180
 have killer and therefore miner knives 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.420
 In any case , no happy man 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:49.990
 in the air hoping that it will kill 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:51.250
 I could maybe do it 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.570
 I can prepare a little better 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.920
 put my sight very quickly 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:03:02.560
 appetite for 53 worried because I'm back 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.260
 mw3 gambled my warfare 3 and the 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.290
 I find it a bit different 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.680
 and yes, but I think five is one 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:17.870
 pretty good number 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:19.340
 view sensitivity and that of me 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:25.700
 that'll be fine 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:27.830
 is still eight minutes takes yellow 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.760
 unlimited you can me in the 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.269
 will write comments 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:38.610
 if I'm right the next game play 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:40.610
 to do multiplayer and or like me 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.849
 the party should make position 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:48.720
 and when you have a buck you can 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:50.400
 under comment put that with the point 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:59.129
 the attitude and the attitude 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:04:01.859
 how many points how much time I hope 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:05.340
 you like the mode here 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:09.349
 time of recruitment human needs 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.349
 I first have my father's little air 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.780
 and we have a kill hunter killer 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:20.729
 in my opinion simmern kill 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:23.580
 but I do not know if he does when he does 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:31.250
 kills then only do it as always 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:34.080
 then we want to rule 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.870

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.470
