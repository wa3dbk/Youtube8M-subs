00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
want to call it a contra game because it

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.490 
want to call it a contra game because it
just<00:03:05.760> kind<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.269> is<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.480> contra<00:03:06.989> game<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.260> me<00:03:07.379> it's

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
just kind of is a contra game to me it's

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.559 
just kind of is a contra game to me it's
a<00:03:07.560> good<00:03:07.769> it's<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.579> good<00:03:08.609> game<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.209> it's

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
a good it's a good game and it's

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.839 
a good it's a good game and it's
different<00:03:10.109> but<00:03:10.859> all<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.159> contra<00:03:11.459> games<00:03:11.640> are<00:03:11.819> a

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
different but all the contra games are a

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.580 
different but all the contra games are a
little<00:03:12.060> different<00:03:12.239> from<00:03:12.510> each<00:03:12.689> other<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.500> the

little different from each other and the
contra<00:03:13.980> name<00:03:14.189> probably<00:03:14.459> would<00:03:14.700> have<00:03:14.760> helped

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
contra name probably would have helped

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.690 
contra name probably would have helped
sell<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.299> that<00:03:15.659> is<00:03:15.780> correct<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.260> is<00:03:16.349> correct
