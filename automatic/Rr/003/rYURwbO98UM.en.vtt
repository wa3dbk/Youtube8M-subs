00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.950

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.780
 You look behind me that was the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.210
 bookcase the game might be the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.269
 background of all videos I have 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.310
 packed in boxes and broken down tonight 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.410
 and possibly tomorrow that 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.460
 the cost of building in our new one 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.080
 home and with that alone we were fully booked 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.349
 we started with that it is now suddenly one 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.929
 real in the move and well 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.940
 it's good because exactly about week then go 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.800
 we widened right and so it is now allowed 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.690
 to happen 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.950
 I just asked pop in Geleen here 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.350

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.700
 but sinks about it daddy said yes 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.950
 of course people expect one 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.399
 life lesson of yours well I have today 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.399
 not for 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.590
 I can tell you that I understand that 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.660
 dates 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.739
 we had a delicious dinner tonight but because 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.129
 we have worked hard 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.750
 it is not against team love it 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.570
 for a few fresh dates I am really crazy 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.250
 on the fresh ladies is a nice and soft 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.070
 that is mine and concentrate 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.729
 even after exercising, by the way, well 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.729
 we have something to report 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.439
 we take the turn 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.530
 well i got it now i like going to bed 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.210
 but just nice and relaxed 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.799
 we are trying the period from 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.479
 move as compact as possible 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.009
 what I normally too much luck because 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.140
 now we really go in the boxes for a week 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.040
 and put in under it but good if 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.780
 threatened when I go through 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.140
 say i don't mind 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.869
 sure if i also challenge a lot 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.250
 to pack everything and by the hands 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.799
 to have and see what goes with it 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.170
 what goes away and it again 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.509
 again we'll build that up there though 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.159
 make such a video that creating 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.420
 of your own environment determined very much 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.939
 good how you feel and 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.950
 every time she moved it to the 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.049
 I also release the move 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.049
 even if you relocate you fall 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.490
 again the chance because the duty over 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.750
 a new environment for yourself 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.750
 create and 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.600
 well there now also just after my work but 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.069
 I feel what is important for more of it 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.590
 set me and your camille can just reach 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.410
 our standard drop your furniture but 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.700
 what is in the room what is in it 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.750
 Your house is determined about it 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.610
 to grow 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.500
 moves in it so where can you choose 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.940
 but that about it please let 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.870
 maybe today the life lesson is dolls 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.430
 are tons of us another lesson 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.230
 lifestyle often starts with creating 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.760
 from a different environment 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.340
 what maybe smart we had in the 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.260
 powerful course about your kitchen 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.360
 furnish differently with other equipment with 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.590
 Others 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.049
 basic ingredients that changes nicely 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.430
 automatically also put your live after me 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.140
 relocation is a great time to do that 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.610
 but from a fire wait for one 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.549
 relocation and some people are women 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.959
 my twice alive or not at all 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.600
 but then you of course very 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.970
 consciously create your own environment and 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.560
 thereby change the live style or 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.299
 to influence 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.000
 maybe think about it 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:07.810
 we drag these days with these i have 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.010
 my duty now fulfilled and commitment to 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.840
 make a video every day 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.640
 you have a little bit of life lesson and 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.320
 we are going to enjoy them 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.320
 relax you say it anyway
