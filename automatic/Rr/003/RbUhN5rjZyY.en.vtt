00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.880 
now I really like these guys cuz their
legs<00:00:44.610> Bend<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.360> their<00:00:45.870> heads<00:00:46.110> still<00:00:46.530> move<00:00:46.770> of

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
legs Bend and their heads still move of

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.100 
legs Bend and their heads still move of
course<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.670> little<00:00:47.910> skinny<00:00:48.239> or<00:00:48.420> NAS<00:00:48.660> block

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
course the little skinny or NAS block

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.639 
course the little skinny or NAS block
isn't<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.770> as<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.250> older<00:00:50.550> horses<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.320> they

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
isn't on as the older horses and so they

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.160 
isn't on as the older horses and so they
look<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.949> bit<00:00:53.100> more<00:00:53.280> realistic<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.390> guess<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.870> mean

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
look a bit more realistic I guess I mean

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.170 
look a bit more realistic I guess I mean
it's<00:00:55.320> not<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.500> Lego<00:00:55.949> horses<00:00:56.489> with<00:00:56.670> all<00:00:56.910> that

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
it's not like Lego horses with all that

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.080 
it's not like Lego horses with all that
realistic<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.680> they<00:00:58.949> look<00:00:59.129> more<00:00:59.579> realistic

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
realistic but they look more realistic

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.630 
realistic but they look more realistic
than<00:01:01.129> horses<00:01:03.589> over<00:01:04.589> here<00:01:04.799> we<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.250> Viking

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
through the Horde because he plans to

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.550 
through the Horde because he plans to
escape<00:04:17.269> so<00:04:17.479> he's<00:04:17.690> gonna<00:04:17.810> take<00:04:18.019> as<00:04:18.169> much<00:04:18.320> as<00:04:18.380> he
