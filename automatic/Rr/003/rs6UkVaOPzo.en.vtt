00:00:03.104 --> 00:00:07.833
 By studying the interaction of genes and the environment, scientists and psychologists began 

00:00:07.848 --> 00:00:13.702
 more accurately determine the individual genes that control our behavior. 

00:00:13.702 --> 00:00:19.068
 This led to a completely new science called molecular genetics. 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.936
 Molecular genetics is a science that examines the present 

00:00:28.936 --> 00:00:34.990
 the structure of the molecules and the function of the genes, thus examining the DNA segments. 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:42.652
 In the 1950s, James Watson and Francis Crick helped to discover the structure of DNA, 

00:00:42.652 --> 00:00:48.700
 which gave rise to a number of amazing discoveries and one such discovery made Crick, 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.901
 Francis Crick and we call him the central dogma of molecular biology. 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.985
 The central dogma of molecular biology basically says DNA segments 

00:01:02.985 --> 00:01:13.698
 called genes encode RNA or ribonucleic acid. 

00:01:14.677 --> 00:01:23.873
 These small portions of RNA, referred to as codons, encode one of 20 amino acids. 

00:01:25.211 --> 00:01:27.842
 This is an amino acid. 

00:01:28.904 --> 00:01:33.141
 Now we come to a more biological concept, 

00:01:33.141 --> 00:01:39.258
 however, these amino acids that have been encoded have ultimately become the building blocks of proteins. 

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:45.071
 And it is these created proteins that work in our body. 

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:49.398
 Such as enzymes, which are proteins that accelerate reactions in the body 

00:01:49.398 --> 00:01:58.986
 or proteins that determine whether a substance can pass through different membranes inside and outside the cell. 

00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:02.400
 There are a lot of different types of proteins in the body, but the point is 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.117
 that proteins can mediate between genes and behavior. 

00:02:11.396 --> 00:02:17.990
 I use the word behavior because in psychology it includes a beautifully broad reference 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.318
 the function of our bodies and the response to the environment. 

00:02:22.318 --> 00:02:30.037
 The central dogma of molecular biology places great emphasis on the role of DNA 

00:02:30.037 --> 00:02:35.652
 in determining all the outputs of these proteins that cause our behavior. 

00:02:35.652 --> 00:02:42.821
 Subsequent discoveries, especially in the molecular area, have caused relative re-evaluation 

00:02:42.821 --> 00:02:49.107
 the meaning of the DNA sequence, or our gene sequence, to determine this function. 

00:02:49.107 --> 00:02:57.074
 As an example, steroids, which are hormones, can be considered environmental factors. 

00:02:57.074 --> 00:03:00.699
 Imagine a testosterone steroid. 

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:09.538
 We have heard that steroids travel between different parts of the body to trigger reactions, 

00:03:09.538 --> 00:03:15.597
 but these reactions are actually activating genes for protein production. 

00:03:16.598 --> 00:03:21.282
 If we want an example that touches the environment even more, we can imagine 

00:03:21.282 --> 00:03:24.151
 stimuli outside our body such as pheromones. 

00:03:24.151 --> 00:03:30.236
 Pheromones work the same because they stimulate the brain and cause some reaction in us. 

00:03:30.236 --> 00:03:35.443
 But the reaction is essentially again determined by the genes that make up these proteins 

00:03:35.443 --> 00:03:39.092
 and they have a function in our body. 

00:03:39.353 --> 00:03:44.319
 In both of these cases, the central dogma is slightly reversed, 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:51.403
 because at one point we place emphasis on DNA structure 

00:03:51.403 --> 00:03:56.083
 thus, the gene structure in determining the protein that affects our behavior, 

00:03:56.083 --> 00:04:01.891
 and now we are moving a bit of determination out of the DNA sequence. 

00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:07.028
 This phenomenon puts us in the concept of gene regulation. 

00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:15.310
 The concept of gene regulation becomes very important in the discussion of the environment 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:22.327
 and behavioral inheritance. There is a whole modulating world of genetic expression 

00:04:22.327 --> 00:04:30.487
 and I say modulating because gene expression is modulated by environmental factors, 

00:04:30.487 --> 00:04:35.750
 but one of the greatest achievements in clarifying these modulation factors 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.718
 has become a mapping of the human genome. 

00:04:38.718 --> 00:04:47.380
 In the last two decades, scientists have mapped the entire genome of about 30,000 genes. 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.107
 In the background, I drew an example of such an image 

00:04:51.107 --> 00:04:57.156
 with our 46 chromosomes and we can see that this might be the mentioned genes. 

00:04:57.156 --> 00:05:03.743
 Scientists have mapped all the genes involved in our genome. 

00:05:03.743 --> 00:05:09.304
 And while we have relied heavily on studies of twins and adoptions in the recent past, 

00:05:09.304 --> 00:05:14.245
 to narrow down the inheritance of behavioral features, now that we have mapped the entire human genome 

00:05:14.245 --> 00:05:17.445
 we can examine samples of a population with identical features and genes 

00:05:17.445 --> 00:05:21.645
 which we assume are involved in their features. 

00:05:21.645 --> 00:05:25.152
 And we can compare these genes. 

00:05:25.152 --> 00:05:31.160
 Such studies have provided us with some really amazing results, for example, we have found 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:38.203
 that the vast majority of our genes, I guess about 95% of genes, do not actually encode proteins 

00:05:38.203 --> 00:05:43.406
 but rather it controls how proteins are encoded. 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:51.135
 Thus, instead of changing the protein, it changes the context of the protein and when and how it manifests. 

00:05:51.135 --> 00:05:59.827
 A bit like a conditional sentence. If we eat sugar, we encode the protein hormone insulin. 

00:05:59.827 --> 00:06:08.156
 In the biology section, there is an entire list that includes gene control and gene expression modulation. 

00:06:08.156 --> 00:06:15.324
 I'm not going too deep, but it's an important point, especially when we see differences 

00:06:15.324 --> 00:06:21.907
 in the molecular structure of genes contributing to the inheritance of our behavior. 

00:06:21.907 --> 00:06:28.907
 In addition to studying the structure of DNA and the gene sequence, we began to discover other interesting things 

00:06:28.907 --> 00:06:32.299
 at the molecular level that affect gene expression. 

00:06:32.299 --> 00:06:37.624
 It is a completely new area of ​​interest called epigenetics. 

00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:48.408
 Epigenetics studies changes in gene expression that are not due to changes in DNA sequence. 

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:56.503
 A classic example of epigenetic influence is methylation, or addition of methyl groups to the gene. 

00:06:57.104 --> 00:07:06.580
 Addition of these methyl groups may make transcription factors more difficult to identify and activate the gene. 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:13.368
 Gene expression does not occur because the sequence is interrupted 

00:07:13.368 --> 00:07:17.248
 but rather because something prevents its activation. 

00:07:17.248 --> 00:07:23.944
 This phenomenon can be seen in rats where different maternal behavior can 

00:07:23.944 --> 00:07:28.709
 thanks to methylation in offspring almost always change the response to stress. 

00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:34.075
 We consider the environment to be the cause of methylation that affects gene expression 

00:07:34.075 --> 00:07:42.903
 and in this sense, epigenetic factors are capable of transcribing DNA sequences critical to our behavior. 

00:07:42.903 --> 00:07:47.409
 These terms are quite biological compared to most psychology, 

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:52.542
 however, molecular genetics and epigenetics are another step 

00:07:52.542 --> 00:07:56.792
 to solve the inheritance of our behavior.
