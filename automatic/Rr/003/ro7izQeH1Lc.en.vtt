current phone compare the size hikes

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.160 
current phone compare the size hikes
that's<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.150> lot<00:01:06.270> bigger<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:08.240> here<00:01:09.350> is<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.850> Kindle

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
that's a lot bigger and here is a Kindle

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.690 
that's a lot bigger and here is a Kindle
paperwhite<00:01:14.990> almost<00:01:15.990> as<00:01:16.229> long<00:01:16.530> quite<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> bit

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
paperwhite almost as long quite a bit

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.240 
paperwhite almost as long quite a bit
thinner<00:01:18.030> that's<00:01:18.360> that's<00:01:18.840> good<00:01:19.140> side<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.040> side

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
thinner that's that's good side to side

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.219 
thinner that's that's good side to side
because<00:01:20.550> with<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.119> paperwhite<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.900> really

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
because with the paperwhite it really

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.399 
because with the paperwhite it really
they<00:01:22.830> put<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.700> touch<00:01:23.909> zones<00:01:24.840> along<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
they put the the touch zones along the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.200 
they put the the touch zones along the
edge<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.220> other<00:01:26.310> Kindle<00:01:26.789> the<00:01:26.970> little

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
edge and on the other Kindle the little

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.490 
edge and on the other Kindle the little
buttons<00:01:27.479> because<00:01:27.810> really<00:01:28.050> that's<00:01:28.229> all<00:01:28.350> you

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
buttons because really that's all you

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.139 
buttons because really that's all you
can<00:01:28.710> do<00:01:28.860> with<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.250> barely<00:01:29.460> touch<00:01:29.789> the<00:01:29.820> edges

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
can do with it is barely touch the edges

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.300 
can do with it is barely touch the edges
so<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.170> phone<00:01:31.350> does<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.830> be<00:01:31.860> quite<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> bit

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
so the phone does have to be quite a bit

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.650 
so the phone does have to be quite a bit
thinner<00:01:32.490> if<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:33.030> any<00:01:33.149> chance<00:01:33.420> of
