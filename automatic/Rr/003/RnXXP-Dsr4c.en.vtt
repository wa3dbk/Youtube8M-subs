00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.969
 Yesterday 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.440
 present and are welcome to this 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.060
 is the new top 10 of halo 4 for 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.279
 participate mindfully in changing their plays 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.779
 so we're going to go to the mode without this 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.970
 It is a small tutorial of how to send me 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.860
 the plays choose the game where 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.900
 have some clips and this is for 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.360
 cut the success and is that they do not have it 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.850
 trimmed and good basically they 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.470
 I recommend starting many seconds before 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.180
 without finishing the video many seconds 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.489
 after the small clip team 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.620
 I just give him to record and once I 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.300
 I give in record and lack of seconds 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.610
 so that it happens in the play that is more 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.350
 In this case, it is a very public 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.430
 very novice so if they have plays 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.460
 just like this 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.990
 refrain from sending it because there 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.780
 many who see this kind of play and the 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.940
 truth is that they will not enter top 10 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.430
 so good as good it took me some 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.140
 seconds later and good in the name 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.540
 of the video they put what you 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.759
 want not there does not matter anything in this 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.799
 case of having donald duck rape 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.840
 because I'm a urchin like I eat 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.820
 also in the description and then nothing 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.710
 without so continue free to send the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.520
 plays they want as long as they do not 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.219
 be 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.320
 ninjas that nothing else in the girl tweets 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:21.600
 like these new two arms of existed 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.969
 you know then, well, good 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.969
 Once you are saved, you are given 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.740
 finish filming and finish it 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.899
 we will return that at least then 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.549
 the menu we will look for our new 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.740
 our new files and with 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.079
 just give it and we will go up to 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.149
 our shared files this can 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.530
 take a little bit because of the connection to 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.539
 internet but once it's uploaded 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.069
 because we will tell here how it is 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.679
 so then we go back 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.880
 again and we're going to give and we're going to 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.709
 look what is our archives 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.829
 shared that is right here below 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:55.530
 and to the right and that's it and we're going to 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.780
 film sign clips and there are the archives 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.989
 shared and well here we find rap 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.090
 the donald duck we are going to give again and 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:04.709
 and let's go to what is the mint suit 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.329
 that this is very important that 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.069
 put it the same as it is like I'm going 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:12.090
 to find the theater to be nonsense 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.129
 presents top and 4 then well it is 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.770
 disney present space top space 4 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.810
 this put it that way why 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.520
 at the top in the last top 10 there was 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.960
 written post so I think it's fair 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.730
 to check all the plays and then 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.410
 nothing good in his plays and comments here 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.910
 down what do you think and remember to follow me 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.910
 on social networks thanks
