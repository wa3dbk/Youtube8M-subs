hello guys and welcome to my tutorial on

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.950 
hello guys and welcome to my tutorial on
the<00:00:03.659> magma<00:00:04.080> crucible<00:00:04.620> now<00:00:05.490> as<00:00:05.910> you<00:00:06.450> can<00:00:06.540> see<00:00:06.600> ya

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
the magma crucible now as you can see ya

the magma crucible now as you can see ya
I've<00:00:07.170> got<00:00:07.680> my<00:00:07.830> mansion<00:00:08.069> full<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.429> things<00:00:08.700> our

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
I've got my mansion full of things our

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.940 
I've got my mansion full of things our
words<00:00:09.330> are<00:00:09.599> ever<00:00:09.929> be<00:00:10.139> putting<00:00:10.469> them<00:00:10.620> in<00:00:10.769> the

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
words are ever be putting them in the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.270 
words are ever be putting them in the
magma<00:00:11.250> crucible<00:00:11.960> maybe<00:00:12.960> some<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.380> them<00:00:13.500> but<00:00:13.830> no

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
magma crucible maybe some of them but no

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.349 
magma crucible maybe some of them but no
you<00:00:15.179> see<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.540> thing<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:16.550> the<00:00:17.550> magma<00:00:17.910> crucible

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
you see the thing is the magma crucible

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.870 
you see the thing is the magma crucible
uses<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> lot<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.170> energy<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:20.460> sort<00:00:20.699> of

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
uses a lot of energy and it's sort of

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.849 
uses a lot of energy and it's sort of
slow<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:22.760> be<00:00:23.760> careful<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.859> stone

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
slow so be careful of that stone

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.700 
slow so be careful of that stone
cobblestone<00:00:26.580> obsidian<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.510> never<00:00:27.840> act<00:00:28.109> makes

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
cobblestone obsidian and never act makes

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.999 
cobblestone obsidian and never act makes
lava<00:00:29.279> despite<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.359> saying<00:00:30.390> magma<00:00:31.199> crucible<00:00:31.740> it

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
lava despite it saying magma crucible it

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.299 
lava despite it saying magma crucible it
doesn't<00:00:33.000> actually<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.630> makes<00:00:33.960> lava<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:35.010> it's

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
doesn't actually it makes lava but it's

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.750 
doesn't actually it makes lava but it's
more<00:00:35.579> it's<00:00:35.910> more<00:00:36.149> intended<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:37.760> smelting

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
more it's more intended on smelting

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.360 
more it's more intended on smelting
things<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> liquid<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:40.559> once<00:00:41.280> again

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
things to a liquid you can once again

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.080 
things to a liquid you can once again
I'll<00:00:41.640> do<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.879> again<00:00:42.090> click<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:42.480> recipes<00:00:42.960> to

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
I'll do that again click on recipes to

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.029 
I'll do that again click on recipes to
see<00:00:45.090> all<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.960> different<00:00:46.050> recipes<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.890> stuff

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
see all the different recipes and stuff

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.479 
see all the different recipes and stuff
you<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.370> do<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:48.149> quite<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> few<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.020> them<00:00:49.140> so

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
you can do is quite a few of them so

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.700 
you can do is quite a few of them so
this<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.850> power<00:00:51.090> input<00:00:51.510> output<00:00:52.410> now<00:00:52.530> you

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
this is the power input output now you

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.350 
this is the power input output now you
can't<00:00:52.980> actually<00:00:53.219> scoop<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.879> out<00:00:54.090> with

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
can't actually scoop this out with

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.229 
can't actually scoop this out with
buckets<00:00:54.809> that's<00:00:55.170> not<00:00:55.440> possible<00:00:55.820> you<00:00:56.820> need<00:00:57.030> to

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
buckets that's not possible you need to

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.920 
buckets that's not possible you need to
as<00:00:57.539> its<00:00:57.989> shown<00:00:58.320> here<00:00:58.559> pipe<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:59.250> two<00:00:59.579> tanks<00:01:00.270> now

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
as its shown here pipe out two tanks now

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.140 
as its shown here pipe out two tanks now
it<00:01:01.260> uses<00:01:01.649> will<00:01:02.100> fluid<00:01:02.789> acts<00:01:02.940> or<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:04.970> what<00:01:05.970> does

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
it uses will fluid acts or the what does

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.230 
it uses will fluid acts or the what does
it<00:01:06.240> gold<00:01:06.470> BuildCraft<00:01:07.470> fluid<00:01:08.100> pipes<00:01:08.340> but<00:01:08.700> it

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
it gold BuildCraft fluid pipes but it

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.000 
it gold BuildCraft fluid pipes but it
does<00:01:09.510> seem<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.020> prefer<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.590> fluid<00:01:10.860> acts

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
does seem to prefer the fluid acts

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.010 
does seem to prefer the fluid acts
because<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.490> think<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:12.119> fluid<00:01:12.420> extra<00:01:12.750> strong

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
because I think of fluid extra strong

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.340 
because I think of fluid extra strong
transfers<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.430> liquid<00:01:14.880> foster<00:01:15.570> these<00:01:16.110> have

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
transfers the liquid foster these have

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.080 
transfers the liquid foster these have
been<00:01:16.500> running<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.220> same<00:01:17.490> amount<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:18.030> time

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
been running for the same amount of time

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.570 
been running for the same amount of time
and<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.720> one's<00:01:18.960> five<00:01:19.350> times<00:01:19.710> as<00:01:20.009> for<00:01:20.250> maybe

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
and this one's five times as for maybe

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.649 
and this one's five times as for maybe
six<00:01:20.820> times<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:22.020> full<00:01:22.229> as<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.890> BuildCraft<00:01:23.430> one

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
six times as full as the BuildCraft one

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.490 
six times as full as the BuildCraft one
so<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.979> main<00:01:26.220> thing<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.580> again<00:01:27.140> well<00:01:28.140> cook

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
so the main thing that again well cook

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.609 
so the main thing that again well cook
over<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.280> these<00:01:30.119> give<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.570> llama<00:01:30.810> these

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
over this is these give you llama these

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.580 
over this is these give you llama these
give<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.979> destabilize<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:33.380> molten<00:01:34.380> red

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
give you destabilize the molten red

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.130 
give you destabilize the molten red
stone<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.790> one<00:01:36.030> gives<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.360> Moulton<00:01:36.930> in

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
stone this one gives you Moulton in

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.319

glowstone energize does tons quite a fun

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.719 
glowstone energize does tons quite a fun
thing<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.600> play<00:01:42.780> worth<00:01:43.560> because<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.549> like

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
thing to play worth because it's like

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.710 
thing to play worth because it's like
water<00:01:45.000> but<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.390> goes<00:01:45.540> up<00:01:45.780> instead<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.320> down<00:01:46.409> so

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
water but it goes up instead of down so

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.870 
water but it goes up instead of down so
definitely<00:01:48.720> something<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.229> look<00:01:49.259> into<00:01:49.850> now<00:01:50.850> i

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
definitely something to look into now i

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.929 
definitely something to look into now i
do<00:01:51.149> think<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.380> don't<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.399> think<00:01:53.790> this

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
do think that I don't I think this

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.190 
do think that I don't I think this
machine<00:01:54.390> if<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.630> let<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.369> sort<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.460> like<00:01:56.640> Cruz

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
machine if you let it sort of like Cruz

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.359 
machine if you let it sort of like Cruz

wings<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.909> magma<00:02:00.210> crucible<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:01.500> can

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
wings of a magma crucible it can

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.690 
wings of a magma crucible it can
actually<00:02:04.079> power<00:02:04.320> itself<00:02:05.009> but<00:02:05.310> i'm<00:02:05.460> not

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
actually power itself but i'm not

actually power itself but i'm not
completely<00:02:06.060> shown<00:02:06.509> or<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.290> don't<00:02:07.710> quote

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
completely shown or that so don't quote

completely shown or that so don't quote
me<00:02:08.479> okay<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.869> that's<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.379> for<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.679> magma

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
me okay so that's it for the magma
