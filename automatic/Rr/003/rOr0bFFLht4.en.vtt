00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 well with me I'm robben and 17 and 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.130
 welcome to the new race of 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.480
 gestation with lay subscribers but 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.250
 As you can see, this time a little 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.500
 different vale we're going to run like 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.519
 you are watching with the blazers so 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.750
 let's see with those with whom 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.070
 how good are we going to see how it gives us 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.680
 this race as you see is that over 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.279
 we have to use with the place we have 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.279
 what to do 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:32.189
 going with the blazer this spiral go 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.700
 you that got me so let's see 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.239
 if I'm able to pass it because I do not know 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.850
 I 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.850
 this looks dodgy eye or game 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.890
 are two laps by the way but but that 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.530
 I pass it I'm stopping this 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.530
 program is worth this does not end 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.449
 how can it be true or can not be 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.399
 true that I have done that has made you 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.739
 it's from being bad people this being bad people 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.589
 that is, it can not be true that I have 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.750
 done that is it was up the tube and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.210
 has arrived 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.890
 and it has pushed me just above the whole 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:15.530
 seriously seriously you have to go up and down 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:19.960
 this is going to be crazy that next to the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.960
 point at the top is pushed 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.640
 no, I could not, I was fucking 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.700
 Up above the whole uncle had already passed 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.890
 yes, it had happened 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.789
 not many are worth it, please, let's go 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.060
 and sr 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:43.340
 a perfect kid to see now what 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.420
 we have to do is work here 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.390
 to see that so eye will go down braking 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.640
 because I water 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.920
 I think that really to see can be 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.899
 do in the plan the trap that would be to jump 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.450
 suddenly to the point but man is not 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.310
 it's not very legal either, it's cooler 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.610
 do it right so let's try 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.610
 having a good time and I was there 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.430
 that has pushed me right up when 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.440
 I was next to the damn point 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.019
 real rage but good nothing happens 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.019
 I passed it third, so this one 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.150
 practically safe and good to see if 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.670
 At least it was advancing this 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.680
 second to come here is worth 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.209
 so let's face again to 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.319
 mercy because they are two laps and that 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.480
 It takes you up and down to go down 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.810
 obviously it's easier it's easier 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.470
 get off but getting expensive is that over like 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.990
 he clashed with those who come from above 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.390
 it's quite unique sometimes 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:03:00.770
 Equivate stretches on lap 2 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:05.190
 let's see let's see eye with the point 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:08.160
 in short let's see the first attempt 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.030
 here ok let's go up first 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.440
 try is a game a little much to the 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.810
 first try I'm having it 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.110
 I am a little bit without more old forces 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.890
 although my image is a bit 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.410
 do not 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:27.240
 because he says feel against the same favor 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.490
 that comes in the opposite direction of truth 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.000
 I think to himself because the clothes 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.560
 appeared the same or be this one clear 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.020
 this explanation that more endurance if another 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.530
 once marked 3 x awesome van 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:44.270
 three times and you go three times 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.270
 true that is, it is impressive 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.060
 ok let's see how to up or 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.530
 try to go outside or by the 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.400
 interior I mean try to go by 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:01.709
 the center and I pass it let's go sir 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.390
 ok I keep third place a lot what 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.130
 I feel sorry I'm going to catch the point what 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:10.080
 I feel 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:12.870
 I did not want to fall or it's not going to give me 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.030
 time but you know it could be done 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.310
 already said what could be done dirty 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.450
 I did not want to repeat it but 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.280
 also because I had left 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.590
 it's a lot simpler but hey hey 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.810
 I put the truth in the second place 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.190
 point have the other side to avoid that 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.630
 to be avoided in the cell with what 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.110
 unintentionally done but some 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.670
 requiring and as I say I'm going to see it 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.140
 changes place but good will 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.270
 finish second position 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.450
 we go here we take the bend there 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.000
 and the goal then is only two points 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.040
 so let's see we catch let's go to 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.410
 approaching the horses I want 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.800
 make a little horse I can not make a 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.120
 little horse 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.610
 Well, nothing is the same because a 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.550
 little horse like jumping around here doing 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.430
 well doing jumps this over here and 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.380
 guys and we get in the goal with 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.970
 spill included by the way then finished 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.230
 they are a position nothing more than a 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.020
 position the truth that the stone is 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.520
 pretty cool indeed congratulations to the 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.140
 victor that in a life I do not know what I think 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.720
 it was called an anger or something 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.240
 so congratulations in fact I'll see 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.220
 then a life then congratulations for the 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.690
