supposed to be a US ally and has been

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.849 
supposed to be a US ally and has been
for<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.490> long<00:00:26.550> time<00:00:27.240> but<00:00:27.570> based<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.320> reports

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
for a long time but based on the reports

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.290 
for a long time but based on the reports
that<00:00:28.980> are<00:00:29.070> coming<00:00:29.369> out<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.760> looks<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.269> though

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
that are coming out it looks as though

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.569 
that are coming out it looks as though
the<00:00:30.570> u.s.<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.140> pushing<00:00:31.830> Pakistan<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.489> a

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
the u.s. is pushing Pakistan in a

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.000 
the u.s. is pushing Pakistan in a
direction<00:00:32.940> that's<00:00:33.120> creating<00:00:33.840> tension<00:00:34.469> what's

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
direction that's creating tension what's

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.580 
direction that's creating tension what's
your<00:00:35.190> take<00:00:35.460> well<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.120> think<00:00:36.360> after<00:00:36.540> 911<00:00:37.290> there

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
your take well I think after 911 there

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.830 
your take well I think after 911 there
was<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> slow<00:00:38.160> clash<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.790> strategic<00:00:39.570> interest

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
was a slow clash of strategic interest

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.319 
was a slow clash of strategic interest
between<00:00:39.989> washington<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.680> islamabad

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
between washington and islamabad

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.250 
between washington and islamabad
essentially<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> United<00:00:42.750> States<00:00:42.930> thought

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
essentially the United States thought

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.869 
essentially the United States thought
that<00:00:43.440> they<00:00:43.559> were<00:00:43.620> going<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.040> get<00:00:44.309> Pakistan's

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
that they were going to get Pakistan's

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.850 
that they were going to get Pakistan's
full<00:00:45.510> cooperation<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.469> going<00:00:46.680> after

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
full cooperation and going after

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.190 
full cooperation and going after
militants<00:00:47.399> however<00:00:48.239> i<00:00:48.480> think<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.050> bush

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
militants however i think the bush

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.439 
militants however i think the bush
administration<00:00:49.829> initially<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.550> sort<00:00:51.360> of

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
administration initially and sort of

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.420 
administration initially and sort of
slowly<00:00:51.930> understood<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.770> later<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.250> but

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
slowly understood this later on but

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.490 
slowly understood this later on but
didn't<00:00:53.670> act<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.180> they<00:00:54.870> didn't<00:00:55.079> understand

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
didn't act on it they didn't understand

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.869 
didn't act on it they didn't understand
it<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.860> extent<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> which<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.520> militant

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
it the extent to which the militant

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.540 
it the extent to which the militant
groups<00:00:57.090> at<00:00:57.239> pakistan<00:00:57.629> used<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.899> fund<00:00:58.250> would<00:00:59.250> no
