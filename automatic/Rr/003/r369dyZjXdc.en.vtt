00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello to all and all these pictures 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.280
 forgotten or that of strong gamers with a 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.290
 new guide on assassin's creed iii 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.290
 and the trophy this time we go 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.109
 try to have and monopoly is to 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.560
 send a convoy to boston new york and 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:23.100
 the border now that's it's 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.930
 easy enough the whole thing it's just 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.269
 find a shop in each of the masts 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.640
 in boston and new york it's pretty easy 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.820
 especially in boston there we are obliged 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.870
 to find one during the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.540
 campaign 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.090
 it's mostly the border that took me 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.489
 still time could find I 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.530
 showed you that at the beginning of the video 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.410
 so while I'm there I'm going to show 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.420
 the other tulare locations all 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.539
 the stores there are 3 on each 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.129
 map and you will need it all 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.280
 ways to find them all for the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.359
 trophy finds it the coureurs des bois 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.119
 like this there to sell a fault that 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.720
 is not damaged at each store 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.340
 but good when you did that and 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.320
 you'll just have to enter any 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.100
 which shop or in your mansion 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.040
 in all i stem and you crack 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.960
 three convoys in your homestead are 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.680
 pursued for unlocking the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.409
 wood worker level 1 or 2 he 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.100
 know the forums pretty quickly if not 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.500
 right now 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.170
 so that's not a problem done in 3 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.659
 since that's the goal of the trophy 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.000
 send three at the same time 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:43.100
 so when you will interact in the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.119
 part and change you will see the 3 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.909
 3we in blue boston new york and the 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.930
 border is what you send it that 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.270
 has no importance 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.610
 I sent him our righteous floods 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.320
 to send something then of any 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.780
 way if you really want to do the 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.570
 big exchange made by naval convoy 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.869
 bring in more even if it lasts a 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.000
 little bit longer and you have to 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.600
 a few more levels for the crafter 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.340
 but it's worth the wait 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.530
 so here I think I said everything 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.769
 that there is to know simply 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.170
 find a store in the border 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.940
 that's the hardest thing because 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.090
 really it's a big map 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.880
 and then he forces us not explored all 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.160
 during the broadcast 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.190
 so we find out there are zones 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.730
 we discover by but here I have 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.010
 sent tno everywhere 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.870
 in addition after I continued to play and 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.049
 yann but convoy that was attacked 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:49.030
 so but good trophy boom thank you for having 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.030
 to keep and the next
