the same time and the pin lines we're

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.630 
the same time and the pin lines we're
done<00:04:20.299> with<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.019> same<00:04:21.229> paint<00:04:21.650> so<00:04:22.010> it's<00:04:22.490> all

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
done with the same paint so it's all

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.490 
done with the same paint so it's all
just<00:04:23.090> an<00:04:23.180> illusion<00:04:23.419> because<00:04:23.840> of<00:04:24.169> the<00:04:24.289> light

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
just an illusion because of the light

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.790 
just an illusion because of the light
and<00:04:24.979> the<00:04:25.280> color<00:04:25.870> even<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:26.960> pinstriping<00:04:27.590> there

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
and the color even the pinstriping there

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.020 
and the color even the pinstriping there
that's<00:04:28.039> all<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.400> same<00:04:29.110> so<00:04:30.110> basically<00:04:31.030> that's

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
that's all the same so basically that's

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.640 
that's all the same so basically that's
a<00:04:32.210> quick<00:04:32.390> walk<00:04:32.630> around<00:04:32.660> at<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.140> truck
