00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
we recommend is plan about you know ten

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.880 
we recommend is plan about you know ten
to<00:01:05.850> thirty<00:01:06.119> different<00:01:06.299> meals<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.140> then

to thirty different meals and then

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.520 
to thirty different meals and then
multiply<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.210> equal<00:01:09.540> 90<00:01:09.810> meals<00:01:10.140> which<00:01:10.380> is

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
multiply that to equal 90 meals which is

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.780 
multiply that to equal 90 meals which is
30<00:01:10.860> months<00:01:11.280> or<00:01:11.450> three<00:01:12.450> months<00:01:13.700> accordingly<00:01:14.700> so

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
30 months or three months accordingly so

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.850 
30 months or three months accordingly so
if<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.119> plan<00:01:15.330> out<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:16.170> know<00:01:16.290> 30<00:01:16.590> different

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
if you plan out you know 30 different

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.890 
if you plan out you know 30 different
meals<00:01:17.369> then<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.180> would<00:01:18.299> multiply<00:01:18.390> each

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
meals then you would multiply each

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.440 
meals then you would multiply each
ingredient<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.770> needed<00:01:20.130> by<00:01:20.549> three<00:01:20.909> if

ingredient that you needed by three if

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.240 
ingredient that you needed by three if
you<00:01:21.570> did<00:01:21.689> 10<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.350> multiply<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.860> by<00:01:22.920> nine

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
you did 10 and you multiply it by nine

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.690 
you did 10 and you multiply it by nine
and<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.670> forth<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.780> anyways<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.229> start<00:01:25.470> out<00:01:25.700> by

and so forth so anyways you start out by

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.700 
and so forth so anyways you start out by
put<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.299> menu<00:01:27.509> plan<00:01:27.630> sheet<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.290> put<00:01:28.500> day

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
purchase so anyways like I said in the

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.810 
purchase so anyways like I said in the
Excel<00:03:45.170> program<00:03:45.350> this<00:03:45.799> does<00:03:45.980> all<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.250> math<00:03:46.430> for

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
Excel program this does all the math for

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.729 
Excel program this does all the math for
you<00:03:46.850> so<00:03:47.329> you<00:03:47.390> may<00:03:47.570> want<00:03:47.810> to<00:03:47.930> try<00:03:48.140> it<00:03:48.260> out<00:03:48.470> give

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
you so you may want to try it out give

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.590 
you so you may want to try it out give
it<00:03:48.829> a<00:03:48.890> try<00:03:49.100> it's<00:03:49.459> not<00:03:49.579> too<00:03:49.790> hard<00:03:50.000> we<00:03:50.180> made<00:03:50.299> a<00:03:50.329> new

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
it a try it's not too hard we made a new

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.380 
it a try it's not too hard we made a new
one<00:03:50.810> if<00:03:51.079> you<00:03:51.350> ever<00:03:51.440> tried<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:51.890> old<00:03:52.100> one<00:03:52.459> it<00:03:52.730> was

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
one if you ever tried the old one it was

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.789 
one if you ever tried the old one it was
harder<00:03:53.780> we<00:03:53.900> made<00:03:54.079> a<00:03:54.109> brand<00:03:54.410> new<00:03:54.530> one<00:03:54.680> that's

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
harder we made a brand new one that's

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.550 
harder we made a brand new one that's
way<00:03:55.100> easier<00:03:55.130> so<00:03:56.079> go<00:03:57.079> ahead<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:57.350> give<00:03:57.440> that<00:03:57.470> a

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
way easier so go ahead and give that a

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.199 
way easier so go ahead and give that a
try<00:03:57.620> or<00:03:58.070> you<00:03:58.519> know<00:03:58.609> you<00:03:58.820> can<00:03:58.940> do<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.120> math

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
try or you know you can do the math

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.270 
try or you know you can do the math
yourself<00:03:59.390> if<00:03:59.750> you<00:04:00.440> would<00:04:00.620> like<00:04:00.799> and<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.100> want

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
yourself if you would like and you want

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.160 
yourself if you would like and you want
to<00:04:01.790> something<00:04:02.120> without<00:04:02.269> cells<00:04:02.570> so<00:04:02.780> good<00:04:02.989> luck

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
to something without cells so good luck

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.489 
to something without cells so good luck
and<00:04:03.380> let<00:04:03.829> us<00:04:03.920> know<00:04:04.070> how<00:04:04.100> goes
