 oh my, I 'm only provoking 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.910
 via provocations had an idea to 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:40.910
 speak the word via provocations in 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.910
 All Greece to talk taunts 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:51.810
 provocations 13 years walking from 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:53.220
 uncertain and of the plot doubts now year 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.280
 14 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:00.600
 this program may not be a window 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:06.020
 open to the world but is certainly a 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:10.830
 periscope was social 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:15.630
 provocations right here today 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:19.470
 a great art historian 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.590
 of public speaking is what they tell us 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.740
 he graduated from the University of Rio Grande do Sul 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.869
 valley of the bells and doctorate in history 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.460
 by usp social history in the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.760
 it matters a lot 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:40.350
 Today he teaches the university of 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:44.210
 campinas unicamp and writes, among others 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:48.689
 many things about teaching history 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:52.830
 and the formation of the United States 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.570
 He is also curator of exhibitions and 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.450
 museums 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.210
 he comes here to talk about all that 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.270
 He wants everything else he wants 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.950
 because he deserves to say whatever he wants 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:13.510
 he is leandro karnal 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:19.150
 leandro karnal or just said ramón that 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:25.600
 in just before the First World War 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:28.319
 history is the science of unhappiness 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.720
 of men 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.060
 Comment this now we have books 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.300
 story about happiness we have 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.750
 books about happy periods but 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.590
 taking a little Freudian axis in the 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.560
 unhappiness to frustration and trauma 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.320
 there would probably be no culture 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.970
 we have fascination including 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.519
 difficult times 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.700
 see a case you certainly know 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.250
 well when I teach hitler a 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.230
 attention of students is enormous 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.570
 when I teach on adenáuer o 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.060
 that re-emerged Germany after the 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.700
 war the students diminishes this attention 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.340
 with a dollar on short man 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.980
 war the students are interested when I 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.870
 I give a lesson about his successor. 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.019
 everything is labor and the interest of the 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:24.700
 students kai apparently our 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:28.000
 interest is for happiness in the past 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.360
 but there is a huge seduction for tyranny 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.630
 by terror for death and for 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:39.160
 unhappiness citing joao cabral de melo 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:44.400
 grandson, happiness 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:47.950
 takes work I believe that even 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.560
 This work in this interesting phrase is 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.609
 Because being happy looks like something bad. 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.090
 taste 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:57.310
 formerly talk about happiness 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.160
 seemed to be a source of envy 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.459
 people, it 's important for you to 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.920
 certain existential pain happiness for 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.560
 example to the left always seemed 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.049
 certain moments of lack of 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.790
 because if you notice that the 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.570
 number of children dying in the 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.790
 Africa 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:19.090
 otherwise I'd be laughing I'd be crying 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.420
 by the corners and also seemed a bit 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.270
 to the direction 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.090
 the home of the expression that being happy was 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.790
 bad taste or kitschy 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.390
 in fact history works too 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.640
 with this prediction about happiness 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.670
 for example because there are periods in 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:41.390
 which is great political happiness as in 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.890
 classical Greece was very important and 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.190
 periods such as ours in which the 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:49.130
 individual happiness is managed by self 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:53.590
 help since the individual is more 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:59.170
 important than the collective who is today 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:03.200
 the great historian you recommend 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:05.060
 to read I was made very much by the 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.580
 ideas of be the fourth 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.010
 I really enjoyed reading and marc bloch. 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.140
 French historian murdered in 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.810
 World War II and only very 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.790
 influenced by a complex author a 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.560
 Jesuit who was a psychoanalytic philosopher 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.810
 called michel 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.210
 he read, but when he read a work of 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.000
 historian alive as a medievalist 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.880
 goff a specialized age woman 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.910
 natalie modern as we do that 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.100
 many modern hospitals works while reading 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.410
 peter burke while taking the authors 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.530
 contemporaries in several of them 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:42.860
 I notice this brightness of joining research 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:45.140
 with well written text ie 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:49.160
 a wonderful epiphany 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:51.860
 reading is a huge company in life and 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.140
 who does not read prophesy a student of mine 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.790
 a very lonely childhood and will have a 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:06:02.900
 very lonely old age because you 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:04.790
 specialized in united states 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.190
 I have a deep interest in 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:10.700
 American society in its 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:13.400
 contradictions in their culture that produced 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:17.440
 world culture for the good and for the 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:20.360
 that produced problems and solutions 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.030
 absolutely interesting, I know the 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.130
 American society relatively well. 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.560
 I know American history. 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:31.520
 relatively well and has a fascination 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.889
 for these ideas as cinema as rock 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.499
 with the idea of ​​common border 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:40.580
 imperialism as all this production 

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:43.189
 that influences us so much 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.680
 Americans Cause Passions 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:48.409
 sometimes because it's critical it 's fair 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.990
 of execrable actions of imperialism 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:53.590
 and sometimes because there is a lot of 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:57.259
 resentment and envy of success 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:59.469
 American also in the states 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:03.289
 united a false power 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:04.539
 I've lived for the whole world and it's very 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:12.469
 important 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:16.240
 drones are art x moraes 

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:19.099
 the imperialists in Roman history 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.439
 Assyrians Carlos Magnus 

00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:23.300
 or the Americans in whom the 

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:27.050
 concept is very different in each 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.370
 The empires were never smooth 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.830
 violent 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.979
 the horrors of King Leopold in Belgium 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:36.529
 the genocidal actions carried out by the 

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:39.409
 england in barbarian and afghanistan 

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:43.039
 united states vietnam all 

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:45.979
 imperialisms are absurdly violent 

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:48.620
 What has happened in recent years is that 

00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:51.139
 imperialism as well as violent is 

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:53.870
 also being a bit hypocritical because 

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:55.219
 He does not want to kill his citizens anymore. 

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:57.649
 but only the others 

00:07:55.219 --> 00:08:00.080
 the owner of a capacity absolutely 

00:07:57.649 --> 00:08:03.439
 Pontius Pilates to wash his hands 

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:08.259
 completely and kill people without the weight 

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:08.259
 the death of the agents of this question 

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:17.580
 the attacker can not
