okay welcome this video lecture is going

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.410 
okay welcome this video lecture is going
to<00:00:04.200> be<00:00:04.319> about<00:00:04.560> adding<00:00:05.040> subtracting<00:00:05.420> mixed

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
to be about adding subtracting mixed

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.839 
to be about adding subtracting mixed
numbers<00:00:06.600> my<00:00:07.500> name<00:00:07.680> is<00:00:07.890> Mark<00:00:08.189> thank<00:00:08.550> you<00:00:08.639> for

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
numbers my name is Mark thank you for

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:09.520 
numbers my name is Mark thank you for
watching

watching

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.959 
watching
so<00:00:10.530> how<00:00:10.710> do<00:00:10.769> you<00:00:10.889> add<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.309> subtract<00:00:11.700> mixed

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
so how do you add and subtract mixed

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.860 
so how do you add and subtract mixed
numbers<00:00:12.150> well<00:00:12.840> it's<00:00:13.410> pretty<00:00:13.620> simple

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
numbers well it's pretty simple

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.120 
numbers well it's pretty simple
let's<00:00:15.870> start<00:00:16.109> off<00:00:16.199> with<00:00:16.230> our<00:00:16.379> first<00:00:16.529> mixed

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
let's start off with our first mixed

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.420 
let's start off with our first mixed
number<00:00:17.460> nine<00:00:18.420> half<00:00:18.869> nine<00:00:19.619> one-fourth<00:00:20.310> plus

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
number nine half nine one-fourth plus

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.689 
number nine half nine one-fourth plus
nine<00:00:20.760> half<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.240> what<00:00:21.390> you're<00:00:21.510> going<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.689> do<00:00:21.930> is

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
nine half so what you're going to do is

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.089 
nine half so what you're going to do is
you're<00:00:23.699> going<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:24.210> add<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.140> whole<00:00:25.170> numbers<00:00:25.859> so

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
you're going to add the whole numbers so

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.410 
you're going to add the whole numbers so
you're<00:00:26.640> gonna<00:00:26.760> have<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.000> do<00:00:27.060> anything<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
you're gonna have to do anything the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.580 
you're gonna have to do anything the
whole<00:00:27.539> number<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:27.779> go<00:00:28.019> ahead<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.289> add<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
whole number so go ahead and add the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.009 
whole number so go ahead and add the
whole<00:00:28.710> numbers<00:00:29.099> as<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.179> then<00:00:30.689> add<00:00:30.869> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
whole numbers as is and then add the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.530 
whole numbers as is and then add the
fractions<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.710> do<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.980> separately<00:00:35.270> okay<00:00:36.270> so

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
fractions and do that separately okay so

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.200 
fractions and do that separately okay so
I'm<00:00:36.719> doing<00:00:37.020> nine<00:00:37.230> plus<00:00:37.559> nine<00:00:37.940> and<00:00:38.940> then<00:00:39.120> 1/2

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
I'm doing nine plus nine and then 1/2

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.869 
I'm doing nine plus nine and then 1/2
plus<00:00:39.750> 1/4<00:00:40.700> okay

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
plus 1/4 okay

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.580 
plus 1/4 okay
another<00:00:42.420> fourth<00:00:42.690> now<00:00:42.899> that's<00:00:43.079> pretty<00:00:43.260> easy<00:00:43.469> I

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
another fourth now that's pretty easy I

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.279 
another fourth now that's pretty easy I
know<00:00:43.920> what<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.190> 18<00:00:44.870> and<00:00:45.870> then<00:00:46.079> now<00:00:46.230> we

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
know what that is 18 and then now we

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.680 
know what that is 18 and then now we
just<00:00:46.469> got<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.680> figure<00:00:47.010> out<00:00:47.039> what<00:00:47.280> 1/4<00:00:47.879> plus<00:00:48.180> 1/2

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
just got to figure out what 1/4 plus 1/2

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.279 
just got to figure out what 1/4 plus 1/2
is<00:00:49.129> well<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.430> add<00:00:50.579> 1/4<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.210> 1/2<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.809> need<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.140> do

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
is well to add 1/4 and 1/2 we need to do

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.299 
is well to add 1/4 and 1/2 we need to do
it<00:00:52.610> we<00:00:53.610> need<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.789> common<00:00:54.570> denominator<00:00:55.219> so<00:00:56.219> with

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
it we need a common denominator so with

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.770 
it we need a common denominator so with
the<00:00:56.399> carbonator<00:00:57.090> between<00:00:57.420> 1/4<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.379> 1/2<00:00:59.780> 4

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the carbonator between 1/4 and 1/2 4

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.009 
the carbonator between 1/4 and 1/2 4
okay<00:01:01.559> well<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.550> already<00:01:02.820> has<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> 4<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.870> this

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
okay well this already has a 4 so this

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.920 
okay well this already has a 4 so this
doesn't<00:01:04.290> need<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> change<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.489> then<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.420> 1/2

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
doesn't need to change so then the 1/2

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.590 
doesn't need to change so then the 1/2
needs<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.470> change<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.180> I'm<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.420> leave

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
needs to change so I'm going to leave

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.840 
needs to change so I'm going to leave
1/4<00:01:10.320> as<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.540> what<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.659> 1/2<00:01:13.580> written<00:01:14.580> as

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
1/4 as is and what is 1/2 written as

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.910 
1/4 as is and what is 1/2 written as
force

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
force

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.660 
force
so<00:01:16.920> 1/2<00:01:17.310> written<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.880> fourth<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.860> 2/4<00:01:21.799> okay<00:01:22.830> and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
so 1/2 written is fourth is 2/4 okay and

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.320 
so 1/2 written is fourth is 2/4 okay and
then<00:01:24.000> now<00:01:24.180> what<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:25.100> 1/4<00:01:26.100> plus<00:01:26.400> 2/4<00:01:27.060> that's<00:01:27.240> 3/4

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
then now what is 1/4 plus 2/4 that's 3/4

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.310 
then now what is 1/4 plus 2/4 that's 3/4
[Applause]

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.980 

so<00:01:34.320> nine<00:01:34.620> and<00:01:34.830> a<00:01:34.860> half<00:01:35.040> plus<00:01:35.610> nine<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.390> a

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
so nine and a half plus nine and a

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.110 
so nine and a half plus nine and a
fourth<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:38.180> 18<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.540> 3/4<00:01:40.370> that's<00:01:41.370> pretty<00:01:41.640> good

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
fourth is 18 and 3/4 that's pretty good

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.460 
fourth is 18 and 3/4 that's pretty good
all<00:01:42.360> right<00:01:42.690> let's<00:01:42.990> try<00:01:43.320> another<00:01:44.100> one<00:01:46.310> how<00:01:47.310> bout

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
all right let's try another one how bout

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.410 
all right let's try another one how bout
5<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.800> 2/3<00:01:50.430> plus<00:01:51.920> 4<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.070> 1/2

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420

[Applause]

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.560 

okay<00:02:01.280> so<00:02:02.280> I'll<00:02:02.340> do<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.700> one<00:02:02.909> just<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.390> did

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
okay so I'll do this one just like I did

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.330 
okay so I'll do this one just like I did
the<00:02:03.659> last<00:02:03.689> one<00:02:04.170> I'm<00:02:04.770> going<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.189> go<00:02:05.369> ahead<00:02:05.430> and

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
the last one I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.979 
the last one I'm going to go ahead and
line<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.610> up<00:02:08.940> now<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.360> time<00:02:09.630> I'm<00:02:09.780> going<00:02:09.929> to

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
line this up now this time I'm going to

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.630 
line this up now this time I'm going to
line<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.380> up<00:02:10.560> vertically<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.340> I'm<00:02:11.430> going<00:02:11.580> to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
line this up vertically so I'm going to

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.350 
line this up vertically so I'm going to
write<00:02:11.790> my<00:02:12.000> four<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.900> half<00:02:13.640> underneath<00:02:14.640> my

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
write my four and a half underneath my

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.490 
write my four and a half underneath my
two<00:02:15.420> thirds<00:02:16.280> okay<00:02:18.260> like<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:20.130> I'm<00:02:20.250> at<00:02:21.500> and

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
two thirds okay like that and I'm at and

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.440 
two thirds okay like that and I'm at and
before<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.220> start<00:02:23.580> Mattie<00:02:23.849> I'm<00:02:24.030> going<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.300> go

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
before I start Mattie I'm going to go

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.390 
before I start Mattie I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.810> convert<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.170> one<00:02:25.410> half<00:02:25.980> and

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
ahead and convert this one half and

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.820 
ahead and convert this one half and
these<00:02:27.209> two<00:02:27.540> thirds<00:02:27.900> let's<00:02:28.230> get<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.410> common

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
these two thirds let's get a common

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.050 
these two thirds let's get a common
denominator<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:29.430> it's<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.670> common<00:02:29.940> Dominator

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
denominator so it's the common Dominator

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.340 
denominator so it's the common Dominator
between<00:02:30.599> 1/2<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.080> 1/3<00:02:31.230> well<00:02:32.160> that'd<00:02:32.400> be<00:02:32.430> six

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
between 1/2 and 1/3 well that'd be six

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.740 
between 1/2 and 1/3 well that'd be six
so<00:02:34.350> I'm<00:02:34.680> going<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:34.980> have<00:02:35.130> six<00:02:35.549> in<00:02:35.940> the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
so I'm going to have six in the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.780 
so I'm going to have six in the
denominator

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
denominator

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
denominator
and<00:02:38.790> now<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:38.910> just<00:02:39.000> gotta<00:02:39.269> look<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.600> here<00:02:39.780> and

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
and now I just gotta look in here and

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.460 
and now I just gotta look in here and
see<00:02:39.900> okay<00:02:40.350> well<00:02:41.069> two<00:02:41.340> times<00:02:41.670> what<00:02:42.180> gives<00:02:42.600> me

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
see okay well two times what gives me

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.839 
see okay well two times what gives me
six<00:02:44.130> well<00:02:44.910> that's<00:02:45.060> three<00:02:45.450> okay<00:02:46.640> something<00:02:47.640> and

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
six well that's three okay something and

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.199 
six well that's three okay something and
I'm<00:02:48.000> going<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.239> multiply<00:02:49.099> the<00:02:50.099> top<00:02:50.370> by<00:02:50.400> 3<00:02:51.000> so

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
I'm going to multiply the top by 3 so

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.710 
I'm going to multiply the top by 3 so
what<00:02:51.390> is<00:02:51.510> 1<00:02:51.780> times<00:02:52.080> 3<00:02:52.260> 1<00:02:53.250> times<00:02:53.519> 3<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:53.940> 3

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
what is 1 times 3 1 times 3 is 3

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.390 
what is 1 times 3 1 times 3 is 3
ok<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.970> then<00:02:57.569> over<00:02:58.080> here<00:02:58.110> 3<00:02:58.799> times<00:02:59.010> what<00:02:59.370> gives

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
ok and then over here 3 times what gives

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.240 
ok and then over here 3 times what gives
you<00:02:59.790> 6<00:03:00.150> let's<00:03:00.840> -<00:03:03.079> so<00:03:04.079> let's<00:03:04.230> do<00:03:04.380> 2<00:03:04.590> times<00:03:04.829> 2<00:03:05.220> and

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
you 6 let's - so let's do 2 times 2 and

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.860 
you 6 let's - so let's do 2 times 2 and
2<00:03:05.549> times<00:03:05.820> 2<00:03:06.209> is<00:03:06.239> 4

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.180 

all<00:03:09.870> right<00:03:10.220> so<00:03:11.220> now<00:03:11.370> we're<00:03:11.609> adding<00:03:12.380> 5<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:13.620> 4<00:03:13.859> 6

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
all right so now we're adding 5 and 4 6

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.170 
all right so now we're adding 5 and 4 6
plus<00:03:14.459> 5<00:03:14.730> in<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.239> +<00:03:15.750> 4<00:03:15.959> +<00:03:16.140> 3<00:03:16.319> 6<00:03:16.590> so<00:03:17.340> 5<00:03:17.549> plus<00:03:17.850> 4<00:03:18.150> is

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
plus 5 in it + 4 + 3 6 so 5 plus 4 is

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:25.490 
plus 5 in it + 4 + 3 6 so 5 plus 4 is
what<00:03:18.480> 9<00:03:20.150> 4<00:03:21.150> 6<00:03:21.450> +<00:03:21.810> 3<00:03:21.840> 6<00:03:22.410> what's<00:03:22.799> that<00:03:23.900> 7<00:03:24.900> 6

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
what 9 4 6 + 3 6 what's that 7 6

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.729 
what 9 4 6 + 3 6 what's that 7 6
okay<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:27.000> then<00:03:27.690> anytime<00:03:28.019> your<00:03:30.470> numerator<00:03:31.470> is

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
okay and then anytime your numerator is

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.170 
okay and then anytime your numerator is
bigger<00:03:31.769> than<00:03:32.100> your<00:03:32.340> denominator<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:33.150> have

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
bigger than your denominator you have

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.479 
bigger than your denominator you have
what<00:03:33.569> improper<00:03:34.230> fraction<00:03:34.739> so<00:03:34.769> what<00:03:35.100> I<00:03:35.130> need<00:03:35.280> to

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
what improper fraction so what I need to

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.910 
what improper fraction so what I need to
do<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:35.940> just<00:03:36.600> ask<00:03:36.780> myself<00:03:37.019> how<00:03:37.380> many<00:03:37.440> times<00:03:37.530> the

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
do I just ask myself how many times the

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.330 
do I just ask myself how many times the
six<00:03:38.220> going<00:03:38.519> to<00:03:38.639> 7<00:03:39.000> well<00:03:39.150> 6<00:03:39.420> goes<00:03:39.690> into<00:03:40.200> 7<00:03:40.650> one

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
six going to 7 well 6 goes into 7 one

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.750 
six going to 7 well 6 goes into 7 one
time<00:03:42.079> ok<00:03:43.079> and<00:03:44.209> then<00:03:45.209> I<00:03:45.239> subtract<00:03:46.069> 7<00:03:47.069> minus<00:03:47.400> 6

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
time ok and then I subtract 7 minus 6

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.140 
time ok and then I subtract 7 minus 6
and<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.389> gives<00:03:48.450> me<00:03:48.889> 1<00:03:49.889> 6<00:03:50.220> so<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.459> one<00:03:50.790> right

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
and that gives me 1 6 so this one right

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.509 
and that gives me 1 6 so this one right
here<00:03:51.359> represents<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:52.560> number<00:03:52.680> of<00:03:52.829> times<00:03:52.920> at<00:03:53.250> 6

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
here represents the number of times at 6

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.640 
here represents the number of times at 6
1<00:03:53.700> into<00:03:53.940> 7<00:03:54.180> which<00:03:54.480> is<00:03:54.660> 1<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.200> then<00:03:55.230> I

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
1 into 7 which is 1 and then I

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.069 
1 into 7 which is 1 and then I
subtracted<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.430> 6<00:03:56.670> from<00:03:56.790> 7<00:03:57.239> that<00:03:57.389> gave<00:03:57.569> me<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.840> 1

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
subtracted a 6 from 7 that gave me the 1

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.270 
subtracted a 6 from 7 that gave me the 1
6<00:03:58.350> and<00:03:59.310> now<00:03:59.430> I<00:03:59.459> add<00:03:59.700> 9<00:04:00.090> plus<00:04:00.630> 1<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:01.859> I<00:04:01.920> get<00:04:01.980> into

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
6 and now I add 9 plus 1 and I get into

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:10.600 
6 and now I add 9 plus 1 and I get into
10<00:04:02.609> and<00:04:03.920> 1<00:04:04.920> 6<00:04:05.450> okay

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.240 

all<00:04:11.610> right<00:04:11.819> so<00:04:12.090> five<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:13.290> two<00:04:13.530> thirds<00:04:13.830> plus

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
all right so five and two thirds plus

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.330 
all right so five and two thirds plus
four<00:04:14.580> and<00:04:14.610> a<00:04:14.760> half<00:04:14.790> is<00:04:15.180> ten<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:16.350> one<00:04:16.650> six

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
four and a half is ten and one six

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:25.520 
four and a half is ten and one six
all<00:04:18.269> right<00:04:18.390> let's<00:04:18.750> try<00:04:19.079> another<00:04:19.560> one<00:04:23.240> okay<00:04:24.530> how

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
all right let's try another one okay how

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.680 
all right let's try another one okay how
about<00:04:25.880> eight<00:04:26.880> and<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:27.210> half<00:04:27.890> minus<00:04:29.330> one<00:04:30.330> in

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
about eight and a half minus one in

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:38.120 
about eight and a half minus one in
one-third<00:04:32.660> so<00:04:33.660> eight<00:04:33.900> and<00:04:34.590> a<00:04:34.740> half<00:04:35.660> minus<00:04:37.130> one

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
one-third so eight and a half minus one

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.220 
one-third so eight and a half minus one
in<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.580> third<00:04:40.340> okay<00:04:41.450> see<00:04:42.450> how<00:04:42.570> we're<00:04:42.720> focusing

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
in a third okay see how we're focusing

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.500 
in a third okay see how we're focusing
there<00:04:43.470> all<00:04:44.190> right<00:04:44.310> so<00:04:44.370> once<00:04:44.700> again<00:04:44.850> I<00:04:45.240> want<00:04:45.419> to

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
there all right so once again I want to

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.310 
there all right so once again I want to
convert<00:04:46.310> these<00:04:47.310> two<00:04:47.850> fractions<00:04:48.270> so<00:04:48.960> they<00:04:49.169> have

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
convert these two fractions so they have

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.159 
convert these two fractions so they have
the<00:04:49.470> same<00:04:49.710> denominator<00:04:50.810> so<00:04:51.810> what<00:04:51.990> is<00:04:52.080> the

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
the same denominator so what is the

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.830 
the same denominator so what is the
common<00:04:52.410> denominator<00:04:52.590> between<00:04:53.250> 1/2<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.330> 1/3

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
common denominator between 1/2 and 1/3

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.320 
common denominator between 1/2 and 1/3
well<00:04:55.080> that's<00:04:55.230> 6<00:04:55.530> again<00:04:55.919> so<00:04:56.669> let<00:04:56.760> me<00:04:56.850> copy<00:04:57.030> down

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
well that's 6 again so let me copy down

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.190 
well that's 6 again so let me copy down
the<00:04:57.540> 8<00:04:57.720> and<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:57.990> 1<00:04:58.290> okay<00:04:59.190> and<00:04:59.820> I<00:05:00.090> want<00:05:00.360> 6<00:05:00.720> in<00:05:01.020> the

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
the 8 and the 1 okay and I want 6 in the

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.670 
the 8 and the 1 okay and I want 6 in the
bottom<00:05:01.380> here<00:05:01.830> so<00:05:02.040> I<00:05:02.640> just<00:05:02.790> got<00:05:02.970> myself<00:05:03.330> okay<00:05:04.020> 3

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
bottom here so I just got myself okay 3

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.350 
bottom here so I just got myself okay 3
times<00:05:04.980> what<00:05:05.310> gives<00:05:05.340> us<00:05:05.760> 6

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
times what gives us 6

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.500 
times what gives us 6
that's<00:05:07.080> 2<00:05:07.500> okay<00:05:08.280> so<00:05:08.430> I<00:05:08.580> got<00:05:08.730> to<00:05:08.820> multiply<00:05:09.240> 1

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
that's 2 okay so I got to multiply 1

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.270 
that's 2 okay so I got to multiply 1
times<00:05:09.540> 2<00:05:10.200> so<00:05:11.070> 1<00:05:11.250> times<00:05:11.520> 2<00:05:11.880> is<00:05:11.910> 2<00:05:12.260> and<00:05:13.260> then<00:05:14.040> 2

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
times 2 so 1 times 2 is 2 and then 2

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.140 
times 2 so 1 times 2 is 2 and then 2
times<00:05:14.310> what<00:05:14.940> gives<00:05:14.970> you<00:05:15.360> 6<00:05:15.919> plus<00:05:16.919> 3<00:05:17.000> okay<00:05:18.000> I

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
times what gives you 6 plus 3 okay I

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.750 
times what gives you 6 plus 3 okay I
suddenly<00:05:18.419> multiply<00:05:19.080> the<00:05:19.140> top<00:05:19.560> by<00:05:19.590> 3<00:05:19.860> so<00:05:20.430> what

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
suddenly multiply the top by 3 so what

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.200 
suddenly multiply the top by 3 so what
is<00:05:20.970> 1<00:05:21.630> times<00:05:21.960> 3<00:05:23.419> okay<00:05:24.419> so<00:05:24.450> that's<00:05:24.750> 3<00:05:26.000> so<00:05:27.000> now<00:05:27.150> we

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
is 1 times 3 okay so that's 3 so now we

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.640 
is 1 times 3 okay so that's 3 so now we
got<00:05:27.450> 8<00:05:27.690> &amp;<00:05:28.050> 3<00:05:28.080> 6<00:05:28.800> minus<00:05:29.580> 1<00:05:29.850> and<00:05:30.030> 2<00:05:30.210> sticks<00:05:30.600> well<00:05:31.320> 8

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
got 8 &amp; 3 6 minus 1 and 2 sticks well 8

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.940 
got 8 &amp; 3 6 minus 1 and 2 sticks well 8
minus<00:05:32.040> 1<00:05:32.280> is<00:05:32.460> what<00:05:33.350> 7<00:05:34.350> and<00:05:34.880> then<00:05:35.880> 3<00:05:36.360> 6<00:05:36.690> -<00:05:37.140> 2<00:05:37.410> 6<00:05:37.680> is

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
minus 1 is what 7 and then 3 6 - 2 6 is

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.620 
minus 1 is what 7 and then 3 6 - 2 6 is
1<00:05:38.220> 1<00:05:39.060> 6<00:05:40.130> all<00:05:41.130> right

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
1 1 6 all right

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.710 
1 1 6 all right
any<00:05:42.630> problems<00:05:43.020> there<00:05:43.400> let's<00:05:44.400> try<00:05:44.760> another<00:05:45.120> one

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
any problems there let's try another one

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:58.879 
any problems there let's try another one
how<00:05:46.620> about<00:05:46.860> 9<00:05:47.280> and<00:05:47.310> 1/2<00:05:47.900> -<00:05:48.900> 1<00:05:49.229> and<00:05:49.979> 3/4

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889
