00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
out in the rain so there you go

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.199 
out in the rain so there you go
certainly<00:04:16.680> depicts<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.280> right<00:04:17.519> here<00:04:17.789> the

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
certainly depicts that right here the

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.770 
certainly depicts that right here the
the<00:04:18.959> rear<00:04:19.200> exhaust<00:04:19.350> tips<00:04:20.010> are<00:04:20.250> off<00:04:20.370> a<00:04:20.579> GT<00:04:21.389> it's

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
the rear exhaust tips are off a GT it's

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.490 
the rear exhaust tips are off a GT it's
actually<00:04:22.109> got<00:04:22.229> a<00:04:22.260> rear<00:04:22.590> GT<00:04:23.190> balance<00:04:23.669> on<00:04:23.880> it<00:04:23.910> and

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
actually got a rear GT balance on it and

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.800 
actually got a rear GT balance on it and
the<00:04:25.500> exhaust<00:04:25.860> on<00:04:26.070> this<00:04:26.100> car<00:04:26.520> is<00:04:26.789> is<00:04:27.060> is<00:04:27.450> not

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
the exhaust on this car is is is not

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.409 
the exhaust on this car is is is not
factory<00:04:28.500> on<00:04:28.770> this<00:04:29.100> particular<00:04:29.460> model<00:04:29.850> it's

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
factory on this particular model it's

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.779 
factory on this particular model it's
they're<00:04:30.720> actually<00:04:31.110> offer<00:04:31.260> a<00:04:31.440> GT<00:04:32.070> check<00:04:32.580> those

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
they're actually offer a GT check those

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.969 
they're actually offer a GT check those
little<00:04:33.060> horizontal<00:04:33.389> flutes<00:04:34.139> they're<00:04:34.470> at

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
little horizontal flutes they're at

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.279 
little horizontal flutes they're at
different<00:04:35.010> angles<00:04:35.550> deflecting<00:04:36.270> they're<00:04:36.479> all

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
different angles deflecting they're all

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:38.980 
different angles deflecting they're all
the<00:04:37.560> noise<00:04:37.740> down<00:04:37.770> was<00:04:38.280> actually<00:04:38.610> they

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
the noise down was actually they

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.760 
the noise down was actually they
deflecting<00:04:39.990> at<00:04:40.080> different<00:04:40.410> angles<00:04:40.470> aren't

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
deflecting at different angles aren't

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.469 
deflecting at different angles aren't
they<00:04:40.889> so<00:04:40.950> it's<00:04:41.400> a<00:04:41.490> rule<00:04:41.700> are<00:04:41.940> different<00:04:42.300> touch

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
they so it's a rule are different touch

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.360 
they so it's a rule are different touch
yeah<00:04:43.110> that's<00:04:43.289> right<00:04:43.410> pledges<00:04:43.800> to<00:04:43.950> stop<00:04:44.159> all

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
yeah that's right pledges to stop all

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.580 
yeah that's right pledges to stop all
the<00:04:45.050> condensation<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.140> what<00:04:46.349> have<00:04:46.560> you

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
the condensation and what have you

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.310 
the condensation and what have you
coming<00:04:47.070> up<00:04:47.190> and

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
coming up and

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.500 
coming up and
tarnishing<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:49.350> the<00:04:50.070> bumper<00:04:50.400> bar<00:04:50.550> so<00:04:51.180> it's

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
tarnishing the the bumper bar so it's

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.420 
tarnishing the the bumper bar so it's
deflecting<00:04:52.170> it<00:04:52.260> away<00:04:52.500> and<00:04:52.860> also<00:04:53.040> with<00:04:53.400> you

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
deflecting it away and also with you

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.820 
deflecting it away and also with you
know<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.600> engines<00:04:54.930> a<00:04:54.990> little<00:04:55.200> bit<00:04:55.320> smoky<00:04:55.590> or

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
know the engines a little bit smoky or

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.040 
know the engines a little bit smoky or
whatever<00:04:56.130> going<00:04:56.730> down<00:04:56.970> hills<00:04:57.300> it<00:04:57.600> stops<00:04:57.900> it

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
whatever going down hills it stops it

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.560 
whatever going down hills it stops it
from<00:04:58.110> rolling<00:04:58.280> back<00:04:59.280> up<00:04:59.490> towards<00:04:59.970> the<00:05:00.030> car<00:05:00.300> and

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
up into the boot seal area what a clever

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.660 
up into the boot seal area what a clever
idea<00:05:03.900> ray<00:05:04.410> to<00:05:04.470> keep<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:04.860> fat<00:05:05.160> off<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.460> back

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
idea ray to keep the fat off the back

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.580 
idea ray to keep the fat off the back
mat<00:05:06.000> that<00:05:06.270> takes<00:05:06.540> us<00:05:06.690> to<00:05:06.810> another<00:05:06.840> subject

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
mat that takes us to another subject

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.550 
mat that takes us to another subject
with<00:05:07.920> you<00:05:08.070> add<00:05:08.250> your<00:05:09.090> engines<00:05:09.600> no<00:05:10.050> such<00:05:10.320> thing

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
with you add your engines no such thing

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.220 
with you add your engines no such thing
as<00:05:10.590> fat<00:05:10.950> out<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.250> back<00:05:11.430> now<00:05:12.330> your<00:05:12.570> engines<00:05:13.050> run

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
as fat out the back now your engines run

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.590 
as fat out the back now your engines run
extremely<00:05:13.590> clean<00:05:14.250> I<00:05:14.520> mean<00:05:14.910> we<00:05:15.060> pull<00:05:15.300> the<00:05:15.420> dip

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
extremely clean I mean we pull the dip

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.770 
extremely clean I mean we pull the dip
sticks<00:05:15.900> out<00:05:16.110> and<00:05:17.090> let's<00:05:18.090> look<00:05:18.240> at<00:05:18.390> the<00:05:18.480> oil<00:05:18.600> on

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
sticks out and let's look at the oil on

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.920 
sticks out and let's look at the oil on
the<00:05:18.960> tip<00:05:19.320> of<00:05:19.410> the<00:05:19.530> dipstick<00:05:19.860> now<00:05:20.430> look<00:05:20.610> at<00:05:20.730> that

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
the tip of the dipstick now look at that

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.710 
the tip of the dipstick now look at that
look<00:05:21.930> how<00:05:22.020> clean<00:05:22.470> that<00:05:22.500> will<00:05:22.860> is<00:05:23.180> now<00:05:24.180> that's

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
look how clean that will is now that's

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.710 
look how clean that will is now that's
that's<00:05:25.560> just<00:05:25.830> evident<00:05:26.490> on<00:05:26.670> how<00:05:27.150> nicely<00:05:27.450> you

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
that's just evident on how nicely you

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.660 
that's just evident on how nicely you
build<00:05:28.050> an<00:05:28.140> engine<00:05:28.290> it<00:05:28.590> that's<00:05:29.310> right<00:05:29.460> well<00:05:29.640> I

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 
build an engine it that's right well I

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.070 
build an engine it that's right well I
mean<00:05:29.910> the<00:05:31.160> all<00:05:32.160> the<00:05:32.310> credit<00:05:32.640> goes<00:05:32.790> to<00:05:32.850> as<00:05:33.840> I

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
mean the all the credit goes to as I

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.660 
mean the all the credit goes to as I
said<00:05:34.140> before<00:05:34.290> the<00:05:34.920> people<00:05:35.100> that<00:05:35.310> do<00:05:35.430> all<00:05:35.550> the

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
said before the people that do all the

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.090 
said before the people that do all the
machine<00:05:36.000> work<00:05:36.240> on<00:05:37.020> my<00:05:37.290> engines<00:05:37.710> I've<00:05:37.920> used

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
machine work on my engines I've used

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.920 
machine work on my engines I've used
them<00:05:38.280> for<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:38.520> last<00:05:38.700> 28<00:05:39.600> years<00:05:39.720> or<00:05:40.140> so<00:05:40.350> and

them for the last 28 years or so and
that's<00:05:42.930> what<00:05:43.050> it's<00:05:43.290> all<00:05:43.410> about<00:05:43.440> it's<00:05:43.950> just<00:05:44.040> all
