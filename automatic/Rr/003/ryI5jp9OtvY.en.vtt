her cartilage or nasal tip was
malposition<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:19.100> we<00:02:19.160> had<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.310> release<00:02:19.580> that

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.190 
and bring it to its new position which
would<00:02:25.370> make<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:25.670> tip<00:02:25.910> softer<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.690> also
