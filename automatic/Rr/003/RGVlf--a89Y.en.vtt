00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.460
 so you've been through a funny adventurous sort of celebrate 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.380
 love with lightness we have once and it's called a scene a 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:11.589
 again with the baguette 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.509
 it's bernard crÃ©pel the father of the famous this moment in the capelle who 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.039
 is the initiative of this project the concept is super original but I you 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.079
 say no more 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.440
 his descendants are still later from the mountain 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.980
 and who goes up to las vegas actually after 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.349
 we simply want 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.239
 using your home xi of the sentence and really did not start with 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.050
 distribute 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.270
 the men of the storyboard ended up we are 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.850
 like that we already say 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.850
 it is first of all a trip to put oneself at the service of the environment 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.359
 the preservation of water is a subject 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.040
 in my opinion 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.360
 and to my knowledge that sports ambassadors of russia 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.260
 innovation 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.150
 at the 56th 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.270
 exactly 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.310
 bertrand baguette which is a treat 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.310
 rapid advances 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.110
 and if the base was his seventh week as a tribute to 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.950
 victims 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.370
 such acts 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.540
 after erwan is going to have dugout 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.240
 and then we're going to end up justin do not want her for that too tested 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.510
 during the week 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.510
 nevertheless the latter 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.080
 in the opposite the banking sector proved weaker 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.670
 this is called anthony sechaud coach in the market way 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.689
 especially ecological 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.920
 but also sports have tested for you m 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.630
 level 6 he is no longer a manager in 2009 opel 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.630
 to the achievement mathias enard this info 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.000
 by a blood test 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.930
 like year it's good 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.050
 but there is a match 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.990
 that's it's still 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.090
 even if it was a little bit but it's up to us too 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.180
 very little it works very well posted last week 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.359
 that's going to be used to protect yourself from the rocks 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:59.360
 Frederic Antonetti 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.249
 it's a kind of shield exactly 

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:03.030
 the idea is to go fast 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.240
 it's trying to go to the river 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.520
 the fastest this layout is fourth place a little within reach of 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.459
 everyone agrees 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.429
 the sensations come back 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:17.429
 in short with the rebels 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:26.089
 the child could not do anything about copyrights 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.859
 in this discipline 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.859
 before departure to end with spectacular 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.099
 the departure from paris gare du nord 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.099
 slightly above the north of France was zero 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.949
 another defeat is also 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.509
 resumed by granting the party 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:04.509
 if the response has retired 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.409
 soccer 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:30.369
 it became somewhat more than the others 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.529
 but is it our attache port 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:56.800
 we do not change 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.830
 this case is reminiscent of another that has been regular 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.049
 replaced by abriel 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.309
 yes the end of the season 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:08.789
 I just sang the hall 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:11.789
 already an actor's talent 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.529
 I just sang there 

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:16.799
 I know how to do it too 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.969
 this concrete way in all it went very well 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:23.449
 some may have a little miracle in any case me without concession 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.449
 on the official website 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.190
 once relations between the club 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.820
 wayne simmonds and michele and that you will have understood it is the stage of panels 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.099
 it will be May 15 so rendezvous 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:59.740
 May 15 and if you find them besides all these little magneto 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.430
 that the little sports that I tested for you can find on the site 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.699
 of a channel + point fr obviously 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:06.029
