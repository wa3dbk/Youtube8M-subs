00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
synthetic bags and as you can see this

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.089 
synthetic bags and as you can see this
is<00:00:24.990> how<00:00:25.109> I've<00:00:25.230> been<00:00:25.350> stored<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.769> them<00:00:25.890> recently

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
is how I've been stored in them recently

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.349 
is how I've been stored in them recently
which<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.609> hanging<00:00:26.910> them<00:00:27.000> up<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.330> they

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
which is hanging them up so they

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.589 
which is hanging them up so they
basically<00:00:27.630> folded<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.410> half<00:00:28.820> onto<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.390> coat

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
basically folded in half onto the coat

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.380 
basically folded in half onto the coat
hanger<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.170> then<00:00:31.380> hung<00:00:31.590> up<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.360> past

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
hanger and then hung up and in the past

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.389 
hanger and then hung up and in the past
of<00:00:33.840> stored<00:00:34.110> sleeping<00:00:34.620> buyers<00:00:34.800> compressed

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
of stored sleeping buyers compressed

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.160 
of stored sleeping buyers compressed
it's<00:00:35.760> not<00:00:35.910> really<00:00:36.270> be<00:00:36.360> not<00:00:36.570> much<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.960> an<00:00:37.050> issue

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
it's not really be not much of an issue

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.100 
it's not really be not much of an issue
with<00:00:38.180> synthetic<00:00:39.180> bags<00:00:39.390> but<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.899> know<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.020> think

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
with synthetic bags but you know I think

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.130 
with synthetic bags but you know I think
that<00:00:40.879> having<00:00:41.879> financially<00:00:42.450> washed<00:00:42.690> them<00:00:42.989> I

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
that having financially washed them I

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.590 
that having financially washed them I
want<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.469> keep<00:00:43.710> them<00:00:43.860> then<00:00:44.610> lofted<00:00:44.820> until<00:00:45.420> use

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
want to keep them then lofted until use

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.020 
want to keep them then lofted until use
now<00:00:46.500> probably<00:00:46.980> doing<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:47.430> way<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.820> don't

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
now probably doing it this way I don't

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.670 
now probably doing it this way I don't
have<00:00:48.120> much<00:00:48.300> space<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.780> my<00:00:48.899> wardrobe<00:00:49.230> britches

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
have much space in my wardrobe britches

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.750 
have much space in my wardrobe britches
what<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.219> hanging<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.730> not<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:52.610> sadly<00:00:53.610> I

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
what that hanging on not and so sadly I

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.100 
what that hanging on not and so sadly I
need<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.000> come<00:00:54.149> up<00:00:54.180> with<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.329> solution<00:00:54.690> for<00:00:55.050> that

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
need to come up with a solution for that

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.369 
need to come up with a solution for that
very<00:00:55.440> soon<00:00:55.680> but<00:00:55.890> one<00:00:56.070> idea<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
very soon but one idea so but in the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.319 
very soon but one idea so but in the
meantime<00:00:58.590> what<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.070> want<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.370> do<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.579> take<00:01:00.120> these

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
meantime what I want to do is take these

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.299 
meantime what I want to do is take these
bags<00:01:00.949> from<00:01:01.949> gather<00:01:02.399> dust<00:01:02.820> okay<00:01:03.739> so<00:01:04.739> I've<00:01:05.129> got

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
bags from gather dust okay so I've got

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.710 
bags from gather dust okay so I've got
an<00:01:05.369> idea<00:01:05.430> for<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.150> let's<00:01:06.240> see<00:01:06.510> if<00:01:06.600> it

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
an idea for that and let's see if it

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.609 
an idea for that and let's see if it
works<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.760> let's<00:01:08.760> take<00:01:08.970> these<00:01:09.090> down<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.619> let's

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
works so let's take these down and let's

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.100 
works so let's take these down and let's
see<00:01:10.920> if<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.369> can<00:01:11.670> give<00:01:12.150> them<00:01:12.330> some<00:01:12.570> protection

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
see if we can give them some protection

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.850 
see if we can give them some protection
from<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.380> dust<00:01:15.020> okay<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> win

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
from the dust okay so this is the win

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.429 
from the dust okay so this is the win
stuff<00:01:17.130> sleeping<00:01:17.520> bag<00:01:17.700> as<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.630> can<00:01:18.960> see<00:01:19.170> here

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
stuff sleeping bag as you can see here

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.820 
stuff sleeping bag as you can see here
now<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:21.420> way<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.600> keep<00:01:21.930> them<00:01:22.200> stored<00:01:22.530> is

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
now the way I keep them stored is

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.219 
now the way I keep them stored is
folding<00:01:23.430> them<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.610> half<00:01:23.820> using<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.689> draw<00:01:24.930> cord

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
folding them in half using the draw cord

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.580 
folding them in half using the draw cord
at<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.380> top<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.869> tabs<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.080> are<00:01:28.229> usually

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
at the top and the tabs that are usually

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.359 
at the top and the tabs that are usually
on<00:01:28.740> most<00:01:28.770> foot<00:01:29.369> box<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.150> secure<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
on most foot box is to secure it to the

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.999 
on most foot box is to secure it to the
Kohanga<00:01:32.570> which<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:34.079> find<00:01:34.409> works<00:01:34.650> effectively

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
Kohanga which I find works effectively

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.980 
Kohanga which I find works effectively
so<00:01:35.640> we're<00:01:36.360> going<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.540> keep<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.750> an<00:01:36.869> S

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
so we're going to keep it an S

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.380 
so we're going to keep it an S
configuration<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.180> we're<00:01:39.180> going<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.329> put<00:01:39.600> a

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
configuration and we're going to put a

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.749 
configuration and we're going to put a
dust<00:01:42.390> bin<00:01:42.570> liner<00:01:42.869> over<00:01:43.189> the<00:01:44.189> top<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.549> I'm<00:01:44.640> going

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
dust bin liner over the top so I'm going

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.010 
dust bin liner over the top so I'm going
to<00:01:44.790> cut<00:01:44.970> hole<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.299> top<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.630> dustbin

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
to cut hole in the top of the dustbin

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.660 
to cut hole in the top of the dustbin
lane<00:01:46.170> outfit<00:01:46.560> over<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.890> top<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.310> hopefully

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
lane outfit over the top and hopefully

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.789 
lane outfit over the top and hopefully
that<00:01:47.880> we<00:01:48.030> will<00:01:48.810> protect<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> sleeping<00:01:49.649> bag

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
that we will protect the sleeping bag

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.719 
that we will protect the sleeping bag
from<00:01:50.040> dust<00:01:52.070> okay<00:01:53.070> let's<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.490> quick<00:01:53.700> look

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
from dust okay let's have a quick look

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.050 
from dust okay let's have a quick look
at<00:01:54.060> how<00:01:54.180> i<00:01:54.450> hook<00:01:54.990> up<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.520> basically

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
at how i hook up to this so basically

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.300 
at how i hook up to this so basically
this<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.020> foot<00:01:58.229> box<00:01:58.439> here<00:01:58.740> after<00:01:58.920> usually

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
this is the foot box here after usually

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.929 
this is the foot box here after usually
have<00:01:59.460> two<00:01:59.670> tabs<00:01:59.969> on<00:02:00.210> them<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:01.549> this<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
have two tabs on them and this is the

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.359 
have two tabs on them and this is the
hood<00:02:03.119> section<00:02:03.689> ya<00:02:03.930> know<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:05.130> idea<00:02:06.380> as<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:08.250> can

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
hood section ya know the idea as you can

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.040 
hood section ya know the idea as you can
see<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.729> hood<00:02:08.879> sent<00:02:09.270> straight<00:02:09.509> up<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:09.989> let's

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
see the hood sent straight up so let's

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.550 
see the hood sent straight up so let's
let<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.590> lives

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
let that lives

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.370 
let that lives
so<00:02:13.560> essentially<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:15.450> just<00:02:15.720> goes<00:02:15.960> round<00:02:16.170> to

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
so essentially that just goes round to

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.560 
so essentially that just goes round to
go<00:02:16.590> hang<00:02:16.830> out<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.040> hood<00:02:17.220> there<00:02:17.460> so<00:02:18.180> at<00:02:18.450> least

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
go hang out the hood there so at least

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.920 
go hang out the hood there so at least
you<00:02:18.810> can<00:02:18.930> see<00:02:19.250> where<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.310> two<00:02:20.460> tabs<00:02:20.820> on<00:02:21.150> the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
you can see where the two tabs on the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
you can see where the two tabs on the
coat<00:02:22.320> hanger<00:02:22.470> like<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:24.800> there's<00:02:25.800> a

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
coat hanger like that and there's a

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.430 
coat hanger like that and there's a
sleeping<00:02:26.280> bag<00:02:26.400> down<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.780> think<00:02:28.110> that's

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
sleeping bag down so I think that's

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.930 
sleeping bag down so I think that's
quite<00:02:28.560> good<00:02:28.650> because<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.250> half<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:29.610> obviously

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
quite good because it half so obviously

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.300 
quite good because it half so obviously
a<00:02:30.030> half<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.420> size<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.960> sleeping<00:02:31.740> by<00:02:31.860> extend<00:02:32.190> to

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
a half the size of sleeping by extend to

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.440 
a half the size of sleeping by extend to
be<00:02:32.400> quite<00:02:32.610> long<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.060> don't<00:02:33.240> want<00:02:33.390> them

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
be quite long and you don't want them

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.360 
be quite long and you don't want them
touching<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.990> floor<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:34.470> she<00:02:35.010> didn't<00:02:35.250> like

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
touching the floor so she didn't like

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.010 
touching the floor so she didn't like
that's<00:02:35.610> half<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:35.910> size<00:02:36.330> hook<00:02:36.660> them<00:02:36.840> up<00:02:36.960> to

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
that's half the size hook them up to

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.260 
that's half the size hook them up to
these<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:38.100> know<00:02:38.190> use<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.370> Thompson<00:02:38.940> whatever

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
these you know use the Thompson whatever

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.880 
these you know use the Thompson whatever
configuration<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:40.080> want<00:02:40.290> see<00:02:40.590> I've<00:02:40.680> looked

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
configuration you want see I've looked

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.060 
configuration you want see I've looked
over<00:02:41.010> them<00:02:41.430> back<00:02:42.150> on<00:02:42.360> itself<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:42.990> then<00:02:43.590> hood

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
over them back on itself and then hood

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.810 
over them back on itself and then hood
simply<00:02:45.350> sets<00:02:46.350> around<00:02:46.500> there<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.580> draw

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
simply sets around there to the draw

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:58.600 
simply sets around there to the draw
cord<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:51.300> just<00:02:52.260> tighten<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.830> right<00:02:53.280> up<00:02:55.580> and

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.570

defeat the call hang up through and not
just<00:03:29.040> no<00:03:29.220> rests<00:03:29.700> nicely<00:03:30.270> over<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:31.230> can<00:03:31.350> see

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
just no rests nicely over it you can see

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.870 
just no rests nicely over it you can see
a<00:03:31.560> lot<00:03:31.739> about<00:03:31.800> poking<00:03:32.250> out<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.370> bottom<00:03:32.730> there

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
a lot about poking out the bottom there

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.630 
a lot about poking out the bottom there
but<00:03:33.060> that's<00:03:33.150> not<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.480> problem<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:34.050> be<00:03:34.320> honest

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
but that's not a problem to be honest

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.360 
but that's not a problem to be honest
yeah<00:03:35.640> okay<00:03:35.880> so<00:03:36.540> yeah<00:03:37.500> next<00:03:38.010> time<00:03:38.130> I'll<00:03:38.250> get

yeah okay so yeah next time I'll get

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.550 
yeah okay so yeah next time I'll get
longer<00:03:38.550> ones<00:03:38.880> but<00:03:39.150> actually<00:03:39.989> plate<00:03:40.260> in<00:03:40.380> place

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
longer ones but actually plate in place

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.850 
longer ones but actually plate in place
so<00:03:40.800> let's<00:03:40.980> get<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.250> other<00:03:41.340> one<00:03:41.520> done<00:03:42.590> right<00:03:43.590> so

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
so let's get the other one done right so

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.530 
so let's get the other one done right so
this<00:03:43.950> is<00:03:44.100> another<00:03:44.280> sleeping<00:03:44.700> bike<00:03:44.910> this<00:03:45.330> is<00:03:45.510> a

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
this is another sleeping bike this is a

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.800 
this is another sleeping bike this is a
blacks<00:03:45.900> can't<00:03:46.890> recall<00:03:47.400> what<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:48.450> model<00:03:48.600> is

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
blacks can't recall what the model is

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.360 
blacks can't recall what the model is
but<00:03:49.020> i<00:03:49.050> should<00:03:49.290> i<00:03:49.350> do<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.620> man<00:03:49.739> 10<00:03:49.950> because<00:03:50.130> of

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
but i should i do the man 10 because of

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.240 
but i should i do the man 10 because of
see<00:03:50.550> it<00:03:50.640> FX<00:03:51.270> and<00:03:51.600> i<00:03:52.560> think<00:03:52.800> according<00:03:53.040> that

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
see it FX and i think according that

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.000 
see it FX and i think according that
some<00:03:53.520> poor<00:03:53.820> guard<00:03:54.150> 3d<00:03:54.600> insulation<00:03:55.230> nuts<00:03:55.410> not

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
some poor guard 3d insulation nuts not

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.490 
some poor guard 3d insulation nuts not
strictly<00:03:56.760> true<00:03:56.880> it's<00:03:57.810> actually<00:03:57.959> porygon

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
strictly true it's actually porygon

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.490 
strictly true it's actually porygon
delta<00:03:59.310> more<00:04:00.270> that<00:04:00.450> really<00:04:00.720> matters<00:04:01.020> anything

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
delta more that really matters anything

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.460 
delta more that really matters anything
but<00:04:02.030> it's<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.180> lot<00:04:03.420> later<00:04:03.720> than<00:04:04.020> double

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
but it's a lot later than double

make sure you get that all the way down
to<00:06:00.670> the<00:06:00.730> bottom<00:06:00.990> I'll<00:06:01.990> take<00:06:02.200> the<00:06:02.320> wrap<00:06:02.500> off<00:06:02.650> of
