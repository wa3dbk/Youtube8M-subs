questions that are coming in for the Q&amp;A
but<00:03:56.500> somebody<00:03:57.160> asks<00:03:57.459> a<00:03:57.489> question<00:03:57.519> about<00:03:57.970> speed

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
but somebody asks a question about speed

but somebody asks a question about speed
work<00:03:58.630> and<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:59.620> basically<00:03:59.859> kind<00:04:00.340> of<00:04:00.459> said<00:04:00.670> if

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
work and I basically kind of said if

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.550 
work and I basically kind of said if
you're<00:04:00.880> new<00:04:01.090> there's<00:04:01.840> really<00:04:01.959> no<00:04:02.200> point<00:04:02.380> you

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
you're new there's really no point you

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.020 
you're new there's really no point you
moving<00:04:02.829> around<00:04:02.890> fast<00:04:03.280> because<00:04:03.670> you<00:04:03.700> haven't

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
moving around fast because you haven't

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.520 
moving around fast because you haven't
even<00:04:04.120> learned<00:04:04.299> how<00:04:04.480> to<00:04:04.570> move<00:04:04.750> around<00:04:04.870> slow<00:04:05.260> yet

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
even learned how to move around slow yet

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.110 
even learned how to move around slow yet
you<00:04:06.190> haven't<00:04:06.370> even<00:04:06.549> learned<00:04:06.700> how<00:04:06.850> to<00:04:06.940> move

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
you haven't even learned how to move

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.090 
you haven't even learned how to move
around<00:04:07.239> properly<00:04:07.780> at<00:04:07.870> all<00:04:07.989> so<00:04:08.829> there's<00:04:09.040> really

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
around properly at all so there's really

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.340 
around properly at all so there's really
no<00:04:09.340> point<00:04:09.579> in<00:04:09.790> working<00:04:10.299> on<00:04:10.510> being<00:04:10.720> explosive

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
no point in working on being explosive

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.530 
no point in working on being explosive
just<00:04:11.560> yet<00:04:11.799> work<00:04:12.400> on<00:04:12.549> your<00:04:12.609> form<00:04:13.000> learn<00:04:13.299> how<00:04:13.420> to

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
just yet work on your form learn how to

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.910 
just yet work on your form learn how to
do<00:04:13.630> to<00:04:13.750> lift<00:04:13.930> properly<00:04:14.440> build<00:04:14.680> up<00:04:14.799> some

do to lift properly build up some

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.490 
do to lift properly build up some
strength<00:04:15.280> I'd<00:04:16.030> say<00:04:16.269> a<00:04:16.299> good<00:04:16.390> a<00:04:16.690> good<00:04:17.140> reference

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
strength I'd say a good a good reference

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.420 
strength I'd say a good a good reference
point<00:04:17.769> for<00:04:18.070> men<00:04:18.400> is<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.650> you<00:04:20.650> know<00:04:20.739> get<00:04:21.250> in<00:04:21.370> a

you<00:04:37.030> really<00:04:37.240> worried<00:04:37.539> about<00:04:37.599> speed<00:04:38.169> I<00:04:38.199> mean

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
you really worried about speed I mean

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.290 
you really worried about speed I mean
those<00:04:38.590> are<00:04:38.770> just<00:04:38.919> that's<00:04:39.460> a<00:04:39.550> very<00:04:39.789> general

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
those are just that's a very general

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.809 
those are just that's a very general
guideline<00:04:40.780> everybody's<00:04:41.740> different<00:04:41.979> I

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:42.819 
guideline everybody's different I

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.580 
guideline everybody's different I
believe<00:04:43.479> you<00:04:43.599> can<00:04:43.720> throw<00:04:43.930> some<00:04:44.139> people<00:04:44.409> in<00:04:44.500> the

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
believe you can throw some people in the

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.890 
believe you can throw some people in the
speed<00:04:44.830> work<00:04:45.039> almost<00:04:45.879> right<00:04:46.060> away<00:04:46.120> but<00:04:46.780> you

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
speed work almost right away but you

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.210 
speed work almost right away but you
should<00:04:47.080> have<00:04:47.169> some<00:04:47.409> sort<00:04:47.590> of<00:04:47.650> base<00:04:47.860> built

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
should have some sort of base built

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.640 
should have some sort of base built
before<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.759> start<00:04:49.000> to<00:04:49.090> go<00:04:49.210> fast<00:04:49.509> otherwise<00:04:50.440> it

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
before you start to go fast otherwise it

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.409 
before you start to go fast otherwise it
just<00:04:50.680> doesn't<00:04:51.069> really<00:04:51.099> make<00:04:51.400> sense<00:04:51.460> there's

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
just doesn't really make sense there's

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.360 
just doesn't really make sense there's
