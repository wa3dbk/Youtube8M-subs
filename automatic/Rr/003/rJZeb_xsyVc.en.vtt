00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.930 
gave out and had the belt in the gym and
it<00:02:20.110> wouldn't<00:02:20.410> move<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:21.010> like<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.400> car<00:02:21.610> stalled

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
it wouldn't move is like the car stalled

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.490 
it wouldn't move is like the car stalled
and<00:02:22.090> they<00:02:22.150> couldn't<00:02:22.420> start<00:02:22.660> anymore<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:23.380> when

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
and they couldn't start anymore so when

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.860 
and they couldn't start anymore so when
he<00:02:23.590> was<00:02:23.680> trying<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.950> start<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:25.330> crank<00:02:25.660> was

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
he was trying to start it the crank was

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.590 
he was trying to start it the crank was
still<00:02:26.110> moving<00:02:26.350> but<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:27.520> rest<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.000> cams

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
still moving but the rest of the cams

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.949 
still moving but the rest of the cams
were<00:02:28.840> staying<00:02:29.260> still<00:02:30.270> actually<00:02:31.270> put<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.720> belt

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
were staying still actually put the belt

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.530 
were staying still actually put the belt
on<00:02:32.110> didn't<00:02:32.470> have<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.940> timing<00:02:33.940> marks<00:02:34.209> prize

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
on didn't have the timing marks prize

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.500 
on didn't have the timing marks prize
that<00:02:34.870> said<00:02:35.319> exactly<00:02:35.470> right

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
that said exactly right

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.340 
that said exactly right
so<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:39.030> gave<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.150> a<00:02:40.209> couple<00:02:40.450> cranks<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.170> then<00:02:41.260> I

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
so I gave it a couple cranks and then I

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.890 
so I gave it a couple cranks and then I
came<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.860> end<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.880> came<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.269> a<00:02:43.300> stop<00:02:43.360> it

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
came to a end it came to a stop it

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.780 
came to a end it came to a stop it
wouldn't<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.440> could<00:02:44.769> roll<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.130> backwards<00:02:45.370> as

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
wouldn't I could roll it backwards as

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.240 
wouldn't I could roll it backwards as
many<00:02:46.030> times<00:02:46.360> as<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.569> want<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.680> then<00:02:47.830> we<00:02:47.890> keep<00:02:48.069> on

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
many times as I want and then we keep on

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.160 
many times as I want and then we keep on
gone<00:02:48.489> but<00:02:48.760> as<00:02:48.880> I<00:02:49.000> go<00:02:49.209> forward<00:02:49.420> after<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.050> many

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
gone but as I go forward after so many

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.470 
gone but as I go forward after so many
rolls<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:50.769> would<00:02:50.920> finally<00:02:51.730> come<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.239> stop

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
rolls it would finally come to a stop

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.330 
rolls it would finally come to a stop
and<00:02:52.830> wouldn't<00:02:53.830> want<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.540> turn<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:56.140> I<00:02:56.440> had<00:02:57.220> to

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
and wouldn't want to turn so I had to

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.080 
and wouldn't want to turn so I had to
pull<00:02:57.549> it<00:02:57.670> back<00:02:57.819> apart<00:02:58.180> actually<00:03:00.090> suspecting

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
pull it back apart actually suspecting

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.340 
pull it back apart actually suspecting
maybe<00:03:01.269> a<00:03:01.330> problem<00:03:01.600> with<00:03:01.930> that

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
maybe a problem with that

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
maybe a problem with that
with<00:03:02.920> this<00:03:03.100> inner<00:03:03.340> cam<00:03:04.060> area<00:03:05.190> upon<00:03:06.190> my

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
with this inner cam area upon my

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.680 
with this inner cam area upon my
inspection<00:03:06.880> I<00:03:07.180> noticed<00:03:07.569> that<00:03:07.780> uh<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:13.420> one<00:03:13.600> of

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
inspection I noticed that uh that one of

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.900 
inspection I noticed that uh that one of
the<00:03:13.780> cam<00:03:14.049> followers<00:03:14.769> or<00:03:15.160> maybe<00:03:15.489> all<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:15.970> them

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
the cam followers or maybe all of them

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.830 
the cam followers or maybe all of them
were<00:03:20.190> we're<00:03:21.190> collapsed<00:03:21.910> I<00:03:22.120> don't<00:03:22.600> know<00:03:22.690> if<00:03:22.750> you

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
were we're collapsed I don't know if you

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.610 
were we're collapsed I don't know if you
can<00:03:22.989> see<00:03:23.170> that<00:03:23.370> but<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.780> cam<00:03:25.780> Fowler<00:03:26.109> is<00:03:26.350> not

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
can see that but the cam Fowler is not

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.220 
can see that but the cam Fowler is not
even<00:03:26.829> close<00:03:27.070> to<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.489> to<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.540> lobe<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:32.019> that

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
even close to the to the lobe and that

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.900 
even close to the to the lobe and that
seemed<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:32.590> appear<00:03:32.829> that<00:03:33.040> way<00:03:33.220> maybe<00:03:33.579> all<00:03:33.820> the

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
seemed to appear that way maybe all the

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.340 
seemed to appear that way maybe all the
way<00:03:34.000> across<00:03:34.239> I<00:03:34.510> really<00:03:34.720> couldn't<00:03:34.989> get<00:03:35.109> a<00:03:35.140> good

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
way across I really couldn't get a good

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.740 
way across I really couldn't get a good
look<00:03:35.410> I<00:03:35.920> need<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.310> put<00:03:36.790> a<00:03:36.820> mirror<00:03:37.180> in<00:03:37.269> here<00:03:37.299> or

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
look I need to put a mirror in here or

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.949 
look I need to put a mirror in here or
something<00:03:38.459> but<00:03:39.459> uh<00:03:39.489> I'm<00:03:40.120> assuming<00:03:40.630> that<00:03:40.750> maybe

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
something but uh I'm assuming that maybe

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.080 
something but uh I'm assuming that maybe
I'm<00:03:41.170> just<00:03:41.410> well<00:03:42.190> we<00:03:42.459> definitely<00:03:42.640> don't<00:03:42.970> have

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
I'm just well we definitely don't have

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.880 
I'm just well we definitely don't have
compression<00:03:43.750> right<00:03:43.959> now<00:03:44.170> because<00:03:44.500> we<00:03:44.620> didn't

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
compression right now because we didn't

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.750 
compression right now because we didn't
have<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.340> belt<00:03:45.579> on<00:03:45.790> but<00:03:46.060> I<00:03:46.799> don't<00:03:47.799> know<00:03:47.950> I<00:03:48.250> was

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
have the belt on but I don't know I was

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.259 
have the belt on but I don't know I was
playing<00:03:49.239> with<00:03:49.390> that<00:03:49.720> I<00:03:50.640> had<00:03:51.640> put<00:03:51.880> my<00:03:52.060> little

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
playing with that I had put my little

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.729 
playing with that I had put my little
star<00:03:52.540> bit<00:03:52.750> in<00:03:52.870> there<00:03:53.019> moved<00:03:53.260> it<00:03:53.410> back<00:03:53.560> and

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
star bit in there moved it back and

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.470 
star bit in there moved it back and
forth<00:03:53.950> kind<00:03:54.280> of<00:03:54.370> heard<00:03:54.489> a<00:03:54.609> little<00:03:54.730> tapping

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
forth kind of heard a little tapping

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.330 
forth kind of heard a little tapping
noise<00:03:55.660> I<00:03:55.900> don't<00:03:55.989> know<00:03:56.140> if<00:03:56.230> maybe<00:03:56.410> them<00:03:56.680> them

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
noise I don't know if maybe them them

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.370 
noise I don't know if maybe them them
are<00:03:57.489> collapsed<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.239> just<00:03:58.540> maybe<00:03:58.900> they<00:03:59.140> ain't

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
are collapsed and just maybe they ain't

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.020 
are collapsed and just maybe they ain't
pumping<00:03:59.590> up<00:03:59.890> because<00:04:00.070> I<00:04:00.100> know<00:04:00.220> oil<00:04:00.519> in<00:04:00.700> it<00:04:00.819> but

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
pumping up because I know oil in it but

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.970 
pumping up because I know oil in it but
anyway<00:04:01.870> if<00:04:01.989> anybody's<00:04:02.410> gotten<00:04:02.709> information

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
anyway if anybody's gotten information

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.479 
anyway if anybody's gotten information
on<00:04:03.549> maybe<00:04:04.480> how<00:04:04.630> to<00:04:04.690> get<00:04:05.230> these<00:04:05.380> cams<00:04:05.799> lined<00:04:06.220> up

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
on maybe how to get these cams lined up

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.240 
on maybe how to get these cams lined up
and<00:04:06.900> get<00:04:07.900> this<00:04:08.049> set<00:04:08.319> up<00:04:08.350> right<00:04:08.500> so<00:04:08.920> I<00:04:08.980> can<00:04:09.040> get

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
and get this set up right so I can get

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.849 
and get this set up right so I can get
this<00:04:09.370> time<00:04:09.640> and<00:04:09.819> go<00:04:09.940> done<00:04:10.420> and<00:04:10.720> hopefully<00:04:11.230> have

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
this time and go done and hopefully have

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.979 
this time and go done and hopefully have
an<00:04:12.010> engine<00:04:12.400> that<00:04:12.430> runs<00:04:12.790> without<00:04:13.449> any<00:04:13.660> major

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
an engine that runs without any major

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.120 
an engine that runs without any major
problems<00:04:14.760> I'd<00:04:15.760> appreciate<00:04:16.239> any<00:04:16.269> help
