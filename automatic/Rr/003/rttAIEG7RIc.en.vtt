 ranging from 95 to 150 horses 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.330

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.710
 only available in box 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.289
 traditional automatic to produce 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.300
 torque weaver while the dci 110

 exclusively with the top finish of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.349
 initial range we are in the presence 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.340
 the most expensive of which short scÃ©nic 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.420
 exceeds the optional 35000 euros 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.829
 inside this top finish 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.020
 range looks after the reception with a saddlery

 Mixed leather alcantara series a seat 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.230
 electrically adjustable driver 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.969
 the vuitton presentation and the set 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.260
 clear with a warm side while 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.160
 that quality finish is at the rendezvous 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.600
 you in the back we find of course 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.610
 individual and sliding seats 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.840
 but not retractable on this version 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.610
 high-end aviation tablets 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.160
 storage hatch and blinds 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.020
 sun visors are standard trunk 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.789
 reaches 435 cubic decimetres with the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.939
 seats roll back a bad score for the 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.229
 category this the idea this is 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.299
 currently the most powerful block 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.500
 on the scenic with him this minivan is 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.540
 comfortable to raise even on 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.920
 highway and charge the box 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.659
 automatic is correctly managed but 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.280
 delay sometimes locked converter 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.290
 Ducourau was expecting more 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.970
 free do not hesitate to switch to 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.380
 manual if you are in a hurry the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.880
 behavior also picks up the one 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.650
 another scenic even though the wheels of 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.020
 18 inches presents two series degrades 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.609
 comfort especially at low speed 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.539
 the compromise becomes a bit more 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:35.250
 dynamic on this cynical road and a 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.200
 the most expensive part of the range to purchase 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.090
 but also for use among the diesels 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.060
 indeed renault announces 7 liters of 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.429
 average of 179 g per km of CO2 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.649
 2000 euros of ecological penalty 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.209
 in comparison the scenic 1 6 dci 130 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.649
 some available in automatic transmission 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.289
 but barely less efficient 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.090
 happy with 4 4 of average and 114 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.890
 co2 grams even gasoline models 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.079
 consumes less and rejects less co2 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.979
 the fault both the absence of stop and 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.569
 start and automatic transmission 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.299
 aging traditional 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.569
 strongly the scenic dci 130 associated with the 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.569
 edc box
