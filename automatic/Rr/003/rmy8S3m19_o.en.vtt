00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.900 
looks mirrored so then you receive two
jokers<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.650> these<00:03:16.770> are<00:03:16.920> just<00:03:17.010> standard<00:03:17.730> you

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
jokers and these are just standard you

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.490 
jokers and these are just standard you
know<00:03:18.030> bicycle<00:03:18.600> one<00:03:18.750> bigger<00:03:19.080> than<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.290> other

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
know bicycle one bigger than the other

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.350 
know bicycle one bigger than the other
and<00:03:19.620> this<00:03:19.709> is<00:03:19.770> the<00:03:19.890> guaranteed<00:03:20.370> one<00:03:20.610> so<00:03:21.150> quite

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
and this is the guaranteed one so quite

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.510 
and this is the guaranteed one so quite
standard<00:03:21.780> jokers<00:03:22.170> there<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.890> then<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.400> get

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
standard jokers there and then you get

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.070 
standard jokers there and then you get
the<00:03:23.700> rest<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.270> the<00:03:24.360> cards<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:24.840> then<00:03:25.020> these

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
the rest of the cards and then these

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.320 
the rest of the cards and then these
don't<00:03:25.290> custom<00:03:25.800> the<00:03:26.250> whole<00:03:26.400> way<00:03:26.550> through<00:03:26.580> and

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
don't custom the whole way through and

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.990 
don't custom the whole way through and
well<00:03:28.080> it's<00:03:28.260> not<00:03:28.290> custom<00:03:28.920> necessarily<00:03:29.820> with

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
well it's not custom necessarily with

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.250 
well it's not custom necessarily with
some<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.270> them<00:03:30.360> they're<00:03:30.540> quite<00:03:30.780> custom

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
some of them they're quite custom

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.420 
some of them they're quite custom
actually<00:03:31.560> if<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.680> think<00:03:31.709> about<00:03:31.950> its<00:03:32.250> come<00:03:32.370> at

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
actually if I think about its come at

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.910 
actually if I think about its come at
the<00:03:32.489> hundred<00:03:32.760> 25<00:03:33.150> years<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.900> faces<00:03:34.739> they've

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
the hundred 25 years and faces they've

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.370 
the hundred 25 years and faces they've
used<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:36.090> here<00:03:36.270> we<00:03:36.360> have<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.600> base<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.840> spades

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
used so here we have the base of spades

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.350 
used so here we have the base of spades
it's<00:03:37.769> really<00:03:38.130> recall<00:03:38.459> it<00:03:38.580> has<00:03:38.670> been<00:03:38.940> scorned

really<00:04:40.740> cool<00:04:41.040> deck<00:04:41.340> so<00:04:42.270> let's<00:04:42.690> see<00:04:42.840> how<00:04:43.020> this

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
really cool deck so let's see how this

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.800 
really cool deck so let's see how this
deck<00:04:43.470> actually<00:04:44.010> handles<00:04:44.669> so<00:04:45.060> it<00:04:45.330> looks<00:04:45.570> great

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
deck actually handles so it looks great

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.029 
deck actually handles so it looks great
but<00:04:45.960> how<00:04:46.110> does<00:04:46.169> it<00:04:46.380> have

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
but how does it have

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.969 
but how does it have
so<00:04:47.430> first<00:04:47.669> off<00:04:47.850> it<00:04:48.150> dribbles<00:04:48.570> really<00:04:49.110> well<00:04:49.289> no

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
so first off it dribbles really well no

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:51.650 
so first off it dribbles really well no
problems<00:04:50.430> of<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.550> dribbling<00:04:50.850> at<00:04:51.060> saw<00:04:51.419> it's

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
problems of the dribbling at saw it's

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.110 
problems of the dribbling at saw it's
just<00:04:51.780> a<00:04:51.840> bus<00:04:52.050> will<00:04:52.289> stop<00:04:52.320> egg<00:04:52.740> finish<00:04:53.460> so<00:04:53.970> what

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
just a bus will stop egg finish so what

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.360 
just a bus will stop egg finish so what
would<00:04:54.270> be<00:04:54.419> the<00:04:54.509> problem<00:04:54.750> this<00:04:55.220> spring<00:04:56.220> will

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
would be the problem this spring will

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.200

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
to see a little bit of the border but if

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.379
