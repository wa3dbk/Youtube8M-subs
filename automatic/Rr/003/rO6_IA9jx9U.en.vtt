00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.810
 for a formal party you will be staying 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.240
 elegant and charming with this attractive 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:14.309
 life hairstyle leaving the hair 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:17.490
 loose parts and separate the part 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.449
 from top to ear 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.720
 if desired or if a bow or an elastic 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:27.810
 and position as you see in the video now 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.390
 secure with clips in places 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.820
 where they will not be seen in the hairstyle 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.610
 this will help to make the elastic in the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:41.340
 corrective desfio capello and AlÃ­sio over 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.079
 now make a ponytail by fastening 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.700
 more or less in the middle 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.460
 starting with the tips is holly hair 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:55.050
 contagion into each other's tail 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.129
 horse and secure with staples one if 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.129
 how many are needed 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:06.119
 place on both sides of this roll 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.850
 after that make two braids and each 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.920
 side in front and split the hair in 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.890
 low in two parts and undo the hair 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.490
 now hold onto the root as you stand 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.770
 next to it with a clamp and go 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.720
 Hair up and clamp with clips 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.659
 You could also make a tail of 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.850
 horse as it did on top but for me it was 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.259
 easier to split the hair in two 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.290
 parts 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.930
 do the same with the other side 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.170
 note that on the top I wrapped the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.220
 hair down and these two parts of 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.880
 low 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.420
 I wrapped up that fly 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.909
 I really wanted to debut in this video, remember. 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.509
 that it is important to shred hair at 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.960
 times to give volume to the hair 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.119
 stability 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.060
 so the hair is not strapped 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.610
 singing when you work with him and 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.520
 also if you have fine hair or 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.440
 little hair helps to create more 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.150
 intensity 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.620
 if you prefer there, that's the one 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:21.280
 braids by the edges and then 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:26.280
 a braid right in the middle where the division 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.680
 between these soils and fasten with staples 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:34.329
 wrap the end of the line and 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:37.599
 elastic and secure with clips then 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:39.000
 and place the second braid over the 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.819
 first 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.780
 hold and scroll points as you did 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.540
 prior to finalizing justice 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.409
 where necessary with clamps and 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.150
 again I really like the ep or that 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:59.340
 more separate clamp 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:02.920
 like you saw in the video and finished with 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.019
 putting fixative and your hairstyle is 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.220
 ready 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:12.220
 This hairstyle is attractive and elegant. 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:16.030
 It seems difficult to do but like you. 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:20.790
 saw it simple and hope you have 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.790
 liked thank you for watching
