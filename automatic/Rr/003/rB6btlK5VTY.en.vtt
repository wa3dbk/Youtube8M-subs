another knife review what do we have
here<00:00:08.040> is<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.429> zero<00:00:08.730> tolerance<00:00:08.970> over<00:00:09.420> 30<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:10.790> zero

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
here is a zero tolerance over 30 to zero

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.810 
here is a zero tolerance over 30 to zero
tolerance<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.540> tie<00:00:13.530> cutlery<00:00:13.980> own<00:00:14.250> knife

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
tolerance is a tie cutlery own knife

company<00:00:15.320> and<00:00:16.520> obviously<00:00:17.520> no<00:00:18.390> 301<00:00:19.170> was<00:00:19.500> made<00:00:19.680> in

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
company and obviously no 301 was made in

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.040 
company and obviously no 301 was made in
collaboration<00:00:20.039> with<00:00:20.520> stridor<00:00:22.730> so<00:00:23.930> this<00:00:24.930> is

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
collaboration with stridor so this is

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.109 
collaboration with stridor so this is
the<00:00:25.199> 030<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.400> difference<00:00:26.730> between<00:00:26.820> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
the 030 to the difference between the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.839 
the 030 to the difference between the
0302<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.380> rest<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.769> 300<00:00:29.340> line<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.699> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
0302 and the rest of the 300 line is the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.089 
0302 and the rest of the 300 line is the
coyote<00:00:30.150> brown<00:00:30.330> handle<00:00:30.869> but<00:00:31.650> other<00:00:31.859> than<00:00:32.040> that

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
coyote brown handle but other than that

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.030 
coyote brown handle but other than that
they're<00:00:32.460> all<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.759> same<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:36.920> handle<00:00:37.920> material

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
they're all the same a handle material

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.330 
they're all the same a handle material
is<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:39.120> front<00:00:39.360> /<00:00:39.570> g10<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.649> frame<00:00:40.860> lock<00:00:41.040> sides

textured<00:00:42.030> titanium<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:45.750> texturing<00:00:46.320> really

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
textured titanium the texturing really

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.410 
textured titanium the texturing really
helps<00:00:47.039> because<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.610> makes<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> knife<00:00:48.120> more

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
helps because it makes it the knife more

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.240 
helps because it makes it the knife more
comfortable<00:00:48.899> more<00:00:49.200> grippy<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:49.829> not<00:00:50.039> going

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
comfortable more grippy it's not going

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
just for more finish cutting let's see

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.780 
just for more finish cutting let's see
what<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.659> talk<00:01:33.840> about<00:01:33.869> next<00:01:34.229> oh<00:01:34.860> right<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
what to talk about next oh right the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.730 
what to talk about next oh right the
blade<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.509> blades<00:01:36.750> made<00:01:36.930> out<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.200> s30v

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
blade the blades made out of s30v

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.460 
blade the blades made out of s30v
stainless<00:01:38.700> steel<00:01:38.909> which<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.270> really<00:01:39.570> tough

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
stainless steel which is really tough

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.410 
stainless steel which is really tough
steel<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:41.009> believe<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.400> has<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> rockwell<00:01:42.060> rating

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
steel I believe it has a rockwell rating

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.200 
steel I believe it has a rockwell rating
of<00:01:42.540> 58<00:01:42.930> 360<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.460> going<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.640> retain<00:01:44.909> that

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
of 58 360 so it's going to retain that

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.710 
of 58 360 so it's going to retain that
edge<00:01:45.450> really<00:01:45.780> well<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.640> also<00:01:47.850> see<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
edge really well you can also see the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.749 
edge really well you can also see the
shredder<00:01:49.020> inherited<00:01:49.530> tiger<00:01:50.070> striping<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
shredder inherited tiger striping on the

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.370 
shredder inherited tiger striping on the
blade

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.459 

the<00:01:55.380> blades<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.859> recurve<00:01:56.520> shape<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.570> makes

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
the blades of recurve shape so it makes

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.940 
the blades of recurve shape so it makes
really<00:01:58.679> well<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.280> specific<00:02:00.060> cutting<00:02:00.390> tasks

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.730 

nice<00:02:04.950> very<00:02:05.939> festive<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:07.049> spring<00:02:07.319> its

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
nice very festive and it's spring its

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.639 
nice very festive and it's spring its
speed<00:02:08.489> assisted<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:10.229> can<00:02:10.379> take<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
speed assisted so you can take the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.830 
speed assisted so you can take the
torsion<00:02:11.039> rod<00:02:11.160> out<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.519> make<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.730> not<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.599> fast

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
torsion rod out and make it not so fast

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.509 
torsion rod out and make it not so fast
and<00:02:13.049> it<00:02:13.170> kind<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.410> overwhelms<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.099> but<00:02:14.340> I

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
and it kind of overwhelms you but I

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.490 
and it kind of overwhelms you but I
think<00:02:14.700> it's<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:14.879> great<00:02:14.910> feature<00:02:15.299> added<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.440> the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
think it's a great feature added to the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:24.470 
think it's a great feature added to the
knife<00:02:22.220> when<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.250> first<00:02:23.519> looked<00:02:23.730> at<00:02:23.879> this<00:02:24.090> knife

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
knife when I first looked at this knife

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.930 
knife when I first looked at this knife
it<00:02:24.810> kinda<00:02:25.230> reminded<00:02:25.590> me<00:02:25.769> of<00:02:25.799> it<00:02:26.370> kind<00:02:26.519> of<00:02:26.670> made

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
it kinda reminded me of it kind of made

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.620 
it kinda reminded me of it kind of made
me<00:02:26.970> think<00:02:27.299> about<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:28.400> speed<00:02:29.400> assisted<00:02:30.269> Strider

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
me think about a speed assisted Strider

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.979 
me think about a speed assisted Strider

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
because this looks it carries on a lot

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.199

some things I like change about this
knife<00:03:05.010> is<00:03:05.609> probably<00:03:06.829> how<00:03:07.829> ride<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.400> low<00:03:08.579> how

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
knife is probably how ride it low how

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.629 
knife is probably how ride it low how
low<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:10.200> rides<00:03:10.440> in<00:03:10.829> my<00:03:11.190> pocket<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:14.040> give<00:03:14.400> that

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
low it rides in my pocket you give that

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.550 
low it rides in my pocket you give that
much<00:03:14.850> for<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.060> knife<00:03:15.239> still<00:03:15.480> sticks<00:03:15.780> out<00:03:15.989> for

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
much for the knife still sticks out for

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.440 
much for the knife still sticks out for
a<00:03:16.590> nice<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:16.950> bit<00:03:17.190> this<00:03:17.430> big<00:03:17.700> that's<00:03:18.060> not<00:03:18.120> much

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
a nice that bit this big that's not much

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.500 
a nice that bit this big that's not much
but<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:19.049> feel<00:03:19.470> like<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:19.950> see<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.519> little

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
but I feel like it to see it a little

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.420 
but I feel like it to see it a little
ride<00:03:22.079> a<00:03:22.109> little<00:03:22.410> lower<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.980> way<00:03:26.160> it's<00:03:26.310> the

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
ride a little lower and the way it's the

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.250 
ride a little lower and the way it's the
biggest<00:03:26.760> issue<00:03:26.940> it's<00:03:27.630> eight<00:03:27.840> point<00:03:28.079> six

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
biggest issue it's eight point six

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.229 
biggest issue it's eight point six
ounces<00:03:28.769> so<00:03:29.069> it's<00:03:29.579> kind<00:03:29.819> of<00:03:29.910> heavy<00:03:30.030> for

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
ounces so it's kind of heavy for

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.710 
ounces so it's kind of heavy for
everyday<00:03:30.810> pocket<00:03:31.319> carry<00:03:33.349> also<00:03:34.519> but<00:03:35.720> actually

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
everyday pocket carry also but actually

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.860 
everyday pocket carry also but actually
other<00:03:37.169> than<00:03:37.319> that<00:03:37.560> there's<00:03:37.919> nothing<00:03:38.310> much

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
other than that there's nothing much

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.879 
other than that there's nothing much
that<00:03:39.870> goes<00:03:40.169> wrong<00:03:40.410> with<00:03:40.590> this<00:03:40.680> knife

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
that goes wrong with this knife

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:45.710 
that goes wrong with this knife
everything<00:03:41.310> was<00:03:41.430> made<00:03:41.639> really<00:03:42.090> well<00:03:44.720> the

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
everything was made really well the

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.789 
everything was made really well the
blades<00:03:46.019> perfect<00:03:46.650> size<00:03:47.040> for<00:03:47.069> like<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:48.870> make<00:03:49.620> it

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
blades perfect size for like to make it

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.650 
blades perfect size for like to make it
so<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.220> grips<00:03:50.489> in<00:03:50.700> really<00:03:50.970> nicely<00:03:51.150> in<00:03:51.359> the<00:03:51.419> hand

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
so it grips in really nicely in the hand

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.479 
so it grips in really nicely in the hand
theblaze<00:03:52.500> about<00:03:52.799> three<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.130> three<00:03:53.250> four

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489

my<00:03:58.169> hand<00:03:58.849> and<00:03:59.849> this<00:04:00.690> is<00:04:00.810> just<00:04:00.840> a<00:04:01.109> great<00:04:01.319> knife

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
my hand and this is just a great knife

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.400 
my hand and this is just a great knife
to<00:04:01.919> use

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
to use

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.980 
to use
I<00:04:02.470> I<00:04:03.340> primarily<00:04:03.820> use<00:04:04.120> this<00:04:04.390> knife<00:04:04.600> when<00:04:04.810> I<00:04:04.870> go

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
I I primarily use this knife when I go

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.940 
I I primarily use this knife when I go
hiking<00:04:05.370> just<00:04:06.370> because<00:04:06.520> it's<00:04:06.670> really<00:04:06.870> really

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
hiking just because it's really really

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.930 
hiking just because it's really really
well<00:04:08.950> made<00:04:09.220> and<00:04:09.700> sturdy<00:04:10.710> the<00:04:11.710> frame<00:04:11.980> lock<00:04:12.160> then

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
well made and sturdy the frame lock then

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.790 
well made and sturdy the frame lock then
you<00:04:13.030> grip<00:04:13.240> it<00:04:13.270> and<00:04:13.450> reinforces<00:04:14.140> the<00:04:14.200> log<00:04:14.410> so<00:04:14.710> it

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
you grip it and reinforces the log so it

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.259 
you grip it and reinforces the log so it
kind<00:04:14.980> of<00:04:15.040> gives<00:04:15.160> you<00:04:15.280> that<00:04:15.790> sort<00:04:16.000> of<00:04:16.120> security

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
kind of gives you that sort of security

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.289 
kind of gives you that sort of security
that<00:04:16.660> you<00:04:16.930> would<00:04:17.049> have<00:04:17.200> with<00:04:17.380> a<00:04:17.410> fixed<00:04:17.620> blade

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
that you would have with a fixed blade

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.120 
that you would have with a fixed blade
maybe<00:04:19.299> not<00:04:19.510> quite<00:04:19.959> as<00:04:20.140> much<00:04:20.320> but<00:04:20.590> pretty<00:04:20.920> damn

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
maybe not quite as much but pretty damn

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.790 
maybe not quite as much but pretty damn
close<00:04:21.810> so<00:04:22.810> this<00:04:23.710> is<00:04:23.890> just<00:04:25.110> great<00:04:26.110> nice<00:04:26.500> if

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
close so this is just great nice if

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.230 
close so this is just great nice if
you're<00:04:26.980> looking<00:04:27.370> for<00:04:27.400> that<00:04:27.790> sort<00:04:28.150> of

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
you're looking for that sort of

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.440 
you're looking for that sort of
sturdiness<00:04:28.630> and<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:30.190> blades<00:04:30.460> may<00:04:30.730> have<00:04:30.880> s30v

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
sturdiness and the blades may have s30v

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.000 
sturdiness and the blades may have s30v
so<00:04:31.750> it's<00:04:31.840> going<00:04:31.930> to<00:04:31.990> retain<00:04:32.230> that<00:04:32.380> edge<00:04:32.620> and

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
so it's going to retain that edge and

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.410 
so it's going to retain that edge and
it's<00:04:33.460> not<00:04:33.640> going<00:04:33.790> to<00:04:33.850> rush<00:04:34.000> very<00:04:34.240> easy<00:04:36.420> well

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
it's not going to rush very easy well

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.010 
it's not going to rush very easy well
that's<00:04:37.900> my<00:04:38.080> review<00:04:38.260> of<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.950> oh<00:04:38.980> 3<00:04:39.370> 02<00:04:39.900> hope<00:04:40.900> you
