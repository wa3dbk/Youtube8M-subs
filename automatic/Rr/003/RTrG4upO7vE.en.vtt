00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
want to talk to you about dynamic range

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.859 
want to talk to you about dynamic range
it's<00:01:18.700> very<00:01:18.880> important<00:01:19.240> to<00:01:19.299> me<00:01:19.359> because<00:01:19.509> it's

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
it's very important to me because it's

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.800 
it's very important to me because it's
the<00:01:19.960> basis<00:01:20.499> of<00:01:20.649> my<00:01:21.490> philosophy<00:01:22.090> for<00:01:22.270> drum

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
the basis of my philosophy for drum

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.209 
the basis of my philosophy for drum
design<00:01:23.170> it's<00:01:23.380> getting<00:01:23.679> the<00:01:23.770> most<00:01:23.920> out<00:01:24.159> of

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
design it's getting the most out of

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:27.169 
design it's getting the most out of
something<00:01:24.579> just<00:01:25.000> like<00:01:25.090> a<00:01:25.149> car<00:01:25.479> performance

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
something just like a car performance

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.429 
something just like a car performance
with<00:01:28.179> the<00:01:28.210> drums<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.950> about<00:01:31.350> extending<00:01:32.350> the

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
with the drums it's about extending the

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.800 
with the drums it's about extending the
range<00:01:32.590> of<00:01:32.890> tone<00:01:34.170> volume<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:36.780> sensitivity<00:01:37.780> of

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
range of tone volume and sensitivity of

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.190 
range of tone volume and sensitivity of
the<00:01:37.959> instrument<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:40.030> means<00:01:40.240> that<00:01:40.509> yes<00:01:40.990> it

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
the instrument that means that yes it

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.749 
the instrument that means that yes it
affects<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.619> feel<00:01:41.859> of<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.130> instrument<00:01:42.609> it

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
affects the feel of the instrument it

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.209 
affects the feel of the instrument it
affects<00:01:43.270> you<00:01:43.420> both<00:01:43.569> physically<00:01:44.170> and

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
affects you both physically and

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.849 
affects you both physically and
psychologically<00:01:45.219> it's<00:01:45.880> important<00:01:46.329> stuff

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
psychologically it's important stuff

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:50.729 
psychologically it's important stuff
cars<00:01:47.859> its<00:01:48.189> horsepower<00:01:48.909> it's<00:01:49.810> like<00:01:50.079> how<00:01:50.379> fast

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:50.739 
cars its horsepower it's like how fast

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:53.160 
cars its horsepower it's like how fast
can<00:01:50.890> I<00:01:50.979> get<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:51.280> energy<00:01:51.429> from<00:01:52.179> this<00:01:52.390> gas<00:01:52.719> pedal

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
can I get the energy from this gas pedal

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.709 
can I get the energy from this gas pedal
to<00:01:53.560> that<00:01:53.770> engine<00:01:54.250> do<00:01:54.700> those<00:01:54.849> back<00:01:55.090> wheels<00:01:55.119> and

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
to that engine do those back wheels and

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.919 
to that engine do those back wheels and
how<00:01:55.840> long<00:01:55.989> will<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.259> take<00:01:56.379> me<00:01:56.679> to<00:01:56.709> get<00:01:56.920> 20<00:01:57.459> to<00:01:57.579> 60

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
how long will it take me to get 20 to 60

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:03.289 
how long will it take me to get 20 to 60
speed<00:01:59.969> well<00:02:00.969> you<00:02:01.270> know<00:02:01.420> it<00:02:02.289> doesn't<00:02:02.469> feel<00:02:02.619> good

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
speed well you know it doesn't feel good

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.099 
speed well you know it doesn't feel good
it<00:02:04.299> feels<00:02:04.569> great<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:07.030> dynamic<00:02:07.719> range<00:02:07.989> is

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:08.109 
it feels great so dynamic range is

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:12.930 
it feels great so dynamic range is
really<00:02:08.619> important<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.929> let's<00:02:11.200> help<00:02:12.129> put<00:02:12.819> that

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
really important so let's help put that

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.099 
really important so let's help put that
back<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.329> studio<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:13.690> talk<00:02:13.959> about

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:14.109 
back to the studio and talk about

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:17.099 
back to the studio and talk about
dynamic<00:02:14.739> range<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.640> at<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.879> same<00:02:16.060> time<00:02:16.120> let's

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:17.109 
dynamic range and at the same time let's

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:18.960 
dynamic range and at the same time let's
try<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.349> tweak<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.799> few<00:02:17.829> more<00:02:18.250> but<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.670> little

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
try to tweak a few more but a little

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.270 
try to tweak a few more but a little
more<00:02:19.120> horsepower<00:02:19.380> out<00:02:20.380> of<00:02:20.440> your<00:02:20.709> drum<00:02:21.010> set

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
more horsepower out of your drum set

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.670
