Gilliam Collegiate Academy was something

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:37.509 
Gilliam Collegiate Academy was something
that<00:00:34.710> was<00:00:34.980> very<00:00:35.160> unique<00:00:35.910> for<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.960> school

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:37.519 
that was very unique for this school

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:39.529 
that was very unique for this school
particularly<00:00:38.519> because<00:00:38.940> they<00:00:39.210> didn't<00:00:39.420> have

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:39.539 
particularly because they didn't have

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.689 
particularly because they didn't have
any<00:00:39.660> old<00:00:39.809> paradigms<00:00:40.320> nor<00:00:40.679> did<00:00:40.859> they<00:00:40.980> have<00:00:41.010> any

education<00:00:44.249> for<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.489> kind<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.850> school

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
education for this kind of school

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.450 
education for this kind of school
because<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.719> was<00:00:45.839> brand-new<00:00:46.339> what<00:00:47.339> we

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
because it was brand-new what we

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.310 
because it was brand-new what we
suggested<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.179> them<00:00:48.359> was<00:00:48.629> go<00:00:49.050> through<00:00:49.079> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
suggested with them was go through a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.169 
suggested with them was go through a
process<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.859> really<00:00:50.129> identify<00:00:50.760> what<00:00:50.969> your

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:51.179 
process to really identify what your

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:53.119 
process to really identify what your
mission<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.629> goals<00:00:51.809> are<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.260> then<00:00:52.829> we<00:00:52.980> can

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
mission and goals are and then we can

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.619 
mission and goals are and then we can
start<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.460> translate<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.149> into<00:00:54.210> an

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
start to translate that into an

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.869 
start to translate that into an
architectural<00:00:55.199> expression<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:56.460> come<00:00:56.609> up<00:00:56.730> with

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
architectural expression to come up with

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.579 
architectural expression to come up with
something<00:00:57.210> really<00:00:57.239> creative<00:00:57.749> to<00:00:58.050> serve<00:00:58.289> this

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
something really creative to serve this

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.169 
something really creative to serve this
school<00:00:59.149> specifically<00:01:01.489> when<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.640> walk<00:01:02.909> into

00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:03.179 
school specifically when you walk into

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:05.290 
school specifically when you walk into
the<00:01:03.449> building<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.589> first<00:01:04.830> thing<00:01:05.220> that

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
the building the first thing that

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.130 
the building the first thing that
anybody<00:01:06.300> sees<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.410> a<00:01:07.710> college<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:09.480> does<00:01:09.840> not

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
anybody sees is a college this does not

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.310 
anybody sees is a college this does not
look<00:01:10.680> like<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:11.430> high<00:01:11.640> school<00:01:12.060> at<00:01:12.570> all

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
look like a high school at all

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.500 
look like a high school at all
I<00:01:13.350> feel<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> school<00:01:14.910> helps<00:01:15.270> me<00:01:15.360> achieve

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
I feel like the school helps me achieve

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.870 
I feel like the school helps me achieve
in<00:01:15.900> many<00:01:16.140> ways<00:01:16.410> because<00:01:17.100> they're<00:01:17.550> a<00:01:17.580> great

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
in many ways because they're a great

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.080 
in many ways because they're a great
staff<00:01:18.300> and<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.260> building<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.800> just<00:01:19.910> fits<00:01:20.910> us

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
staff and the building is just fits us

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.930 
staff and the building is just fits us
off<00:01:21.330> all<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.410> things<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.070> came<00:01:23.640> up

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
off all of the things that we came up

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.690 
off all of the things that we came up
with<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.810> said<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.410> would<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.650> would<00:01:26.640> be

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
with and said that would be would be

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.270 
with and said that would be would be
needed<00:01:27.330> or<00:01:27.540> elements<00:01:28.440> that<00:01:28.530> are<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.800> a<00:01:28.920> design

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
needed or elements that are in a design

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.810 
needed or elements that are in a design
of<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> building<00:01:30.120> so<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:30.960> example<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:32.580> know

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
of the building so for example we know

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.120 
of the building so for example we know
that<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:33.300> needed<00:01:33.570> extensive<00:01:34.080> supports<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:35.100> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
that we needed extensive supports for a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.530 
that we needed extensive supports for a
ninth<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.640> 10th<00:01:35.880> grade<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.600> less<00:01:37.590> extensive

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
ninth and 10th grade and less extensive

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.510 
ninth and 10th grade and less extensive
supports<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.720> monitoring<00:01:40.320> for<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.860> 11th<00:01:41.400> and

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
supports and monitoring for the 11th and

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.240 
supports and monitoring for the 11th and
12th<00:01:41.550> graders<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.690> design<00:01:43.010> one<00:01:44.010> the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
12th graders so in the design one the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.100 
12th graders so in the design one the
two<00:01:44.400> grade<00:01:44.670> levels<00:01:44.700> 9th<00:01:45.300> and<00:01:45.510> 10th<00:01:45.750> they<00:01:45.930> need

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
two grade levels 9th and 10th they need

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.010 
two grade levels 9th and 10th they need
the<00:01:46.230> most<00:01:46.410> support<00:01:46.530> or<00:01:47.250> separated<00:01:48.120> from<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
the most support or separated from the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.800 
the most support or separated from the
11th<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.710> 12th<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.370> facility<00:01:50.940> we<00:01:51.600> knew

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
11th and 12th in the facility we knew

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.800 
11th and 12th in the facility we knew
that<00:01:52.140> we<00:01:52.440> needed<00:01:52.650> a<00:01:53.190> place<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.120> students<00:01:54.780> to

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
that we needed a place for students to

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.610 
that we needed a place for students to
access<00:01:55.380> support<00:01:55.790> and<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.210> hence<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:58.050> have<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
access support and so hence we have the

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.580 
access support and so hence we have the
perch<00:01:59.540> as<00:02:00.540> they<00:02:00.720> think<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.050> all<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.290> spaces

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
perch as they think of all the spaces

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.170 
perch as they think of all the spaces
the<00:02:01.950> spaces<00:02:02.370> that<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.580> think<00:02:02.850> are<00:02:02.970> most

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
the spaces that I think are most

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.110 
the spaces that I think are most
successful<00:02:03.870> is<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.950> really<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.520> common

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
successful is the is really that common

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.940 
successful is the is really that common
Plaza<00:02:06.470> we<00:02:07.470> treated<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.569> twofold<00:02:09.569> one<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:10.170> its

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
Plaza we treated it twofold one is its

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.559 
Plaza we treated it twofold one is its
place<00:02:11.370> where<00:02:11.609> dining<00:02:11.999> happens

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
place where dining happens

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.649 
place where dining happens
but<00:02:13.290> Marcos<00:02:13.890> flexibility<00:02:14.579> is<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:14.939> important

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
but Marcos flexibility is so important
