part tastes the same as the u.s. kind
the<00:01:58.640> only<00:01:58.819> difference<00:01:59.000> I'd<00:01:59.270> say<00:01:59.450> with<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.750> ice

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
the only difference I'd say with the ice

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.449 
the only difference I'd say with the ice
cream<00:02:00.170> is<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:01.610> walnut<00:02:01.939> park<00:02:03.099> and<00:02:04.099> it's<00:02:04.340> really

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
cream is the walnut park and it's really

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:09.370 
cream is the walnut park and it's really
good

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.790 

it<00:02:09.890> actually<00:02:10.100> has<00:02:10.340> pieces<00:02:11.200> iguana<00:02:12.200> in<00:02:12.410> it<00:02:13.390> so<00:02:14.390> I

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
it actually has pieces iguana in it so I

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.470 
it actually has pieces iguana in it so I
thought<00:02:15.800> it<00:02:15.950> was<00:02:16.010> just<00:02:16.070> flavored<00:02:16.760> but<00:02:17.360> it

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
thought it was just flavored but it

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.710 
thought it was just flavored but it
actually<00:02:17.600> has<00:02:17.840> pieces<00:02:18.310> like<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.430> picture

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.840
