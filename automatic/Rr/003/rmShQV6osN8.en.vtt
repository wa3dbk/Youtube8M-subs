make<00:00:00.149> it<00:00:00.269> smooth<00:00:00.539> I<00:00:00.690> definitely<00:00:01.050> it<00:00:01.560> turns<00:00:01.860> out

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
make it smooth I definitely it turns out

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.590 
make it smooth I definitely it turns out
that<00:00:02.100> I'm<00:00:02.310> pretty<00:00:02.520> good<00:00:02.669> at<00:00:02.730> replicating<00:00:03.270> a

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
that I'm pretty good at replicating a

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.329 
that I'm pretty good at replicating a
topology<00:00:03.899> but<00:00:04.200> I<00:00:04.230> don't<00:00:04.470> know<00:00:04.589> how<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.040> get<00:00:05.190> all

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
topology but I don't know how to get all

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.820 
topology but I don't know how to get all
these<00:00:05.490> correct<00:00:05.910> textures<00:00:06.390> but<00:00:07.379> I<00:00:07.440> do<00:00:07.529> know<00:00:07.740> how

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
these correct textures but I do know how

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.669 
these correct textures but I do know how
to<00:00:07.859> cheat<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.460> correct<00:00:08.940> textures<00:00:09.389> so<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.349> threw

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
to cheat the correct textures so I threw

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.230 
to cheat the correct textures so I threw
it<00:00:10.800> into<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:11.040> vat<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.309> rubber<00:00:11.639> let<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.059> rubber

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
it into a vat of rubber let the rubber

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.660 
it into a vat of rubber let the rubber
hard<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.660> pulled<00:00:12.900> out<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.200> casting<00:00:13.650> made<00:00:14.639> a

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
hard and pulled out the casting made a

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.849 
hard and pulled out the casting made a
resin<00:00:15.240> casting<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.170> now<00:00:16.650> when<00:00:16.800> you

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
resin casting of that and now when you

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.529 
resin casting of that and now when you
want<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.070> smooth<00:00:17.279> down<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.490> resin<00:00:17.789> casting<00:00:18.150> you

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
want to smooth down a resin casting you

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.120 
want to smooth down a resin casting you
can<00:00:18.690> use<00:00:18.810> bondo<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.260> can<00:00:19.380> use<00:00:19.500> auto<00:00:19.740> fillers

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
can use bondo you can use auto fillers

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.349 
can use bondo you can use auto fillers
you<00:00:20.250> can<00:00:20.400> use<00:00:20.520> putty's<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.000> there<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.180> my

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
you can use putty's and there is my

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.160 
you can use putty's and there is my
preferred<00:00:21.810> thing<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.289> actually<00:00:23.660> about<00:00:24.660> 70

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
preferred thing is actually about 70

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.250 
preferred thing is actually about 70
coats<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.590> this<00:00:25.800> auto<00:00:26.099> primer<00:00:26.900> you<00:00:27.900> just<00:00:28.109> keep

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
coats of this auto primer you just keep

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.169 
coats of this auto primer you just keep
on<00:00:28.439> spring<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.189> trips<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:29.760> hell<00:00:30.000> but

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
on spring it it trips like hell but

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.490 
on spring it it trips like hell but
there's<00:00:30.359> nothing<00:00:30.689> that's<00:00:30.869> easier<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.170> sand

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
there's nothing that's easier to sand

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.200

bunch of quadruple zero steel wool and
you<00:00:35.250> polish<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.360> was<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.540> oh<00:00:36.890> yeah<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.100> as

you polish it and I was a oh yeah so as
I'm<00:00:38.460> polishing<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:39.090> casting<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.960> know<00:00:39.989> I'm

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
I'm polishing this casting you know I'm

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.200 
I'm polishing this casting you know I'm
trying<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.010> work<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> light<00:00:41.700> kicks<00:00:42.030> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
trying to work on the light kicks and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.580 
trying to work on the light kicks and
luckily<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> movie<00:00:43.079> there's<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.350> scene

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
luckily in the movie there's a scene

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.779 
luckily in the movie there's a scene
when<00:00:43.739> they've<00:00:43.860> revealed<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.430> Falcon

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
when they've revealed the Falcon

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.540 
when they've revealed the Falcon
actually<00:00:45.180> spin<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:45.989> camera<00:00:46.950> really<00:00:47.219> close

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
actually spin it on camera really close

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.260 
actually spin it on camera really close
so<00:00:48.059> i<00:00:48.090> did<00:00:48.390> screenshots<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.320> every<00:00:49.739> frame<00:00:50.270> that

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
so i did screenshots of every frame that

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.180 
so i did screenshots of every frame that
the<00:00:51.300> Falcon<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.960> visible<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.620> really

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
the Falcon is visible to really

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.130 
the Falcon is visible to really
replicate<00:00:53.640> I'm<00:00:53.910> really<00:00:54.390> replicating<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
replicate I'm really replicating the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.110 
replicate I'm really replicating the
light<00:00:55.440> kicks<00:00:55.739> I'm<00:00:55.920> replicating<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> lighting

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
light kicks I'm replicating the lighting

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.549 
light kicks I'm replicating the lighting
in<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> room<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.719> taking<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.109> look<00:00:58.140> at<00:00:58.410> my

obsessive remember so here i have this
thing<00:01:21.800> which<00:01:21.980> I<00:01:22.130> now<00:01:22.370> realize<00:01:22.400> from<00:01:23.000> the

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
thing which I now realize from the

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.820 
thing which I now realize from the
extensive<00:01:23.960> amount<00:01:24.200> of<00:01:24.290> research<00:01:24.530> that<00:01:24.590> I've

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
extensive amount of research that I've

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.640 
extensive amount of research that I've
done<00:01:24.860> my<00:01:25.610> google<00:01:25.970> foo<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.510> my<00:01:26.900> arrogance

done my google foo and my arrogance

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.260 
done my google foo and my arrogance
tells<00:01:27.950> me<00:01:28.100> this<00:01:28.520> is<00:01:28.730> the<00:01:28.760> most<00:01:29.030> accurate

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
tells me this is the most accurate

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.820 
tells me this is the most accurate

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
like a falcon like this you lose a

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.260 
like a falcon like this you lose a
certain<00:04:39.500> amount<00:04:39.710> of<00:04:39.949> size<00:04:40.250> between<00:04:40.789> one<00:04:41.240> and
