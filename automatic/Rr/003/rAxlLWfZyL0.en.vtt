pool they have where you can use the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.260 
pool they have where you can use the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
pool empty and make a ball pit and they

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.630 
pool empty and make a ball pit and they
have<00:01:51.390> netting<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.290> can<00:01:52.439> buy<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.220> that

have netting that you can buy and that

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.850 
have netting that you can buy and that
is<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.180> cool<00:01:54.210> like<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.140> make<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.500> netting

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
is so cool like you can make the netting

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.280 
is so cool like you can make the netting
to<00:01:56.250> fully<00:01:56.759> go<00:01:56.969> around<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.420> ball<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.750> ball<00:01:58.079> pit

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
to fully go around the ball a ball pit

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.560 
to fully go around the ball a ball pit
so<00:01:58.590> you'll<00:01:59.009> keep<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> balls<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.670> there's<00:02:00.420> lots

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
plans already some ideas there's other

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.789 
plans already some ideas there's other
stuff<00:03:09.439> online<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:10.220> they<00:03:10.909> have<00:03:10.939> a<00:03:11.560> online<00:03:12.560> 3d

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
stuff online and they have a online 3d

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.500 
stuff online and they have a online 3d
program<00:03:13.220> where<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:13.489> can<00:03:13.609> go<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:13.939> design<00:03:14.150> your

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
program where you can go and design your

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.379 
program where you can go and design your
own<00:03:14.739> thing<00:03:15.739> virtually<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.579> then<00:03:17.060> print<00:03:17.329> it

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
own thing virtually and then print it

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:18.339 
own thing virtually and then print it
out<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:17.690> then<00:03:17.780> you've<00:03:17.989> got<00:03:18.169> your

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
out and then you've got your

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.140 
out and then you've got your
instructions<00:03:19.069> to<00:03:19.310> build<00:03:19.459> whatever<00:03:19.790> it<00:03:20.030> is

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
instructions to build whatever it is

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.939 
instructions to build whatever it is
you've<00:03:20.389> created<00:03:20.750> that<00:03:21.290> is<00:03:21.440> I<00:03:21.560> mean<00:03:21.680> there's

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:21.949 
you've created that is I mean there's

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:23.830 
you've created that is I mean there's
just<00:03:22.040> so<00:03:22.310> much<00:03:22.760> different<00:03:23.269> stuff<00:03:23.449> and<00:03:23.690> this<00:03:23.780> is

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
just so much different stuff and this is

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.599 
just so much different stuff and this is
really<00:03:24.169> educational<00:03:24.859> as<00:03:24.980> well<00:03:25.010> because

slide or the pool at the bottom in a

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.869 
slide or the pool at the bottom in a
ball<00:04:10.639> pit<00:04:10.900> so<00:04:11.900> in<00:04:12.079> that<00:04:12.290> way<00:04:12.829> I<00:04:12.859> could<00:04:13.159> sum<00:04:13.400> it

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
ball pit so in that way I could sum it

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.539 
ball pit so in that way I could sum it
up<00:04:13.909> walls<00:04:14.599> in<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.109> pool<00:04:15.349> right<00:04:15.739> I<00:04:16.039> mean<00:04:16.430> you

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
up walls in the pool right I mean you

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.250 
up walls in the pool right I mean you
can<00:04:16.699> use<00:04:16.849> it<00:04:17.000> empty<00:04:17.329> as<00:04:17.479> a<00:04:17.510> ball<00:04:17.720> pit<00:04:17.930> or<00:04:18.109> you

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
can use it empty as a ball pit or you

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.509 
can use it empty as a ball pit or you
could<00:04:18.409> fill<00:04:18.560> it<00:04:18.650> full<00:04:18.829> of<00:04:18.889> water<00:04:19.099> and<00:04:19.190> have<00:04:19.430> it

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
could fill it full of water and have it

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.370 
could fill it full of water and have it
and<00:04:19.760> I<00:04:19.789> think<00:04:20.000> there<00:04:20.120> are<00:04:20.150> a<00:04:20.299> couple<00:04:20.570> I<00:04:21.019> think

yeah and another thing that I love about
this<00:04:25.330> is<00:04:25.509> it's<00:04:25.659> so<00:04:25.810> versatile<00:04:26.199> you<00:04:26.349> can<00:04:26.409> use<00:04:26.530> it

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
this is it's so versatile you can use it

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.950 
this is it's so versatile you can use it
indoor<00:04:27.159> or<00:04:27.370> outdoor<00:04:27.789> so<00:04:28.120> if<00:04:28.509> you<00:04:28.629> live<00:04:28.780> in<00:04:28.900> a

with<00:05:50.469> the<00:05:50.590> directions<00:05:51.190> I<00:05:51.490> mean<00:05:51.759> trying<00:05:52.090> to<00:05:52.300> go

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
with the directions I mean trying to go

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.059 
with the directions I mean trying to go
through<00:05:52.599> the<00:05:52.659> directions<00:05:53.169> and<00:05:53.469> figure

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:54.069 
through the directions and figure

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:56.189 
through the directions and figure
everything<00:05:54.250> out<00:05:54.810> it's<00:05:55.810> a<00:05:55.930> little

everything out it's a little
time-consuming<00:05:56.440> I<00:05:57.009> would<00:05:57.370> say<00:05:57.550> it<00:05:57.669> maybe<00:05:57.819> took

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
time-consuming I would say it maybe took

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.059 
time-consuming I would say it maybe took
