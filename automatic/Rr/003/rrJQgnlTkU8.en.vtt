00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.980
 Although the questions I'm such mon say that over to answer me you doing 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:17.789
 It's early and fast. 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.400
 Honma Decca of 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.850
 This person is 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.810
 Do what you regulars Trico 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:29.170
 Kedomo No, it's momentum that was found much and not that of him 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:33.340
 aa I am going to work 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:36.559
 Where is the good point 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.120
 But it was your question Tteyuu this 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.450
 Hm 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.710
 Oh dear 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.710
 Just think about it 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.289
 First of all I 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.280
 The easiest way is to use 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.150
 There is ea 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:03.810
 It is unexpectedly difficult to treat something close 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:05.129
 And that there is Lowest fuss, such because the easiest way to handle that 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:10.439
 He and he 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:14.159
 Has been fishing there, even people who do the fishing because they look but in short say audience of bar 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.060
 Where there is very good to say and seen in one shot Naa today I 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.640
 Den 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.640
 When the big fish I Pato took 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.900
 The excitement is 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:31.380
 It is said that it will be transmitted even if it is enactment of a large Asaka when pouring beer 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:37.090
 There may be times when a healthy upswing can not be communicated 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.040
 So Come to think of it in a complex manner that say so Do'm kind of Kotonan 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.630
 Hm 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.520
 Maybe this 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.600
 Action things 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:53.030
 A little of because kana not you close to the acre 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.390
 I think it's a pen, but this is a kung fu movie 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.200
 Chamber 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.550
 A foreign book close to that action thing 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.600
 Also referred to wonder if not it there is a total of rod Next 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:08.789
 That's why it's something like a reel. 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.060
 Although single-handedly like a burn 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.790
 I think if now was whether looking I might be of some power 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.920
 I wonder what it feels like 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.720
 Talk 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.100
 Probably still valid Jean-chan Wallerwirt Wallerwirt I Toka Janbara 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.700
 But 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.710
 Kind of like I mean the Na can Onushi 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.790
 Well in the boom 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.660
 I think it's very good 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.830
 Good leg is already a little 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.930
 So that's a very important thing 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.780
 Another 4 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.490
 Not only the person of still Hey fishing to 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.080
 That 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:51.350
 To those 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:52.650
 Well we saw in the bird's-eye view what you say caught fish, including anglers Teruyo 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:58.920
 People 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:04.819
 To say I think that so as you Kitsugi'll rank yet something big is coming 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:09.240
 Yet that made the most plainly understandable representation 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:13.080
 If If you have the elements of Kana action system 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.819
 The other this is at all 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:20.090
 I wonder if there is no text yesterday 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:24.490
 That's a bit strange because I feel something today 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.069
 Of course the person doing it is fun too, but even if it does not come out 1 mm 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:31.090
 I will do my best 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.150
 Network pen at the user's own After pulling trying to bend Osaka 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.069
 But 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.069
 How much 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:40.990
 Kana between the UGG-less team 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:43.740
 It is still after Toka or even in those things 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.459
 I enjoy myself and watch it 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.549
 People other than me 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.340
 Even for that 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.470
 Give a good impression 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.990
 Hmm 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:59.310
 Like that 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:59.310
 It seems to be a test to say that I feel like I 'm going to be a test
