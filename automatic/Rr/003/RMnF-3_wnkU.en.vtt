00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.600
 Hello Tsuchiya of the world rubber market partners 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.820
 This time 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:18.560
 As the position to cut the Saab 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:24.450
 I will proceed with the content of remembering the sense of applying the rotation to apply a strong rotation 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:28.620
 People have never got off to a people that rotation is not cut well 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:37.410
 I will learn the sense of breaking 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:42.020
 People who wear the serve is made moderate well further enhance the firm rotational force 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.600
 We will practice to acquire the senses 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.010
 When applying rotation 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.449
 There are various technologies 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:58.609
 The time of serving can experience the amount of rotation most 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.609
 It is thought that it is water, so we will use Hiraku to serve the state 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:08.450
 What I want you to remember first in this exercise 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.740
 The energy added to the ball is in the first place 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:19.640
 There are only two 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:21.770
 The energy applied to the ball in table tennis technology is only two of rotation and speed 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:28.180
 In the practice of serving 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:34.330
 Most of these two energies use rotation 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:40.830
 Most of the methods of service 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:43.150
 I think that Saab's practice is the most important part of the rotation. 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.880
 In this exercise 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.110
 Thinking about these reasons 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.620
 Bold practice methods 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.050
 I want to try 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:02:00.920
 Ignore the size of the coat once 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:05.960
 I will practice to spin the ball directly first 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.909
 Even if there is a table tennis table in front of you, ignore the table tennis table 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.300
 pr 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.300
 as it is 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.660
 It is a way to hit the ball directly 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.800
 Take a large distance 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:32.350
 Increase the swing speed 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:35.080
 After that we sneer go off the ball with bold the body also increased swing width 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.060
 In this practice method 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.290
 Strongly turn the ball 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:46.819
 First of all is the first goal 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:50.569
 Regardless of the size of the coat from the coat 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:57.400
 Let's go ahead and take turns 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:03:01.389
 Because the movement of the body will be bold if the distance is out, regardless of the size of the coat at all 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.389
 Let's swing and shake the racket 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.570
 When serving, it is most difficult to spin the ball 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.460
 The ball is 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.680
 Whereas has stopped 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.660
 Swing the racket 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:25.090
 When the ball and the racket is in contact 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.510
 If the ball is not caught on the surface of the rubber, the rotation will not be taken 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.939
 The ball is 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:35.319
 It is about to be an image that you hear after touching the package in front of you 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.319
 Let's increase the swing speed 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.850
 As a point of caution at this time 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.910
 After the ball and racket come in contact 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:50.760
 Surface, etc. of the racket when the go away 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:57.569
 The angle of the ball's direction of travel is called the reflection angle, 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:04:03.310
 The ball with this reflection angle flying vertically is 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:06.550
 It may be said that the rotation is not nearly over 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:10.350
 As you go away in the front direction 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:13.990
 The point is to release the ball 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.519
 And we will put a strong rotation 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:20.590
 The ball is 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.590
 Ignoring the movement of the parabola 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:27.970
 Like floating up or flying in a straight line 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.830
 May fly in shape 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.960
 In the extreme 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:38.590
 It can be said that the situation is that the rotational power is strong 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:42.800
 If you can do it, the ball will be warped 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.889
 I would like to practice swinging the racket 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.710
 Because I actually played 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.710
 I would like to see the play video 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.930
 Have 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.260
 Ha 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.260
 There was 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.360
 Haa 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.400
 I am now play video to see 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:32.860
 Where I understand 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:35.810
 First of all, the ball will fly straight up 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.070
 Slightly back to you 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.849
 Straight to the wall 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.430
 About that 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:46.260
 When the go birth of the amount of rotation 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:49.409
 I think that a very strong spin was not buried 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:53.070
 Ignore the rules completely 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:55.220
 At the swing speed of the racket against the ball 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:59.940
 I will turn the rotation strongly 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:05.820
 I will cut while conscious of the ball touch 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:07.550
 I think that it might be helpful if it is a situation where that part can be seen clearly 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.830
 I will 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.650
 In this practice 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.350
 I want to earn 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:20.660
 Amount of rotation 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:24.009
 In order to first aim to secure a sufficient amount of rotation 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:31.089
 Ignore the coat and dare 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:32.550
 It is the most important thing in this practice to practice focusing on putting the ball on the ball 

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:35.190
 think 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.740
 Whether or not I got a sense 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:41.580
 Because it is an important practice 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:43.990
 Feel when rubber and ball come in contact 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:47.500
 How to get caught 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:50.040
 If you observe and get a feel 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:53.400
 I think it will be shaped 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.120
 Only by repeating the number of times until you can 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.260
 I think it can not be overcome 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:01.280
 Please practice repeatedly 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.280
 Thank you very much
