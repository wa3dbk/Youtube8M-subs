00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.990
 then what is a natural that apple 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.849
 natural athlete so a natural athlete 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.070
 it's not someone who will do a 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.499
 diet and succeed it's shy'm ultra 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.960
 defined ultra groult rassek by not drinking 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:20.990
 that tea all day and 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.429
 one going to train two or three times or 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.470
 even forty six times in the day 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:27.980
 a natural athlete it can not be 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:32.960
 that a natural athlete can not you 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:35.090
 present 50 thousand boxes of protein 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.250
 with a bicep that will do roughly 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:46.160
 we will say between 55 and 62 arms and who will 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:48.410
 to weigh 60 120 kilos for 1 meter 75 that 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.100
 neither can it be an athlete 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.809
 natural a natural athlete can not 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.160
 no longer win the classic olympia or 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.280
 where there is no control so 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.050
 anti-doping and where we are in the pure of 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.670
 words of the measures that's why in 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.530
 general in the leaves that we have two 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.630
 judgments the first criterion is 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.650
 always the line first the moon that's 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.820
 means your work 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.370
 the line is always a question of 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.540
 work include products or not 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.800
 so that's the first thing you 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.700
 must defend in your preparation 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.470
 it's the line 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.360
 it means the balance of all that 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.930
 you do for example start with the 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.670
 weakness 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.280
 when we're going to train in the gym 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.890
 bodybuilding the second thing it's a 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:34.400
 natural athlete can not either 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.830
 to say that without product we arrive at nothing 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.270
 impossible that a natural athlete you 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.010
 say that without product you will not arrive 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.840
 he is just trying to find you 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.450
 explain that he himself has not succeeded in 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.740
 do without resorting to 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.260
 products or nothing at least they 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.060
 do not engage a satisfaction on his part 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.420
 on his part only because 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.729
 often 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.140
 at the start the athletes are natural they 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.750
 make the satisfaction of those around them 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.310
 happened at a certain stage they have the 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.600
 madness of grandeur the madness of 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.820
 championships make first always 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.780
 first and then make money 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.210
 to do first because the entourage 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.000
 asks if it brings in money and 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.890
 that moment there falls to the 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.700
 doping products and we leave the domain 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.560
 of the natural in my case I made the 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.650
 proof that one could be an athlete 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.319
 natural and have a professional level 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.930
 natural and be controlled precisely in 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.519
 these championships who try who tries 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.050
 somehow to defend the 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.350
 values ​​that can be released 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.239
 on a naturally trained body 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.459
 and very well get by in terms of 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.489
 championship from the given moment where 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.810
 we are in his respective category that 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.880
 can put a tick foot for example alan 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.739
 hack where there is no control it can 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.400
 to be a critic at esbf to where there is 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.519
 no control 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.530
 it can be bodybuilding aleph h &amp; m fac 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.810
 where there are controls or so allied 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.480
 nba where there are controls and so on 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.340
 even go to the nbc if you need to miami where 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.329
 I did not see any control even though 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.799
 apparently there may have 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.010
 a few who wander right to 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.079
 left 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.280
 so here's a natural athlete that's 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.340
 first, someone with roots 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.709
 strong rooted in the ability to 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.959
 think that everyone around him is 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.030
 usable to succeed in competition 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.090
 that all there is in nature is 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.890
 success factor to transform his 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.220
 body to transcend itself and for 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.720
 to arrive to present a result 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.519
 balanced on the stage result 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.090
 balanced that is reflected by the line 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.700
 athlete 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.010
 then those who think that the 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.120
 genetics and responsible all 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.160
 physical differences are wrong 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.100
 heavily and are strongly me 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.310
 taught about statistics and about 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.430
 experiences precisely 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.010
 place in matters of genetics to know 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.840
 that every person so beings 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.440
 humans between them are identical 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.459
 genetically 99 99% 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.140
 that means that what makes the 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.390
 difference genetically are by 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.500
 example the length of the limbs is a 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.040
 examples of others and others 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.680
 items 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.150
 it is for example the size of waters 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.590
 that's all that's the structure 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.510
 of the individual these are the 0.01% of 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.610
 difference between one and the other 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.390
 others on the other hand on everything that is 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.700
 muscular volume definition 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.290
 all were work of the whole mass 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.780
 and the flesh that has around 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.780
 this is not a question of genetics 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.590
 but of preparation ie of this 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.060
 that you will put in your 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.470
 plate and effort that you are 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.030
 you went to give during your 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.130
 trainings to know that an athlete 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.260
 natural can not develop a mass 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.380
 considerable muscular tissue without even 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.250
 heavy weight load but loaded in the 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.389
 bars not charge the doping products 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.800
 otherwise there would be no difference 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.479
 between the person who works on the 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.010
 site and who pick up pebbles 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.440
 for example all day and the 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.570
 person who will lift the cast in 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.860
 bodybuilding time to get 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.229
 prepare for competitions 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.500
 as for the diet we can not eat 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:55.560
 croissants in the morning of green tea 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.750
 buttered sandwiches even at 0% hoping 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.710
 acquire a dryer that will be around 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.090
 4 6% maximum 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.250
 naturally what was a record and 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.410
 a performance in itself for an athlete 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.229
 who does not take diuretics or 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.450
 anabolic but which remains possible on 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:16.940
 a relatively long duration that will 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.940
 to be around 5 to 6 months
