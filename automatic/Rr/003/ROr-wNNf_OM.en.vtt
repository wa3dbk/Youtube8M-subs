make one little circle inside of another
circle<00:01:21.890> a<00:01:22.100> lot<00:01:22.640> of<00:01:22.790> characters<00:01:23.360> already<00:01:23.630> made

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
circle a lot of characters already made

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:34.500 
circle a lot of characters already made
up<00:01:23.930> in<00:01:24.050> circles<00:01:24.440> mostly

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.450 

so<00:01:35.110> far<00:01:35.410> so<00:01:35.650> good<00:01:35.680> just<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:38.380> circles<00:01:39.100> so

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
so far so good just to the circles so

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.010 
so far so good just to the circles so
far<00:01:39.730> it's<00:01:39.910> all<00:01:40.060> circles<00:01:40.600> are<00:01:40.750> in<00:01:40.840> at<00:01:40.990> the

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
far it's all circles are in at the

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.270 
far it's all circles are in at the
moment<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.780> by<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.350> way<00:01:44.530> it's<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.800> easiest

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
moment and by the way it's the easiest

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.590 
moment and by the way it's the easiest
way<00:01:45.460> to<00:01:45.520> draw<00:01:45.700> something<00:01:45.940> in<00:01:46.090> my<00:01:46.180> opinion<00:01:46.450> is

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
way to draw something in my opinion is

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.010 
way to draw something in my opinion is
just<00:01:46.630> narrow<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:47.260> down<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:47.500> basic<00:01:47.980> shapes<00:01:49.020> so

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
just narrow it down to basic shapes so

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.510 
just narrow it down to basic shapes so
once<00:01:50.170> you<00:01:50.290> have<00:01:50.410> that<00:01:50.440> you<00:01:50.860> need<00:01:51.160> a<00:01:51.220> little

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
once you have that you need a little

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.440 
once you have that you need a little
line<00:01:52.480> outside<00:01:53.230> of<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.500> circles<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:55.090> we<00:01:55.270> just

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
line outside of the circles that we just

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.360 
line outside of the circles that we just
drew<00:01:56.760> and<00:01:57.760> now<00:01:57.850> you<00:01:57.910> can<00:01:58.120> see<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.450> eyes<00:01:58.570> so<00:01:58.930> far

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
drew and now you can see the eyes so far

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.680 
drew and now you can see the eyes so far
for<00:02:00.370> my<00:02:00.490> character<00:02:00.880> now<00:02:01.150> I<00:02:01.180> have<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.510> little

for my character now I have a little

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
circle inside the circles your for the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:29.330 
circle inside the circles your for the
lighting

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.670 

my<00:02:30.030> guys<00:02:30.209> smile<00:02:30.739> why<00:02:31.739> not<00:02:32.870> all<00:02:33.870> right<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:34.349> now

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
my guys smile why not all right so now

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.559 
my guys smile why not all right so now
we'll<00:02:34.890> just<00:02:35.129> put<00:02:35.310> on<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.430> glasses<00:02:35.790> which<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.540> a

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
we'll just put on the glasses which is a

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.520 
we'll just put on the glasses which is a
big<00:02:36.840> giant<00:02:37.379> oval<00:02:38.069> for<00:02:38.340> eyes<00:02:39.110> make<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.260> bridge

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
big giant oval for eyes make the bridge

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.699 
big giant oval for eyes make the bridge
for<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.830> glasses<00:02:41.310> make<00:02:41.849> another<00:02:42.150> one<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:46.440> far

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
for the glasses make another one so far

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.920 
for the glasses make another one so far
that's<00:02:46.920> all<00:02:47.129> we<00:02:47.280> got<00:02:47.430> now<00:02:48.299> the<00:02:48.450> next<00:02:48.629> thing<00:02:48.810> is

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
that's all we got now the next thing is

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.960 
that's all we got now the next thing is
just<00:02:49.200> two<00:02:49.440> triangles<00:02:50.220> three<00:02:50.819> ears<00:02:52.610> like<00:02:53.610> a

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
just two triangles three ears like a

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.640 
just two triangles three ears like a
little<00:02:54.239> Ridge<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.780> remind<00:02:55.080> yourself<00:02:55.379> for<00:02:55.590> the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
little Ridge to remind yourself for the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.990 
little Ridge to remind yourself for the
top<00:02:55.830> of<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.040> head<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.370> you'll<00:02:56.580> see<00:02:56.790> why<00:02:56.940> this

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
top of the head and you'll see why this

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.880 
top of the head and you'll see why this
is<00:02:57.180> important<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:58.049> other<00:02:58.200> year<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.500> basically

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
is important the other year is basically

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.160 
is important the other year is basically
kind<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.160> hanging<00:02:59.310> off<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.849> hair<00:03:00.510> right<00:03:00.750> here

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
kind of hanging off the hair right here

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.120 
kind of hanging off the hair right here
so<00:03:01.590> there<00:03:02.459> you<00:03:02.579> go<00:03:03.140> next<00:03:04.140> part<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.769> spikes

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
so there you go next part is the spikes

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.030 
so there you go next part is the spikes
which<00:03:05.610> is<00:03:06.569> probably<00:03:07.410> one<00:03:07.829> of<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:07.980> easiest

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
which is probably one of the easiest

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.000 
which is probably one of the easiest
things<00:03:08.459> in<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.670> world<00:03:09.260> top<00:03:10.260> spike<00:03:10.650> just

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
things in the world top spike just

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.559 
things in the world top spike just
curves<00:03:11.220> over<00:03:11.519> a<00:03:11.670> bit<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.720> goes<00:03:12.870> down<00:03:14.569> those

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
curves over a bit it goes down those

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.020 
curves over a bit it goes down those
your<00:03:15.780> mil<00:03:16.019> spike<00:03:17.390> lower<00:03:18.390> spike<00:03:19.579> and<00:03:20.579> there<00:03:20.910> we

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
your mil spike lower spike and there we

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.839 
your mil spike lower spike and there we
go<00:03:21.120> we<00:03:21.269> gotta<00:03:21.420> head<00:03:21.629> already<00:03:22.700> once<00:03:23.700> you<00:03:23.819> have

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
go we gotta head already once you have

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.300 
go we gotta head already once you have
that<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.180> could<00:03:24.329> put<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.540> emotion<00:03:24.989> ball

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
that you could put the emotion ball

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.800 
that you could put the emotion ball
since<00:03:26.310> my<00:03:26.519> characters<00:03:26.970> really<00:03:27.180> trying<00:03:27.629> my

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
since my characters really trying my

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.680 
since my characters really trying my
actually<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.530> jog<00:03:29.209> so<00:03:30.209> there's<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:30.510> little

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
actually a jog so there's this little

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.250 
actually a jog so there's this little
chat<00:03:30.989> motion<00:03:31.530> ball<00:03:32.299> make<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.420> lines<00:03:33.690> because

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
chat motion ball make the lines because

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.180 
chat motion ball make the lines because
he's<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.530> speech<00:03:34.920> now<00:03:35.160> so<00:03:36.650> give<00:03:37.650> him<00:03:37.739> his<00:03:37.950> little

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
he's a speech now so give him his little

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.470 
he's a speech now so give him his little
Chow<00:03:38.430> parts<00:03:38.880> they<00:03:39.329> doesn't<00:03:40.019> lose<00:03:40.970> so<00:03:41.970> there<00:03:42.359> we

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
Chow parts they doesn't lose so there we

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.330 
Chow parts they doesn't lose so there we
go<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:42.690> can<00:03:42.959> outline<00:03:43.560> this<00:03:43.859> to<00:03:44.100> make<00:03:44.250> it

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
go you can outline this to make it

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.199 
go you can outline this to make it
thicker<00:03:44.670> make<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.299> more<00:03:45.510> noticeable<00:03:47.209> already

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
thicker make it more noticeable already

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.610 
thicker make it more noticeable already
we<00:03:48.329> have<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.599> head<00:03:48.750> which<00:03:48.989> is<00:03:49.019> probably<00:03:49.470> the

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
we have the head which is probably the

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.099 
we have the head which is probably the
hardest<00:03:49.709> part<00:03:50.160> there<00:03:50.880> comes<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.329> easier<00:03:51.690> part

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
hardest part there comes the easier part

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.920 
hardest part there comes the easier part
which<00:03:52.380> is<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.920> body<00:03:53.310> so<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.269> make<00:03:54.420> one<00:03:54.690> more

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
which is the body so you make one more

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.229 
which is the body so you make one more
but<00:03:55.290> little<00:03:55.889> version<00:03:56.280> of<00:03:56.370> spike<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:56.910> guess<00:03:57.090> I

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
but little version of spike I guess I

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.470 
but little version of spike I guess I
would<00:03:57.329> say<00:03:57.530> two<00:03:58.530> lines<00:03:58.799> I<00:03:59.250> suggest<00:04:00.180> doing<00:04:00.299> the

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
would say two lines I suggest doing the

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.170 
would say two lines I suggest doing the
arm<00:04:00.690> right<00:04:01.169> now<00:04:01.380> not<00:04:02.069> when<00:04:02.190> I<00:04:02.280> do<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.519> arm<00:04:02.669> I'm

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
arm right now not when I do the arm I'm

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.629 
arm right now not when I do the arm I'm
time<00:04:03.419> to<00:04:03.569> give<00:04:03.690> them<00:04:03.780> pose<00:04:04.280> ok<00:04:05.280> so<00:04:05.340> I'll<00:04:05.489> going

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
time to give them pose ok so I'll going

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.589 
time to give them pose ok so I'll going
to<00:04:05.760> post<00:04:05.940> this<00:04:06.180> time<00:04:07.669> but<00:04:08.669> I'm<00:04:08.819> just<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.359> little

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
to post this time but I'm just a little

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.740 
to post this time but I'm just a little
curving<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.319> line<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:11.209> stops<00:04:12.209> off<00:04:12.480> the

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
curving the line that stops off the

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.330 
curving the line that stops off the
gloves<00:04:13.079> which<00:04:13.319> were<00:04:13.470> like<00:04:13.620> two<00:04:13.799> circles

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
gloves which were like two circles

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.539 
gloves which were like two circles
smashing<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.209> each<00:04:15.299> other<00:04:15.979> tility<00:04:16.979> off

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
smashing to each other tility off

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.509 
smashing to each other tility off
circles<00:04:18.120> I<00:04:18.329> don't<00:04:18.539> know<00:04:19.130> that's<00:04:20.130> just<00:04:20.400> the

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
circles I don't know that's just the

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.839 
circles I don't know that's just the
easiest<00:04:20.789> way<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.000> describe<00:04:21.090> it<00:04:22.190> hands<00:04:23.190> might

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
easiest way to describe it hands might

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.520 
easiest way to describe it hands might
not<00:04:24.030> be<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.300> easiest<00:04:24.330> thing<00:04:24.720> for<00:04:24.840> most<00:04:25.169> people

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
not be the easiest thing for most people

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.950 
not be the easiest thing for most people
but<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:26.330> know

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
but you know

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.909 
but you know
they're<00:04:28.080> basically<00:04:28.650> little<00:04:29.750> like<00:04:30.750> ovals<00:04:31.440> that

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
they're basically little like ovals that

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.800 
they're basically little like ovals that
curve<00:04:32.190> around<00:04:32.430> that's<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.360> best<00:04:33.600> way<00:04:33.750> to

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
curve around that's the best way to

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.610 
curve around that's the best way to
describe<00:04:34.229> fingers<00:04:35.930> especially<00:04:36.930> for<00:04:37.110> cartoons

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
describe fingers especially for cartoons

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.980 
describe fingers especially for cartoons
cartoons<00:04:37.979> are<00:04:38.160> detailed<00:04:38.639> so<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.449> body<00:04:39.660> is<00:04:39.870> a

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
cartoons are detailed so the body is a
