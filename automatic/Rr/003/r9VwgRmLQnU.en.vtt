 It happened from us such a trouble I do not know 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:19.590
 pedals is an interesting thing but my 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.900
 character 1 of this is my second character 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.779
 for which my son plays here and the first 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.840
 my character is randomly somehow 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.030
 we know what the bug happened on the bed 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.510
 them or somewhere it means thrown out shorter 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.390
 my first my first character and not 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:50.129
 yes did not let me go under the first 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:53.879
 character but i went in it was possible to go under 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:58.800
 the second character is signed son press 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.469

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:08.280
 the garage is they are all mine 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:12.720
 besides this pegasus bate I like 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.950

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.600

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.600
 who does not believe can go under so 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.840
 choose another character 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:32.759
 and I did not show you this character 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.380
 this character 16 will soon be level 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.979
 but level 15 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.979

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.140

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:25.380
 interesting thing is also the exact same 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.800
 the same cars are exactly the same cars with this 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:35.370
 in the same color only on pegasus dad 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:38.030

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.030
 I will not get 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.300
 apparently some have been a failure on the 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:50.170
 server there something they flew 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:56.890

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.930

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.209
 Level 15 here look at it specifically 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.180
