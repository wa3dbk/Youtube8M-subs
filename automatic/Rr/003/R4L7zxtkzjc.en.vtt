00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.380
 hello girls i hope you 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.029
 I'm very happy about you 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.260
 find in a new video is 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.130
 as it could have seen in the title 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.750
 today I do not make you a 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.279
 a lot of games offered but essential 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.540
 manicure that I had on vacation with 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.680
 me we were so I showed you 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.420
 really what I bring with me when 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.739
 I go on vacation in summer we do not have 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.210
 necessarily want to bring too many things 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.500
 we already have enough with the clothes 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.790
 which still weighs quite heavy 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.199
 so here I am going to show you all 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.370
 little accessories that bring me what 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.449
 do a little bit of nail art but not 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.890
 too much because we do not want to 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.940
 enjoy the sea and the pool 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.230
 so here I leave you with the video 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.230
 and I hope you'll like it 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.890
 so the first thing that I you 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.210
 advise before leaving on vacation and 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.530
 a scrub of the hands like that you 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.329
 will not need to bring the pot 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.739
 in the suitcase I use the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.930
 scrubs of the one minute brand that 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.519
 are my favorite here I used one 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.869
 with vanilla this scrub contains 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.430
 moisturizing oils and sea salt 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.899
 dead and so it's very simple I'm going 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.130
 start by mixing a little bit the 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.479
 scrub and I'm going to take a 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.280
 teaspoon that I'm going to place at 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.690
 hollow of my hand I will then rub 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.369
 gently my hands between them in 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.070
 insisting on cuticles and 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.330
 dry areas 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.740
 Then I just rinse with water 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.210
 warm and I will try my hands in 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.590
 a clean towel is very 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.940
 important to make a scrub before 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.679
 go to the sun to have a nice 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.319
 uniform tan that will last you longer 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.819
 long time 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:34.560
 if you ever go to the sun the very 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.090
 important to moisturize to protect your 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.500
 skin so when you put the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.880
 sunscreen do not forget to insist 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.500
 on hands that have just as much 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.860
 need that the rest of the body if not 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.030
 more 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.289
 since the skin of the hands is 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.289
 particularly thin and fragile 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.680
 in the evening do not forget to apply the 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.180
 hand cream the sea ​​or the 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.590
 pool dries a lot of skin so 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.510
 do not forget to rehydrate it 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.100
 after that is and I really like used 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.020
 the gourmet cream from caudalie who 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.220
 was offered to me by my friend Cathy when 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.660
 it's hot we do not necessarily want 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.580
 a texture that is too rich or too 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.110
 heavy and this one's perfect texture 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.929
 is fluid and light and in addition they 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.490
 are superb we are and I noticed 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.110
 that my nails push him a lot more 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.550
 quickly with the sun and the heat is 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.350
 so the ideal time if you want you 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.580
 to grow nails and for that you 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.410
 can bring from it the cuticle 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.330
 I particularly like those with monoi 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.800
 from adam cosmetics and flasks 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.150
 of this title are just perfect for 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.010
 the holidays since they are very small 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.180
 which slips everywhere I 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.950
 apply a drop on my cuticles 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.810
 that I have nail polish or not and I 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.190
 am going to do a little massage in circles and 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.480
 if you ever want more advice 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.100
 to grow nails I 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.610
 you will put my video about it in 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.610
 annotations 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.210
 I also advise you to bring 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.890
 a nail file when you go out 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.180
 holidays we often do activities at 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.710
 the beach that can chipped or 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.970
 split at a tab often it's worth 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.440
 better to limay right away the little one 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.630
 nail tip rather than playing with and 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.890
 to end up snatching everything up imagine that 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.270
 white of what I want to talk about 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.860
 you can sleuth them as your nails 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.600
 either varnish or not but still in the 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.560
 same meaning and with a slug and 12 like 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.060
 I say in my routine video Manipur 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.230
 to remove your nail polish or nail 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.880
 art on vacation I advise you 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.960
 to opt for a foam remover so 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.430
 for those who would not know 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.170
 it's a pot in which there is a 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.940
 foam soaked with solvent is drilled at 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.530
 middle to place his finger there we go 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.910
 then turn the flap around 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.560
 and the polish will go in a few 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.270
 seconds it's really more convenient 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.740
 of a big bottle of solvent 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.060
 and cottons and if ever you do 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.440
 an alarm you can clean your 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.440
 brushes directly into the foam 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.040
 another essential product for me 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.810
 on vacation is to bring a base and 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.610
 a 2 in 1 top coat is a nail polish 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.959
 serves as a base as well as a top coat 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.519
 and it avoids bringing two flasks 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.049
 separate you can use it to 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.909
 your manicure but also to extend 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.590
 holding a nail polish when you do 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.599
 activities it's the most 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.340
 external varnish that erodes first 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.690
 if you add a layer of top coat 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.280
 everyday is this layer 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.849
 who will line up first and not 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.849
 your manicure 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.680
 varnish side no need to bring 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.540
 too often we tend to take 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.010
 too many things with you here everything depends 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.360
 the number of days you leave 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.830
 but if you bring two or three 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.030
 colors of you favorite color this 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.470
 will be more than enough 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.269
 I show you here a small selection 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.050
 of colors that I love wearing in summer 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.050
 with my proposed 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.170
 and here is my small selection of colors 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.760
 for the summer that I'm going to put in my 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:41.560
 kit when I go on vacation 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.000
 I really try to enjoy it for myself 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.440
 rest and I often only have a simple 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.880
 nail polish but I always bring 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.260
 with me some water boards 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.580
 shifts have for those who do not 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.650
 would not know these are kind of 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.450
 decals with water for the nails and 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.160
 it's really super easy and fast to 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.480
 apply there are plenty of 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.420
 models and I propose hundreds 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.830
 on my shop because I love it 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.120
 to use them nothing more simple I 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.470
 begins by first applying my 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.730
 nail polish in two layers but 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.290
 you can of course apply them on 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.030
 an old polish and once that is 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.040
 dry i'm going to cut out a row of 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.810
 motives and I'm going soaked back and forth 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.280
 in simple water the water is going 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.680
 actually allow to dilute the glue 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.090
 between the pattern and the paper for the 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.560
 little trick I always put a little 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.270
 little water on my nail before asking 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.800
 the water shifts so in their place 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.030
 is exactly where I want and that's 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.440
 really favor it over 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.480
 stickers or once these collets on 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.980
 can not do anything anymore I will then mop up 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.950
 the excess of water with a tissue I'm going 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.030
 do the same especially my other nails 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.230
 which is also practical with the 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.820
 water shifts is that you can do 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.500
 your tomorrow exactly the same without 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.850
 problem unlike the art or it's 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.670
 a little more complicated with the hand 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.440
 with which you do not write it does not 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.030
 I just have to apply my top 2 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.530
 in 1 and do not worry about the water 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.530
 shifts very well with solvent 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.529
 in bonus you made a little 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.999
 selection of nail art accessories to 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:58.319
 bring if you ever think you have the 

00:05:56.999 --> 00:06:00.149
 time to do a little bit of nail art 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.739
 so we start with the doping tool which 

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:03.389
 you will do much more than this 

00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:04.619
 that you can think if you ever 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.389
 look at my videos you have to see it 

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:07.679
 very often if you do not have one 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.749
 can also use a head 

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:11.219
 pinned it works just as well you 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:13.019
 can also bring a fine brush 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:13.379
 which will allow you to make small 

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:15.179
 drawings 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:16.709
 I also bring a foam sponge 

00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:17.069
 to make pretty gradient on my 

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:18.629
 nails 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.249

 video in info bar and finally very 

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:30.059
 important never a small palette in 

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:32.039
 plastic to be able to put the drops

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.389
 thought 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:46.619
 in any case for me it's not all about 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:47.789
 following the holidays do not hesitate to me 

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:49.199
 say in the comments if you go 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:50.219
 leave a little bit and you would do it 

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.209
 very pleasure to know it 

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:52.979
 I give you an appointment Wednesday 

00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:54.119
 next for a new video from here 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:56.599
 there take care of you I kiss you 

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:56.599
 very strong
