lettuce we have this red type and then

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:01.740 
lettuce we have this red type and then
also<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:59.590> have<00:01:00.280> some<00:01:00.609> Bibb<00:01:00.820> lettuce<00:01:01.030> in<00:01:01.390> there<00:01:01.539> I

also I have some Bibb lettuce in there I

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.900 
also I have some Bibb lettuce in there I
like<00:01:02.469> mixing<00:01:02.649> them<00:01:02.949> together<00:01:03.010> it<00:01:03.699> tastes

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
like mixing them together it tastes

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.600 
like mixing them together it tastes
pretty<00:01:04.030> good<00:01:04.180> together

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610

Joe<00:01:06.610> this<00:01:06.790> is<00:01:06.939> after<00:01:07.240> about<00:01:08.400> three<00:01:09.400> weeks<00:01:09.640> or

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
Joe this is after about three weeks or

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.399 
Joe this is after about three weeks or
so<00:01:10.000> that's<00:01:10.270> how<00:01:10.420> much<00:01:10.600> lettuce<00:01:10.930> we<00:01:11.049> got<00:01:11.200> out<00:01:11.380> of

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
so that's how much lettuce we got out of

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.429 
so that's how much lettuce we got out of
it<00:01:11.619> these<00:01:12.250> plants<00:01:12.549> will<00:01:12.670> grow<00:01:12.790> back

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
it these plants will grow back

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.999 
it these plants will grow back
relatively<00:01:14.439> quickly

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
relatively quickly

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.219

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.160 
aquaponic system so I'll show you guys
how<00:01:18.820> much<00:01:19.259> grows<00:01:20.259> out<00:01:20.439> of<00:01:20.470> that<00:01:21.930> another<00:01:22.930> thing

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
aquaponics system that I have sitting in

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.319 
aquaponics system that I have sitting in
my<00:01:31.240> window<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:33.310> this<00:01:33.460> tank<00:01:33.729> I've<00:01:33.909> been<00:01:34.060> having

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
my window so this tank I've been having

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.960 
my window so this tank I've been having
some<00:01:34.479> issues<00:01:34.810> with<00:01:34.840> algae<00:01:35.500> buildup<00:01:36.250> in<00:01:36.729> the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
some issues with algae buildup in the

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.990 
some issues with algae buildup in the
grow<00:01:37.210> bed<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.659> also<00:01:37.780> in<00:01:38.079> the<00:01:38.170> tank<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:39.520> don't

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
grow bed and also in the tank I don't

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.120 
grow bed and also in the tank I don't
think<00:01:40.299> that<00:01:40.509> the<00:01:40.930> fish<00:01:41.259> in<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.590> shrimp<00:01:41.920> are

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
think that the fish in the shrimp are

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.060 
think that the fish in the shrimp are
producing<00:01:42.579> enough<00:01:43.229> waste<00:01:44.229> for<00:01:44.590> these<00:01:44.740> plants

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
producing enough waste for these plants

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.450 
producing enough waste for these plants
they're<00:01:45.430> looking<00:01:45.790> kind<00:01:46.329> of<00:01:46.479> stringy<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.460> not

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
they're looking kind of stringy and not

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.170 
they're looking kind of stringy and not
the<00:01:48.969> healthiest<00:01:49.509> I've<00:01:49.750> ever<00:01:49.810> seen<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.850> know<00:01:51.939> I

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
the healthiest I've ever seen you know I

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.789 
the healthiest I've ever seen you know I
checked<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.780> water<00:01:52.990> just<00:01:53.259> to<00:01:53.380> make<00:01:53.409> sure<00:01:53.649> it's

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
checked the water just to make sure it's

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.620 
checked the water just to make sure it's
okay<00:01:54.040> for<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.280> fish<00:01:54.520> but<00:01:54.820> I<00:01:54.850> really<00:01:55.270> am<00:01:55.420> NOT

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
okay for the fish but I really am NOT

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.740 
okay for the fish but I really am NOT
expecting<00:01:56.140> this<00:01:57.009> system<00:01:57.579> to<00:01:57.789> put<00:01:58.090> out<00:01:58.240> too

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
expecting this system to put out too

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.039 
expecting this system to put out too
much<00:01:58.960> in<00:01:59.350> terms<00:01:59.530> of<00:01:59.770> vegetables<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:01.780> we'll

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
much in terms of vegetables but we'll

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.590 
much in terms of vegetables but we'll
see<00:02:02.170> how<00:02:02.289> it<00:02:02.409> goes<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:03.549> don't<00:02:04.119> think<00:02:04.299> the<00:02:04.360> lights

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
see how it goes I don't think the lights

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.770 
see how it goes I don't think the lights
actually<00:02:04.899> enough<00:02:05.320> for<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.649> plants<00:02:05.979> either

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
actually enough for the plants either

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.010 
actually enough for the plants either
but<00:02:07.780> we'll<00:02:08.020> say<00:02:09.300> see<00:02:11.010> here<00:02:12.010> is<00:02:12.310> my<00:02:12.730> big<00:02:13.300> into

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.280 
plants are doing very well they really
like<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.290> grow<00:02:42.220> light<00:02:42.460> that<00:02:42.640> I'm<00:02:42.760> using<00:02:43.290> and

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
like the grow light that I'm using and

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.090 
like the grow light that I'm using and
the<00:02:44.740> water<00:02:45.520> parameters<00:02:46.320> have<00:02:47.320> been<00:02:47.350> doing

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
the water parameters have been doing

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.320 
the water parameters have been doing
fine<00:02:48.400> for<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.730> fish<00:02:48.970> as<00:02:49.150> well<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:52.000> it's

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
fine for the fish as well so it's

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.730 
fine for the fish as well so it's
getting<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.600> be<00:02:52.660> about<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:53.170> time<00:02:53.230> what<00:02:53.680> I'm

cleaned<00:03:57.010> for<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.310> fish<00:03:57.520> so<00:03:57.880> it's<00:03:58.150> pretty

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
cleaned for the fish so it's pretty
