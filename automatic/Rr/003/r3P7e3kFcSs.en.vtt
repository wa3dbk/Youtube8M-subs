I think that they'll be pretty great on
the<00:01:08.550> water<00:01:09.530> when<00:01:10.530> you're<00:01:10.650> matching<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.160> hatch

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
the water when you're matching the hatch

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.220 
the water when you're matching the hatch

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
the earth tones of these flies compared

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.040 
the earth tones of these flies compared
to<00:01:13.350> real<00:01:14.010> bugs<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.790> world<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.510> the<00:01:15.540> real<00:01:15.720> wide

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
to real bugs in a world in the real wide

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.970 
to real bugs in a world in the real wide
world<00:01:16.670> are<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.730> little<00:01:18.060> bit<00:01:18.300> different<00:01:18.510> I

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
world are a little bit different I

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.010 
world are a little bit different I
wouldn't<00:01:19.980> exactly<00:01:20.100> say<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.610> all<00:01:20.940> these<00:01:21.150> look

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
wouldn't exactly say that all these look

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.990
