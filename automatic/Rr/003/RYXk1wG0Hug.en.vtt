well<00:05:03.230> that<00:05:03.350> was<00:05:03.470> fun<00:05:03.710> for<00:05:04.010> the<00:05:04.100> most<00:05:04.310> part

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
well that was fun for the most part

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.800 
well that was fun for the most part
minus<00:05:05.570> the<00:05:05.900> random<00:05:06.350> bits<00:05:06.830> of<00:05:07.040> anger<00:05:07.810> can't

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
minus the random bits of anger can't

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.360 
minus the random bits of anger can't
imagine<00:05:09.170> playing<00:05:09.350> that<00:05:09.530> on<00:05:09.650> hard<00:05:09.920> that<00:05:10.220> was

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
imagine playing that on hard that was

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.400 
imagine playing that on hard that was
the<00:05:10.520> challenge<00:05:10.760> just<00:05:11.330> enough<00:05:11.600> by<00:05:11.780> itself<00:05:11.810> i

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
the challenge just enough by itself i

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.410 
the challenge just enough by itself i
might<00:05:15.410> play<00:05:15.560> on<00:05:15.680> hard<00:05:16.040> every<00:05:16.940> now<00:05:17.060> and<00:05:17.270> then

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
might play on hard every now and then

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.720 
might play on hard every now and then
just<00:05:17.780> for<00:05:17.990> a<00:05:18.020> laugh<00:05:18.400> that<00:05:19.400> it's<00:05:19.550> gonna<00:05:19.670> be

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
just for a laugh that it's gonna be

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.980 
just for a laugh that it's gonna be
recorded<00:05:20.270> though<00:05:20.360> i<00:05:22.600> played<00:05:23.600> through<00:05:23.780> like

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
recorded though i played through like

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.130 
recorded though i played through like
the<00:05:24.020> first<00:05:24.530> two<00:05:24.740> levels<00:05:24.920> on<00:05:25.220> heart<00:05:25.490> it's<00:05:25.700> just

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
the first two levels on heart it's just

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.070 
the first two levels on heart it's just
extra<00:05:27.140> enemies<00:05:27.590> and<00:05:28.480> maybe<00:05:29.480> more<00:05:29.750> damage

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
extra enemies and maybe more damage

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.510 
extra enemies and maybe more damage
probably<00:05:30.680> more<00:05:30.830> damage<00:05:31.130> that<00:05:31.310> would<00:05:31.400> make

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
probably more damage that would make

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.959 
probably more damage that would make
sense

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:33.969 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:36.689 

yeah<00:05:34.599> this<00:05:34.719> games<00:05:34.959> pretty<00:05:35.079> short<00:05:35.769> overall<00:05:36.279> to

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
yeah this games pretty short overall to

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:38.519 
yeah this games pretty short overall to
think<00:05:36.879> about<00:05:37.119> it<00:05:37.269> even<00:05:37.749> though<00:05:37.989> this<00:05:38.110> is<00:05:38.259> part

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:38.529 
think about it even though this is part

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:41.279 
think about it even though this is part
probably<00:05:38.769> like<00:05:39.039> 35<00:05:39.669> because<00:05:40.569> I<00:05:40.689> failed<00:05:41.019> so

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
probably like 35 because I failed so

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.639 
probably like 35 because I failed so
miserably<00:05:42.599> but<00:05:43.599> i<00:05:43.659> might<00:05:44.079> do<00:05:44.289> super

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:44.649 
miserably but i might do super

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:47.939 
miserably but i might do super
castlevania<00:05:45.249> for<00:05:46.139> since<00:05:47.139> that's<00:05:47.379> pretty<00:05:47.769> much

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:47.949 
castlevania for since that's pretty much

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:51.899 
castlevania for since that's pretty much
similar<00:05:48.849> to<00:05:49.029> this<00:05:50.279> but<00:05:51.279> that<00:05:51.429> one's<00:05:51.610> quite<00:05:51.849> a

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:51.909 
similar to this but that one's quite a

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:56.009 
similar to this but that one's quite a
bit<00:05:52.089> longer<00:05:52.329> or<00:05:53.879> i<00:05:54.879> could<00:05:55.119> do<00:05:55.389> simply<00:05:55.749> the

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:56.019 
bit longer or i could do simply the

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:57.809 
bit longer or i could do simply the
night<00:05:56.199> I<00:05:56.439> will<00:05:56.619> do<00:05:56.889> that<00:05:56.919> sometime<00:05:57.519> for<00:05:57.759> sure

00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:57.819 
night I will do that sometime for sure

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:02.850 
night I will do that sometime for sure
