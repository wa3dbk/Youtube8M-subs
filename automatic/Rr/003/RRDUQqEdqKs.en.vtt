00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
was just reading was talking about

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.440 
was just reading was talking about
having<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:26.610> hold<00:01:27.240> bananas<00:01:28.049> after<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> workout

having to hold bananas after a workout

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.749

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
I guess we can assume that multiplying

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.590 
I guess we can assume that multiplying
that<00:01:35.670> by<00:01:36.079> 10<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.439> probably<00:01:38.130> even<00:01:38.340> better<00:01:38.670> we're

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
that by 10 is probably even better we're

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.210 
that by 10 is probably even better we're
not<00:01:39.720> going<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.930> have<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> 20<00:01:40.500> banana<00:01:40.770> smoothie
