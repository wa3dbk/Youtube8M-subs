carat and platinum at the time I'm
shooting<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:29.789> video<00:00:29.939> gold<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.810> considered

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
shooting this video gold is considered

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.469 
shooting this video gold is considered
more<00:00:31.650> valuable<00:00:31.710> by<00:00:32.340> ounce<00:00:32.579> than<00:00:32.879> platinum

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:33.479 
more valuable by ounce than platinum

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:36.349 
more valuable by ounce than platinum
however<00:00:34.229> 18<00:00:35.039> carat<00:00:35.339> gold<00:00:35.370> will<00:00:35.819> always<00:00:35.850> be

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:36.359 
however 18 carat gold will always be

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:39.649 
however 18 carat gold will always be
less<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:37.019> cost<00:00:37.829> than<00:00:38.549> the<00:00:38.670> exact<00:00:39.030> same<00:00:39.269> ring<00:00:39.510> in

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:39.659

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:43.789 
less in cost than the exact same ring in
platinum<00:00:40.079> here's<00:00:41.039> one<00:00:41.249> reason<00:00:41.399> why<00:00:42.289> gold<00:00:43.289> spot

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:43.799

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:46.369 
platinum here's one reason why gold spot
price<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.399> alloyed<00:00:44.999> down<00:00:45.389> to<00:00:45.629> 18<00:00:45.959> carat<00:00:46.260> so

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
price is alloyed down to 18 carat so

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.020 
price is alloyed down to 18 carat so
you're<00:00:46.499> actually<00:00:46.799> buying<00:00:46.920> less<00:00:47.280> gold<00:00:47.549> 18

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
you're actually buying less gold 18

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.029 
you're actually buying less gold 18
carat<00:00:48.389> gold<00:00:48.420> which<00:00:49.409> is<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.649> standard<00:00:49.859> for

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039

the<00:00:54.780> rest<00:00:54.959> is<00:00:55.079> alloy<00:00:55.489> but<00:00:56.690> platinum<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.869> much

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
the rest is alloy but platinum is much

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.309 
the rest is alloy but platinum is much
denser<00:00:58.529> than<00:00:59.010> gold<00:00:59.279> is<00:00:59.489> 18<00:01:00.449> carat<00:01:00.779> gold<00:01:00.809> has<00:01:01.289> a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
practical application if you have a ring

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.139 
practical application if you have a ring
that's<00:01:25.020> five<00:01:25.500> grams<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.219> 18<00:01:26.549> carat<00:01:26.909> white<00:01:27.090> gold

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
that's five grams of 18 carat white gold

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.770 
that's five grams of 18 carat white gold
in<00:01:27.840> platinum<00:01:28.649> it'll<00:01:29.039> weigh<00:01:29.159> about<00:01:29.369> 7<00:01:29.789> grams<00:01:30.030> so

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
in platinum it'll weigh about 7 grams so

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.620 
in platinum it'll weigh about 7 grams so
it<00:01:31.229> will<00:01:31.409> always<00:01:31.770> cost<00:01:32.070> more<00:01:32.280> platinum<00:01:33.060> but

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
it will always cost more platinum but

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.620 
it will always cost more platinum but
there's<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.869> reason<00:01:34.369> platinum<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.520> most<00:01:36.149> often

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
there's a reason platinum is most often

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.200 
there's a reason platinum is most often
a<00:01:36.780> better<00:01:36.960> choice<00:01:37.320> than<00:01:37.350> white<00:01:37.740> gold<00:01:38.210> here's

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
a better choice than white gold here's

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.450 
a better choice than white gold here's
why<00:01:39.679> second<00:01:40.679> difference<00:01:40.950> between<00:01:41.009> them

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
why second difference between them

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.859 
why second difference between them
ductility<00:01:43.280> platinum<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.399> very<00:01:44.579> ductile<00:01:45.030> it

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
ductility platinum is very ductile it

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.419 
ductility platinum is very ductile it
has<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> lot<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.380> give<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:47.009> it's<00:01:47.280> actually

has a lot of give to it it's actually
pretty<00:01:47.939> soft<00:01:48.390> you'll<00:01:48.780> find<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.289> satin

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
pretty soft you'll find that a satin

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.609 
pretty soft you'll find that a satin
finish<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.130> platinum<00:01:50.490> will<00:01:51.060> get<00:01:51.929> closer<00:01:52.289> to<00:01:52.590> a

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
finish on platinum will get closer to a

Platinum<00:01:58.109> is<00:01:58.319> soft<00:01:58.740> but<00:01:59.159> because<00:01:59.609> of

00:01:59.629 --> 00:01:59.639 
Platinum is soft but because of

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:02.080 
Platinum is soft but because of
