00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.900
 so he is a stefan of mobile and not 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.700
 selectable so that's a sad thing 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.960
 but it was worth it here 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.220
 also something to stand up 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.710
 to look because there are new ones here 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.240
 platform infiniti and that's easy 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.039
 another track better than the padfone 2 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.150
 from enstar and it feels too 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.710
 again best different quality 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.740
 already handles this easily 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.500
 a little bit more soja the new ipad from 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.329
 infiniti of asus yes that is in principle 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.469
 the third edition, however, replaced 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.600
 you do not have the second edition we have 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.950
 here just explained but the ipad 2 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.670
 will continue to be quite normal 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.870
 be the market 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.010
 because this device is still a bit 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.829
 higher set as you can see, however 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.930
 also at the price for 999 euros 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.840
 that is the ufop e if the device is in the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.270
 early q2 yes here in europe too 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.980
 is likely to come on the market 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.690
 that is already quite nice 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.030
 hefty price, however, get for it 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.620
 also a lot offered by both 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.070
 designers so the whole device is 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.739
 extremely thin now 89 mm thin the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.090
 but just works really elegant that 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.010
 I think it must be really chic 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.930
 I say the total processing 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.549
 very good and above all what you want 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.860
 also the back side has to say that 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.180
 is no longer plastic as well as it 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.100
 just before been times than now 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.299
 I know that, too 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.170
 It could not sound that way 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.420
 high quality but it feels right 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.490
 Well, everything is like metal with metal, of course 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.369
 always that's what it allegedly stems from 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.820
 somehow from the aircraft industry 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.920
 aviation industry 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.810
 well it will be good in any case 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.220
 and he looks very good here too 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.360
 this platform logo for example that 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.619
 is an nfc antenna 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.909
 So you also have over 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.619
 little things 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.149
 let in and get into it 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.319
 come up with some raffinesses so 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.450
 I'm definitely still the device 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.179
 times as the predecessor of the very first 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.350
 padfone newer so a bit yes 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.490
 a bit criticized I think 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.590
 also because it's a bit like that 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.600
 Plastics came over for good 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.490
 Carefully express 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.109
 this device further advantage or one 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.909
 another change is now with 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:00.390
 a 5 inch display full equipped 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.020
 hd that is 1920 x 1080 pixels that is 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.479
 really hot 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.560
 The display also has extremely high 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.090
 viewing angle 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.750
 so speaks 178 degrees yes weitwinkel 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.730
 and 400 with brightness also already one 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.530
 whole lot 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.760
 I have to say it now 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.870
 measured or I can of course tell 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.340
 I measure but is actually sees 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.540
 Everything looks pretty good, of course 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.019
 Anyway, that he is not a sore at the time 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.680
 resolution 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.120
 but yes the brightness I sit there 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.590
 There is nothing to complain about 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.819
 I really like everything pretty much 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.879
 good for the necessary power in this 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.739
 device ensures a quad core processor 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.019
 and while that is in the chat of two 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.590
 years still you because it is pro was with 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:48.299
 1 5 gigahertz it is now the new one here 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.790
 qualcomm s 600 with 1 7 ghz 2 gigabytes 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.840
 ram are also present and which ensures halt 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.970
 just for a really high 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.380
 speed you have the padfone 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.599
 back then in the bed of 2 1 out 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.419
 came there at least in the short term 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:03.209
 briefly list new benchmark or 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:04.349
 Best marks set and I guess 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.090
 the device will not even here 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.010
 badly cut off in the end though 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.930
 No matter how they are now what I am here 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.489
 could see the device is absolute 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.609
 liquid what I show here right now 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.720
 is the camera 3 10 megapixel this too 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.859
 Of course, it has always been improved 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.060
 There is a higher trigger 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.280
 speed i can in full 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.989
 3 10 megapixel resolution approximately 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.569
 shoot eight frames per second so 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.889
 says that is the measure of all at the moment 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.750
 Things so faster that currently makes 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:30.750
 no competitor that may be 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.639
 because, for example, htc one comes 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.200
 at higher rates so over ten per 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.980
 but then not anymore 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.420
 in full resolution 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.090
 or certainly not in 3 10 megapixels 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.970
 resolution because the HTC has just 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.750
 four megapixels the club is on the device 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.280
 yes still 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.330
 and that's why it's certainly 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.950
 a bit more expensive than others 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.840
 smartphones that one still here 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.360
 tablet lures it has we have 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.269
 Now I have 10 here in my hand 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.129
 1 inch and another act of course 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.989
 Implement the device if you like 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.180
 so if the smartphone itself 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.069
 you put it in here next to it 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:09.180
 The resolution of these 10 1 inch 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:09.180
 display is now here at 1920x 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.940
 1080 hd but that you know already 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.169
 from definitely pad for example and there 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.190
 So it's not just the name itself 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.299
 It's a bit similar now 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.199
 just a little bit here and there 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.880
 just try that with a hand 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.440
 smartphone as well as me 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.169
 so also planned is this mechanism 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.940
 The principle has been adopted by the 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:35.530
 of infiniti qx 14 format before and 2 and 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.460
 yes keeps quite well and of course 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.260
 simply still all a bit 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.610
 high quality as I said there probably 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.470
 really very much 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.060
 looks identical but that does not matter 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.500
 because that has actually the ipad 2 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.250
 often disturbed and did not work there 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.250
 how cheap or something 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.919
 the advantage or the joke is that yes 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.770
 Man, as I said everything that you what you something 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.910
 here with the one with the smartphone one can 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.810
 then stop just number again 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:04.090
 bigger here on the huge display 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.800
 and implicit of the 21 solution i have 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.700
 does not need to sync data though 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.229
 Of course it can because there is 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.180
 of course, as always, 50 megabytes 1 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.130
 gigabyte for two years from asus for the 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.450
 but I do not have to do it 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.889
 because I have all the data almost always 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.539
 even with a device on one 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.330
 smartphone and change so to speak 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:21.669
 all this through namely with 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.260
 Memory in the big tablet for 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.639
 example 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.260
 and apropos memory I have 64 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.940
 gigabytes that are not extended 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.720
 but i think 64 gigabytes can 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.010
 you're a bit over there 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.910
 replacement 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.370
 460 he wanted then I think I already 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.890
 quite enough if everyone on 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.460
 The market comes directly with it 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.080
 Android for his android 4.2 jelly bean 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.390
 be equipped 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:47.170
 and yes, that's just the moment 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:50.870
 latest version, there are still various 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:52.310
 small software innovations under it 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.400
 another new version of nord with 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.470
 Two good things went well 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.670
 is a demonstration device where the rum around 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.800
 You can and must play 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.940
 then look in the test if it will be synonymous 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.130
 still similar to such minor quirks 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.050
 had or did have that has quite that 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.310
 Padfone 1 and 2 also at least on 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.100
 at the beginning various updates 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.050
 there is still renovation is 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.390
 here asus eco you can see here 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.390
 this is voice function so i can 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.950
 then by voice for example photos 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.560
 trigger or tell him that it is her 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.190
 should choose the one piece of news or 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.960
 innovations 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.730
 otherwise you did not so much 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.890
 Visually, the surface is pretty 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.110
 identical 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.670
 yes, I have to say that's me 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.170
 padfone infiniti already a pretty 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.640
 cool thing i found this this one 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.700
 general idea has always been pretty good 

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.600
 because I have two individual solutions the 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.640
 actually until now always one 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.830
 was a bit cheaper than for example 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.500
 comparatively single solutions so 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.370
 speak a high-quality smartphone and 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:50.660
 just stop on a high quality 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.680
 high-quality tablet at 999 euro uvp is 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.490
 of course, unfortunately now at all 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.110
 not the case anymore 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.810
 there you have to look if that is now 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.910
 still somehow yes 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.950
 Still, the question is like me 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.870
 itself provide the technical equipment 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.669
 is great there are big display 5 inches 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.010
 the smartphone is very high resolution 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:07.600
 full hd a lot of memory old super 

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:10.690
 fast processor with the s 600 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.389
 but so far at least 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:15.460
 a main argument more with the price 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:15.940
 because this 2 in 1 solution for the price of 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.860
 one 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.230
 what is not more like a walk now 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.480
 possible otherwise I am very curious 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.130
 on the test because I like it in itself 

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.050
 Keeping said very good is easy too 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.550
 optically high quality of the quality of 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.350
 the quality of advice something again 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:32.440
 more and above all the choice of materials 

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:35.020
 So strong piece of what it delivers here 

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.229
 unfortunately also to a strong partly me 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.460
 Let's just wait and see 

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:41.590
 so far until the next video 

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:44.130
 otherwise you will always find that, of course 

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:47.130
 but see us and channel from rmb or 

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.130
