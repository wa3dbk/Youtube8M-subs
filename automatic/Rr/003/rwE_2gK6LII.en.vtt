something new so in typical pulse'
attitude<00:01:01.809> we<00:01:02.379> wanted<00:01:02.710> to<00:01:02.770> set<00:01:02.980> a<00:01:03.250> new

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
attitude we wanted to set a new

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.760 
attitude we wanted to set a new
benchmark<00:01:03.850> that<00:01:04.300> let's<00:01:05.170> create<00:01:05.410> a<00:01:05.619> new

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
benchmark that let's create a new

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.030 
benchmark that let's create a new
digital<00:01:06.160> property<00:01:06.729> that<00:01:07.570> our<00:01:07.780> riders<00:01:08.140> haven't

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
digital property that our riders haven't

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.670 
digital property that our riders haven't
the<00:01:09.130> puzzle<00:01:09.640> of<00:01:09.760> us<00:01:09.910> would<00:01:10.119> love<00:01:10.600> using<00:01:10.810> which

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
the puzzle of us would love using which

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.749 
the puzzle of us would love using which
would<00:01:11.800> become<00:01:11.890> part<00:01:12.130> of<00:01:12.220> the<00:01:12.310> lights<00:01:12.520> and

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
would become part of the lights and

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.690 
would become part of the lights and
which<00:01:12.940> they<00:01:13.060> will<00:01:13.180> talk<00:01:13.330> about<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.460> we<00:01:15.550> just

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
which they will talk about so we just

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.100 
which they will talk about so we just
thought<00:01:15.910> maybe<00:01:16.150> we<00:01:16.300> could<00:01:16.540> do<00:01:16.690> something

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
thought maybe we could do something

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.930 
thought maybe we could do something
interesting<00:01:17.350> this<00:01:17.770> time<00:01:18.040> taking<00:01:18.490> stunts

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
interesting this time taking stunts

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.440 
interesting this time taking stunts
taking<00:01:19.840> Internet<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.590> also<00:01:20.979> taking<00:01:21.369> film<00:01:21.820> as

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
taking Internet and also taking film as

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.560 
taking Internet and also taking film as
a<00:01:22.509> sort<00:01:22.900> of<00:01:22.960> medium<00:01:23.380> we<00:01:23.530> decided<00:01:23.950> to<00:01:24.070> use

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
a sort of medium we decided to use

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.830 
a sort of medium we decided to use
create<00:01:25.570> alphabets<00:01:26.259> from<00:01:27.000> burn<00:01:28.000> outs<00:01:28.270> which

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
create alphabets from burn outs which

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.540 
create alphabets from burn outs which
means<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.259> motorcycle<00:01:29.860> would<00:01:29.979> do<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.280> typical

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
means the motorcycle would do a typical

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.029 
means the motorcycle would do a typical
stunt<00:01:31.149> and<00:01:31.420> create<00:01:31.810> an<00:01:31.960> alphabet<00:01:32.440> you<00:01:32.800> know<00:01:32.890> as

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
stunt and create an alphabet you know as

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.710 
stunt and create an alphabet you know as
a<00:01:33.100> combination<00:01:33.729> of<00:01:33.789> these<00:01:33.970> tons<00:01:34.300> we<00:01:34.509> could

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
a combination of these tons we could

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:48.630 
a combination of these tons we could
actually<00:01:34.869> spell<00:01:35.350> out<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:37.119> idea

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:02:11.449 

the<00:01:49.640> stunt<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.090> we<00:01:50.570> have<00:01:50.660> attracted<00:01:51.080> it

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.699 

some<00:02:12.209> part<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.840> like<00:02:13.019> once<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.440> type

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
some part of it is like once you type

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.460 
some part of it is like once you type
the<00:02:13.860> message<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:15.300> get<00:02:15.480> these<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:16.110> bunch<00:02:16.349> of

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
the message you get these a bunch of

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.830 
the message you get these a bunch of
bikers<00:02:16.760> doing<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:17.819> amazing<00:02:18.090> stance<00:02:18.599> to

two GoPros shooting perspective this was
one<00:02:56.849> of<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.000> best<00:02:57.150> location<00:02:57.540> for<00:02:57.569> but<00:02:58.260> for<00:02:58.500> us

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
one of the best location for but for us

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.039 
one of the best location for but for us
it<00:02:59.129> is<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.640> booth<00:02:59.790> location<00:03:00.329> to<00:03:00.510> do<00:03:00.629> some<00:03:00.870> zone

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
it is the booth location to do some zone

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.440 
it is the booth location to do some zone
because<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.379> surface<00:03:01.709> is<00:03:01.739> so<00:03:01.860> slippery<00:03:02.450> that

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
because the surface is so slippery that

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.180 
because the surface is so slippery that
means<00:03:03.660> we<00:03:03.810> do<00:03:03.930> not<00:03:04.079> get<00:03:04.290> any<00:03:04.650> kind<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:05.010> traction

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
means we do not get any kind of traction

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.589 
means we do not get any kind of traction

for the tires to perform you have to

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.259 
for the tires to perform you have to
decide<00:03:07.280> but<00:03:08.280> fortunately<00:03:08.670> is<00:03:08.879> reported<00:03:09.180> by

the production team they were ready with

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.949 
the production team they were ready with
everything<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.879> that's<00:03:12.239> how<00:03:12.390> we<00:03:12.450> pulled<00:03:12.870> off

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
everything so that's how we pulled off

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:34.640 
everything so that's how we pulled off
many<00:03:13.170> stands<00:03:13.440> over<00:03:13.709> here

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.610 

as<00:03:35.189> a<00:03:35.250> production<00:03:35.640> it's<00:03:36.239> very<00:03:36.989> much<00:03:37.200> kind<00:03:37.379> of<00:03:37.500> a
