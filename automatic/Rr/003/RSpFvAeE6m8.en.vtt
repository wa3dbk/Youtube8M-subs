and<00:00:52.329> then<00:00:52.809> we<00:00:52.899> blend<00:00:53.139> them<00:00:53.260> up<00:00:53.379> and<00:00:53.620> we<00:00:53.710> get<00:00:53.859> a

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:53.889 
and then we blend them up and we get a

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:56.039 
and then we blend them up and we get a
new<00:00:54.249> animal<00:00:54.399> and<00:00:54.760> from<00:00:55.510> this<00:00:55.659> that<00:00:55.839> keeps

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:56.049 
new animal and from this that keeps

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:57.569 
new animal and from this that keeps
keeps<00:00:56.469> moving<00:00:56.859> we're<00:00:56.979> going<00:00:57.100> to<00:00:57.159> swipe<00:00:57.339> up<00:00:57.549> to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
there's a checkpoint there and we can

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.610 
there's a checkpoint there and we can
also<00:01:00.879> swipe<00:01:01.209> to<00:01:01.420> charge<00:01:01.690> so<00:01:01.959> just<00:01:01.989> swipe<00:01:02.499> to

to the checkpoint and then we'll tap tap
to<00:01:11.770> stop<00:01:12.009> and<00:01:12.250> then<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.780> little<00:01:14.200> platform

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649

has a lever on it and so obviously just

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.959 
has a lever on it and so obviously just
wait<00:01:19.899> for<00:01:20.109> it<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.229> go<00:01:20.710> tap<00:01:21.100> it's<00:01:21.700> going<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:21.880> go

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:21.969 
wait for it to go tap it's going to go

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.719 
wait for it to go tap it's going to go
up<00:01:22.119> there<00:01:22.960> we<00:01:23.079> go<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:24.280> we're<00:01:24.369> going<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.520> swipe

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:51.630 
experimental platformer so I'm going to
do<00:01:50.079> this<00:01:50.229> we're<00:01:50.770> going<00:01:50.859> to<00:01:50.920> put<00:01:51.280> these<00:01:51.369> things

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
do this we're going to put these things

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.760 
do this we're going to put these things
together<00:01:51.880> again<00:01:52.299> because<00:01:52.539> obviously<00:01:52.990> we're

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
together again because obviously we're

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.349 
together again because obviously we're
going<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:53.950> give<00:01:54.070> level<00:01:54.520> two<00:01:54.729> ago<00:01:54.939> i'll<00:01:55.119> skip

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
going to give level two ago i'll skip

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:56.999 
going to give level two ago i'll skip
skip<00:01:55.780> ahead<00:01:55.899> in<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.200> little<00:01:56.409> bit<00:01:56.530> as<00:01:56.649> well<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:56.979> a

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
skip ahead in a little bit as well to a

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.099 
skip ahead in a little bit as well to a
slightly<00:01:57.369> later<00:01:57.579> level<00:01:57.939> but<00:01:58.689> you<00:01:58.780> can<00:01:58.929> see<00:01:59.079> how

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
slightly later level but you can see how

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:01.380 
slightly later level but you can see how
this<00:01:59.350> works<00:01:59.560> right<00:01:59.799> like<00:02:00.249> I'm<00:02:00.939> just<00:02:00.999> dropping

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
this works right like I'm just dropping

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.760 
this works right like I'm just dropping
down<00:02:01.719> here<00:02:01.990> going<00:02:02.170> to<00:02:02.229> go<00:02:02.319> to<00:02:02.380> this<00:02:02.560> next

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
down here going to go to this next

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.760 
down here going to go to this next
checkpoint<00:02:03.069> smash<00:02:03.579> through<00:02:03.819> here<00:02:04.109> press<00:02:05.109> tap

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
checkpoint smash through here press tap

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.219 
checkpoint smash through here press tap
to<00:02:06.069> stop<00:02:06.609> moving<00:02:06.789> I'm<00:02:07.479> going<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.659> hit<00:02:07.780> this<00:02:07.869> red

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
to stop moving I'm going to hit this red

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.219 
to stop moving I'm going to hit this red
button

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
button

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.339 
button
that<00:02:09.979> moves<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.429> down<00:02:10.640> jump<00:02:11.120> over<00:02:11.510> we<00:02:12.140> can

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
that moves that down jump over we can

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.190 
that moves that down jump over we can
smash<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.860> all<00:02:13.010> this<00:02:13.220> good<00:02:13.430> stuff<00:02:14.110> hit<00:02:15.110> the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
smash you all this good stuff hit the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.729 
smash you all this good stuff hit the
blue<00:02:15.319> on<00:02:15.560> smash<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.519> there<00:02:16.730> go<00:02:17.269> back<00:02:17.450> there

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
blue on smash you there go back there

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.160 
blue on smash you there go back there
it's<00:02:18.739> it's<00:02:19.370> kind<00:02:19.610> of<00:02:19.640> lost<00:02:19.970> vikings<00:02:20.510> e<00:02:20.959> a

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
it's it's kind of lost vikings e a

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.820 
it's it's kind of lost vikings e a
little<00:02:21.830> bit<00:02:21.980> which<00:02:22.849> i'm<00:02:23.360> all<00:02:23.690> for<00:02:24.080> obviously

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
little bit which i'm all for obviously

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.009 
little bit which i'm all for obviously
because<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:26.120> was<00:02:26.239> very<00:02:26.360> good<00:02:26.569> game<00:02:26.720> but<00:02:26.900> it's

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
because that was very good game but it's

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.559 
because that was very good game but it's
definitely<00:02:27.230> definitely<00:02:27.890> got<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.420> having<00:02:29.420> to

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
definitely definitely got that having to

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.699 
definitely definitely got that having to
work<00:02:29.750> together<00:02:30.019> vibe<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:32.299> the<00:02:32.390> moon<00:02:32.709> off

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
work together vibe to it to the moon off

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.110 
work together vibe to it to the moon off
we<00:02:34.670> go<00:02:34.720> off<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.170> moon<00:02:36.440> so<00:02:37.129> if<00:02:37.430> i<00:02:37.549> tap<00:02:37.849> x

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
we go off to the moon so if i tap x

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.039 
we go off to the moon so if i tap x
there<00:02:38.390> we'll<00:02:39.159> go<00:02:40.159> ahead<00:02:40.280> over<00:02:40.610> I've<00:02:41.450> done<00:02:41.690> some

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
there we'll go ahead over I've done some

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.150 
there we'll go ahead over I've done some
of<00:02:42.170> these<00:02:42.230> levels<00:02:42.410> so<00:02:42.829> i'll<00:02:42.920> show<00:02:43.099> you

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
of these levels so i'll show you

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.199 
of these levels so i'll show you
something<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.489> little<00:02:43.519> bit<00:02:43.730> more<00:02:43.819> complicated

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
something a little bit more complicated

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.869 
something a little bit more complicated
so<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.900> magic<00:02:45.650> number<00:02:46.099> this<00:02:46.160> is<00:02:46.250> level<00:02:46.519> seven

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
so the magic number this is level seven

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.520 
so the magic number this is level seven
so<00:02:47.000> this<00:02:47.150> is<00:02:47.299> where<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.780> game<00:02:47.810> lets<00:02:48.260> you

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
so this is where the game lets you

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.150 
so this is where the game lets you
combine<00:02:49.180> three<00:02:50.180> different<00:02:50.930> types<00:02:51.170> of<00:02:51.410> animal

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
combine three different types of animal

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.479 
combine three different types of animal
into<00:02:53.060> one<00:02:53.239> blender<00:02:53.950> so<00:02:54.950> what<00:02:55.250> I'm<00:02:55.340> going<00:02:55.430> to

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
into one blender so what I'm going to

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:56.979 
into one blender so what I'm going to
take<00:02:55.670> is<00:02:55.910> I'm<00:02:56.060> going<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.209> take<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.569> mole<00:02:56.780> I'm

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
take is I'm going to take the mole I'm

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.539 
take is I'm going to take the mole I'm
going<00:02:57.109> to<00:02:57.200> take<00:02:57.349> the<00:02:57.470> rhino<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.220> I'm<00:02:58.340> going<00:02:58.489> to

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
going to take the rhino and I'm going to

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.729 
going to take the rhino and I'm going to
take<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:59.109> flounder<00:03:00.109> fish<00:03:00.260> thing<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.650> I'm

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
take the flounder fish thing and I'm

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.860 
take the flounder fish thing and I'm
going<00:03:00.859> to<00:03:00.890> tap<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.160> red<00:03:01.280> button<00:03:01.910> we've<00:03:02.690> mixed

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
going to tap the red button we've mixed

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.599 
going to tap the red button we've mixed
it<00:03:03.079> up<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:03.379> we've<00:03:03.500> got<00:03:03.680> some<00:03:03.920> horrendous

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
it up and we've got some horrendous

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.720 
it up and we've got some horrendous
beast<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:05.480> now<00:03:06.470> what<00:03:07.099> I'm<00:03:07.129> going<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.340> do<00:03:07.519> is

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
beast and now what I'm going to do is

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.699 
beast and now what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:03:08.060> going<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.599> charge<00:03:08.959> through<00:03:09.230> here<00:03:09.530> and

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
I'm going to charge through here and

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.520 
I'm going to charge through here and
then<00:03:09.950> use<00:03:10.129> the<00:03:10.310> moles<00:03:10.579> ability<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:12.140> dig

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
then use the moles ability to dig

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.440 
then use the moles ability to dig
through<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.250> can<00:03:13.400> see<00:03:13.609> that<00:03:13.819> there<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:14.359> I'm

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
through you can see that there and I'm

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.479 
through you can see that there and I'm
going<00:03:14.569> to<00:03:14.660> swipe<00:03:14.840> ahead<00:03:15.200> go<00:03:15.470> through<00:03:15.680> that<00:03:15.799> so

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
going to swipe ahead go through that so

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.030 
going to swipe ahead go through that so
you<00:03:16.579> can<00:03:16.669> see<00:03:16.880> how<00:03:16.910> this<00:03:17.269> would<00:03:17.450> get<00:03:17.739> more<00:03:18.739> and

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
you can see how this would get more and

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.309 
you can see how this would get more and
more<00:03:19.130> and<00:03:19.519> more<00:03:19.579> and<00:03:19.760> more<00:03:20.030> complicated<00:03:20.989> as

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
more and more and more complicated as

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.050 
more and more and more complicated as
the<00:03:21.889> game<00:03:22.040> goes<00:03:22.190> on<00:03:22.370> with<00:03:22.579> you<00:03:22.730> no<00:03:22.819> more

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
the game goes on with you no more

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.640 
the game goes on with you no more
combinations<00:03:23.690> more<00:03:23.900> types<00:03:24.139> of<00:03:24.290> animals

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
combinations more types of animals

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.199 
combinations more types of animals
different<00:03:25.310> things<00:03:25.519> that<00:03:25.639> you've<00:03:25.760> got<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:26.060> do

different things that you've got to do

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.440 
different things that you've got to do
with<00:03:26.389> them<00:03:26.569> it's<00:03:27.560> really<00:03:28.310> interesting<00:03:28.880> it's<00:03:29.359> a

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
with them it's really interesting it's a

with them it's really interesting it's a
really<00:03:29.900> interesting<00:03:30.049> game<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:30.980> swiping<00:03:31.880> up

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
really interesting game and swiping up

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.500 
really interesting game and swiping up
there<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.299> dig<00:03:32.510> through<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:33.700> yeah<00:03:34.700> I<00:03:34.910> at<00:03:35.299> first

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
there to dig through and yeah I at first
