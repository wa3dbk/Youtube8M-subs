big you want your screen uh just for say
sticking<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:34.800> better<00:00:35.040> make<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.309> four<00:00:35.579> by

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
sticking this better make it four by

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.130 
sticking this better make it four by
four<00:00:37.160> to<00:00:38.160> make<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.460> lot<00:00:38.610> bigger<00:00:38.820> than<00:00:38.940> this

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
four to make it a lot bigger than this

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.650 
four to make it a lot bigger than this
like<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.320> have<00:00:40.440> one<00:00:40.649> that's<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.980> whole<00:00:41.489> wall<00:00:41.790> but

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
like I have one that's a whole wall but

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.889 
like I have one that's a whole wall but
you<00:00:43.170> can<00:00:43.290> use<00:00:43.440> snow<00:00:43.680> or<00:00:43.829> cloth<00:00:44.360> then<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.690> want

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
you can use snow or cloth then you want

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:57.130 
you can use snow or cloth then you want
to<00:00:47.360> make<00:00:48.360> one<00:00:48.390> extra<00:00:48.930> row<00:00:50.870> to<00:00:51.870> put<00:00:52.140> torches<00:00:52.710> on

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.630 

all<00:00:58.140> right<00:00:58.320> like<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.160> don't<00:00:59.190> have<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.489> do

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
all right like that you don't have to do

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.709 
all right like that you don't have to do
the<00:00:59.699> torches<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.149> think<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.390> looks<00:01:00.539> kind<00:01:00.690> of

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the torches I think it looks kind of

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.139 
the torches I think it looks kind of
cool<00:01:00.870> though<00:01:01.370> find<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.520> two<00:01:02.670> blocks<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
cool though find the two blocks in the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.060 
cool though find the two blocks in the
middle<00:01:03.920> walk<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> few<00:01:05.250> steps<00:01:05.309> out<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.710> these<00:01:07.890> two

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
middle walk a few steps out so these two

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.780 
middle walk a few steps out so these two
steps<00:01:08.340> look<00:01:08.610> up<00:01:10.040> this<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.220> don't<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.640> not

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
steps look up this you don't this is not

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.910 
steps look up this you don't this is not
i<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.270> do<00:01:12.420> either<00:01:12.630> but<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.260> did<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.680> just

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
i have to do either but I did it just

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.109 
i have to do either but I did it just
for<00:01:14.159> fun<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:20.520> say<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.090> a

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
for fun and you can say this is a

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.429 
for fun and you can say this is a
projector<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.900> doesn't<00:01:22.170> look<00:01:22.259> like<00:01:22.320> a

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
projector it doesn't look like a

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.210 
projector it doesn't look like a
projector<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.009> all<00:01:23.479> but<00:01:24.710> you<00:01:25.710> could<00:01:25.860> act<00:01:26.009> like

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
projector at all but you could act like

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.060 
projector at all but you could act like
it<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.869> now<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.930> few<00:01:28.229> people<00:01:28.500> asked<00:01:28.770> how<00:01:28.920> do<00:01:28.979> you

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
it is now a few people asked how do you

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.760 
it is now a few people asked how do you
make<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.369> benches<00:01:29.790> well<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:31.470> make<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
make the benches well to make the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.550 
make the benches well to make the
benches<00:01:32.220> you're<00:01:32.880> gonna<00:01:33.229> try<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.290> make<00:01:34.439> this

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
benches you're gonna try to make this

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.649 
benches you're gonna try to make this
even<00:01:36.560> wrong<00:01:37.560> way<00:01:37.799> oh<00:01:38.040> well<00:01:38.579> then<00:01:39.479> those<00:01:39.630> are

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
even wrong way oh well then those are

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.020 
even wrong way oh well then those are
facing<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.140> way<00:01:40.200> you're<00:01:41.159> gonna<00:01:41.310> put<00:01:41.850> two

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
facing that way you're gonna put two

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.499 
facing that way you're gonna put two
stairs<00:01:42.299> down<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:43.460> signs<00:01:44.460> point<00:01:45.000> about<00:01:45.270> right

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
stairs down to signs point about right

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.990 
stairs down to signs point about right
there<00:01:46.520> gone<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.270> makes<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.659> side<00:01:48.869> wall<00:01:50.000> if

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
there gone and it makes the side wall if

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.330 
there gone and it makes the side wall if
it<00:01:51.450> not<00:01:51.630> up<00:01:51.810> here<00:01:52.170> because<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.770> makes<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.130> oh

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
it not up here because that makes it oh

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.100 
it not up here because that makes it oh
well<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.149> guess<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.540> works<00:01:54.689> too<00:01:54.930> but

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
well I guess that works too but

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.770 
well I guess that works too but
sometimes<00:01:55.860> still<00:01:56.280> pay<00:01:56.520> make<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.600> that

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
sometimes still pay make it like that

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.959 
sometimes still pay make it like that
way<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.680> if<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.950> guys<00:01:59.100> didn't<00:01:59.520> know<00:01:59.670> how<00:01:59.909> to

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
way and if you guys didn't know how to

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.929 
way and if you guys didn't know how to
make<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.240> sign<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:01.200> diagonal<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.130> actually

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
make a sign like diagonal I actually

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.550 
make a sign like diagonal I actually
didn't<00:02:03.479> know<00:02:03.570> how<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.750> do<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.049> until<00:02:04.229> like<00:02:04.469> a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
didn't know how to do this until like a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.310 
didn't know how to do this until like a
week<00:02:04.590> ago<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.729> can<00:02:05.850> just<00:02:06.000> like<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.420> diagonally

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
week ago you can just like a diagonally

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.749 
week ago you can just like a diagonally
had<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.469> block<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.009> will<00:02:08.129> place<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.520> sign

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
had a block and it will place the sign

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.260 
had a block and it will place the sign
bag

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
bag

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.780 
bag
I<00:02:09.560> did<00:02:10.560> not<00:02:10.740> knew<00:02:11.010> that<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.280> thought<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.670> could
