00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
can see it's a windows program so now

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.320 
can see it's a windows program so now
we'll<00:01:10.390> insert<00:01:10.750> a<00:01:11.020> disc<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.909> could<00:01:13.060> have<00:01:13.180> done

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
we'll insert a disc you could have done

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.230 
we'll insert a disc you could have done
this<00:01:13.740> before<00:01:14.740> you<00:01:14.920> open<00:01:15.250> up<00:01:15.340> DVD<00:01:15.760> shrink<00:01:16.000> it

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:27.510 
this before you open up DVD shrink it
doesn't<00:01:16.600> really<00:01:16.720> matter<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:26.220> then<00:01:27.220> we<00:01:27.399> will

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
doesn't really matter and then we will

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:39.480 
doesn't really matter and then we will
go<00:01:27.580> to<00:01:27.960> open<00:01:28.960> disk<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:37.210> might<00:01:37.570> want<00:01:37.810> to<00:01:38.490> wait

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
go to open disk you might want to wait

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.219 
go to open disk you might want to wait
for<00:01:39.550> your<00:01:39.910> disc<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:40.600> get<00:01:40.780> mounted<00:01:42.090> first<00:01:43.229> and

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
for your disc to get mounted first and

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.230 
for your disc to get mounted first and
now<00:01:44.530> we<00:01:44.590> can<00:01:44.830> see<00:01:44.979> it's<00:01:45.130> mounted<00:01:45.550> so<00:01:45.850> now<00:01:46.179> we

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
now we can see it's mounted so now we

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.900 
now we can see it's mounted so now we
can<00:01:46.570> open<00:01:46.750> this<00:01:47.130> it'll<00:01:48.130> be<00:01:48.340> right<00:01:48.490> there<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:48.729> I

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
can open this it'll be right there and I

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.620 
can open this it'll be right there and I
just<00:01:49.149> picked<00:01:49.330> a<00:01:49.450> random<00:01:49.479> disc<00:01:51.450> that's<00:01:52.450> like

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
just picked a random disc that's like

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.419 
just picked a random disc that's like
okay<00:01:54.720> I'd<00:01:55.720> like<00:01:56.259> to<00:01:56.440> disable<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.160> video

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:03.810 
okay I'd like to disable the video
preview<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:02.170> we<00:02:02.590> will<00:02:02.710> just<00:02:02.770> wait<00:02:03.310> for

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
preview and so we will just wait for

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:14.490 
preview and so we will just wait for
this<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:05.429> finish<00:02:06.899> decrypting<00:02:07.899> or<00:02:09.300> Eliza

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.800 

and<00:02:15.500> now<00:02:15.950> our<00:02:16.129> analyzing<00:02:16.969> is<00:02:17.209> all<00:02:17.420> know<00:02:17.599> done

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810
