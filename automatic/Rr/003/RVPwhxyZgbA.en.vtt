00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.110 
you get a little different spoiler its
speed<00:03:28.140> activated<00:03:28.860> so<00:03:29.430> this<00:03:29.670> is<00:03:29.790> on<00:03:29.910> two

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
speed activated so this is on two

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.020 
speed activated so this is on two
pedestals<00:03:30.690> as<00:03:30.870> we<00:03:31.049> go<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.500> drive<00:03:32.370> faster<00:03:32.880> the

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.000 
pedestals as we go and drive faster the
spoiler<00:03:33.390> come<00:03:33.600> up<00:03:33.720> create<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.170> downforce<00:03:34.650> and

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
spoiler come up create the downforce and

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.800 
spoiler come up create the downforce and
the<00:03:35.400> reason<00:03:35.670> why<00:03:35.760> we<00:03:35.940> do<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.209> is<00:03:36.269> check<00:03:36.660> this

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
the reason why we do that is check this

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.289 
the reason why we do that is check this
out<00:03:37.019> underneath<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:37.950> car<00:03:38.310> what<00:03:39.150> they're

operated<00:05:03.570> shifters<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:04.729> so<00:05:05.729> they<00:05:05.820> tend<00:05:06.060> to<00:05:06.120> be
