00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
down up motion across the strings that's

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.430 
down up motion across the strings that's
kind<00:00:47.210> of<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.390> basic<00:00:47.750> standard<00:00:48.230> way<00:00:48.410> of

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
strumming on the guitar obviously we

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.119 
strumming on the guitar obviously we
will<00:00:50.510> leave<00:00:50.660> some<00:00:50.989> strokes<00:00:51.350> out<00:00:51.589> every<00:00:51.800> once<00:00:51.980> a

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
will leave some strokes out every once a

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.380 
will leave some strokes out every once a
while

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.760 

but<00:00:58.390> you're<00:00:58.540> always<00:00:58.690> continuing<00:00:59.290> that<00:00:59.380> motion

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
but you're always continuing that motion

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.960 
but you're always continuing that motion
even<00:00:59.980> if<00:01:00.070> you're<00:01:00.220> not<00:01:00.340> hanging<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.670> strings

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
even if you're not hanging the strings

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.590 
even if you're not hanging the strings
every<00:01:01.270> time<00:01:01.450> now<00:01:02.320> a<00:01:02.620> way<00:01:03.460> of<00:01:03.640> developing<00:01:04.269> some

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
every time now a way of developing some

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.740 
every time now a way of developing some
kind<00:01:04.629> of<00:01:04.870> percussive<00:01:05.470> feel<00:01:05.770> to<00:01:06.130> these<00:01:06.250> rhythms

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
kind of percussive feel to these rhythms

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.630 
kind of percussive feel to these rhythms
or<00:01:07.750> is<00:01:07.900> a<00:01:07.930> couple<00:01:08.200> things<00:01:08.320> that<00:01:08.470> you<00:01:08.560> can<00:01:08.830> do<00:01:09.460> to

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
kind of takes everything from kind of a

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.109 
kind of takes everything from kind of a
Spanish<00:01:16.330> Dalek<00:01:16.690> of<00:01:16.869> flamenco<00:01:17.770> players<00:01:18.220> where

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
keep a consistent rhythm going without

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.590

these<00:04:14.620> rhythms<00:04:15.160> and<00:04:15.540> every<00:04:16.540> down<00:04:16.720> stroke<00:04:17.080> you

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
these rhythms and every down stroke you

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.900 
these rhythms and every down stroke you
do<00:04:17.580> let<00:04:18.580> your<00:04:19.110> hand<00:04:20.110> come<00:04:20.320> down<00:04:20.530> on<00:04:20.710> the<00:04:21.220> thing

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
do let your hand come down on the thing

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:30.540 
do let your hand come down on the thing
so<00:04:21.940> yeah

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.700 

so<00:04:31.550> you<00:04:32.210> can<00:04:32.360> see<00:04:32.480> there<00:04:32.660> I<00:04:32.690> can<00:04:33.080> that<00:04:33.470> what

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
so you can see there I can that what

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.880 
so you can see there I can that what
that<00:04:33.740> does<00:04:33.860> is<00:04:34.190> it<00:04:34.340> my<00:04:34.900> paint<00:04:35.900> my<00:04:36.140> palm<00:04:36.710> back

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
that does is it my paint my palm back

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.380 
that does is it my paint my palm back
here<00:04:37.100> is<00:04:37.160> actually<00:04:37.430> landing<00:04:37.820> behind<00:04:37.970> the

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
here is actually landing behind the

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.510 
here is actually landing behind the
strings<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:39.020> then<00:04:39.650> these<00:04:39.830> fingers<00:04:40.250> are

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
strings and then these fingers are

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.120 
strings and then these fingers are
landing<00:04:40.790> on<00:04:40.910> it<00:04:41.090> see<00:04:41.270> I've<00:04:41.360> got<00:04:41.540> some<00:04:41.860> space<00:04:42.860> in

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
landing on it see I've got some space in

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.460 
landing on it see I've got some space in
there<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:43.880> all<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.120> strings<00:04:44.540> can<00:04:44.780> ring<00:04:45.050> you

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
there so all the strings can ring you

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.040 
there so all the strings can ring you
can't<00:04:45.770> really<00:04:46.010> see<00:04:46.400> a<00:04:46.700> lot<00:04:47.300> don't<00:04:47.750> have<00:04:47.930> my

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
can't really see a lot don't have my

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.930 
can't really see a lot don't have my
hand<00:04:48.290> on<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:48.470> strings<00:04:48.770> so<00:04:49.310> it's<00:04:49.490> not<00:04:49.580> muting

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
hand on the strings so it's not muting

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.120 
hand on the strings so it's not muting
out<00:04:50.060> so<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.270> can<00:04:50.450> still<00:04:50.720> get<00:04:50.870> a<00:04:50.930> full<00:04:51.290> acoustic

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
out so I can still get a full acoustic

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.820 
out so I can still get a full acoustic
guitar<00:04:52.750> strum<00:04:53.750> sound<00:04:54.200> out<00:04:54.410> of<00:04:54.440> it

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
guitar strum sound out of it

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.100 
guitar strum sound out of it
and<00:04:55.400> still<00:04:55.820> get<00:04:55.940> a<00:04:55.970> percussive<00:04:56.330> feel<00:04:56.720> with<00:04:56.960> it

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
and still get a percussive feel with it

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.200 
and still get a percussive feel with it
so<00:04:57.890> you<00:04:58.040> gotta<00:04:58.370> figure<00:04:58.550> out<00:04:58.700> a<00:04:58.790> good<00:04:59.000> way<00:04:59.060> to

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
so you gotta figure out a good way to

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.170 
so you gotta figure out a good way to
position<00:04:59.510> your<00:04:59.870> hand<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:01.610> practice<00:05:02.150> that

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
position your hand and practice that

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:12.659 
position your hand and practice that
landing<00:05:02.900> behind<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.410> strings<00:05:03.680> back<00:05:03.860> here

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.490 

every<00:05:13.330> downstroke<00:05:13.870> that's<00:05:14.050> keep<00:05:14.289> big

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
every downstroke that's keep big

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.080 
every downstroke that's keep big
downstroke<00:05:14.949> is<00:05:15.069> the<00:05:15.159> down<00:05:15.340> beat<00:05:15.580> so<00:05:15.759> let's<00:05:15.909> do

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
downstroke is the down beat so let's do

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.749 
downstroke is the down beat so let's do
two<00:05:16.689> three<00:05:17.409> if<00:05:17.560> given<00:05:18.039> that<00:05:18.159> pulse<00:05:18.400> and<00:05:18.610> that's

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
two three if given that pulse and that's

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.339 
two three if given that pulse and that's
what<00:05:18.909> that<00:05:19.000> percussive<00:05:19.539> thing<00:05:19.719> is<00:05:19.900> trying<00:05:20.199> to

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
what that percussive thing is trying to

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.040 
what that percussive thing is trying to
push<00:05:20.759> alright<00:05:21.759> another<00:05:22.240> quick<00:05:22.569> way<00:05:22.719> you<00:05:22.780> can

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
push alright another quick way you can

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.809 
push alright another quick way you can
work<00:05:23.229> on<00:05:23.379> stuff<00:05:23.740> let's<00:05:24.310> hold<00:05:24.430> an<00:05:24.580> E<00:05:24.669> major

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
work on stuff let's hold an E major

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:27.869 
work on stuff let's hold an E major
chord<00:05:25.000> again<00:05:25.479> and<00:05:25.719> you<00:05:26.590> can<00:05:26.710> actually<00:05:26.979> mute

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:27.879 
chord again and you can actually mute

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:30.330 
chord again and you can actually mute
the<00:05:28.060> strings<00:05:28.389> and<00:05:28.629> pick<00:05:29.199> them<00:05:29.409> muted<00:05:29.919> which

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
the strings and pick them muted which

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.640 
the strings and pick them muted which
creates<00:05:30.669> a<00:05:30.729> percussive<00:05:31.030> effect<00:05:31.479> as<00:05:31.629> well<00:05:31.840> now

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
creates a percussive effect as well now

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.980 
creates a percussive effect as well now
this<00:05:32.830> time<00:05:33.129> when<00:05:33.909> I<00:05:33.939> come<00:05:34.210> down<00:05:34.479> on<00:05:34.509> my<00:05:34.750> right

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
this time when I come down on my right

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.980 
this time when I come down on my right
hand<00:05:35.969> it's<00:05:36.969> going<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.180> be<00:05:37.300> in<00:05:37.419> front<00:05:37.719> of<00:05:37.900> the

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
hand it's going to be in front of the

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.980 
hand it's going to be in front of the
bridge<00:05:38.229> all<00:05:38.530> the<00:05:38.590> strings<00:05:39.250> right<00:05:39.460> here<00:05:39.789> so<00:05:40.270> I'm

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
bridge all the strings right here so I'm

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.499 
bridge all the strings right here so I'm
going<00:05:41.199> to<00:05:41.669> now<00:05:42.669> you<00:05:42.729> see<00:05:42.939> how<00:05:43.060> that<00:05:43.240> you<00:05:43.389> could

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:43.509 
going to now you see how that you could

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.290 
going to now you see how that you could
still<00:05:43.750> hear<00:05:43.960> the<00:05:44.110> notes<00:05:44.349> but<00:05:44.879> it's<00:05:45.879> more<00:05:46.150> of<00:05:46.240> a

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
still hear the notes but it's more of a

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.420 
still hear the notes but it's more of a
percussive<00:05:46.840> effect<00:05:47.199> than<00:05:47.710> a<00:05:48.009> strumming

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
percussive effect than a strumming

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.959 
percussive effect than a strumming
effect<00:05:48.759> and<00:05:49.139> the<00:05:50.139> upstroke<00:05:50.620> all<00:05:51.159> that<00:05:51.759> ring

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:51.969 
effect and the upstroke all that ring

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:58.589 
effect and the upstroke all that ring
out<00:05:52.229> freely<00:05:53.229> so<00:05:53.979> we<00:05:54.069> have<00:05:54.189> this

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.510 

so<00:05:59.599> basically<00:06:00.110> what<00:06:00.349> you<00:06:00.440> want<00:06:00.620> to<00:06:00.650> time<00:06:00.949> here

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
so basically what you want to time here

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.890 
so basically what you want to time here
is<00:06:01.639> your<00:06:02.180> pic<00:06:03.879> hitting<00:06:04.879> the<00:06:05.000> exact<00:06:05.389> same<00:06:05.629> time

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
is your pic hitting the exact same time

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.070 
is your pic hitting the exact same time
the<00:06:05.930> back<00:06:06.319> of<00:06:06.590> your<00:06:07.129> palm<00:06:07.370> does<00:06:07.699> right<00:06:08.690> I<00:06:08.720> kind

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
the back of your palm does right I kind

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.550 
the back of your palm does right I kind
of<00:06:09.169> create<00:06:09.409> like<00:06:09.440> a<00:06:10.629> kind<00:06:11.629> of<00:06:11.659> but<00:06:12.020> I'm<00:06:12.199> laying

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
of create like a kind of but I'm laying

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.920 
of create like a kind of but I'm laying
this<00:06:12.770> whole<00:06:13.280> pinky<00:06:13.729> muscle<00:06:14.150> down<00:06:14.389> right<00:06:14.810> in

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
this whole pinky muscle down right in

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.430 
this whole pinky muscle down right in
front<00:06:15.139> of<00:06:15.259> bridge<00:06:15.530> at<00:06:15.860> the<00:06:16.129> same<00:06:16.460> time<00:06:16.759> I'm

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
front of bridge at the same time I'm

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.140 
front of bridge at the same time I'm
hitting<00:06:18.440> all<00:06:18.560> the<00:06:18.740> stoats<00:06:19.009> usually<00:06:19.759> the<00:06:19.909> bond

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
hitting all the stoats usually the bond

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.430 
hitting all the stoats usually the bond
with<00:06:20.360> lower<00:06:20.509> strain<00:06:20.900> to<00:06:21.020> the<00:06:21.110> ones<00:06:21.289> you're

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
with lower strain to the ones you're

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.339 
with lower strain to the ones you're
muting<00:06:21.710> it<00:06:21.830> good<00:06:22.479> the<00:06:23.479> third<00:06:23.990> fourth<00:06:24.289> fifth

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:24.349 
muting it good the third fourth fifth

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:28.450 
muting it good the third fourth fifth
and<00:06:24.650> sixth<00:06:25.129> are<00:06:25.280> through<00:06:25.759> uh<00:06:27.220> fourth<00:06:28.220> fifth
