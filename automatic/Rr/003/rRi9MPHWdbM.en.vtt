00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.660
 at the time of cooking I love 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.260
 have fun and today we bring you a recipe 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.259
 very special butter cookies with 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.380
 candy and chocolate chips les 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.810
 I recommend this preparation for that 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.439
 we need 125 grams of butter 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.499
 without salt at room temperature 40 grams 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:36.360
 of brown sugar 75 grams of sugar 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:38.640
 white 185 grams of flour a new 1 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.040
 teaspoon of vanilla essence 1 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.170
 teaspoon baking powder one 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.100
 pinch of salt 40 grams of chocolate 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.410
 chopped and 16 to 20 candies and chips 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.510
 chocolate to decorate 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.950
 then first let's mix the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.950
 butter with sugars 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.570
 let's mix a little bit until it 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.570
 smooth 6 integrate the ingredients 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.710
 meanwhile we are going to put it to the 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.119
 flour 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:26.300
 a little bit of real dust and we're going to 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:28.880
 get the egg we need 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:35.630
 let's add a teaspoon of 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:38.050
 vanilla essence and we add again 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.050
 our 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.180
 meanwhile I will be opening a 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.180
 once the candies 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.659
 to the line I just added a pinch 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.370
 of salt that we were missing and we're going to 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.370
 mix with all the ingredients 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.409
 takes a little bit of speed from 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.040
 that would give us then to fly the line of 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:18.970
 make us suddenly to dirty all the 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.970
 kitchen will come out the flour 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.790
 if you can see there already as the mass then 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.840
 As you have already been able to form we are going to 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:32.930
 finally add chopped chocolate 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.930
 we let mix a little and we can turn it off 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.879
 and we are going to start preparing them with 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:43.790
 our hands normally I do the 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:46.579
 cookies as well as heavy 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.770
 of this amount more or less about 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:51.900
 16 cookies of 30 grams 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.170
 and we're going to start filling them with the 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.170
 candies 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.749
 the last cookies already to decorate them 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:04:08.629
 let's decorate them with chips for 

00:03:41.749 --> 00:04:11.680
 bring them to the list were ready the 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.680
 let's take to the oven 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.810
 let's see how cookies are 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.609
 they started to raise a little bit of color in 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.590
 the edges then better take them out of 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:28.039
 once for us to be softer and 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:30.759
 there are no folders with these cookies 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:34.669
 butter can really innovate 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:38.350
 add raisins or white chocolate 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:41.300
 and you will see what delight you are going to enjoy 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.910
 prepare them at home with your children and to
