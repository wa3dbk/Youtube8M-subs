with suppressor and I almost never use

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.209 
with suppressor and I almost never use
the<00:00:42.480> suppressor<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.200> weapon<00:00:43.379> because

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the suppressor on this weapon because

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.160 
the suppressor on this weapon because
I'm<00:00:44.340> pretty<00:00:44.760> good<00:00:44.969> at<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.270> staying<00:00:45.960> off<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
I'm pretty good at just staying off the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.680 
I'm pretty good at just staying off the
map<00:00:46.500> by<00:00:47.190> moving<00:00:47.520> from<00:00:47.850> place<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.239> place<00:00:48.270> with

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
map by moving from place to place with

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.940 
map by moving from place to place with
this<00:00:48.809> weapon<00:00:49.020> because<00:00:49.320> it's<00:00:49.469> great<00:00:49.739> for<00:00:49.890> that

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
this weapon because it's great for that

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.950 
this weapon because it's great for that
and<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.219> has<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> really<00:00:50.579> nice<00:00:50.910> range<00:00:51.360> as<00:00:51.629> you

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
and it has a really nice range as you

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.139 
and it has a really nice range as you
can<00:00:52.110> see<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.100> really<00:00:53.489> really<00:00:53.760> do<00:00:53.910> love

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
can see and so I really really do love

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.900 
can see and so I really really do love
this<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.260> squad<00:00:55.680> point<00:00:55.949> value<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.370> 7<00:00:56.789> as

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
this and the squad point value is 7 as

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.459 
this and the squad point value is 7 as
you<00:00:57.059> can<00:00:57.210> see<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> same<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
you can see in that is the same as the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.010 
you can see in that is the same as the
ak-12<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.180> mean<00:01:00.449> that's<00:01:00.480> not<00:01:00.780> really

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
ak-12 and so I mean that's not really

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.420 
ak-12 and so I mean that's not really
that<00:01:01.170> big<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.590> deal<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:01.980> not<00:01:02.039> going<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.340> be

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
that big of a deal it's not going to be

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.280 
that big of a deal it's not going to be
a<00:01:02.460> deal<00:01:02.760> breaker<00:01:02.789> off<00:01:03.300> at<00:01:03.420> seven<00:01:03.750> squad<00:01:04.049> points

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
a deal breaker off at seven squad points

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.920 
a deal breaker off at seven squad points
the<00:01:05.100> rate<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.280> fire<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.970> lowest<00:01:06.510> among<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the rate of fire is the lowest among the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.039 
the rate of fire is the lowest among the
assault<00:01:07.229> rifles<00:01:07.820> 631<00:01:08.820> rounds<00:01:09.450> per<00:01:09.600> minute<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
assault rifles 631 rounds per minute and

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.620 
assault rifles 631 rounds per minute and
the<00:01:10.619> high<00:01:10.799> range<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.119> high<00:01:12.270> damage

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the high range and the high damage

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.050 
the high range and the high damage
really<00:01:13.229> makes<00:01:13.409> up<00:01:13.619> for<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.640> magazine

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
really makes up for this the magazine

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.210 
really makes up for this the magazine
size<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.540> pretty<00:01:15.780> low<00:01:15.990> at<00:01:16.170> 24<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.920> always

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
size is pretty low at 24 so I always

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.190 
size is pretty low at 24 so I always
find<00:01:17.549> myself<00:01:17.670> using<00:01:18.000> extended<00:01:18.780> mags<00:01:18.960> with

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
find myself using extended mags with

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.740 
find myself using extended mags with
this<00:01:19.350> weapon<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.150> finally<00:01:21.150> these<00:01:21.270> shots<00:01:21.540> to

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
this weapon and finally these shots to

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.300 
this weapon and finally these shots to
kill<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.080> going<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.380> three<00:01:22.619> close<00:01:23.009> range

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
kill it's going to be three close range

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.120 
kill it's going to be three close range
and<00:01:23.520> five<00:01:23.880> at<00:01:24.090> long<00:01:24.240> range<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> reason<00:01:24.930> it's

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
and five at long range the reason it's

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.620 
and five at long range the reason it's
49<00:01:26.130> at<00:01:26.490> close<00:01:26.700> range<00:01:27.000> which<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.180> going<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.479> be<00:01:27.540> a

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
49 at close range which is going to be a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.630 
49 at close range which is going to be a
three<00:01:27.840> shot<00:01:28.080> kill<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.979> if<00:01:29.100> someone<00:01:29.280> slightly

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
three shot kill so if someone slightly

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.640 
three shot kill so if someone slightly
damaged<00:01:30.210> it'll<00:01:30.420> be<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> two<00:01:30.810> shot<00:01:31.049> kill<00:01:31.290> at

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
damaged it'll be a two shot kill at

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.399 
damaged it'll be a two shot kill at
close<00:01:31.920> range<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.430> it'll<00:01:33.299> drop<00:01:33.900> all<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.320> way

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
close range and it'll drop all the way

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.010 
close range and it'll drop all the way
off<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.799> 20<00:01:35.430> damage<00:01:35.970> at<00:01:36.360> long<00:01:36.570> range<00:01:36.840> which<00:01:36.990> is

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
off to 20 damage at long range which is

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.319 
off to 20 damage at long range which is
why<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> five<00:01:37.740> shot<00:01:37.770> kill<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.939> overall

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
why it's a five shot kill so overall

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.120 
why it's a five shot kill so overall
this<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.659> pretty<00:01:39.869> solid<00:01:40.140> assault<00:01:40.560> rifle<00:01:40.890> and

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
this is a pretty solid assault rifle and

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.410 
this is a pretty solid assault rifle and
let's<00:01:41.430> go<00:01:41.579> ahead<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.820> move<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
let's go ahead and move on to the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.179 
let's go ahead and move on to the
Maverick<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:43.380> we<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.619> not<00:01:43.799> seen<00:01:44.009> I've

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
Maverick so if we have not seen I've

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.219 
Maverick so if we have not seen I've
already<00:01:44.460> compared<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.090> AK<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.869> Maverick

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
already compared the AK to the Maverick

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.289 
already compared the AK to the Maverick
and<00:01:46.409> unfortunately<00:01:47.159> some<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.729> damage<00:01:47.909> was

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
and unfortunately some of the damage was

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.030 
and unfortunately some of the damage was
not<00:01:48.329> accurate<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:49.439> now<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.619> we<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
not accurate so now that we have the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.830 
not accurate so now that we have the
full<00:01:50.189> accurate<00:01:50.399> damage<00:01:50.939> I'm<00:01:51.149> REE<00:01:51.360> comparing

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
full accurate damage I'm REE comparing

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.020 
full accurate damage I'm REE comparing
it<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.350> time<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.890> Remington<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
it but this time to the Remington so the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.399 
it but this time to the Remington so the
three<00:01:54.210> shot<00:01:54.390> kill<00:01:54.630> arranged<00:01:54.810> for<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.079> weapon

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
three shot kill arranged for this weapon

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.530 
three shot kill arranged for this weapon
is<00:01:55.500> 37<00:01:56.130> meters<00:01:56.280> which<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.210> know<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.329> little

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
is 37 meters which is you know a little

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.850 
is 37 meters which is you know a little
bit<00:01:57.689> shorter<00:01:57.930> than<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.259> Remington<00:01:58.649> but

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
bit shorter than the Remington but

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.990 
bit shorter than the Remington but
you'll<00:01:59.009> still<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.340> getting<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.610> three<00:01:59.790> shot

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
you'll still be getting a three shot

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.109 
you'll still be getting a three shot
kill<00:02:00.320> fairly<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.439> often<00:02:02.009> but<00:02:02.130> basically<00:02:02.549> one

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
kill fairly it often but basically one

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.370 
kill fairly it often but basically one
thing<00:02:03.299> that's<00:02:03.450> cool<00:02:03.600> about<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:03.930> weapon<00:02:04.259> as

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
thing that's cool about this weapon as

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.200 
thing that's cool about this weapon as
you<00:02:04.500> can<00:02:04.649> see<00:02:04.799> at<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.950> bottom<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> two

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
you can see at the bottom is it is a two

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.839 
you can see at the bottom is it is a two
shot<00:02:06.780> kill<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:08.009> thing<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.280> be<00:02:08.310> noted<00:02:08.759> is

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
shot kill but one thing to be noted is

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.729 
shot kill but one thing to be noted is
that<00:02:08.879> range<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.390> very<00:02:09.720> very<00:02:09.959> short<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:10.590> like

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
that range is very very short it's like

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.020 
that range is very very short it's like
seven<00:02:11.160> meters<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.610> it's<00:02:11.730> almost<00:02:11.849> like

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
seven meters so it's almost like

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.200 
seven meters so it's almost like
point-blank

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
point-blank

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.340 
point-blank
in<00:02:13.270> just<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.540> little<00:02:13.690> bit<00:02:13.780> longer<00:02:14.050> than

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
in just a little bit longer than

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.870 
in just a little bit longer than
point-blank<00:02:14.740> so<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.190> really<00:02:15.640> won't<00:02:15.760> be

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
point-blank so you really won't be

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.490 
point-blank so you really won't be
getting<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.240> too<00:02:16.360> often<00:02:16.570> and<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:16.960> imagine<00:02:17.410> if

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
getting it too often and I imagine if

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.380 
getting it too often and I imagine if
you<00:02:17.560> use<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.710> suppressor<00:02:18.370> it'll<00:02:19.000> completely

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
you use a suppressor it'll completely

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.150 
you use a suppressor it'll completely
eliminate<00:02:19.930> that<00:02:20.050> two<00:02:20.230> shot<00:02:20.500> kill<00:02:20.710> range<00:02:20.890> but

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
eliminate that two shot kill range but

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.260 
eliminate that two shot kill range but
you<00:02:21.340> guys<00:02:21.430> will<00:02:21.580> just<00:02:21.640> have<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.910> find<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.180> out

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
you guys will just have to find that out

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.330 
you guys will just have to find that out
for<00:02:22.360> yourselves<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.650> squad<00:02:23.860> point<00:02:24.130> value

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
for yourselves so the squad point value

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.100 
for yourselves so the squad point value
is<00:02:24.460> zero<00:02:24.670> as<00:02:24.820> I've<00:02:24.970> said<00:02:25.180> before<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:25.780> because

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
is zero as I've said before and because

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.710 
is zero as I've said before and because
you<00:02:26.470> spent<00:02:26.740> fifteen<00:02:27.100> dollars<00:02:27.400> in<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.610> dlc<00:02:27.880> but

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
you spent fifteen dollars in the dlc but

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.240 
you spent fifteen dollars in the dlc but
you<00:02:28.900> know<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.200> squad<00:02:29.410> want<00:02:29.620> value<00:02:29.770> is<00:02:30.010> zero

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
you know the squad want value is zero

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.090 
you know the squad want value is zero
within<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.670> game<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:31.480> rate<00:02:31.600> of<00:02:31.630> fire<00:02:31.870> is<00:02:32.100> 652

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
within the game the rate of fire is 652

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.860 
within the game the rate of fire is 652
and<00:02:33.460> then<00:02:33.550> is<00:02:33.670> similar<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.330> Remington<00:02:34.780> in

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
and then is similar to the Remington in

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.500 
and then is similar to the Remington in
the<00:02:34.960> AK<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.490> know<00:02:36.550> it<00:02:36.670> has<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:36.850> good<00:02:37.120> damage

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
the AK so you know it has a good damage

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.720 
the AK so you know it has a good damage
so<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.960> really<00:02:38.140> is<00:02:38.230> made<00:02:38.530> up<00:02:38.680> for<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.190> magazine

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
so it really is made up for the magazine

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.730 
so it really is made up for the magazine
size<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.360> standard<00:02:40.720> assault<00:02:41.110> rifle<00:02:41.410> 30

long<00:03:02.290> 50<00:03:03.070> damage<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:03.550> close<00:03:03.790> so<00:03:04.360> I<00:03:04.630> mean<00:03:04.810> you'll

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
long 50 damage it close so I mean you'll

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.690 
long 50 damage it close so I mean you'll
be<00:03:05.110> getting<00:03:05.350> that<00:03:05.380> five<00:03:05.680> shot<00:03:05.980> kill<00:03:06.220> range<00:03:06.460> but

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
be getting that five shot kill range but

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.950 
be getting that five shot kill range but
if<00:03:06.850> there's<00:03:07.030> slightly<00:03:07.240> damaged<00:03:07.690> you'll<00:03:07.840> get

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
if there's slightly damaged you'll get

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.020 
if there's slightly damaged you'll get
it<00:03:08.050> in<00:03:08.110> for<00:03:08.470> for<00:03:08.500> most<00:03:08.980> of<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.160> time<00:03:09.370> so

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
it in for for most of the time so

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.670 
it in for for most of the time so
basically<00:03:10.420> guys<00:03:10.660> let's<00:03:10.930> bring<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.260> Remington

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
basically guys let's bring the Remington

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.220 
basically guys let's bring the Remington
stats<00:03:11.950> back<00:03:12.190> on<00:03:12.400> screen<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:12.940> compare<00:03:13.510> them<00:03:13.750> so

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
stats back on screen and compare them so

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.540 
stats back on screen and compare them so
as<00:03:14.350> you<00:03:14.500> can<00:03:14.620> see<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:14.920> Remington<00:03:15.370> has<00:03:15.520> a

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
as you can see the Remington has a

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.400 
as you can see the Remington has a
longer<00:03:16.030> three<00:03:16.420> shot<00:03:16.630> kill<00:03:16.870> range<00:03:17.080> and<00:03:17.290> that's

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
longer three shot kill range and that's

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.320 
longer three shot kill range and that's
really<00:03:17.830> really<00:03:18.010> important<00:03:18.580> and<00:03:18.700> I<00:03:19.060> used<00:03:19.240> a

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
really really important and I used a

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.030 
really really important and I used a
suppressor<00:03:19.540> on<00:03:19.960> the<00:03:20.140> Mavericks<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:20.740> drops

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
suppressor on the Mavericks that drops

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.220 
suppressor on the Mavericks that drops
that<00:03:21.190> even<00:03:21.460> further<00:03:21.820> and<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:22.750> squad<00:03:22.960> point

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
that even further and the squad point

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.810 
that even further and the squad point
value<00:03:23.470> is<00:03:23.590> 0<00:03:23.800> for<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.010> Maverick<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.520> seven

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
value is 0 for the Maverick and seven

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.370 
value is 0 for the Maverick and seven
for<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.060> Remington<00:03:25.660> but<00:03:25.840> I<00:03:25.870> really<00:03:26.230> don't

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
for the Remington but I really don't

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.350 
for the Remington but I really don't
think<00:03:26.440> that's<00:03:26.710> that<00:03:27.010> big<00:03:27.160> of<00:03:27.280> a<00:03:27.370> factor<00:03:27.610> the

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
think that's that big of a factor the

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.300 
think that's that big of a factor the
rate<00:03:28.510> of<00:03:28.540> fire<00:03:28.810> is<00:03:28.840> slower<00:03:29.380> on<00:03:29.710> the<00:03:29.860> Remington

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
rate of fire is slower on the Remington

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.620 
rate of fire is slower on the Remington
but<00:03:30.430> at<00:03:30.520> longer<00:03:30.850> ranges<00:03:31.180> you're<00:03:31.360> going<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.540> be

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
but at longer ranges you're going to be

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.840 
but at longer ranges you're going to be
dropping<00:03:31.930> people<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.530> little<00:03:32.770> bit<00:03:32.920> quicker<00:03:33.220> and

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
dropping people a little bit quicker and

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.210 
dropping people a little bit quicker and
the<00:03:33.910> rate<00:03:34.060> of<00:03:34.090> fire<00:03:34.330> is<00:03:34.500> 652<00:03:35.500> for<00:03:35.770> the<00:03:35.830> Maverick

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
the rate of fire is 652 for the Maverick

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.340 
the rate of fire is 652 for the Maverick
the<00:03:36.640> magazine<00:03:37.090> size<00:03:37.360> is<00:03:37.540> 24<00:03:38.110> for<00:03:38.320> the

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
the magazine size is 24 for the

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.080 
the magazine size is 24 for the
Remington<00:03:38.770> and<00:03:38.920> 30<00:03:39.130> for<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.520> Maverick<00:03:39.910> and

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
Remington and 30 for the Maverick and

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.570 
Remington and 30 for the Maverick and
it's<00:03:40.990> two<00:03:41.260> shots<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.710> kill<00:03:41.920> for<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.190> Maverick

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
it's two shots to kill for the Maverick

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.520 
it's two shots to kill for the Maverick
up<00:03:42.730> at<00:03:42.940> very<00:03:43.240> very<00:03:43.510> close<00:03:43.780> ranges<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.440> it

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
up at very very close ranges and it

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.260 
up at very very close ranges and it
drops<00:03:44.740> off<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.010> five<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:45.520> it<00:03:45.610> is<00:03:45.760> 3<00:03:46.030> for<00:03:46.240> the

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
drops off the five and it is 3 for the

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.090 
drops off the five and it is 3 for the
Remington<00:03:46.660> and<00:03:46.810> five<00:03:47.260> so<00:03:47.590> at<00:03:47.680> long<00:03:47.800> range

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
Remington and five so at long range

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.470 
Remington and five so at long range
they're<00:03:48.550> both<00:03:48.700> going<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:48.940> do<00:03:49.030> but<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.270> same

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
they're both going to do but the same

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.910 
they're both going to do but the same
but<00:03:49.660> I<00:03:49.690> imagine<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.140> Remington<00:03:50.500> will<00:03:50.650> be<00:03:50.740> more

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
but I imagine the Remington will be more

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.010 
but I imagine the Remington will be more
powerful<00:03:51.100> given<00:03:51.670> its<00:03:51.820> range<00:03:52.060> thank<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:52.900> guys
