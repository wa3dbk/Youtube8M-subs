00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.390
 one 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.919
 in point is we are going to present in it 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.789
 video how to connect our 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:17.850
 phone to a samsung galaxy s2 or a 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:22.270
 galaxy note how it is said 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.700
 through the hdtv adapter 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.250
 of the port m hl 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.210
 This is the original Samsung connector 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.230
 and let's see 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.050
 let's unpack what we're going to see 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:39.210
 and different connectors arrives that we 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.210
 they will serve to connect our 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.170
 as we see 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.090
 here is an hdmi connector 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.740
 in this front part here in this part 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.680
 from behind we have a micro usb connector 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.410
 microusb that where are we going to connect the 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.750
 current charger cable 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.089
 we need to have the positions connected 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.360
 so that it receives power and the mobile 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.060
 it can work and be able to pull 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.689
 reproduction d 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.689
 in 1080p 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.280
 and then we have at the end then another 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.700
 microusb connector that is the one that we're going to 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.700
 connect 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.250
 the same connector where we connect the 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.250
 current that is the output 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.400
 let's connect it so that for 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.400
 can work 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.869
 of current 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.869
 we also have the hdmi cable 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.299
 and now let's connect 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.150
 of the micro usb we are going to connect 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.830
 and now you have here on screen as 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.830
 we have 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.170
 the same image we have in it 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.410
 let's make a 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.290
 let's have one here on the phone 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.989
 to go to the applications 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.210
 let's go now multimedia let's 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:28.120
 use the mx 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:33.450
 the producer player and we are going to play 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.450
 for example the same video tutorial 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.150
 and it has happened 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.960
 well there you have the image 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.620
 s 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.620
 Sound 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.550
 Recorded 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.050
 it can be our 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.610
 in the north 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.240
 but we can also reproduce 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.240
 any 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.859
 any other video 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.319
 so that you see it we are going to reproduce a 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.249
 video 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.249
 directly 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.849
 we have recorded on it 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.849
 good 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.280
 it has also been recorded in the north 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.470
 well that is recorded with him 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.360
 How can I see that the image is very 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.890
 good 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.890
 and good was 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.280
 the video 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.830
 it is very simple an advanced 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.730
 for m access 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.270
 the power charger the cable hdmi 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.940
 we connect it in front of him 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.400
 TV and the phone that we already have 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.420
 our photos in our video in 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.490
 large screen with great quality 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.860
 I hope you liked this video and 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.930
 we are calling you to a next video
