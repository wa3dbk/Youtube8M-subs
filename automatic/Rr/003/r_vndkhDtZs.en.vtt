want to catch up to Detective Conan but
in<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:21.720> past<00:02:22.050> like<00:02:22.410> week<00:02:22.680> or<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:23.640> I've<00:02:23.970> been

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
in this past like week or so I've been

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.780 
in this past like week or so I've been
really<00:02:24.540> into<00:02:25.380> loop<00:02:25.770> on<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.070> third<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:26.610> that's

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
really into loop on the third so that's

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.790 
really into loop on the third so that's
taken<00:02:27.000> up<00:02:27.270> most<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.630> my<00:02:27.690> time<00:02:27.780> almost<00:02:28.590> done

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
taken up most of my time almost done

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.040 
taken up most of my time almost done
with<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.100> with<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.120> season<00:02:30.480> one<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.690> that

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
with that with the season one of that

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.410 
with that with the season one of that
and<00:02:31.380> then<00:02:32.190> I'll<00:02:32.370> probably<00:02:32.520> continue<00:02:33.120> with<00:02:33.390> a

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
and then I'll probably continue with a

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.110 
and then I'll probably continue with a
few<00:02:33.660> more<00:02:33.810> episodes<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.410> case<00:02:34.740> closed<00:02:35.370> and

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
few more episodes of case closed and

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.480 
few more episodes of case closed and
hopefully<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:37.440> was<00:02:37.800> hoping<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.220> be<00:02:38.310> like

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
hopefully I was hoping to be like

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.980 
hopefully I was hoping to be like
halfway<00:02:38.700> cut<00:02:39.060> off<00:02:39.180> by<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.420> end<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.810> year

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
halfway cut off by the end of the year

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.750 
halfway cut off by the end of the year
but<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.350> know<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.620> SI<00:02:40.950> happening<00:02:41.400> if<00:02:41.580> that

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
but you know that SI happening if that

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.690 
but you know that SI happening if that
is<00:02:42.000> not<00:02:42.060> happening<00:02:42.600> but<00:02:43.530> hopefully<00:02:44.400> within

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
is not happening but hopefully within

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.180 
is not happening but hopefully within
like<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.150> first<00:02:45.420> two<00:02:46.320> months<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.680> next<00:02:46.980> year<00:02:47.100> I

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
like the first two months of next year I

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.040 
like the first two months of next year I
could<00:02:47.400> be<00:02:47.520> halfway<00:02:47.760> cut<00:02:48.180> off<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.450> case<00:02:48.720> closed

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
could be halfway cut off to case closed

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
could be halfway cut off to case closed
and<00:02:50.060> maybe<00:02:51.060> be<00:02:51.480> somewhere<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.500> see<00:02:52.680> like

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
and maybe be somewhere and see like

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.850 
and maybe be somewhere and see like
halfway<00:02:53.459> through<00:02:53.850> season<00:02:54.060> two<00:02:54.510> or<00:02:55.230> second

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
halfway through season two or second
