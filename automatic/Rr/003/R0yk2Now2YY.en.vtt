wondering if you'd like to go to dinner

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.430 
wondering if you'd like to go to dinner
with<00:00:27.990> me<00:00:28.820> why<00:00:29.820> uh<00:00:30.710> well<00:00:31.710> uh<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:33.079> have<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> mouth

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
with me why uh well uh I have a mouth

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.130 
with me why uh well uh I have a mouth
you<00:00:35.070> have<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> mouth<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:36.149> we<00:00:36.420> both<00:00:36.570> eat<00:00:36.780> foods

you have a mouth and we both eat foods

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.630 
you have a mouth and we both eat foods
so<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.440> thought<00:00:37.649> maybe<00:00:37.710> we<00:00:38.129> could<00:00:38.160> eat<00:00:38.399> food

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.590 
so I thought maybe we could eat food
together<00:00:39.290> why<00:00:40.969> because<00:00:41.969> that's<00:00:42.149> what<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.450> do

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
together why because that's what we do

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.299 
together why because that's what we do
to<00:00:42.719> get<00:00:42.840> nutrition<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.620> our<00:00:43.800> bodies<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.129> we

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
to get nutrition in our bodies and we

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.549 
to get nutrition in our bodies and we
could<00:00:44.430> share<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.700> make<00:00:45.059> sure<00:00:45.239> she<00:00:46.170> was<00:00:46.320> just

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
could share that make sure she was just

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.380
