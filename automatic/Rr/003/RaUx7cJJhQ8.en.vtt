00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
seeds I'm joined with Gary today we're

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.050 
seeds I'm joined with Gary today we're
gonna<00:00:04.440> be<00:00:04.589> talking<00:00:04.980> about<00:00:05.009> how<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.490> build<00:00:05.790> a

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
gonna be talking about how to build a

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.270 
gonna be talking about how to build a
raised<00:00:06.270> bed<00:00:06.299> using<00:00:06.930> veggies<00:00:07.500> corner

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
raised bed using veggies corner

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.040 
raised bed using veggies corner
connectors<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:08.849> inline<00:00:09.150> connectors<00:00:09.660> now

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
connectors and inline connectors now

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:19.820 
connectors and inline connectors now
Gary<00:00:10.349> how<00:00:10.920> do<00:00:10.980> we<00:00:11.099> get<00:00:11.219> started<00:00:11.630> well<00:00:18.830> Shawn

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
Gary how do we get started well Shawn

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.359 
Gary how do we get started well Shawn
looked<00:00:20.430> like<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:21.830> allows<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.130> attach

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
looked like this allows you to attach

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.550 
looked like this allows you to attach
two<00:00:24.300> pieces<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.660> lumber<00:00:24.900> together<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.500> a

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
two pieces of lumber together in a

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.710 
two pieces of lumber together in a
corner<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:26.070> different<00:00:26.460> dimensions<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.210> this

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
corner of different dimensions so this

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.570 
corner of different dimensions so this
particular<00:00:28.019> one<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.560> for<00:00:28.680> two<00:00:28.859> by<00:00:29.010> tens<00:00:29.340> and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
particular one is for two by tens and

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.510 
particular one is for two by tens and
you<00:00:30.480> can<00:00:30.599> also<00:00:30.750> get<00:00:30.990> them<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.410> two<00:00:31.890> by<00:00:32.040> twelves

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
you can also get them in two by twelves

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.690 
you can also get them in two by twelves
two<00:00:32.759> by<00:00:32.880> eight<00:00:33.030> century<00:00:33.450> by<00:00:33.540> sixes<00:00:34.010> so<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
two by eight century by sixes so for the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.889 
two by eight century by sixes so for the
bed<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.000> we're<00:00:36.149> building<00:00:36.450> today<00:00:36.570> we've

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
bed that we're building today we've

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.600 
bed that we're building today we've
decided<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.469> go<00:00:37.620> with<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.860> two<00:00:37.980> by<00:00:38.100> tens<00:00:38.370> that

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
decided to go with the two by tens that

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.580 
decided to go with the two by tens that
gives<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> nice<00:00:39.329> deep<00:00:39.629> raised<00:00:39.930> bed<00:00:40.230> and

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
gives you a nice deep raised bed and

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.860 
gives you a nice deep raised bed and
we're<00:00:41.550> just<00:00:41.670> cutting<00:00:41.879> them<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.420> length<00:00:42.629> so

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
we're just cutting them to the length so

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.150 
we're just cutting them to the length so
one<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.320> first<00:00:43.440> things<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.829> want<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.010> do

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
one of the first things you want to do

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.970 
one of the first things you want to do
is<00:00:44.309> decide<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.239> size<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.719> bed<00:00:45.899> by<00:00:46.739> your

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
is decide on the size of the bed by your

00:00:46.980 --> 00:01:08.120 
is decide on the size of the bed by your
lumber<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.489> then<00:00:48.000> cut<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.450> length

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.710 

so<00:01:09.130> we'll<00:01:09.340> take<00:01:09.460> them<00:01:09.610> up<00:01:09.729> to<00:01:09.759> our<00:01:09.970> location

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
so we'll take them up to our location

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.170 
so we'll take them up to our location
and<00:01:11.080> okay<00:01:12.070> put<00:01:12.490> them<00:01:12.610> together<00:01:12.759> with<00:01:13.090> the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
and okay put them together with the

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.560 
and okay put them together with the
corners<00:01:13.509> and<00:01:13.659> connectors<00:01:14.049> they're<00:01:14.259> excellent

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
corners and connectors they're excellent

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.760 
corners and connectors they're excellent
all<00:01:16.570> right<00:01:16.720> Gary<00:01:16.899> looks<00:01:17.140> like<00:01:17.259> we're<00:01:17.440> all<00:01:17.560> set

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
all right Gary looks like we're all set

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.230 
all right Gary looks like we're all set
up<00:01:17.799> here<00:01:17.920> and<00:01:18.159> ready<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.399> go<00:01:18.610> so<00:01:18.820> why<00:01:18.940> don't<00:01:19.119> you

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
up here and ready to go so why don't you

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.510 
up here and ready to go so why don't you
show<00:01:19.450> us<00:01:19.479> how<00:01:19.810> these<00:01:19.990> go<00:01:20.289> together<00:01:20.520> really

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
show us how these go together really

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.770 
show us how these go together really
simple<00:01:22.210> actually

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
simple actually

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.240 
simple actually
you<00:01:22.899> take<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.200> raised<00:01:23.350> bed<00:01:23.590> corners<00:01:24.039> and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
you take the raised bed corners and

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.440 
you take the raised bed corners and
you'll<00:01:24.460> see<00:01:24.670> that<00:01:24.850> there<00:01:25.060> are<00:01:25.090> some<00:01:25.270> holes

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
you'll see that there are some holes

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.279 
you'll see that there are some holes
drilled<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:27.159> each<00:01:27.369> side<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.689> you<00:01:28.780> want<00:01:29.020> the

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
drilled on each side so you want the

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.609 
drilled on each side so you want the
corner<00:01:30.360> piece<00:01:31.360> just<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.750> slide<00:01:32.080> over<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.560> top

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
corner piece just to slide over the top

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.230 
corner piece just to slide over the top
of<00:01:32.770> your<00:01:33.009> pre-cut<00:01:33.550> lumber

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
of your pre-cut lumber

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.590 
of your pre-cut lumber
just<00:01:35.020> like<00:01:35.170> so<00:01:36.210> lay<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.360> bed<00:01:37.539> down<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:39.600> with

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
just like so lay the bed down and with

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.240 
just like so lay the bed down and with
the<00:01:40.750> corners<00:01:41.140> you'll<00:01:41.350> get<00:01:41.530> some<00:01:41.800> Phillips

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
the corners you'll get some Phillips

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.859 
the corners you'll get some Phillips
head<00:01:42.700> screws<00:01:43.149> so<00:01:43.840> use<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.920> Phillips<00:01:45.600> bit<00:01:46.600> and

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
head screws so use the Phillips bit and

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.910 
head screws so use the Phillips bit and
just<00:01:47.679> drill<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:53.020> now<00:01:53.440> with<00:01:53.560> these<00:01:53.679> there's

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
just drill that now with these there's

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.160 
just drill that now with these there's
no<00:01:54.100> need<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.340> pre-drill<00:01:55.060> any<00:01:55.539> of<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.690> holes<00:01:55.899> or

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
no need to pre-drill any of the holes or

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.109 
no need to pre-drill any of the holes or
do<00:01:56.259> any<00:01:56.409> other<00:01:56.470> prep<00:01:56.979> work<00:01:57.190> it's<00:01:57.909> a<00:01:58.000> good

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
do any other prep work it's a good

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.940 
do any other prep work it's a good
option<00:01:58.299> because<00:01:58.840> you're<00:01:59.049> actually<00:01:59.470> drilling

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
option because you're actually drilling

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.949 
option because you're actually drilling
fairly<00:02:00.369> close<00:02:00.549> to<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.789> end<00:02:00.940> of<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.149> lumber<00:02:01.420> so

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
fairly close to the end of the lumber so

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.839 
fairly close to the end of the lumber so
to<00:02:02.080> pre-drill<00:02:02.679> the<00:02:02.890> holes<00:02:03.069> helps<00:02:03.489> to<00:02:03.610> prevent

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:03.849 
to pre-drill the holes helps to prevent

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:06.029 
to pre-drill the holes helps to prevent
any<00:02:04.119> cracking<00:02:04.390> I've<00:02:05.170> already<00:02:05.530> done<00:02:05.709> that<00:02:05.890> to

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
any cracking I've already done that to

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:12.900 
any cracking I've already done that to
this<00:02:06.160> way<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.690> once<00:02:10.840> you<00:02:10.989> get<00:02:11.500> that<00:02:11.650> one<00:02:11.760> set<00:02:12.760> up

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
this way so once you get that one set up

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.720 
this way so once you get that one set up
your<00:02:13.270> other<00:02:13.450> piece<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.200> lumber<00:02:14.349> and<00:02:15.160> slide<00:02:15.489> it

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
your other piece of lumber and slide it

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.920 
your other piece of lumber and slide it
into<00:02:15.879> the<00:02:16.000> groove<00:02:16.769> and<00:02:17.769> do<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.160> same<00:02:18.310> thing

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
into the groove and do the same thing

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.570 
into the groove and do the same thing
now<00:02:19.930> doing<00:02:20.560> this<00:02:20.709> you<00:02:20.890> end<00:02:21.010> up<00:02:21.160> with<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.340> lot

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
now doing this you end up with a lot

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.850 
now doing this you end up with a lot
stronger<00:02:21.910> corner<00:02:22.569> than<00:02:23.230> if<00:02:23.349> you<00:02:23.470> were<00:02:23.590> just<00:02:23.739> to

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
stronger corner than if you were just to

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.280 
stronger corner than if you were just to
nail<00:02:24.129> two<00:02:24.370> pieces<00:02:24.700> of<00:02:24.790> lumber<00:02:24.879> together

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
nail two pieces of lumber together

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.360 
nail two pieces of lumber together
because<00:02:26.290> of<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.470> pressure<00:02:26.709> of<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.099> soil

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
because of the pressure of the soil

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.059 
because of the pressure of the soil
tends<00:02:28.269> to<00:02:28.480> push<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.720> lumber<00:02:29.290> apart<00:02:29.620> whereas

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
tends to push the lumber apart whereas

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.130 
tends to push the lumber apart whereas
this<00:02:30.370> type<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:30.970> connector<00:02:31.330> holds<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:31.810> very

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
this type of connector holds it very

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.619 
this type of connector holds it very
well<00:02:32.319> and<00:02:33.129> over<00:02:33.519> time<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:33.790> will<00:02:34.300> attribute

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
well and over time that will attribute

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.250 
well and over time that will attribute
you<00:02:35.050> just<00:02:35.470> a<00:02:35.620> longer-lasting<00:02:36.160> bed<00:02:37.260> then

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
you just a longer-lasting bed then

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.380 
you just a longer-lasting bed then
having<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.800> say<00:02:39.129> replace<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.910> every<00:02:40.000> couple<00:02:40.239> of

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
having to say replace it every couple of

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.199 
having to say replace it every couple of
years<00:02:40.739> exactly<00:02:41.739> now<00:02:42.580> you'll<00:02:42.790> notice<00:02:42.970> that

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
years exactly now you'll notice that

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.320 
years exactly now you'll notice that
we're<00:02:43.420> using<00:02:44.489> regular<00:02:45.489> spruce<00:02:45.819> lumber<00:02:46.150> for

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
we're using regular spruce lumber for

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.899 
we're using regular spruce lumber for
this<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.920> have<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.220> option<00:02:48.519> of<00:02:48.580> course<00:02:48.760> to

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
this you have the option of course to

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.149 
this you have the option of course to
use<00:02:49.030> cedar<00:02:49.330> as<00:02:49.540> well<00:02:49.720> we<00:02:50.500> recommend<00:02:50.920> not<00:02:50.980> to

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
use cedar as well we recommend not to

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.220 
use cedar as well we recommend not to
use<00:02:51.340> pressure-treated<00:02:51.849> wood<00:02:52.150> okay<00:02:52.870> because

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
use pressure-treated wood okay because

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.839 
use pressure-treated wood okay because
of<00:02:53.590> course<00:02:53.800> you're<00:02:53.980> going<00:02:54.129> vegetables<00:02:54.670> and

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
of course you're going vegetables and

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.149 
of course you're going vegetables and
flowers<00:02:54.909> mmm<00:02:55.510> so<00:02:55.750> better<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.620> stay<00:02:56.890> away<00:02:56.920> from

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
flowers mmm so better to stay away from

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.180 
flowers mmm so better to stay away from
the<00:02:57.489> chemical<00:02:58.170> Wood<00:02:59.170> we<00:02:59.590> don't<00:02:59.769> want<00:02:59.920> any<00:03:00.069> of

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
the chemical Wood we don't want any of

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.160 
the chemical Wood we don't want any of
those<00:03:00.280> chemicals<00:03:00.879> leaching<00:03:01.269> into<00:03:01.659> the<00:03:01.870> soil

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
those chemicals leaching into the soil

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.710 
those chemicals leaching into the soil
and<00:03:02.620> then<00:03:02.739> leaching<00:03:03.220> in<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.700> our<00:03:03.909> to<00:03:04.659> our

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
and then leaching in to our to our

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.800 
and then leaching in to our to our
flowers<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.349> vegetables<00:03:05.639> exactly<00:03:06.719> once<00:03:07.719> you

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
flowers and vegetables exactly once you

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.320 
flowers and vegetables exactly once you
finish<00:03:08.109> the<00:03:08.260> corner<00:03:08.590> you'll<00:03:08.859> see<00:03:08.950> that

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
finish the corner you'll see that

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.510 
finish the corner you'll see that
also<00:03:09.600> comes<00:03:09.810> with<00:03:09.960> a<00:03:09.990> cap<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.130> cap<00:03:11.310> just

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
also comes with a cap and the cap just

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.640 
also comes with a cap and the cap just
slides<00:03:11.820> in<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.300> top<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.110> can<00:03:13.320> tap<00:03:13.620> that

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
slides in the top and you can tap that

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.720 
slides in the top and you can tap that
down<00:03:13.890> with<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.340> rubber<00:03:14.730> mallet<00:03:16.250> for<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.340> inline

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
down with a rubber mallet for the inline

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.600 
down with a rubber mallet for the inline
connector<00:03:18.060> shot<00:03:18.650> you'll<00:03:19.650> see<00:03:19.860> that<00:03:20.010> they're<00:03:20.580> a

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
connector shot you'll see that they're a

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.760 
connector shot you'll see that they're a
little<00:03:20.820> bit<00:03:20.940> different<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:22.260> they<00:03:22.410> have<00:03:22.740> a

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
little bit different and they have a

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.910 
little bit different and they have a
slot<00:03:23.130> for<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.550> middle<00:03:23.820> piece<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.740> two<00:03:25.740> other

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
slot for the middle piece and two other

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.790 
slot for the middle piece and two other
slots<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.550> adjoin<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:27.380> longer<00:03:28.380> piece<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:28.680> lumber

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
slots to adjoin a longer piece of lumber

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.980 
slots to adjoin a longer piece of lumber
together<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:30.030> this<00:03:30.210> way<00:03:30.360> you<00:03:30.420> can<00:03:30.630> make<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:30.810> the

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
together so this way you can make it the

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.700 
together so this way you can make it the
long<00:03:31.200> raised<00:03:31.500> bed<00:03:32.660> but<00:03:33.660> keep<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.440> well

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
long raised bed but keep it well

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.420 
long raised bed but keep it well
supported<00:03:35.190> in<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.430> middle<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:36.810> really<00:03:37.080> with<00:03:37.260> a

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
supported in the middle so really with a

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.460 
supported in the middle so really with a
couple<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.970> corner<00:03:39.660> connectors<00:03:40.110> and<00:03:40.290> some

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
couple of the corner connectors and some

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.500 
couple of the corner connectors and some
inline<00:03:40.740> connectors<00:03:41.190> you<00:03:41.430> could<00:03:41.670> pretty<00:03:42.240> much

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
inline connectors you could pretty much

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.170 
inline connectors you could pretty much
create<00:03:42.840> any<00:03:43.020> sort<00:03:43.350> of<00:03:43.440> size<00:03:44.250> or<00:03:44.610> configuration

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
create any sort of size or configuration

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.090 
create any sort of size or configuration
of<00:03:45.510> raised<00:03:45.660> bed<00:03:45.960> to<00:03:46.200> suit<00:03:46.470> your<00:03:46.620> needs<00:03:46.800> that's

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
of raised bed to suit your needs that's

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.780 
of raised bed to suit your needs that's
right<00:03:48.440> if<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:49.620> go<00:03:49.770> too<00:03:49.830> long<00:03:50.160> with<00:03:50.400> one<00:03:50.610> piece

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
right if you go too long with one piece

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.030 
right if you go too long with one piece
of<00:03:50.970> lumber<00:03:51.420> you'll<00:03:52.200> find<00:03:52.470> that<00:03:52.620> by<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:52.860> time

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
of lumber you'll find that by the time

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.070 
of lumber you'll find that by the time
you<00:03:53.130> have<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.340> soil<00:03:53.580> in<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:54.000> wants<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.630> bow<00:03:54.780> out

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
you have the soil in it wants to bow out

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.130 
you have the soil in it wants to bow out
so<00:03:55.980> this<00:03:56.250> using<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.760> center<00:03:57.330> piece<00:03:57.570> to<00:03:57.870> connect

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
so this using a center piece to connect

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.380 
so this using a center piece to connect
the<00:03:58.290> two<00:03:58.470> will<00:03:59.130> just<00:03:59.310> keep<00:03:59.490> it<00:03:59.730> a<00:04:00.030> lot<00:04:00.209> more

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
the two will just keep it a lot more

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.800 
the two will just keep it a lot more
stable

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
stable

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.250 
stable
excellent<00:04:02.180> so<00:04:03.180> next<00:04:03.420> time<00:04:03.600> we<00:04:03.750> can<00:04:03.900> come<00:04:04.110> back

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
excellent so next time we can come back

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.010 
excellent so next time we can come back
and<00:04:04.590> we'll<00:04:04.920> talk<00:04:05.070> about<00:04:05.250> how<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.209> prepare<00:04:06.780> the

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
and we'll talk about how to prepare the

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.170 
and we'll talk about how to prepare the
soil<00:04:07.230> for<00:04:07.410> a<00:04:07.620> raised<00:04:07.800> bed<00:04:07.830> and<00:04:08.340> how<00:04:08.880> to<00:04:08.940> make

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
soil for a raised bed and how to make

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.510 
soil for a raised bed and how to make
sure<00:04:09.360> that<00:04:09.600> it's<00:04:09.810> got<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.410> it's<00:04:11.250> good<00:04:11.430> and

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
sure that it's got the it's good and

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.699 
sure that it's got the it's good and
fertile<00:04:11.910> for<00:04:12.150> what<00:04:12.270> you<00:04:12.360> want<00:04:12.510> to<00:04:12.570> grow<00:04:12.720> that's

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
fertile for what you want to grow that's
