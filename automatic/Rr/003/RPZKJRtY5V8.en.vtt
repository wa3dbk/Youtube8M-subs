well<00:00:12.570> we<00:00:12.660> started<00:00:13.019> off<00:00:13.139> with<00:00:13.320> wide<00:00:13.559> grip<00:00:13.769> pull

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
well we started off with wide grip pull

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.410 
well we started off with wide grip pull
downs<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.460> we're<00:00:14.610> going<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.759> end<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.150> same

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
downs and we're going to end the same

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.230 
downs and we're going to end the same
way<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.500> know<00:00:16.920> we<00:00:17.039> worked<00:00:17.310> outside<00:00:17.670> to

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
way so you know we worked outside to

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.300 
way so you know we worked outside to
inside<00:00:18.420> now<00:00:18.930> back<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> outside<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:19.920> get

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
inside now back to the outside to get

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.300 
inside now back to the outside to get
that<00:00:20.789> maximum<00:00:21.660> width<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.830> going<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.100> make

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
that maximum width that is going to make

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.950 
that maximum width that is going to make
you<00:00:23.490> have<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.789> greatest<00:00:24.060> v-taper<00:00:24.570> around

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
you have the greatest v-taper around

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.750 
you have the greatest v-taper around
beautiful<00:00:25.710> that's<00:00:25.890> what<00:00:26.039> we<00:00:26.130> want<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.400> best

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760

Luger style so I'm going to go with the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.510 
Luger style so I'm going to go with the
white<00:00:32.279> grip<00:00:32.520> right<00:00:32.700> here

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
white grip right here

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.760 
white grip right here
chin<00:00:35.520> up<00:00:35.610> like<00:00:35.790> before<00:00:36.320> our<00:00:37.320> sit<00:00:37.590> back<00:00:37.739> a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
chin up like before our sit back a

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.560 
chin up like before our sit back a
little<00:00:37.890> bit<00:00:38.219> arching<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.850> lower<00:00:38.879> back<00:00:39.239> chin

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
little bit arching the lower back chin

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.380 
little bit arching the lower back chin
up<00:00:39.600> chest<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.820> and<00:00:41.820> I'm<00:00:41.969> making<00:00:42.120> sure<00:00:42.300> I

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
up chest is up and I'm making sure I

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.840 
up chest is up and I'm making sure I
pause<00:00:42.719> for<00:00:43.140> at<00:00:43.500> least<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.739> one<00:00:43.920> count<00:00:44.160> because<00:00:44.789> I

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
pause for at least a one count because I

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.910 
pause for at least a one count because I
want<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.090> make<00:00:45.270> sure<00:00:45.300> I'm<00:00:46.110> getting<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.649> right

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
want to make sure I'm getting a right

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.160 
want to make sure I'm getting a right
amount<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.219> tension<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:48.570> also<00:00:48.719> going

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
amount of tension on it but also going

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.380 
amount of tension on it but also going
all<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.500> way<00:00:49.559> back<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.010> get<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> stretch<00:00:50.550> and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
all the way back up to get a stretch and

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.869 
all the way back up to get a stretch and
this<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.199> going<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.379> prevent<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.460> from<00:00:53.489> using

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
this is going to prevent you from using

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.869 
this is going to prevent you from using
momentum<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.840> see<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> lot<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.350> guys<00:00:55.879> going

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
momentum you see a lot of guys going

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.599 
momentum you see a lot of guys going
this<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:58.230> momentum<00:00:58.710> especially<00:00:59.399> on<00:00:59.489> this

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
this this momentum especially on this

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.400 
this this momentum especially on this
machine<00:00:59.820> right<00:01:00.180> absolutely<00:01:00.930> all<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.199> time

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
machine right absolutely all the time

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.709 
machine right absolutely all the time
but<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> problem<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.000> you're<00:01:03.300> using<00:01:03.449> more

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
but the problem is is you're using more

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.260 
but the problem is is you're using more
momentum<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.920> get<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.189> down<00:01:05.400> if<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.030> can

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
momentum just to get it down if you can

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.480 
momentum just to get it down if you can
actually<00:01:06.479> come<00:01:07.140> here<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.470> hold<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.070> for<00:01:08.220> just

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
actually come here and hold it for just

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.640 
actually come here and hold it for just
a<00:01:08.549> second<00:01:08.970> you're<00:01:09.390> going<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.570> notice<00:01:09.780> how<00:01:10.320> hard

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
a second you're going to notice how hard

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.340 
a second you're going to notice how hard
it<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.189> be<00:01:11.790> able<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.970> get<00:01:12.150> those<00:01:12.720> little

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
it is and be able to get those little

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.219 
it is and be able to get those little
itty-bitty<00:01:13.530> fire<00:01:14.210> fibers<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.570> fire<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
itty-bitty fire fibers to fire and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.679 
itty-bitty fire fibers to fire and
create<00:01:16.920> more<00:01:17.100> density<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.700> way<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.119> body

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
create more density that way and body

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.570 
create more density that way and body
position<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.380> say<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.799> your<00:01:20.189> butt<00:01:20.430> is

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
position I can say that your butt is

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.940 
position I can say that your butt is
riding<00:01:21.180> as<00:01:21.330> close<00:01:21.600> as<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:21.900> go<00:01:22.200> into<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
riding as close as it can go into the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.260 
riding as close as it can go into the
machine<00:01:23.280> you're<00:01:23.460> not<00:01:23.580> sitting<00:01:23.790> back<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
machine you're not sitting back on the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.670 
machine you're not sitting back on the
seat<00:01:24.479> you're<00:01:24.630> as<00:01:24.720> far<00:01:24.900> forward<00:01:25.080> as<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.500> go

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
seat you're as far forward as you can go

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.190 
seat you're as far forward as you can go
absolutely<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.759> guys<00:01:27.420> look<00:01:27.570> at<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.780> scapular

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
absolutely and guys look at the scapular

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.719 
absolutely and guys look at the scapular
attraction<00:01:28.619> again<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.369> pulldown

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
attraction again just like the pulldown
