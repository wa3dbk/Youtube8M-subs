Barone's you coming back to you guys
today<00:00:04.890> with<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.100> quick<00:00:05.460> look<00:00:05.759> at<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.089> msi<00:00:06.690> UEFI

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
today with a quick look at the msi UEFI

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.850 
today with a quick look at the msi UEFI
BIOS<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.309> also<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.090> quick<00:00:09.590> 4.8<00:00:10.590> gigahertz

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
BIOS and also a quick 4.8 gigahertz

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.890 
BIOS and also a quick 4.8 gigahertz
overclock<00:00:11.490> now<00:00:11.639> i've<00:00:12.090> only<00:00:12.269> had<00:00:12.509> this<00:00:12.690> for

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
overclock now i've only had this for

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.480 
overclock now i've only had this for
about<00:00:12.990> an<00:00:13.259> hour<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.769> like<00:00:14.040> I've<00:00:14.190> only<00:00:14.309> been

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
about an hour and like I've only been

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.640 
about an hour and like I've only been
tweaking<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.480> overclocks<00:00:16.049> for<00:00:16.320> about<00:00:16.500> an

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
tweaking the overclocks for about an

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.500 
tweaking the overclocks for about an
hour<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:16.980> bit<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.369> I've<00:00:18.060> managed<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.359> get

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
hour and a bit and I've managed to get

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.970 
hour and a bit and I've managed to get
up<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.779> four<00:00:18.990> point<00:00:19.199> eight<00:00:19.289> gigahertz<00:00:19.619> which

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
up to four point eight gigahertz which

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.460 
up to four point eight gigahertz which
is<00:00:20.130> very<00:00:20.400> impressive<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:21.660> diminishing

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
is very impressive the diminishing

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.040 
is very impressive the diminishing
returns<00:00:22.859> seriously<00:00:23.670> kicks<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.150> after<00:00:24.300> 4.6

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
returns seriously kicks in after 4.6

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.070 
returns seriously kicks in after 4.6
gigahertz<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:26.090> 4.6<00:00:27.090> karats<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.570> looking<00:00:27.930> like

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
gigahertz so 4.6 karats is looking like

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.429 
gigahertz so 4.6 karats is looking like
the<00:00:28.260> new<00:00:28.470> 4.2<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.939> Ivy<00:00:30.300> Bridge<00:00:30.599> was<00:00:31.199> like<00:00:31.410> a

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
the new 4.2 that Ivy Bridge was like a

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.060 
the new 4.2 that Ivy Bridge was like a
24/7<00:00:32.130> super<00:00:32.940> safe<00:00:33.149> overclock<00:00:33.649> 4.6<00:00:34.649> looks<00:00:34.890> like

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
24/7 super safe overclock 4.6 looks like

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.160 
24/7 super safe overclock 4.6 looks like
that<00:00:35.250> new<00:00:35.489> super<00:00:35.760> safe<00:00:36.030> overclock<00:00:36.510> now<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
that new super safe overclock now the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.350 
that new super safe overclock now the
voltage<00:00:37.770> here<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.460> set<00:00:38.670> at<00:00:38.790> one<00:00:38.940> point<00:00:39.149> two

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
voltage here is it set at one point two

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.790 
voltage here is it set at one point two

I<00:00:41.700> still<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.510> with<00:00:42.809> MSI<00:00:43.260> BIOS<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.770> there's<00:00:44.309> a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
I still have with MSI BIOS you there's a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.430 
I still have with MSI BIOS you there's a
lot<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.879> features<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.329> lot<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.690> options<00:00:46.230> that

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
lot of features a lot of options that

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.799 
lot of features a lot of options that
it's<00:00:47.309> really<00:00:47.670> intricate<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.270> really<00:00:48.629> detailed

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
it's really intricate is really detailed

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.619 
it's really intricate is really detailed
it's<00:00:49.350> really<00:00:49.680> in-depth<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.820> BIOS<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
it's really in-depth I like the BIOS the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.420 
it's really in-depth I like the BIOS the
more<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.930> use<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.440> more<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.800> start<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.280> get

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
more I use it the more I start to get

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.220 
more I use it the more I start to get
used<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.030> really<00:00:54.300> good<00:00:54.449> now<00:00:54.840> don't<00:00:55.110> be

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
used to it it's really good now don't be

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.410 
used to it it's really good now don't be
afraid<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.739> CPU<00:00:56.219> temperature<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.940> correct

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
afraid this CPU temperature is correct

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.139 
afraid this CPU temperature is correct
yes<00:00:57.690> 65<00:00:58.289> degrees<00:00:58.649> however<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.910> got<00:01:00.030> to

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
yes 65 degrees however you got to

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.610 
yes 65 degrees however you got to
remember<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.480> when<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.750> first<00:01:01.079> booted<00:01:01.500> this

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
remember that when I first booted this

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.860 
remember that when I first booted this
up<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:01.949> went<00:01:02.280> into<00:01:02.399> BIOS<00:01:02.670> even<00:01:03.090> at<00:01:03.180> 3<00:01:03.420> point<00:01:03.660> 4

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
up and went into BIOS even at 3 point 4

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.520 
up and went into BIOS even at 3 point 4
gigahertz

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
gigahertz

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.250 
gigahertz
it<00:01:04.619> was<00:01:04.979> reading<00:01:05.339> 50<00:01:05.700> degrees<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.869> tends<00:01:07.170> to

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
it was reading 50 degrees so it tends to

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.950 
it was reading 50 degrees so it tends to
run<00:01:07.500> hot<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.490> don't<00:01:08.729> know<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.150> BIOS<00:01:09.540> for<00:01:09.750> some

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
run hot in I don't know in BIOS for some

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.500 
run hot in I don't know in BIOS for some
reason<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.619> that's<00:01:11.310> something<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.939> consider

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
reason so that's something to consider

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.539 
reason so that's something to consider
but<00:01:12.900> when<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.140> benchmark<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.010> stress<00:01:14.310> test

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
but when you benchmark it stress test

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.310 
but when you benchmark it stress test
with<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> stress<00:01:15.150> testing<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.810> goes<00:01:15.960> up<00:01:16.170> to

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
with the stress testing it goes up to

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.770 
with the stress testing it goes up to
about<00:01:16.409> 80<00:01:16.770> at<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.189> speeds<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.759> did<00:01:18.390> try<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.600> go

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
about 80 at this speeds I did try to go

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.200 
about 80 at this speeds I did try to go
to<00:01:18.840> 5<00:01:19.140> gigahertz<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.009> was<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:20.759> yeah<00:01:21.000> I

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
to 5 gigahertz but that was just yeah I

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.730 
to 5 gigahertz but that was just yeah I
mean<00:01:21.540> that's<00:01:21.750> getting<00:01:22.080> into<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> danger<00:01:22.710> zone

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
mean that's getting into the danger zone

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.160 
mean that's getting into the danger zone
I<00:01:22.979> need<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> lot<00:01:23.460> more<00:01:23.610> time<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.060> stuff<00:01:24.900> around

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
I need a lot more time to stuff around

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.539 
I need a lot more time to stuff around
with<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.500> but<00:01:25.740> yeah<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.130> see<00:01:26.310> how<00:01:26.460> I'm

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
with that but yeah you can see how I'm

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.190 
with that but yeah you can see how I'm
going<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.729> actually<00:01:27.180> get<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.900> got<00:01:28.110> to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
going to actually get in I got to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.050 
going to actually get in I got to
research<00:01:28.770> more<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.220> these<00:01:29.340> settings<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.790> find

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
research more of these settings and find

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.789 
research more of these settings and find
out<00:01:30.180> what's<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.570> lot<00:01:30.960> more<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.290> these<00:01:31.380> mean<00:01:31.619> but

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
out what's a lot more of these mean but

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.350 
out what's a lot more of these mean but
just<00:01:31.979> setting<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.549> one<00:01:32.729> point<00:01:32.909> two<00:01:33.030> nine

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
just setting this to one point two nine

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.410 
just setting this to one point two nine
five<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.020> everything<00:01:34.950> else<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.280> auto<00:01:35.549> it

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
