00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.380
 Hi everyone, I'll show you this 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.300
 finally the muffin recipe below 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.389
 form of plum cake that we made in the 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.510
 video together I south erika came 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.010
 so really delicious that time 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.380
 we show you this recipe 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.390
 deserves a lot is a lemon problem 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.060
 with poppy seeds inside 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.410
 I'll show you right away how to do it 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.779
 let's start by putting a beautiful one 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.730
 bowl our flour we use 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.829
 this whole wheat flour 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.890
 you can also visit other types of 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.610
 We put sugar together with flour 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.680
 of cane and we immediately put the yeast 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.320
 so let's put all of them together 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.750
 dry ingredients we feel muscular 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.250
 now let's add the oil 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.320
 so as usual before the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.460
 dry ingredients are then added 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.000
 the liquid ones add the milk 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.519
 pochina once and we also mix for 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.280
 cats can use milk that 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.840
 In this case we prefer to use 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.220
 soy milk because it helps 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.770
 better bind the compound by having it 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.990
 lecithin internal though if not really 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.130
 I like the soy milk you have it 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.530
 also almond milk rice milk 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.229
 okay look at that beautiful crime 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.579
 this is the consistency it must have 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.579
 nice smooth 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.360
 well now we can put them together 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.340
 lemon peels 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.409
 the flaxseed seeds with the 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.950
 grinder not with a normal blender 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.950
 because in this way they become their own 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.950
 pulverized 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:53.140
 see how fine the dust is there 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.119
 we put in frulliamo also the 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.490
 our lemon peels is always 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.860
 using the grinder and always for the purpose 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.290
 same reason why they become their own 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.900
 very fine and in this way they release 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.680
 we all really so much perfume 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.680
 how much inside 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.470
 and we put these too immediately 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:22.300
 our impasse we also put the seeds 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.300
 poe poor and we're good to me 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.180
 sell reinforce Rome a little more 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.530
 and I also put a little bit of oil 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.230
 lemon essential 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.170
 obviously it is not essential it is a 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.300
 dispute but it is not essential that it 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.459
 put the really one for today 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:51.250
 more because it never comes out 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:53.950
 they happy the bill and there 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.200
 we also put a pin of oil without 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.280
 it is not one of the concentrate trails of 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.019
 vanilla 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.519
 of this I put very little indeed 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.430
 because it is very strong 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.680
 this time I will be careful to put it 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.829
 really little more than I call the last one 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.799
 a perfume is already mixed together 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:15.430
 wonderful and we can field it 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:17.829
 on facebook you too if you preferred theme 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.989
 sin ronchi and torta won the plumcake 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.989
 so it goes to be connected this is worth so much 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.760
 we supply the ventilated at 175 degrees 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.730
 to cooked in the oven 40 45 minutes then them 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.069
 you lose a little from the power of yours 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.170
 oven you always remember to do 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.840
 toothpick test to see if it is 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.260
 well cooked and has a wonderful fragrance 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.569
 but you have to do it to understand that 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.310
 perfume I hope the recipe there is 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.489

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.489
