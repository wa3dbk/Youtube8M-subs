00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:12.599
 Good morning, everyone. I'm here to talk. 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:15.890
 telling you to tell you will get a 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.330
 make the same mistake 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:23.550
 recently i bought a revolver ae 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:28.199
 3 the price of 1,250 praises for me is up 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:35.550
 more expensive I bought this cost of 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:37.320
 Beautiful packaging then draws a 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.399
 person speaks a business of this hotel has 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.739
 that victory has to be derisory 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.760
 do not just win trick a thousand 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.640
 adversary 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.940
 come on the test on the crystal that simulates 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:56.820
 You do every day with that photo. 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:59.780
 an average radius of $ 200 12 hours of 500 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.780
 in the following 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:15.100
 a day that doctors and more to walk in 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:18.790
 same point of view of 160 and all because 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:26.380
 incra is running, nobody is talking 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:32.100
 01 port motorcycle is always recording 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.100
 now let's make two points today 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.340
 the dollar 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.030
 the beauty dollar is not that you are from 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.030
 teach her 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:15.740
 in 1975 they say on the site that it has 900 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.740
 almost thousand 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:28.590
 in 158 days have the recording make four 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:32.910
 by Conrad Baratin the reading of 2004 was 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:44.010
 plant 900 ac by the propaganda ne 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:48.709
 now let's nuno ssd is one that is 64gb per 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.709
 who makes the difference 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.940
 where it made almost 100 megs of difference in 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.790
 reading 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.660
 whats an ssd or drive with two ss 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.310
 from henry from zero that was to give more 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.410
 close to a thousand possible 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:22.800
 there you always read in personal contact with 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:26.720
 support they tell you to use AT &amp; T 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.720
 no longer pays off 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.400
 over there 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.400
 only 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:51.379
 the find of face looks face already gave 800 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:53.299
 and 1000 recording right but because 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.670
 in the test of the other that everyone uses 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.230
 reference does not I entered 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.930
 contact support said by 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:06.140
 cause of it because here he tests with 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.780
 I'll explain with a code that can 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.980
 be compacted the value can be 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.549
 compacted 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.980
 Yeah, but you do not give your music the format 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.320
 that she is already at most one song in 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.209
 mp3 and Brazilian compact provides for its 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:26.120
 photo is already at maximum I will have this photo 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:26.570
 here is property 1,2 and 1,9 shit 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.400
 huh 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:36.770
 I left it here because it's good. 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:38.930
 now with race at the maximum that exists is 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:43.849
 compact here 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:46.789
 now let's see the size of it got 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.160
 the same size as it will be more 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:53.150
 fast to its compact form more than 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:56.560
 this is a video recorded with iphone 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.560
 both the photo as 1 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.530
 compacting 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:13.639
 the first non-core processor i7 10.6 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.639
 that left 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.750
 Now there will stop 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.010
 103 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:38.380
 I love impacted where it came 103 too 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:43.570
 it makes no difference of work 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:45.340
 The method of deceiving is not to proceed. 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.430
 I wish performance where I confess 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:56.009
 ssd buyers good brand force 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:56.009
 life is good and what performance is certain
