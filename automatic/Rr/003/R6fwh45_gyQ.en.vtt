00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.960 
exciting I decided to produce strategy
videos<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.189> thought<00:01:08.369> that'd<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> little<00:01:08.820> more

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
videos I thought that'd be a little more

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.760 
videos I thought that'd be a little more
informative<00:01:09.479> especially<00:01:10.200> for<00:01:10.320> newer<00:01:10.470> players

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
informative especially for newer players

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.429 
informative especially for newer players
but<00:01:11.460> anyways<00:01:11.790> that's<00:01:12.000> not<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> point<00:01:12.450> what<00:01:13.290> is

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
but anyways that's not the point what is

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.280 
but anyways that's not the point what is
that<00:01:14.450> dublicate<00:01:15.450> rector<00:01:15.750> trick<00:01:15.930> works<00:01:16.110> like

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
that dublicate rector trick works like

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.940 
that dublicate rector trick works like
this<00:01:16.439> once<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.920> get<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.369> 10<00:01:17.700> out<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.880> 10<00:01:18.090> supply

you're going to be a 12 out of 10 supply
you're<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> be<00:01:38.610> actually<00:01:38.790> over<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
you're going to be actually over the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.630 
you're going to be actually over the
supply<00:01:39.840> cap<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.710> why<00:01:40.860> would<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.040> do<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.400> well

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
supply cap so why would I do this well

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.460 
supply cap so why would I do this well
it<00:01:41.820> seems<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.540> haven't<00:01:42.990> seen<00:01:43.110> any<00:01:43.290> actual

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
it seems I haven't seen any actual

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.080 
it seems I haven't seen any actual
numbers<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.310> really<00:01:44.549> bad<00:01:44.850> that

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
numbers on it if it's really bad that

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.020 
numbers on it if it's really bad that
effective<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:46.110> you're<00:01:46.500> going<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.680> have<00:01:47.030> 12

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
effective but you're going to have 12

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.910 
effective but you're going to have 12
workers<00:01:48.570> gathering<00:01:49.049> as<00:01:49.170> opposed<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.649> 10

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
workers gathering as opposed to 10

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.469 
workers gathering as opposed to 10
before<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.610> start<00:01:50.850> building<00:01:51.119> your<00:01:51.210> first

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
before you start building your first

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.030 
before you start building your first
Overlord<00:01:51.990> which<00:01:52.320> actually<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:52.799> popped

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
Overlord which actually just popped

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.399 
Overlord which actually just popped
right<00:01:53.250> there<00:01:53.720> so<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.899> seems<00:01:55.140> like<00:01:55.290> you're

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
right there so it seems like you're

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.300 
right there so it seems like you're
going<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.560> be<00:01:55.649> getting<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.890> little<00:01:55.979> extra

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
going to be getting a little extra

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.010 
going to be getting a little extra
minerals<00:01:56.460> from<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.450> numbers<00:01:57.810> seem

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
minerals from that and the numbers seem

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.959 
minerals from that and the numbers seem
like<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.350> would<00:01:58.409> work<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.829> way<00:01:59.009> some<00:01:59.729> people

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
like it would work that way some people

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.280 
like it would work that way some people
debate<00:02:00.210> well<00:02:00.450> if<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.600> get<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> Overlord<00:02:01.170> out

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
debate well if you get the Overlord out

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.840 
debate well if you get the Overlord out
faster<00:02:01.770> rather<00:02:02.040> than<00:02:02.280> building<00:02:02.549> those<00:02:02.700> two

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
faster rather than building those two

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.190 
faster rather than building those two
more<00:02:03.000> drones<00:02:03.270> then<00:02:03.630> you'll<00:02:03.750> bill<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.990> get<00:02:04.079> more

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
more drones then you'll bill to get more

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.899 
more drones then you'll bill to get more
workers<00:02:04.590> out<00:02:04.770> but<00:02:05.130> i<00:02:05.159> don't<00:02:05.700> know<00:02:05.759> i<00:02:05.790> think

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
workers out but i don't know i think

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.850 
workers out but i don't know i think
it's<00:02:06.149> pretty<00:02:06.299> interesting<00:02:06.600> i've<00:02:07.380> implemented

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
it's pretty interesting i've implemented

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.710 
it's pretty interesting i've implemented
it<00:02:08.160> again<00:02:08.789> it's<00:02:08.940> something<00:02:09.179> i<00:02:09.239> saw<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.539> pro

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
it again it's something i saw on a pro

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.300 
it again it's something i saw on a pro
replay<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.319> usually<00:02:10.649> that's<00:02:10.890> someone<00:02:11.550> you

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
replay and usually that's someone you

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.699

not<00:02:13.310> mimic<00:02:13.790> but<00:02:14.060> imitate<00:02:14.629> pro<00:02:15.440> players

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
not mimic but imitate pro players

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.440 
not mimic but imitate pro players
typically<00:02:16.190> have<00:02:16.459> some<00:02:16.700> general<00:02:17.030> idea<00:02:17.269> of<00:02:17.330> what

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
typically have some general idea of what

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.390 
typically have some general idea of what
they're<00:02:17.599> doing<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.799> what<00:02:18.890> are<00:02:18.980> we<00:02:19.040> looking<00:02:19.310> at

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
they're doing so what are we looking at

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.030 
they're doing so what are we looking at
here<00:02:19.459> as<00:02:19.730> far<00:02:19.879> as<00:02:20.000> numbers<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:21.049> do<00:02:21.349> after<00:02:21.799> my

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
here as far as numbers I do after my

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.580 
here as far as numbers I do after my
first<00:02:22.280> Overlord<00:02:22.670> I<00:02:22.819> go<00:02:23.000> 14<00:02:23.750> supply<00:02:24.349> with

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
first Overlord I go 14 supply with

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.990 
first Overlord I go 14 supply with
drones<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.129> then<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:25.280> build<00:02:25.519> my<00:02:25.549> extractor

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
drones and then I build my extractor

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.910 
drones and then I build my extractor
that<00:02:26.150> drops<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.420> be<00:02:26.480> down<00:02:26.629> to<00:02:26.750> 13<00:02:27.140> I<00:02:27.349> get<00:02:27.769> one

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
that drops to be down to 13 I get one

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.160 
that drops to be down to 13 I get one
more<00:02:28.040> drone<00:02:28.340> so<00:02:28.549> at<00:02:28.730> 14<00:02:29.150> supply<00:02:29.420> again<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:29.810> build

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
more drone so at 14 supply again I build

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.199 
more drone so at 14 supply again I build
a<00:02:30.260> spawning<00:02:30.560> pool<00:02:30.860> then<00:02:31.640> with<00:02:31.909> scouting

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
a spawning pool then with scouting

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.970 
a spawning pool then with scouting
information<00:02:32.810> which<00:02:32.959> I<00:02:33.110> moved<00:02:33.319> up<00:02:33.409> my<00:02:33.560> Overlord

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
information which I moved up my Overlord

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.210 
information which I moved up my Overlord
here<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.730> saw<00:02:35.000> he<00:02:35.329> had<00:02:35.360> two<00:02:36.170> gateways<00:02:36.409> and<00:02:36.890> a

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
here and I saw he had two gateways and a

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.740 
here and I saw he had two gateways and a
cybernetic<00:02:37.790> or<00:02:37.940> comments<00:02:38.299> I<00:02:38.329> was<00:02:38.450> like<00:02:38.540> all

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
cybernetic or comments I was like all

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.059 
cybernetic or comments I was like all
right<00:02:38.810> he's<00:02:39.200> going<00:02:39.470> for<00:02:39.590> early<00:02:39.920> game

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
right he's going for early game

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.949 
right he's going for early game
aggression<00:02:40.489> so<00:02:40.670> what<00:02:40.819> am<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:41.000> going<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.299> do<00:02:41.450> I'm

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
aggression so what am I going to do I'm

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.240 
aggression so what am I going to do I'm
going<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.319> go<00:02:42.470> ahead<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.709> build<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.069> roach

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
going to go ahead and build a roach

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.759 
going to go ahead and build a roach
Warren<00:02:43.750> some<00:02:44.750> people<00:02:44.989> may<00:02:45.109> ask<00:02:45.290> me<00:02:45.440> about<00:02:45.560> my

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
Warren some people may ask me about my

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.080 
Warren some people may ask me about my
time<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.160> why<00:02:46.370> did<00:02:46.519> you<00:02:46.609> get<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.819> extractor

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
time and why did you get the extractor

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.610 
time and why did you get the extractor
first<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.690> get<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.870> extractor<00:02:48.079> first<00:02:48.440> because

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
first I get the extractor first because

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.349 
first I get the extractor first because
it<00:02:48.650> I<00:02:49.129> think<00:02:49.459> it<00:02:49.549> opens<00:02:49.879> up<00:02:49.970> a<00:02:50.090> lot<00:02:50.120> more

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
it I think it opens up a lot more

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.690 
it I think it opens up a lot more
avenues<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.840> zerg<00:02:51.379> if<00:02:52.190> you<00:02:52.310> get<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.519> extractor

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
avenues a zerg if you get the extractor

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.880 
avenues a zerg if you get the extractor

he's<00:04:36.979> going<00:04:37.160> to<00:04:37.250> be<00:04:37.340> turning<00:04:37.550> these<00:04:37.789> into<00:04:38.060> warp

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
he's going to be turning these into warp

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.820 
he's going to be turning these into warp
gates<00:04:38.509> and<00:04:38.750> he's<00:04:39.080> going<00:04:39.259> to<00:04:39.319> be<00:04:39.410> able<00:04:39.470> to<00:04:39.620> warp

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
gates and he's going to be able to warp

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.100 
gates and he's going to be able to warp
in<00:04:39.979> units<00:04:40.360> so<00:04:41.360> make<00:04:41.539> the<00:04:41.690> differences

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
in units so make the differences

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.020 
in units so make the differences
subtracting<00:04:42.800> two<00:04:42.949> roaches<00:04:43.160> and<00:04:43.550> attacking

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
subtracting two roaches and attacking

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.210 
subtracting two roaches and attacking
this<00:04:44.330> army<00:04:44.690> or<00:04:44.870> adding<00:04:45.500> two<00:04:45.650> roaches<00:04:45.830> and

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
this army or adding two roaches and

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.550 
this army or adding two roaches and
attacking<00:04:46.699> this<00:04:46.970> army<00:04:47.270> +<00:04:47.569> 3<00:04:47.870> warp<00:04:48.110> gates<00:04:48.319> that

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
attacking this army + 3 warp gates that

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.839 
attacking this army + 3 warp gates that
are<00:04:48.620> going<00:04:48.800> to<00:04:48.860> build<00:04:48.949> a<00:04:49.069> warp<00:04:49.250> in<00:04:49.340> more<00:04:49.550> units

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849 
are going to build a warp in more units

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:51.670 
are going to build a warp in more units
obviously<00:04:50.569> that<00:04:50.690> first<00:04:50.930> scenario<00:04:51.169> attacking

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
obviously that first scenario attacking

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.659 
obviously that first scenario attacking
a<00:04:51.710> little<00:04:51.889> bit<00:04:51.979> earlier<00:04:52.009> would<00:04:52.370> be<00:04:52.430> much

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
a little bit earlier would be much

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.939 
a little bit earlier would be much
better<00:04:52.810> so<00:04:53.810> as<00:04:53.870> you<00:04:53.960> can<00:04:54.020> see<00:04:54.169> moving<00:04:54.500> up<00:04:54.620> I'm

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
better so as you can see moving up I'm

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:56.260 
better so as you can see moving up I'm
going<00:04:55.099> to<00:04:55.160> lose<00:04:55.250> my<00:04:55.310> circling<00:04:55.789> proportion

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
going to lose my circling proportion

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.850 
going to lose my circling proportion
because<00:04:56.389> of<00:04:56.569> this<00:04:56.630> force<00:04:56.930> field<00:04:56.960> and<00:04:57.440> this

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
because of this force field and this

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.080 
because of this force field and this
again<00:04:58.220> puts<00:04:58.460> me<00:04:58.580> in<00:04:58.639> such<00:04:58.669> a<00:04:58.849> dangerous

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
again puts me in such a dangerous

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.240 
again puts me in such a dangerous
position<00:04:59.419> because<00:05:00.139> he<00:05:00.289> can<00:05:00.440> warp<00:05:00.680> in<00:05:00.830> more

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
position because he can warp in more

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.279 
position because he can warp in more
centuries<00:05:01.520> and<00:05:01.970> block<00:05:02.150> me<00:05:02.330> off<00:05:02.449> he<00:05:03.110> does

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
centuries and block me off he does

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:04.659 
centuries and block me off he does
decide<00:05:03.740> to<00:05:03.889> go<00:05:04.099> for<00:05:04.130> a<00:05:04.280> little<00:05:04.340> bit<00:05:04.520> more

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
decide to go for a little bit more

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.040 
decide to go for a little bit more
aggressive<00:05:04.759> o<00:05:05.150> can<00:05:05.330> move<00:05:05.449> and<00:05:05.599> Wharf<00:05:05.780> in<00:05:05.900> more

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
aggressive o can move and Wharf in more

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.860 
aggressive o can move and Wharf in more
stalkers<00:05:06.440> to<00:05:06.590> try<00:05:06.770> to<00:05:06.830> kill<00:05:07.220> my<00:05:07.490> roaches

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
stalkers to try to kill my roaches

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.939 
stalkers to try to kill my roaches
unfortunately<00:05:08.870> stalkers<00:05:09.380> this<00:05:09.620> number<00:05:09.889> of

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
unfortunately stalkers this number of

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:11.350 
unfortunately stalkers this number of
stalkers<00:05:10.310> is<00:05:10.430> not<00:05:10.610> going<00:05:10.759> to<00:05:10.849> kill<00:05:11.000> the<00:05:11.150> summer

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
stalkers is not going to kill the summer

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.379 
stalkers is not going to kill the summer
roaches<00:05:11.870> and<00:05:12.199> that's<00:05:12.770> pretty<00:05:13.009> much<00:05:13.130> it<00:05:13.389> as

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
roaches and that's pretty much it as

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.779 
roaches and that's pretty much it as

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
attack I'm going to be moving up and

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.020 
attack I'm going to be moving up and
actually<00:05:27.470> taking<00:05:27.680> up<00:05:27.889> a<00:05:27.979> pylon<00:05:28.340> to<00:05:28.580> stop<00:05:28.820> them

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
actually taking up a pylon to stop them

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.600 
actually taking up a pylon to stop them
from<00:05:29.180> producing<00:05:29.889> anything<00:05:30.889> now<00:05:31.219> I<00:05:31.250> would<00:05:31.490> be

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
from producing anything now I would be

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.920 
from producing anything now I would be
in<00:05:31.669> a<00:05:31.759> dangerous<00:05:32.000> spot<00:05:32.120> if<00:05:32.389> he<00:05:32.479> was<00:05:32.630> able<00:05:32.780> to

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
in a dangerous spot if he was able to

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.560 
in a dangerous spot if he was able to
get<00:05:33.199> an<00:05:33.409> immortal<00:05:33.860> out<00:05:34.009> but<00:05:34.820> again<00:05:35.060> since<00:05:35.449> he

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
get an immortal out but again since he

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.310 
get an immortal out but again since he
was<00:05:35.690> going<00:05:35.900> for<00:05:36.080> that<00:05:36.110> for<00:05:36.440> work

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
was going for that for work

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.810 
was going for that for work
she<00:05:37.500> didn't<00:05:37.800> have<00:05:37.980> the<00:05:38.010> resources<00:05:38.250> necessary

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
she didn't have the resources necessary

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.720 
she didn't have the resources necessary
at<00:05:39.330> this<00:05:39.570> time<00:05:39.630> in<00:05:40.080> the<00:05:40.170> game<00:05:40.320> to<00:05:41.040> build<00:05:41.580> that

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730 
at this time in the game to build that

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.550 
at this time in the game to build that
immortal<00:05:42.240> so<00:05:42.480> going<00:05:42.990> to<00:05:43.080> be<00:05:43.140> trying<00:05:43.380> to<00:05:43.410> move

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
immortal so going to be trying to move

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.200 
immortal so going to be trying to move
up<00:05:43.710> this<00:05:43.830> probes<00:05:44.100> probes<00:05:44.490> do<00:05:44.670> not<00:05:44.940> do<00:05:45.180> very

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
up this probes probes do not do very

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.390 
up this probes probes do not do very
well<00:05:45.540> against<00:05:46.170> these<00:05:46.350> heavily<00:05:46.860> armed<00:05:47.070> redrew

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
well against these heavily armed redrew

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.580 
well against these heavily armed redrew
armored<00:05:47.850> roaches<00:05:48.330> that's<00:05:49.230> gonna<00:05:49.350> say<00:05:49.530> I'm

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
armored roaches that's gonna say I'm

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.590 
armored roaches that's gonna say I'm
moving<00:05:49.890> in<00:05:49.980> taking<00:05:50.490> out<00:05:50.580> the<00:05:50.820> second<00:05:51.240> pile<00:05:51.390> on

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
moving in taking out the second pile on

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.780 
moving in taking out the second pile on
going<00:05:51.870> to<00:05:51.960> stop<00:05:52.230> any<00:05:52.440> production<00:05:52.740> and<00:05:53.400> that's

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
going to stop any production and that's

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.780 
going to stop any production and that's
pretty<00:05:54.150> much<00:05:54.270> it<00:05:54.890> so<00:05:55.890> yeah<00:05:56.070> going<00:05:56.370> back<00:05:56.520> to<00:05:56.670> the

pretty much it so yeah going back to the

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.870 
pretty much it so yeah going back to the
numbers<00:05:57.120> here<00:05:57.300> real<00:05:57.480> quick<00:05:58.400> again<00:05:59.400> 14

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
numbers here real quick again 14

numbers here real quick again 14
extractor<00:06:00.360> 14<00:06:00.840> pool<00:06:01.110> and<00:06:01.920> then<00:06:02.400> after

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
extractor 14 pool and then after

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.420 
extractor 14 pool and then after
scouting<00:06:03.300> information<00:06:04.020> while<00:06:04.890> producing<00:06:05.220> my

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
scouting information while producing my

scouting information while producing my
queen<00:06:05.700> I<00:06:05.910> decide<00:06:06.300> on<00:06:06.420> my<00:06:06.570> tech<00:06:06.780> and<00:06:07.020> I<00:06:07.110> decided

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
queen I decide on my tech and I decided

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.110
