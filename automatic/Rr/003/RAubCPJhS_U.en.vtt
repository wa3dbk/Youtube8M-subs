their<00:00:39.519> car<00:00:39.699> is<00:00:39.969> how<00:00:40.480> do<00:00:40.539> i<00:00:40.629> power<00:00:40.899> it<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:42.370> let's

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
their car is how do i power it so let's

their car is how do i power it so let's
take<00:00:42.640> a<00:00:42.670> look<00:00:42.820> at<00:00:42.909> how<00:00:42.969> I<00:00:43.000> did<00:00:43.269> it<00:00:43.390> in<00:00:43.510> my<00:00:43.659> car

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
take a look at how I did it in my car

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.920 
take a look at how I did it in my car
and<00:00:44.800> first<00:00:45.100> thing<00:00:45.280> I<00:00:45.370> did<00:00:45.430> was<00:00:46.149> I<00:00:46.269> found<00:00:46.300> out<00:00:46.719> a

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
and first thing I did was I found out a

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.279 
and first thing I did was I found out a
way<00:00:47.109> to<00:00:47.170> tap<00:00:47.500> into<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:48.039> battery<00:00:49.289> my

particular<00:00:50.739> car<00:00:50.949> has<00:00:51.250> a<00:00:51.280> sort<00:00:52.089> of<00:00:52.119> a<00:00:52.239> power

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449

particular car has a sort of a power
distribution<00:00:53.079> block<00:00:53.589> right<00:00:53.829> on<00:00:54.010> top<00:00:54.190> of<00:00:54.339> the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
distribution block right on top of the

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.430 
distribution block right on top of the
battery<00:00:54.729> and<00:00:54.940> what<00:00:55.449> it<00:00:55.539> does<00:00:55.750> is<00:00:55.960> it<00:00:56.079> uses<00:00:56.409> a

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
battery and what it does is it uses a

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.189 
battery and what it does is it uses a
set<00:00:56.680> of<00:00:56.710> fusible<00:00:57.280> links<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:58.570> what<00:00:58.690> a<00:00:58.719> fusible

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
set of fusible links and what a fusible

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.529 
set of fusible links and what a fusible
link<00:00:59.379> does<00:00:59.649> is<00:01:00.010> it<00:01:00.460> essentially<00:01:00.909> provides<00:01:01.030> the

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
link does is it essentially provides the

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.229 
link does is it essentially provides the
same<00:01:01.750> protection<00:01:02.320> as<00:01:02.469> a<00:01:02.559> fuse<00:01:03.339> if<00:01:03.670> I<00:01:03.969> draw<00:01:04.180> too

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
same protection as a fuse if I draw too

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.540 
same protection as a fuse if I draw too
much<00:01:04.539> power<00:01:04.809> it<00:01:05.199> will<00:01:05.530> over<00:01:05.920> a<00:01:05.950> period<00:01:06.189> of<00:01:06.340> time

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.240 
much power it will over a period of time
it<00:01:07.119> will<00:01:07.300> melt<00:01:07.569> and<00:01:07.960> it'll<00:01:08.590> protect<00:01:08.740> my<00:01:09.039> car

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
it will melt and it'll protect my car

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.609
