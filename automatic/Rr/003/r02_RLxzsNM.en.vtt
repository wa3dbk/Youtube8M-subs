wouldn't even know if it was right
around<00:01:22.009> I<00:01:23.330> didn't<00:01:24.330> think<00:01:24.450> there<00:01:24.600> was<00:01:24.659> a

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
around I didn't think there was a

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.789 
around I didn't think there was a
problem<00:01:25.189> straight<00:01:26.189> straight<00:01:26.460> away<00:01:26.729> but<00:01:26.759> I

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
problem straight straight away but I

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.770 
problem straight straight away but I
decide<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.829> haven't<00:01:29.070> seen<00:01:29.220> her<00:01:29.369> video<00:01:29.700> either

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.450 

sure<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.990> know<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.590> something<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.070> that

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
sure you know with something like that

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.420 
sure you know with something like that
happens<00:01:35.970> any<00:01:36.150> there

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.430 

I<00:01:42.540> don't<00:01:43.540> think<00:01:43.750> that's<00:01:43.870> the<00:01:44.020> winning<00:01:44.320> and

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
I don't think that's the winning and

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.000 
I don't think that's the winning and
losing<00:01:44.530> in<00:01:44.800> the<00:01:44.830> game<00:01:45.040> I<00:01:45.520> can<00:01:46.270> myself<00:01:47.010> for

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
losing in the game I can myself for

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.110 
losing in the game I can myself for
there<00:01:48.160> for<00:01:48.370> there<00:01:48.580> try<00:01:49.290> late<00:01:50.290> in<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.470> game<00:01:50.590> and

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
there for there try late in the game and

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.030 
there for there try late in the game and
we<00:01:52.120> probably<00:01:52.330> gave<00:01:52.540> him<00:01:52.660> a<00:01:52.690> lot<00:01:52.810> of<00:01:52.930> ball<00:01:53.080> early

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
we probably gave him a lot of ball early

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.260 
we probably gave him a lot of ball early
on<00:01:54.130> in<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.340> game<00:01:54.370> that<00:01:54.520> we<00:01:54.760> shouldn't<00:01:54.970> have<00:01:55.150> as

and<00:02:12.040> that's<00:02:12.370> what<00:02:12.610> cost<00:02:12.790> us<00:02:12.970> again<00:02:21.209> I<00:02:22.260> think<00:02:23.260> we

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
and that's what cost us again I think we

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.170 
and that's what cost us again I think we
conceded<00:02:23.739> a<00:02:23.920> lot<00:02:24.040> of<00:02:24.160> momentum<00:02:24.580> in<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:24.970> first

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
conceded a lot of momentum in the first

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.290 
conceded a lot of momentum in the first
half<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.630> give<00:02:25.780> them<00:02:25.959> a<00:02:25.989> lot<00:02:26.200> of<00:02:26.290> belief<00:02:27.300> we're

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
half and give them a lot of belief we're

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.970 
half and give them a lot of belief we're
covered<00:02:28.540> in<00:02:28.660> defend<00:02:29.050> with<00:02:29.230> our<00:02:29.350> heads<00:02:29.530> up<00:02:29.739> like

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
covered in defend with our heads up like

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.620 
covered in defend with our heads up like
like<00:02:30.220> we<00:02:30.430> showed<00:02:30.610> our<00:02:30.760> scramble<00:02:31.150> defense<00:02:31.420> was

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
like we showed our scramble defense was

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.650 
like we showed our scramble defense was
really<00:02:31.900> good<00:02:32.080> but<00:02:33.150> we<00:02:34.150> got<00:02:34.330> caught<00:02:34.540> in<00:02:34.630> the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
really good but we got caught in the

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.479 
really good but we got caught in the
short<00:02:34.930> side<00:02:35.170> once<00:02:35.410> or<00:02:35.560> twice<00:02:35.650> They<00:02:36.459> Carried

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
hire us on the void channels and we just

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.610 
hire us on the void channels and we just
got<00:02:39.520> just<00:02:40.480> got<00:02:40.600> caught<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.020> gave<00:02:41.230> them<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.440> lot

of<00:02:41.709> momentum<00:02:41.950> against<00:02:42.520> us<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:42.820> we<00:02:42.910> struggled

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
of momentum against us and we struggled

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.580 
of momentum against us and we struggled
to<00:02:43.390> get<00:02:43.480> into<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.810> game<00:02:43.930> in<00:02:44.110> that<00:02:44.200> first<00:02:44.470> half

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
to get into the game in that first half

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.050 
to get into the game in that first half
you<00:02:44.980> know<00:02:45.070> it<00:02:45.130> took<00:02:45.280> us<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.459> while<00:02:45.640> before<00:02:45.910> we

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
you know it took us a while before we

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.090 
you know it took us a while before we
got<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.780> bit<00:02:46.959> of<00:02:47.019> foothold<00:02:47.380> in<00:02:47.500> territory<00:02:47.980> and

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
got a bit of foothold in territory and

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.740 
got a bit of foothold in territory and
started<00:02:48.459> playing<00:02:48.700> ball<00:02:48.910> ourselves<00:02:49.390> when<00:02:49.660> we

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
started playing ball ourselves when we

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.310 
started playing ball ourselves when we
did<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:50.920> scored<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.280> good<00:02:51.430> try<00:02:51.640> but<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:53.170> know

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
did you scored a good try but you know

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.289 
did you scored a good try but you know
you<00:02:53.799> can't<00:02:54.010> do<00:02:54.190> that<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.519> can't<00:02:54.549> give<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.030> team

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
you can't do that you can't give a team

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.140 
you can't do that you can't give a team
that<00:02:55.570> kind<00:02:55.840> of<00:02:56.100> link<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.220> time<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.459> ball<00:02:57.820> in<00:02:58.000> hand

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
that kind of link to time a ball in hand

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:06.170 
that kind of link to time a ball in hand
it<00:02:58.570> puts<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.019> under<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.260> lot<00:02:59.380> of<00:02:59.410> pressure<00:02:59.680> and

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.930 

look<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:07.390> don't<00:03:08.140> worry<00:03:08.470> up<00:03:08.620> at<00:03:08.769> a<00:03:08.799> nut<00:03:09.070> nice<00:03:09.730> ok

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
look I don't worry up at a nut nice ok

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.930 
look I don't worry up at a nut nice ok
and<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:10.900> think<00:03:11.530> Jeff<00:03:11.739> a<00:03:11.890> process<00:03:12.580> and<00:03:12.610> a<00:03:12.790> lot<00:03:12.910> of

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
and I think Jeff a process and a lot of

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.280 
and I think Jeff a process and a lot of
pressure<00:03:13.180> defensively<00:03:13.630> we<00:03:13.840> had<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.019> defend

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
pressure defensively we had to defend

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.070 
pressure defensively we had to defend
for<00:03:14.530> sixty<00:03:14.940> sixty<00:03:15.940> percent<00:03:16.330> close<00:03:16.810> of<00:03:16.989> the

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
for sixty sixty percent close of the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.570 
for sixty sixty percent close of the
game<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:17.500> if<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:17.739> do<00:03:18.010> that<00:03:18.190> you're<00:03:18.370> going<00:03:18.519> to

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
game and if you do that you're going to

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.710 
game and if you do that you're going to
ask<00:03:18.760> for<00:03:18.970> trouble<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:20.820> check<00:03:21.820> wise<00:03:22.090> we

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
ask for trouble and check wise we

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.330 
ask for trouble and check wise we
weren't<00:03:22.989> too<00:03:23.170> bad<00:03:23.320> once<00:03:23.560> we<00:03:23.709> got<00:03:23.860> into<00:03:24.040> their

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
weren't too bad once we got into their

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.110 
weren't too bad once we got into their
green<00:03:25.180> into<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.570> Green<00:03:25.750> Zone<00:03:25.780> into<00:03:26.140> their<00:03:26.260> 22

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
green into the Green Zone into their 22

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.479 
green into the Green Zone into their 22
there<00:03:28.120> was<00:03:28.209> aspect<00:03:28.600> service<00:03:28.900> we<00:03:29.290> with<00:03:30.130> some

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
there was aspect service we with some

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.009 
there was aspect service we with some
some<00:03:30.940> Chinese<00:03:31.269> we<00:03:31.360> probably<00:03:31.570> played<00:03:31.750> around

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
some Chinese we probably played around

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.170 
some Chinese we probably played around
the<00:03:32.170> halfway<00:03:32.290> line<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:33.489> we<00:03:33.640> just<00:03:33.820> need<00:03:34.000> to

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
the halfway line and we just need to

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.759 
the halfway line and we just need to
some<00:03:34.540> of<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.690> guys<00:03:34.840> need<00:03:35.080> to<00:03:35.200> look<00:03:35.410> up<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.560> see

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
some of the guys need to look up to see

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.110 
some of the guys need to look up to see
what<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:35.980> options<00:03:36.010> that<00:03:36.370> are<00:03:36.610> available<00:03:36.640> to

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
what the options that are available to

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.030 
what the options that are available to
them<00:03:37.390> and<00:03:38.049> I<00:03:38.140> think<00:03:38.320> we<00:03:38.410> can<00:03:38.500> improve<00:03:38.739> their

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
them and I think we can improve their

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.120 
them and I think we can improve their
and<00:03:40.200> some<00:03:41.200> of<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.350> aspects<00:03:41.680> were<00:03:41.769> quite<00:03:41.950> good

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
and some of the aspects were quite good

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.190 
and some of the aspects were quite good
at<00:03:42.310> our<00:03:42.459> lineup<00:03:42.970> went<00:03:43.209> well<00:03:43.390> defensively<00:03:43.780> end

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
at our lineup went well defensively end

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.340 
at our lineup went well defensively end
in<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.440> check<00:03:45.030> scrolls<00:03:46.030> were<00:03:46.209> 5050<00:03:46.810> the

get to a j whereby you're getting a few
hands<00:03:51.190> on<00:03:51.310> it<00:03:51.430> but<00:03:51.580> you're<00:03:51.700> not<00:03:51.790> getting<00:03:52.060> much

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150
