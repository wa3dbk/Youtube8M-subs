so<00:00:16.209> what<00:00:16.840> this<00:00:16.990> skill<00:00:17.260> does<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:18.670> the<00:00:18.880> first

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
so what this skill does is the first

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.090 
so what this skill does is the first
aspect<00:00:19.510> of<00:00:19.779> it<00:00:19.930> is<00:00:20.080> that<00:00:20.380> the<00:00:20.560> bleed<00:00:20.860> skill

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100 
aspect of it is that the bleed skill

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.970 
aspect of it is that the bleed skill
kind<00:00:21.369> of<00:00:21.430> like<00:00:21.550> rent<00:00:21.790> or<00:00:22.360> does<00:00:22.600> 745<00:00:23.350> percent

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
kind of like rent or does 745 percent

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.240 
kind of like rent or does 745 percent
weapon<00:00:24.250> damage<00:00:24.400> over<00:00:25.240> nine<00:00:25.420> seconds<00:00:26.070> well<00:00:27.070> for

weapon damage over nine seconds well for
most<00:00:27.369> monks<00:00:27.730> this<00:00:27.849> isn't<00:00:28.119> going<00:00:28.240> to<00:00:28.300> be<00:00:28.390> overly

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
most monks this isn't going to be overly

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.080 
most monks this isn't going to be overly
significant<00:00:29.439> because<00:00:29.950> they're<00:00:30.220> using<00:00:30.579> fast

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
significant because they're using fast

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.550 
significant because they're using fast
attack<00:00:31.390> speed<00:00:31.630> rather<00:00:31.840> than<00:00:32.110> really<00:00:32.320> high

still 745 percent weapon damage which is

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.120 
still 745 percent weapon damage which is
is<00:00:39.670> big<00:00:40.060> where<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:40.810> skill<00:00:41.170> really<00:00:41.620> comes<00:00:41.829> knew

rector help whether using higher monster
power<00:01:22.570> any<00:01:23.170> of<00:01:23.500> those<00:01:23.650> things<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:25.630> gain<00:01:25.900> the

power any of those things you gain the
the<00:01:28.060> explosion<00:01:28.630> or<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:29.020> fifty<00:01:29.500> percent<00:01:29.770> of

the explosion or the fifty percent of

the explosion or the fifty percent of
the<00:01:30.340> life<00:01:30.570> using<00:01:31.570> all<00:01:31.780> of<00:01:31.810> those<00:01:32.140> items<00:01:33.659> or

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
the life using all of those items or

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.120 
the life using all of those items or
taking<00:01:35.170> all<00:01:35.260> of<00:01:35.290> those<00:01:35.530> things<00:01:35.590> into<00:01:36.010> account

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
taking all of those things into account

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.770 
taking all of those things into account
so<00:01:36.550> it<00:01:36.610> becomes<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:37.000> really<00:01:37.420> really<00:01:37.630> powerful

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
so it becomes a really really powerful

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.510 
so it becomes a really really powerful
skill<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:41.290> first<00:01:41.590> one<00:01:41.770> choice<00:01:42.070> is<00:01:42.370> the

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
skill the first one choice is the

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.969 
skill the first one choice is the
flushes<00:01:42.880> week<00:01:43.120> so<00:01:43.870> in<00:01:44.020> my<00:01:44.170> opinion<00:01:44.320> this<00:01:44.710> is<00:01:44.770> by

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
flushes week so in my opinion this is by

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.550 
flushes week so in my opinion this is by
far<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.250> strongest<00:01:45.909> because<00:01:46.870> in<00:01:47.080> addition<00:01:47.200> to

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
far the strongest because in addition to

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.610 
far the strongest because in addition to
the<00:01:48.299> 745<00:01:49.299> percent<00:01:49.720> weapon<00:01:49.990> damage<00:01:50.110> they're

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
the 745 percent weapon damage they're

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.750 
the 745 percent weapon damage they're
taking<00:01:51.070> already<00:01:52.890> you're<00:01:53.890> also<00:01:54.100> dealing<00:01:54.430> an

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
taking already you're also dealing an

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.469 
taking already you're also dealing an
extra<00:01:55.060> nine<00:01:55.240> percent<00:01:55.690> weapon<00:01:55.990> damage<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.790> to

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
extra nine percent weapon damage to to

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.710 
extra nine percent weapon damage to to
that<00:01:58.690> specific<00:01:58.930> enemy<00:01:59.580> it<00:02:00.580> is<00:02:00.790> only<00:02:00.970> not<00:02:01.299> enemy

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
that specific enemy it is only not enemy

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.690 
that specific enemy it is only not enemy
at<00:02:01.810> still<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.680> fifty<00:02:02.950> percent<00:02:03.280> but<00:02:03.580> you're

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
at still the fifty percent but you're

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.120 
at still the fifty percent but you're
going<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:03.909> kill<00:02:04.150> guys<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.450> lot<00:02:04.780> faster<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.860> only

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
going to kill guys a lot faster the only

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.920 
going to kill guys a lot faster the only
disadvantage<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.909> killing<00:02:07.240> them<00:02:07.360> faster<00:02:07.750> is

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
disadvantage a killing them faster is

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.130 
disadvantage a killing them faster is
the<00:02:08.679> fact<00:02:08.890> that<00:02:09.009> you<00:02:09.849> are<00:02:10.119> going<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.659> be<00:02:10.810> using

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
the fact that you are going to be using

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.520 
the fact that you are going to be using
more<00:02:11.769> more<00:02:12.459> spirit<00:02:13.000> as<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.180> result<00:02:13.629> definitely

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
more more spirit as a result definitely

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.020 
more more spirit as a result definitely
not<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.680> bad<00:02:14.920> thing<00:02:15.159> since<00:02:15.459> you're<00:02:15.700> you're

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
not a bad thing since you're you're

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.430 
not a bad thing since you're you're
killing<00:02:16.390> guy<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:16.720> quickly<00:02:17.080> and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
killing guy so quickly and

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.980 
killing guy so quickly and
again<00:02:18.710> I<00:02:18.740> think<00:02:18.890> this<00:02:19.190> is<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.640> best<00:02:20.240> of<00:02:20.510> all<00:02:20.720> of

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
again I think this is the best of all of

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.690 
again I think this is the best of all of
their<00:02:21.140> own<00:02:21.320> choices<00:02:21.590> available<00:02:21.860> once<00:02:22.460> the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
their own choices available once the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.430 
their own choices available once the
first<00:02:22.910> one<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.180> get<00:02:27.220> so<00:02:28.220> let<00:02:28.520> me<00:02:28.550> just<00:02:29.440> helps

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
first one you get so let me just helps

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.780 
first one you get so let me just helps
if<00:02:30.590> you're<00:02:30.740> in<00:02:30.890> range<00:02:31.100> when<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:32.030> use<00:02:32.210> it

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.059 

just<00:02:37.629> kill<00:02:38.019> these<00:02:38.260> guys<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.739> then<00:02:38.829> we'll<00:02:38.950> go

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
just kill these guys and then we'll go

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:48.300 
just kill these guys and then we'll go
to<00:02:39.129> town<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.400> switch<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.879> burns<00:02:47.069> so<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.159> next

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
to town and switch it burns so the next

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.759 
to town and switch it burns so the next
year<00:02:48.489> in<00:02:48.549> Joyce's<00:02:48.969> strong<00:02:49.239> spirit<00:02:49.689> I<00:02:49.900> don't

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
year in Joyce's strong spirit I don't

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.979 
year in Joyce's strong spirit I don't
think<00:02:50.829> this<00:02:51.040> is<00:02:51.099> overly<00:02:51.549> beneficial<00:02:52.150> anyone

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
think this is overly beneficial anyone

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.099 
think this is overly beneficial anyone
who's<00:02:53.200> hit<00:02:53.680> with<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.250> explosion<00:02:55.000> radius<00:02:55.150> you

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
who's hit with the explosion radius you

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.849 
who's hit with the explosion radius you
gained<00:02:56.290> five<00:02:56.530> spirit<00:02:56.980> for<00:02:57.250> that<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:58.180> overall

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
gained five spirit for that so overall

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.319 
gained five spirit for that so overall
don't<00:02:59.859> think<00:03:00.010> it's<00:03:00.159> a<00:03:00.250> it's<00:03:00.640> a<00:03:01.000> really

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
don't think it's a it's a really

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.319 
don't think it's a it's a really
significant<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:03.400> creeping<00:03:03.760> demise<00:03:04.000> is<00:03:04.209> the

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
significant so creeping demise is the

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.740 
significant so creeping demise is the
next<00:03:04.569> one<00:03:05.189> reduces<00:03:06.189> the<00:03:06.280> movement<00:03:06.639> speed<00:03:06.909> by

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
next one reduces the movement speed by

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.330 
next one reduces the movement speed by
eighty<00:03:08.230> percent<00:03:08.769> for<00:03:09.459> three<00:03:09.849> seconds<00:03:10.329> as<00:03:11.340> I've

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
eighty percent for three seconds as I've

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.129 
eighty percent for three seconds as I've
said<00:03:12.370> before<00:03:12.579> I<00:03:13.060> don't<00:03:13.329> think<00:03:13.720> that<00:03:13.780> reduced

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
said before I don't think that reduced

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.520 
said before I don't think that reduced
movement<00:03:14.530> speed<00:03:14.739> for<00:03:15.189> a<00:03:15.629> monk<00:03:16.629> is<00:03:16.840> very

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
movement speed for a monk is very

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.009 
movement speed for a monk is very
effective<00:03:17.889> whatsoever<00:03:18.639> and<00:03:18.909> the<00:03:19.689> reason

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
effective whatsoever and the reason

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.599 
effective whatsoever and the reason
being<00:03:20.049> is<00:03:20.530> because<00:03:20.560> of<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.099> fact<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.430> you're

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
being is because of the fact that you're

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.690 
being is because of the fact that you're
already<00:03:21.819> in<00:03:22.000> melee<00:03:22.329> range<00:03:22.629> and<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.950> the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
already in melee range and so the

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.069 
already in melee range and so the
reduced<00:03:25.030> movement<00:03:25.389> speed<00:03:25.569> isn't<00:03:25.780> going<00:03:26.019> to

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
reduced movement speed isn't going to

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:39.450 
reduced movement speed isn't going to
help<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.409> much<00:03:26.590> at<00:03:26.739> all

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:46.180 

so<00:03:40.460> even<00:03:41.060> if<00:03:41.240> they<00:03:41.480> do<00:03:41.540> survive<00:03:44.350> then<00:03:45.350> since

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
so even if they do survive then since

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.070 
so even if they do survive then since
they're<00:03:46.340> already<00:03:46.610> within<00:03:46.880> melee<00:03:47.270> range<00:03:47.600> it's

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
they're already within melee range it's

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.510 
they're already within melee range it's
not<00:03:48.350> going<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.710> provide<00:03:48.980> a<00:03:49.040> whole<00:03:49.310> lot<00:03:49.490> of

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
not going to provide a whole lot of

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:59.380 
not going to provide a whole lot of
benefit

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.180 

so<00:04:00.390> I'm<00:04:00.990> not<00:04:01.170> going<00:04:01.380> to<00:04:01.470> show<00:04:01.620> this<00:04:01.800> one<00:04:01.980> much

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
so I'm not going to show this one much

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.400 
so I'm not going to show this one much
more<00:04:02.220> i<00:04:02.760> will<00:04:03.120> look<00:04:03.270> for<00:04:03.330> one<00:04:03.720> more<00:04:03.930> enemy<00:04:04.140> and

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
more i will look for one more enemy and

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.310 
more i will look for one more enemy and
see<00:04:04.530> if<00:04:04.590> we<00:04:04.770> can<00:04:04.950> can<00:04:05.760> see<00:04:06.030> it<00:04:06.120> happening<00:04:06.600> it

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
see if we can can see it happening it

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.410 
see if we can can see it happening it
does<00:04:07.620> happen<00:04:07.800> sometimes<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.700> all<00:04:08.790> depends<00:04:09.240> on

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
does happen sometimes it all depends on

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.600 
does happen sometimes it all depends on
who<00:04:09.720> you're<00:04:09.840> targeting<00:04:10.190> and<00:04:11.190> what<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.460> other

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
who you're targeting and what the other

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.680 
who you're targeting and what the other
enemies<00:04:12.000> are<00:04:12.180> nearby<00:04:12.480> or<00:04:12.810> like<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:14.670> how<00:04:15.540> much

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
enemies are nearby or like and how much

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.229 
enemies are nearby or like and how much
damage<00:04:15.900> you've<00:04:16.230> done<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.440> do<00:04:17.070> them<00:04:20.030> all<00:04:21.030> right

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
damage you've done to do them all right

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:28.610 
damage you've done to do them all right
let's<00:04:21.450> switch<00:04:21.630> things<00:04:21.780> up<00:04:26.990> so<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.260> next<00:04:28.290> round

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
let's switch things up so the next round

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.830 
let's switch things up so the next round
choice<00:04:28.890> is<00:04:29.070> impending<00:04:29.370> doom<00:04:29.720> it's<00:04:30.720> a

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
choice is impending doom it's a

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.420 
choice is impending doom it's a
counterintuitive<00:04:31.320> spell<00:04:31.710> because<00:04:31.920> normally

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
counterintuitive spell because normally

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.460 
counterintuitive spell because normally
you're<00:04:32.580> doing<00:04:32.790> 745<00:04:33.780> percent<00:04:34.140> weapon<00:04:34.380> damage

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
you're doing 745 percent weapon damage

you're doing 745 percent weapon damage
over<00:04:34.830> 9<00:04:35.040> seconds<00:04:35.520> now<00:04:36.120> it's<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.540> same<00:04:36.780> amount

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
over 9 seconds now it's the same amount

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.740 
over 9 seconds now it's the same amount
of<00:04:37.110> weapon<00:04:37.410> damage<00:04:37.560> but<00:04:38.100> over<00:04:38.310> 15<00:04:38.640> seconds<00:04:39.150> so

within<00:05:00.870> 15<00:05:01.380> you<00:05:02.040> may<00:05:02.220> use<00:05:02.370> impending<00:05:02.760> doom<00:05:02.970> I

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
within 15 you may use impending doom I

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.150 
within 15 you may use impending doom I
still<00:05:04.080> think<00:05:04.260> the<00:05:04.320> flushes<00:05:04.650> week<00:05:04.800> is<00:05:04.950> much

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
still think the flushes week is much

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.580 
still think the flushes week is much
much<00:05:05.340> stronger<00:05:05.580> so<00:05:06.480> the<00:05:06.510> last<00:05:06.780> one<00:05:06.990> is<00:05:07.230> essence

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
much stronger so the last one is essence

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.550 
much stronger so the last one is essence
burn<00:05:07.860> so<00:05:08.669> the<00:05:09.000> advantage<00:05:09.240> of<00:05:09.540> this<00:05:09.690> one<00:05:09.990> is<00:05:10.260> the

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
burn so the advantage of this one is the

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.080 
burn so the advantage of this one is the
skill<00:05:11.160> han<00:05:12.560> can<00:05:13.560> stack<00:05:13.860> for<00:05:14.640> lack<00:05:14.820> of<00:05:14.850> a<00:05:15.060> better

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
skill han can stack for lack of a better

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.380 
skill han can stack for lack of a better
word<00:05:15.300> because<00:05:15.780> you'll<00:05:15.930> target<00:05:16.440> one<00:05:16.620> enemy<00:05:16.770> and

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
word because you'll target one enemy and

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.480 
word because you'll target one enemy and
then<00:05:18.390> when<00:05:18.540> he<00:05:18.570> dies<00:05:18.930> he<00:05:19.350> will<00:05:20.090> explode<00:05:21.090> and

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
then when he dies he will explode and

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.380 
then when he dies he will explode and
then<00:05:23.490> not<00:05:23.729> one<00:05:23.910> explodes<00:05:24.390> and<00:05:26.120> then<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.270> next

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
then not one explodes and then the next

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.080 
then not one explodes and then the next
one<00:05:27.600> could<00:05:27.780> explode<00:05:28.169> and<00:05:28.770> so<00:05:29.100> it<00:05:29.220> can<00:05:29.490> can

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
one could explode and so it can can

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.610 
one could explode and so it can can
stack<00:05:31.160> but<00:05:32.160> overall<00:05:32.610> I<00:05:33.320> still<00:05:34.320> don't<00:05:34.530> think

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
stack but overall I still don't think

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.810 
stack but overall I still don't think
that<00:05:34.950> it's<00:05:35.100> a<00:05:35.810> the<00:05:36.810> greatest<00:05:37.290> of<00:05:37.470> all<00:05:37.820> greatest

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
that it's a the greatest of all greatest

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.330 
that it's a the greatest of all greatest
going

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
going

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.520 
going
it's<00:05:41.090> probably<00:05:41.449> the<00:05:41.720> second<00:05:42.169> best<00:05:42.260> friend

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
it's probably the second best friend

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.900 
it's probably the second best friend
choice<00:05:42.740> in<00:05:42.949> my<00:05:43.100> opinion<00:05:43.130> but<00:05:45.130> definitely<00:05:46.130> not

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
choice in my opinion but definitely not

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:54.480 
choice in my opinion but definitely not
