00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.300
Draw

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:20.633
I'll use "Recurring Nightmare" to get back "Tristan, Knight of the Underworld" and "Uni-Zombie".

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:26.833
Next, "Allure of Darkness". Draw 2.

00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:38.000
And now I'll use "Dragon's Mirror", banishing 2 Zombies to Summon...

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.033
"Dragonecro Nethersoul Dragon".

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:46.267
I'll Normal Summon Tristan

00:00:46.267 --> 00:00:51.900
and use its effect to get back "Isolde, Belle of the Underworld".

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.300
And I'll Special Summon it.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.067
I'll negate the Summon with Grysta.

00:01:01.067 --> 00:01:06.267
I'll negate Grysta with "Forbidden Chalice".

00:01:06.267 --> 00:01:11.167
Now Isolde's effect, both my Zombies become Level 8.

00:01:11.167 --> 00:01:17.300
Then I'll overlay them to Xyz Summon...

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.000
"Lancelot, Ghost Knight of the Underworld".

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.067
Lancelot attacks you directly.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.433
And now, Lancelot's effect destroys one of your monsters.

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:43.933
I'll choose Construct.

00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:46.167
I'll use Construct's effect.

00:01:46.167 --> 00:01:49.800
Lancelot negates.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.800
Now Dragonecro attacks Grysta.

00:02:00.267 --> 00:02:03.000
Don't worry, it's not destroyed in battle.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.600
But its ATK becomes 0, And I get to Summon a "Dark Soul Token".

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.633
Finish it!

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:19.467
Hold on, I'll activate "Shaddoll Core".

00:02:19.467 --> 00:02:22.467
Then I'll use "El Shaddoll Fusion".

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:30.300
Fusing my Core and Grysta to Summon...

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.433
"El Shaddoll Anoyatyllis" in Defense Mode.

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:43.233
Grysta and Core both go off, so I'll get back "El Shaddoll Fusion" and "Nephe Shaddoll Fusion".

00:02:43.233 --> 00:02:47.967
Then Dark Soul Token attacks Anoyatyllis.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:53.600
I'll use Wendigo's effect, making Anoyatyllis indestructible in battle.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.100
It's your move.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.333
I draw.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.833
First I'll Flip Summon "El Shaddoll Shekhinaga".

00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:27.567
Then I'll use "Shaddoll Fusion".

00:03:27.567 --> 00:03:30.400
I'll negate it with Lancelot.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.800
I'll negate Lancelot with Shekhinaga.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.733
Destroying Lancelot, then I send a Shaddoll card to the grave.

00:03:39.733 --> 00:03:50.600
And now, Shaddoll Fusion fuses Falco and Wyverburster from the deck to Summonâ€¦

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.867
Construct.

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:59.100
How many Constructs do you run, anyway? I'm getting bored of that card!

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.700
Just 3.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.400
Falco and Construct both go off.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.900
So I'll send Beast to the grave, and Set Falco.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.133
Now Beast's effect. I draw.

00:04:15.133 --> 00:04:19.400
I'll switch Wendigo and Anoyatyllis to Attack Mode.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.133
Then I'll attack!

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.533
My Battle Phase isn't over yet.

00:04:56.533 --> 00:05:07.067
I'll use El Shaddoll Fusion, fusing Falco and Wendigo to Summon...

00:05:07.067 --> 00:05:10.433
"El Shaddoll Winda".

00:05:10.433 --> 00:05:11.733
Attack!

00:05:19.133 --> 00:05:22.967
What a shame... You couldn't finish me off this turn.

00:05:22.967 --> 00:05:27.067
I will next turn. Give me your best shot.

00:05:27.067 --> 00:05:30.267
Oh I will. Draw.

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:39.767
I'll Summon "Ghost Charon, the Underworld Boatman".

00:05:39.767 --> 00:05:48.900
And use its effect, banishing Dragonecro and itself to Summon...

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.433
"Dragocytos, Corrupted Nethersoul Dragon".

00:05:53.433 --> 00:05:54.733
Oh no!

00:05:54.733 --> 00:05:56.600
And I attack!

00:06:09.767 --> 00:06:14.133
And that ends the game.

00:06:14.133 --> 00:06:18.967
Aw man... How could I lose to a rogue deck?

00:06:18.967 --> 00:06:25.867
Oh who cares what kind of deck it is? It really just comes down to who the better player is.

00:06:25.867 --> 00:06:31.700
Please don't tell anyone I lost to Vampires. I'll be a laughing stock!

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:38.367
Hun, don't take this the wrong way, but I don't think anyone knows who you are. I'm just saying.

00:06:38.367 --> 00:06:41.867
Oh, that makes me feel a lot better...

00:06:41.867 --> 00:06:44.900
Oh good, then my job here is done.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.233
Shaki, where is my double gulp? I'm thirsty.

00:06:48.233 --> 00:06:50.233
I drank it all.

00:06:50.233 --> 00:06:54.600
Well, then I guess it's back to the gas station for us, baby.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.133
Peace, dude.

00:06:56.133 --> 00:06:58.067
Peace, Onomatopoeia.
00:06:58.067,00:00:00.000
Holla!
