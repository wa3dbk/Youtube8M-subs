00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:03.960
 what happened Oslo but the better team locked up yet 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.920
 lost 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.510
 stupid mistakes and 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.879
 from there spices St 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.919
 it was an unnecessary at the hedgehog also easier because he has the 2 0 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:15.699
 make Odessa sack 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.679
 just what a blind that today we have the 2 0 led it 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:21.109
 executed to that the wood or been 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.380
 that's football 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.739
 I'm a world champion but not a minute and Sung really need to be Dr 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.440
 The players think it was I have gone or got it to the kidneys 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.830
 no big worry what a defeat against FC Zurich is 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.019
 probably doubly annoying 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.450
 yes they are annoying of course very clear choice it is a derby 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.900
 He totally got us all because we really want to win this derby 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.730
 want to win it over and the players can sometimes get annoyed about and 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.360
 Percent right choice because they know percent that's a derby that's yes 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.580
 clearly and that's just the end then so have given foreign countries 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.410
 this google eye was 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.360
 unnecessary 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.390
 yes needless to clear if you lead 1 0 one i believed he had more play in 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.870
 Handle if not usual did not think that can lose 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.980
 around normal standard situation 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.390
 if he took care of me that may have assumed dynamics we want 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.150
 is necessarily a percent of his 2 1 man is the sun something in the team 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.800
 yes that she really wants to win yes and the Dane 1 1 on the 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.240
 Bring rounds but because the man is supposed to get 1 1 so close to the end 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.880
 then it is usually so that he still has a chance that then shocked 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.950
 Jam is but then we have to concentrate again the ball in possession 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.460
 stay yes and keep calm the 1 1 then take percent as it is because 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.930
 there are still many games and there are still some and again some of them playing 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.450
 become 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.600
 to make good 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.740
 Just because the second lotus has to go to Rheine 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.600
 yes we have that even if it would not be able to transfer 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.850
 Well, it is also harder for us to find around there you have to go 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.570
 play across but the revenue situation, I would have liked to be more on 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.830
 Ball held up instead of immediately trying to return the pass in depth 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.269
 to search in possession so far remain most important even as percent 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.810
 Defensive the Babelsberg opponents no 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.570
 do not scoreline, then lost the ball too fast Jamnig percent the 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.750
 Mix found to know now is a counter situation 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.060
 and now you have to name them Basler Hallein as percent in the wrong one 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.039
 Decision made 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:26.009
 then when we countered Conner Chance, Honda also had percent there 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:27.359
 the counter chances are not well completed
