 is about 20 years old 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.970
 for those who do not know the beginning of the dubbing is 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.450
 always the same for people 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.829

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.800
 sitting watching watching no 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.570
 doing nothing 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.160
 Then one day a director went with his face. 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.760
 Tell me, what if you made a 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.010

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.629
 here a little bit there in my 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.879
 if I say I did one 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.079
 stage of a minute and began to dub 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.030
 and I already knew milton da mata 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.820

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.549

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.640
 invited to dub narratives 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.350
 so I was there I went to watch the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.840
 recording to the stage for whatever 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.360
 how much time would you make at the time 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.700
 I sat down to start the stage has 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.810
 chamon voice to be able to do the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.659
 his character 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.670
 this value had been missing and coincident 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.130
 interest in the voice similar to my 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.979
 so I sat for 11 minutes and it was 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.500
 Felipe the missing voice actor you do not want 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.549
 make his character 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.790
 I went there and went to get a 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.860
 a film only in that time 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.649
 studying together it is common nowadays that it is 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.399
 separated and there who was doing scene 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.790
 with me it was marlene costa that is like a 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.610
 mother for me and nowadays and then she 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.350
 just made the scene famous guy 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.350
 like your grandmother that I'll start 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.509
 Talk, I 'm going to start a Mexican novel. 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.409
 next week you do not want 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.200
 to participate 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.020
 and then the next week it was starting 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.390
 a Mexican novel and my scene was 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.300
 with the director of rbs richa was 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.650
 dubbing there also inflated boy I liked 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.090

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.159
 next week I 'll start drawing 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.769
 You do not want to dribble the cold and I want to 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.299
 then in two weeks it was already in the 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.250
 network brawls a month I was an employee 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.129
 company and employee 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.950
 so that was all very fast 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.049
 a one-minute stage has already emerged 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.980
 recording and another and another and there I'm in 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:37.079
 even today with 1 year of dubbing I 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.260
 I confess I did not know from the side 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.750
 right is a friend of mine 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.720

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.819
 Disney and this is redoubled the lady and the 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.609
 hobo and she was invited to do 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.129
 a test with a character to make the 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:55.109
 lady owner and she did not know blah blah 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.540
 It was Felipe giving me some dubbing lessons. 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:00.450
 I said man, it's only a full year. 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.439
 class home there teaches how does 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.599
 anything and there is I went home 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:11.040
 a whole week every day 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:12.389
 afternoon and it was singing the 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.530
 television 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:19.829
 I put a vhs it was not even a dvd in vhf it has 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.199
 almost 20 years and that's where we went 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.150
 several films on the day of the test she was 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.930
 nervous you can follow her on the 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.199
 test 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.079
 I can but why is it because I've learned 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.889
 you was there learned not okay I will 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.099
 there with you 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:39.180
 arriving there was the tramp designer 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:41.519
 took the test and then the junior garcia who was 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.530
 a Disney representative in Brazil and 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.109
 said felipão wants to do the test myself 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.810
 I told to prove Bundo I spoke a 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:53.370
 block has a year it not only has the voice 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:57.209
 see the test I did and I passed the 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.709
 test with a year of career and then I did 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.780
 the hobo I think so a character 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.659
 striking because it 's a Disney design 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.579
 I did not hear since I was a child and suddenly 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:08.419
 when they were regular they started having the 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:10.680
 my voice is work that's been there 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:13.889
 17 18 years 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.389
 A lot of people in the country have 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:18.090
 remarkable because it was my first 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.500
 Disney character but then I have 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.349
 a special affection for him was a 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.450
 I work a lot with both 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:26.370
 care by the gas director I 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.480
 I swear that almost 20 years later I 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.910
 I confess that I only watch 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.220
 if that's there when I watch, I do not 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.080
 would change anything I think much of the merit 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.580
 was his as a director, I think he 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.920
 He took away from me everything that 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.350
 character needed i think it stayed 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.290
 cool job 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.690
 Look, it 's a character I've had. 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.730
 want to do but I do not remember if 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.190
 some I did a test did not win 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:53.580
 I remember , I know of some. 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.070
 2 I would very much like to dub I wanted to 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:01.080
 much that the films of the 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:04.260
 dn jim and the films of elvis presley 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:08.010
 I really wanted these two 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:11.790
 I like the egg character 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:14.700
 Presley is the singer that he's not even think 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.860
 be a wonderful actor so the 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.470
 his movies were complicated films were 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.330
 always the movie's heartthrob but to dub the 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.980
 entity was expressed I think 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.140
 it would be really cool and james jim too 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.180
 which I think was a promoter of a 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.250
 very short career schulle made three 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.770
 movies I'm not mistaken and died in a 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.300
 accident and I wanted to be able to 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.270
 two actors I think it gives me great pleasure 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.320
 I wanted to have my voice immortalized. 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.320
 I think it's cool in them
