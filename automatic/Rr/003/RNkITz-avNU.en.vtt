00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
usually when you wear any a sneaker

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.690 
usually when you wear any a sneaker
because<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.540> fits<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:19.960> snug<00:02:20.590> onto<00:02:21.310> your<00:02:21.430> foot

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
because it fits so snug onto your foot

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.270 
because it fits so snug onto your foot
it's<00:02:22.330> like<00:02:22.780> as<00:02:22.930> if<00:02:22.960> you<00:02:23.770> are<00:02:23.980> already

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.550 
it's like as if you are already
enveloped<00:02:24.970> with<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.210> jacket<00:02:25.870> that's<00:02:26.260> not<00:02:26.440> the

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
enveloped with a jacket that's not the

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.140 
enveloped with a jacket that's not the
kind<00:02:26.770> of<00:02:26.830> feeling<00:02:27.070> you<00:02:27.100> have<00:02:27.400> this<00:02:27.670> shoe<00:02:27.940> it

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
kind of feeling you have this shoe it

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.460 
kind of feeling you have this shoe it
still<00:02:28.360> feels<00:02:28.570> like<00:02:28.660> is<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:28.960> a<00:02:29.050> some<00:02:29.230> kind<00:02:29.410> of

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
still feels like is it a some kind of

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.120 
still feels like is it a some kind of
wind<00:02:30.370> going<00:02:31.120> through<00:02:31.630> yeah<00:02:32.290> that<00:02:32.530> space<00:02:32.920> you

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
wind going through yeah that space you

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.540 
wind going through yeah that space you
know

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
know

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.490 
know
okay<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:35.320> laces<00:02:35.920> are<00:02:36.220> very<00:02:36.580> smooth<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.750> I

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
okay the laces are very smooth and I

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.440 
okay the laces are very smooth and I
think<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.160> may<00:02:39.280> need<00:02:39.460> to<00:02:39.610> do<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:39.850> double<00:02:40.240> knot

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
think you may need to do a double knot

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.880 
think you may need to do a double knot
