00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.870
 mark is that it does not test on animals and 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.849
 this is very important since it is 100% 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.740
 cruelty free is a brand 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.949

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:24.710

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.719
 I'm going to talk to you, here I have the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.890
 little bag that the people from 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.620

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.010
 two minutes and this charms or this that to 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.449
 Sometimes you do not have time and you think you're 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.090
 a little love in the hair but that 's 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.609
 wait like 10 30 minutes then it's not 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.489
 to do it always then I do not know 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.489
 wants to make a little love in the hair and 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.380
 can not then this applies 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.240
 after the shampoo two minutes and you 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.040
 hair that was really excellent my 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.110
 personal experience I must tell you that 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.670
 once these apply to me 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.619
 love the conditioners and 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.049
 masks and when I placed them to me 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.549
 untangle the hair at the beginning what 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.710
 I placed and I felt that I still do not know 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.200
 tangled but once I come from 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.060
 conagua but totally unraveled and 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.460
 perfect then really lamas that 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.179

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.840
 post chemical version there are two 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.330
 versions this is the fuchsia stage that is 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.789
 for hair with chemical treatments 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.399
 for example the video that is dyed and 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:54.119
 there is another one that is for very fine hair 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.590
 that has keratin and is eternal but I 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.229
 I 'm going to talk about this one that was the one 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.759
