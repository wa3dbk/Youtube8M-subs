00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
here which are past due like this one

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.069 
here which are past due like this one
for<00:01:19.560> instance<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:20.340> one<00:01:20.570> it's<00:01:21.570> done<00:01:21.780> it's

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079

blossom it's honest on the way out so

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.929 
blossom it's honest on the way out so
let's<00:01:25.770> take<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> look<00:01:26.250> at<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> three<00:01:26.670> stages

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
let's take a look at the three stages

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:53.580 
let's take a look at the three stages
one<00:01:27.270> more<00:01:27.479> time

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.480 

okay<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:55.130> now<00:01:55.340> we<00:01:55.400> are<00:01:55.730> going<00:01:55.970> to<00:01:56.320> do<00:01:57.320> our

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
okay so now we are going to do our

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.920 
okay so now we are going to do our
experiment<00:01:58.490> with<00:01:58.730> the<00:01:59.000> third<00:01:59.240> finger<00:01:59.270> playing

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
experiment with the third finger playing

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.040 
experiment with the third finger playing
the<00:02:00.170> simple<00:02:00.560> C<00:02:00.740> scale<00:02:01.130> one<00:02:02.030> more<00:02:02.060> time<00:02:02.510> but

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
the simple C scale one more time but

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.850 
the simple C scale one more time but
this<00:02:03.200> time<00:02:03.440> I<00:02:03.740> want<00:02:04.130> us<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.840> imagine<00:02:05.860> that

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
this time I want us to imagine that

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.300 
this time I want us to imagine that
every<00:02:07.340> note<00:02:07.580> that<00:02:07.820> we<00:02:07.970> hear<00:02:08.950> listen<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.160> the

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
every note that we hear listen to the

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.520 
every note that we hear listen to the
sound<00:02:10.640> deeply<00:02:11.270> and<00:02:11.510> listen<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:11.990> tone<00:02:12.230> and

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
sound deeply and listen to the tone and

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.300 
sound deeply and listen to the tone and
you'll<00:02:13.280> hear<00:02:13.850> that<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.570> has<00:02:14.750> its<00:02:15.380> first<00:02:15.680> cycle

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
you'll hear that it has its first cycle

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.180 
you'll hear that it has its first cycle
which<00:02:16.490> is<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:17.150> birth<00:02:17.780> then<00:02:18.710> it<00:02:18.860> has<00:02:19.010> the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
which is that birth then it has the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.210 
which is that birth then it has the
blossom<00:02:19.940> where<00:02:20.180> opens<00:02:20.780> up<00:02:21.020> just<00:02:21.350> like<00:02:22.160> a

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
blossom where opens up just like a

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.120 
blossom where opens up just like a
Cabernet<00:02:22.820> when<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.240> let<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:23.600> sit<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:25.010> you

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
Cabernet when you let it sit and you

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.060 
Cabernet when you let it sit and you
open<00:02:25.490> the<00:02:25.580> cork<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:27.080> know<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.500> flavors

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
open the cork and you know the flavors

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.740 
open the cork and you know the flavors
start<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.700> kind<00:02:28.970> of<00:02:29.060> marinate<00:02:29.600> together

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
start to kind of marinate together

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.630 
start to kind of marinate together
that's<00:02:30.740> what<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:30.890> want<00:02:31.070> you<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.250> listen<00:02:31.400> for<00:02:31.580> it

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
there'll be a a moment in the sound

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.790 
there'll be a a moment in the sound
that'll<00:02:33.680> be<00:02:33.860> like<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.280> whoosh<00:02:34.790> like<00:02:35.680> like<00:02:36.680> a

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
that'll be like a whoosh like like a

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.530 
that'll be like a whoosh like like a
wave<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:38.620> just<00:02:39.620> overtones<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.430> then<00:02:41.120> you'll

before now what if we don't use this

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.580 
before now what if we don't use this
form<00:04:05.099> what<00:04:05.580> if<00:04:05.700> we<00:04:05.849> just<00:04:06.200> you<00:04:07.200> don't<00:04:07.379> do<00:04:07.470> the

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
form what if we just you don't do the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.830 
form what if we just you don't do the
opposite<00:04:08.069> then<00:04:08.610> alright<00:04:08.760> let<00:04:09.239> our<00:04:09.360> arms<00:04:09.599> hang

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
opposite then alright let our arms hang

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.720 
opposite then alright let our arms hang
and<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:11.160> which<00:04:11.310> way

and you which way
heavy<00:04:12.269> heavy<00:04:12.840> arms<00:04:13.200> let's<00:04:13.470> say<00:04:13.650> flat<00:04:14.610> fingers

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
heavy heavy arms let's say flat fingers

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.550 
heavy heavy arms let's say flat fingers
and<00:04:16.100> well<00:04:17.100> we'll<00:04:17.250> just<00:04:17.430> do<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.669> opposite

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
and well we'll just do the opposite

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.659 
and well we'll just do the opposite
let's<00:04:19.560> listen<00:04:19.859> to<00:04:19.979> what<00:04:20.130> happens<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.639> our

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
let's listen to what happens to our

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:33.500 
let's listen to what happens to our
sound<00:04:30.500> now<00:04:31.500> I<00:04:31.530> don't<00:04:31.650> know<00:04:31.800> about<00:04:32.270> how<00:04:33.270> well

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
sound now I don't know about how well

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.420 
sound now I don't know about how well
this<00:04:33.750> is<00:04:33.930> able<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:35.580> project<00:04:36.740> through<00:04:37.740> the

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
this is able to project through the

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.659 
this is able to project through the
internet<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:39.090> you<00:04:39.270> but<00:04:39.770> there<00:04:40.770> is<00:04:40.889> a<00:04:40.919> definite

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
internet to you but there is a definite

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.030 
internet to you but there is a definite
difference<00:04:41.700> because<00:04:42.660> that<00:04:42.930> blossom<00:04:43.770> in<00:04:43.919> the

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
difference because that blossom in the

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:52.670 
difference because that blossom in the
note<00:04:44.250> is<00:04:44.550> not<00:04:45.450> there<00:04:46.110> at<00:04:46.500> all<00:04:50.360> what<00:04:51.360> I<00:04:51.660> hear<00:04:52.500> is

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
note is not there at all what I hear is

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.930 
note is not there at all what I hear is
just<00:04:52.740> a<00:04:53.370> kind<00:04:53.580> of<00:04:53.639> impact<00:04:55.100> initially<00:04:56.100> and<00:04:56.370> then

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
just a kind of impact initially and then

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.879 
just a kind of impact initially and then
just<00:04:58.010> it<00:04:59.010> just<00:04:59.490> dissipates<00:05:00.300> down<00:05:00.510> it<00:05:00.750> just

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
just it just dissipates down it just

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.150 
just it just dissipates down it just
dissolves<00:05:01.889> out<00:05:02.100> so<00:05:03.030> it's<00:05:03.240> like<00:05:03.450> a<00:05:03.479> hit

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
dissolves out so it's like a hit

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:21.280 
dissolves out so it's like a hit
followed<00:05:05.160> by<00:05:05.340> fading<00:05:06.180> out<00:05:06.500> take<00:05:07.500> a<00:05:07.530> listen

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:39.130 

let<00:05:22.290> me<00:05:22.380> do<00:05:22.530> it<00:05:22.710> with<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.370> wave<00:05:23.550> method<00:05:24.090> form

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.170 

what's<00:05:40.140> so<00:05:40.380> great<00:05:40.590> about<00:05:40.650> the<00:05:41.250> wave<00:05:41.370> method<00:05:41.910> is

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
what's so great about the wave method is

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.070 
what's so great about the wave method is
that<00:05:42.990> your<00:05:43.920> notes<00:05:44.250> by<00:05:44.930> implementing<00:05:45.930> this

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
that your notes by implementing this

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.400 
that your notes by implementing this
form<00:05:46.440> all<00:05:46.830> the<00:05:46.890> time<00:05:47.640> your<00:05:48.090> notes<00:05:48.360> will<00:05:48.660> have<00:05:48.900> a

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
form all the time your notes will have a

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.350 
form all the time your notes will have a
seamless<00:05:50.660> even<00:05:51.660> quality<00:05:52.350> that<00:05:53.360> very

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
seamless even quality that very

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.800 
seamless even quality that very
frustrating<00:05:56.000> quality<00:05:57.000> for<00:05:57.210> pianists<00:05:57.600> where

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
frustrating quality for pianists where

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.150 
frustrating quality for pianists where
each<00:05:58.140> of<00:05:58.320> our<00:05:58.410> fingers<00:05:59.420> being<00:06:00.420> unequal<00:06:01.320> fourth

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
each of our fingers being unequal fourth

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.920 
each of our fingers being unequal fourth
finger<00:06:02.490> being<00:06:02.700> so<00:06:02.970> weak<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.510> thumb<00:06:03.750> for

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
finger being so weak the thumb for

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.220 
finger being so weak the thumb for
instance<00:06:04.230> being<00:06:04.410> so<00:06:04.590> strong<00:06:05.960> it's<00:06:06.960> so

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.230 
instance being so strong it's so

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.220 
instance being so strong it's so
difficult<00:06:07.530> to<00:06:08.190> make<00:06:08.790> them<00:06:09.150> sound<00:06:09.390> evenly<00:06:09.990> in<00:06:10.140> a

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
difficult to make them sound evenly in a

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:17.180 
difficult to make them sound evenly in a
passage<00:06:10.680> that<00:06:10.830> requires<00:06:11.780> but<00:06:14.930> you<00:06:15.930> do<00:06:16.290> the

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
passage that requires but you do the

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.130 
passage that requires but you do the
wave<00:06:17.370> method<00:06:17.850> on<00:06:17.970> each<00:06:18.150> note<00:06:18.419> you<00:06:18.660> see<00:06:18.930> that

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.140 
wave method on each note you see that

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.770 
wave method on each note you see that
instantly<00:06:19.710> all<00:06:20.400> the<00:06:20.550> notes<00:06:20.760> not<00:06:20.940> only<00:06:21.330> connect

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
instantly all the notes not only connect

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.840 
instantly all the notes not only connect
but<00:06:22.530> they're<00:06:22.650> also<00:06:22.919> in<00:06:23.100> the<00:06:23.220> same<00:06:23.490> tonal

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
but they're also in the same tonal

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.630 
but they're also in the same tonal
family<00:06:24.570> it's<00:06:25.470> like<00:06:25.530> if<00:06:25.919> you<00:06:26.100> play<00:06:26.250> just<00:06:26.460> with

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640 
family it's like if you play just with

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.980 
family it's like if you play just with
from<00:06:26.970> the<00:06:27.120> fingers<00:06:29.060> you<00:06:30.060> see<00:06:30.210> some<00:06:30.479> stick<00:06:30.780> out

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
from the fingers you see some stick out

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.210 
from the fingers you see some stick out
and<00:06:31.380> some<00:06:32.130> are<00:06:33.080> softer<00:06:34.080> than<00:06:34.200> others<00:06:34.470> so<00:06:34.979> this

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 
and some are softer than others so this

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.070 
and some are softer than others so this
is<00:06:35.630> instantly<00:06:36.630> going<00:06:36.840> to<00:06:37.430> clarify<00:06:38.690> your<00:06:39.690> tones

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
is instantly going to clarify your tones

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.409 
is instantly going to clarify your tones
and<00:06:40.700> I<00:06:41.700> don't<00:06:42.600> even<00:06:42.720> want<00:06:43.080> to<00:06:43.940> tell<00:06:44.940> you<00:06:45.180> what's

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 
and I don't even want to tell you what's
