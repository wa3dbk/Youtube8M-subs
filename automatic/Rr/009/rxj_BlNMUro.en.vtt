there seems to be general agreement

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.280 
there seems to be general agreement
based<00:00:02.100> upon<00:00:02.460> your<00:00:02.610> testimonies<00:00:03.330> that<00:00:03.570> we<00:00:04.140> are

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
based upon your testimonies that we are

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.079 
based upon your testimonies that we are
able<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.770> detect<00:00:05.100> ninety<00:00:05.580> to<00:00:05.730> ninety-five

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
able to detect ninety to ninety-five

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.940 
able to detect ninety to ninety-five
percent<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:06.960> near-earth<00:00:07.140> objects<00:00:07.859> that

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
percent of the near-earth objects that

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.669 
percent of the near-earth objects that
are<00:00:08.069> larger<00:00:08.460> than<00:00:08.490> one<00:00:08.880> kilometer<00:00:09.679> somewhere

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
are larger than one kilometer somewhere

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.950 
are larger than one kilometer somewhere
around<00:00:10.830> sixty<00:00:11.429> percent<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.360> objects<00:00:12.840> that

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
around sixty percent of the objects that

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.279 
around sixty percent of the objects that
are<00:00:13.080> over<00:00:13.549> 300<00:00:14.549> meters<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.690> my<00:00:15.809> question<00:00:16.199> is

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
are over 300 meters so my question is

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.470 
are over 300 meters so my question is
this<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.770> haven't<00:00:17.220> heard<00:00:17.400> yet<00:00:17.640> nor<00:00:17.910> have<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.090> seen

objects the incoming asteroids that are
100<00:00:24.240> metres<00:00:24.710> or<00:00:25.710> what<00:00:26.189> percentage<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.699> those

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
100 metres or what percentage of those

100 metres or what percentage of those
objects<00:00:27.510> are<00:00:27.630> we<00:00:27.750> able<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.170> detect<00:00:28.769> 100<00:00:29.429> metres

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699

being<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.240> think<00:00:30.570> dr.<00:00:30.960> Holdren<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.619> described

being I think dr. Holdren you described

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.459 
being I think dr. Holdren you described
in<00:00:32.189> your<00:00:32.219> written<00:00:32.550> testimony<00:00:32.940> as<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.989> size<00:00:34.200> of

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
in your written testimony as the size of

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.340 
in your written testimony as the size of
a<00:00:34.559> city<00:00:34.860> destroyer<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:36.390> what<00:00:36.780> percentage<00:00:37.200> of

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
a city destroyer so what percentage of

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.680 
a city destroyer so what percentage of
the<00:00:37.410> 100<00:00:37.950> meter<00:00:38.129> near-earth<00:00:38.820> objects<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.570> we

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the 100 meter near-earth objects and we

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.240 
the 100 meter near-earth objects and we
detect<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:42.350> do<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.620> figure<00:00:43.920> for<00:00:44.100> that

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
detect and do you have a figure for that

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.459 
detect and do you have a figure for that
I<00:00:47.450> believe<00:00:48.450> at<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.690> point<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.020> number

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
I believe at this point that number

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.290 
I believe at this point that number
would<00:00:49.620> be<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.829> little<00:00:50.100> under<00:00:50.399> ten<00:00:50.610> percent<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
would be a little under ten percent the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.529 
would be a little under ten percent the
number<00:00:51.690> for<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:53.219> hundred<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.910> forty<00:00:54.239> meters

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
number for a hundred and forty meters

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.900 
number for a hundred and forty meters
and<00:00:54.750> above<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.320> ten<00:00:55.649> percent<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.550> hundred

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
and above is ten percent the hundred

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.970 
and above is ten percent the hundred
would<00:00:57.059> be<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.360> little<00:00:57.719> understand<00:00:58.199> percent<00:00:58.739> and

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
would be a little understand percent and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.500 
would be a little understand percent and
illustrated<00:00:59.760> rodin<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.090> agree<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:00.480> that

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
illustrated rodin you agree with that

yes sir that was on that second chart I

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.679 
yes sir that was on that second chart I
showed<00:01:03.290> where<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.470> looks<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.640> less<00:01:06.390> than

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
showed where it looks like the less than

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.410 
showed where it looks like the less than
ten<00:01:06.930> percent<00:01:07.380> for<00:01:07.700> how<00:01:08.700> many<00:01:08.760> objects<00:01:09.240> are<00:01:09.330> we

ten percent for how many objects are we
talking<00:01:09.810> about<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.350> are<00:01:10.470> not<00:01:10.680> able<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
talking about that we are not able to

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.340 
talking about that we are not able to
detect<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.850> might<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.360> city<00:01:12.720> destroyers

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350

numbers of objects yes mr. Chairman I I

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.289 
numbers of objects yes mr. Chairman I I
don't<00:01:16.619> know<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.009> answer<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.970> that's

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
don't know that answer and I and that's

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.060 
don't know that answer and I and that's
one<00:01:18.479> thing<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.689> cannot<00:01:19.229> take<00:01:19.470> for<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.740> record

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
one thing I cannot take for the record

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.130 
one thing I cannot take for the record
because<00:01:20.280> look<00:01:20.729> what<00:01:21.030> was<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> ten<00:01:21.509> percent<00:01:21.960> of

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
because look what was the ten percent of

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.950 
because look what was the ten percent of
I<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.310> answer<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.640> question<00:01:23.820> okay<00:01:24.540> dr.

destroyers we are not detecting is that

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.800

roughly<00:01:57.750> right<00:01:58.049> no<00:01:58.439> more<00:01:58.740> what<00:01:59.549> because<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
roughly right no more what because the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.719 
roughly right no more what because the
