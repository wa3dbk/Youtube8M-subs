as I'm concerned job done I pull out the
tray<00:02:14.030> from<00:02:14.090> this<00:02:14.450> hive<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:15.170> did<00:02:15.349> see<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.310> imagine

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
tray from this hive I did see I imagine

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.069 
tray from this hive I did see I imagine
the<00:02:16.819> effects<00:02:17.090> are<00:02:17.209> going<00:02:17.329> exactly<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.870> same

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
the effects are going exactly the same

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.900 
the effects are going exactly the same
look<00:02:18.739> at<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:18.980> absolutely<00:02:19.910> peppered<00:02:20.840> with<00:02:20.870> it

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
look at that absolutely peppered with it

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.860 
look at that absolutely peppered with it
turn<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:22.970> camera<00:02:23.269> on<00:02:23.299> its<00:02:23.390> side<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.690> might

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
turn the camera on its side you might

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.129 
turn the camera on its side you might
get<00:02:24.079> a<00:02:24.110> better<00:02:24.790> view<00:02:25.790> then<00:02:26.090> in<00:02:26.359> front<00:02:26.569> Zeeman<00:02:27.049> a

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:27.139 
get a better view then in front Zeeman a

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.099 
get a better view then in front Zeeman a
bit<00:02:28.150> shows<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.269> actually<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.660> size<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:30.049> the

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109 
bit shows you actually the size of the

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.590 
bit shows you actually the size of the
colonies<00:02:30.530> we've<00:02:30.680> got<00:02:30.889> the<00:02:31.299> Ryan<00:02:32.299> White<00:02:32.389> are

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
colonies we've got the Ryan White are

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.319 
colonies we've got the Ryan White are
actually<00:02:32.900> extremely<00:02:33.230> well<00:02:34.090> displaced<00:02:35.090> over

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
actually extremely well displaced over

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.360 
actually extremely well displaced over
the<00:02:35.540> whole<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.680> tray<00:02:37.389> so<00:02:38.389> a<00:02:39.069> lot<00:02:40.069> of<00:02:40.190> bees

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
the whole of the tray so a lot of bees

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.570 
the whole of the tray so a lot of bees
carrying<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.060> lot<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.209> light
