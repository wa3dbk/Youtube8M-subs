00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.870
 We are going to prepare a cake with 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.980
 chocolate what we will need will be 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:16.010
 a yogurt a packet of yeast 3 eggs 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:20.839
 the measure of a glass of yogurt oil 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:24.370
 the same measure two glasses of sugar and the 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:26.590
 same measure three glasses of flour 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.690
 The first thing we will do is empty the 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.840
 yogurt to have the mold to know 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.050
 the amounts 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.440
 in a container we put three glasses of 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.440
 flour 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.100
 2 sugar 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.590
 and a glass of oil 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.800
 we add the baking powder although the 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.070
 You can take what I have before 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.070
 had forgotten 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.460
 the three eggs 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.520
 and yogurt 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.580
 and we mix everything well until we have a 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.160
 homogeneous mass 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.080
 then we take a mold smeared with 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.700
 butter so that it does not stick 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.700
 sponge cake and we throw the dough 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.700
 we put it in the oven about 30 to 40 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.820
 180 degrees 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.289
 does not have an exact time what you have 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.689
 what to do is that when you see that it is 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.240
 doradito you prick it and if the stick comes out 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:00.110
 clean is that it is ready 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.260
 carefully we are going to unmold it 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.030
 I with a toothpick help me to separate 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.950
 the mold cake although really 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.780
 It is easy to unmold thanks to the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.780
 butter that we put in the mold 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:31.439
 once we unmold it we set it aside and what 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.439
 we let cool at room temperature 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.180
 now we are going to prepare the coverage for 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.030
 we're going to need 200 grams of 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.090
 butter chocolate and 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.830
 milk in a bowl chop the 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.170
 chocolate to make it easier to 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.150
 melt add a little butter 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.730
 to make it brighter and a 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.620
 squirt milk put it to the 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.810
 microwave and we're giving you small 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.820
 heat shock and stirring so that it does not 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.930
 burn and so on until I have the 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.930
 adequate consistency 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.780
 what we will do next will be to put 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.300
 the cake on a raised surface 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.610
 that facilitates us to cover what we will 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.300
 throwing the chocolate little by little according to 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.300
 we need it 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.730
 to remove it this surface is a 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.300
 little difficult you will probably need 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.300
 help 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.580
 as a last step and optionally 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.280
 we will decorate the cake 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.400
 I'm going to use this boat in which 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.569
 balls of colored butterflies come one 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.909
 kind of glitter and hearts 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.650
 as you can see the result is a 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.260
 very cheerful cake perfect for 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.269
 birthday invite you to try it 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.680
 comenteis I do and what you think of 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.680
