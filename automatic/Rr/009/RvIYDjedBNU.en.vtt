how<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.640> works<00:03:18.050> okay<00:03:19.050> so<00:03:19.110> I've<00:03:19.350> assembled<00:03:19.740> the

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
how it works okay so I've assembled the

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.940 
how it works okay so I've assembled the
vertical<00:03:20.490> system<00:03:20.880> on<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.330> slider<00:03:21.920> before<00:03:22.920> I

vertical system on the slider before I

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.590 
vertical system on the slider before I
show<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.310> how<00:03:23.490> it<00:03:23.610> works<00:03:23.640> I<00:03:24.060> just<00:03:24.240> want<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.450> go

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
show you how it works I just want to go

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.750 
show you how it works I just want to go
over<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.900> components<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:25.800> you<00:03:25.860> can<00:03:26.250> see<00:03:26.520> well

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
over the components so you can see well

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.330 
over the components so you can see well
it<00:03:27.060> involves<00:03:27.560> actually<00:03:28.560> what<00:03:28.830> we<00:03:28.980> did<00:03:29.160> this

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
it involves actually what we did this

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.550 
it involves actually what we did this
manufacture<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.090> little<00:03:30.150> pinhook<00:03:30.900> that<00:03:31.170> fits

on<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.310> sled<00:03:32.610> itself<00:03:33.060> you'll<00:03:33.900> notice<00:03:34.260> the

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
on the sled itself you'll notice the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.920 
on the sled itself you'll notice the

for<00:03:37.200> modular<00:03:37.650> fittings<00:03:38.100> this<00:03:38.430> is<00:03:38.640> one<00:03:38.880> of<00:03:38.910> the

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
for modular fittings this is one of the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.240 
for modular fittings this is one of the
things<00:03:39.300> that<00:03:39.540> was<00:03:39.660> designed<00:03:40.080> for<00:03:40.410> then<00:03:41.070> we

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
things that was designed for then we

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.220 
things that was designed for then we
installed<00:03:41.700> boy<00:03:42.030> system<00:03:42.600> on<00:03:42.780> top<00:03:42.960> of<00:03:43.170> the

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
installed boy system on top of the

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
installed boy system on top of the
slider<00:03:43.560> which<00:03:44.280> allows<00:03:44.730> for<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.770> rope<00:03:46.770> to<00:03:47.040> stay

slider which allows for the rope to stay
clear<00:03:47.700> of<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.510> slider<00:03:48.840> up<00:03:49.050> both<00:03:49.260> sides<00:03:49.530> we

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
clear of the slider up both sides we

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.070 
clear of the slider up both sides we
actually<00:03:50.100> extending<00:03:51.060> it<00:03:51.210> to<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.810> back<00:03:52.050> a

actually extending it to the back a

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.950 
actually extending it to the back a
little<00:03:52.500> bit<00:03:52.710> more<00:03:53.070> so<00:03:53.880> if<00:03:54.480> consider<00:03:54.900> a

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
little bit more so if consider a

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.870 
little bit more so if consider a

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
as the rope and the weight move down

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.670 
as the rope and the weight move down
it's<00:04:00.300> not<00:04:00.570> going<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:00.900> interfere<00:04:01.110> with<00:04:01.350> the

actually<00:04:17.000> put<00:04:17.450> in<00:04:17.570> there<00:04:18.160> basically<00:04:19.160> all<00:04:19.280> you

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
actually put in there basically all you

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.979 
actually put in there basically all you

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
wider body and you won't even be able to

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.170 
wider body and you won't even be able to
set<00:05:18.080> it<00:05:18.200> like<00:05:18.380> this<00:05:18.650> in<00:05:19.520> order<00:05:19.820> to<00:05:20.000> overcome

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
set it like this in order to overcome

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.980 
set it like this in order to overcome
this<00:05:20.810> we<00:05:21.620> took<00:05:21.890> our<00:05:22.220> sled<00:05:22.790> head<00:05:23.210> assembly<00:05:23.780> from

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
this we took our sled head assembly from

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.140 
this we took our sled head assembly from
our<00:05:24.170> previous<00:05:24.380> design<00:05:25.040> and<00:05:25.430> made<00:05:25.910> it<00:05:26.030> it

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
our previous design and made it it

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.150 
our previous design and made it it
adaptable<00:05:26.690> so<00:05:27.050> it<00:05:27.170> would<00:05:27.320> fit<00:05:27.350> right<00:05:27.560> on<00:05:27.830> this

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
adaptable so it would fit right on this

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.850 
adaptable so it would fit right on this
head<00:05:28.900> basically<00:05:29.900> all<00:05:29.930> you<00:05:30.230> need<00:05:30.410> to<00:05:30.500> do<00:05:30.680> is

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
head basically all you need to do is

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.820 
head basically all you need to do is
remove<00:05:30.890> the<00:05:31.310> rs2<00:05:32.210> ball<00:05:32.510> head<00:05:32.780> and<00:05:33.050> put<00:05:33.680> the

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
remove the rs2 ball head and put the

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.250 
remove the rs2 ball head and put the
vertical<00:05:34.370> head<00:05:34.550> mount<00:05:34.820> right<00:05:35.480> in<00:05:35.630> place<00:05:35.930> and

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
vertical head mount right in place and

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.710 
vertical head mount right in place and
then<00:05:36.560> put<00:05:36.890> your<00:05:36.920> camera<00:05:37.430> on<00:05:37.490> top<00:05:37.760> of<00:05:38.000> it<00:05:38.120> let<00:05:38.600> me

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
then put your camera on top of it let me

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:47.219 
then put your camera on top of it let me
show<00:05:38.930> you<00:05:38.990> how<00:05:39.080> that<00:05:39.230> works
