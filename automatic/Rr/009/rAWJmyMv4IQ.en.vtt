00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.320
 Laboratory LEAGUE "Kitchen paints" is: 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:15.360
 Roberto Vigano in the laboratory of LIGI represents the polishing machine Vigano Mario 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.440
 Grinding and polishing machine Vigano Mario SP 1200 Part 1 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.700
 Now we are launching this polishing machine for polishing parts. Run the shaft. 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.740
 Next, start the movement of the table. 

00:00:35.606 --> 00:00:39.906
 Now adjust the degree of pressing the shaft to the details. 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.380
 We set 15 cycles ... and the table will make 15 passes back and forth. 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.760
 Now we manually add polishing paste to our parts. 

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:36.895
 There are still two cycles left to finish 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.820
 Now the table will move to the left side and stop. 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.509
 We check the result of polishing after 15 cycles. 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.070
 Now we expand the parts horizontally and polish them in that position. 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.569
 Run the polishing process again. 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:41.149
 Add polishing paste. 

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:52.995
 Check the degree of compression of the shaft to the details. 

00:03:05.444 --> 00:03:08.784
 Once again add polishing paste. 

00:03:40.382 --> 00:03:51.522
 About the machine itself. This is a polishing machine that allows you to get high gloss on flat parts. 

00:03:51.522 --> 00:04:03.762
 First, it is necessary to carry out grinding with 800 and 1200 grains. And after that we simply put the panel, set the required number of cycles and get a high gloss. 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.400
 Now we stop the shaft. And check the details. 

00:04:23.775 --> 00:04:31.575
 At the beginning we clean the surface of the polishing paste to check the quality of the polishing surface. 

00:04:31.575 --> 00:04:40.015
 Finishing finishing with polish we will do manually. 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:51.740
 Apply polish. At first we work with black polish, because the panel itself is black. 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:03.770
 This is the final stage in high-gloss technology. 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:17.430
 The polisher had previously made a clean, flat surface. And this is the finishing touch. 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:24.990
 Now manually clean the part with a cotton napkin. 

00:05:29.314 --> 00:05:36.974
 And apply a special liquid to remove residual polishes. 

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:47.748
 This is the final result. 

00:05:47.748 --> 00:05:55.328
