00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:16.730
 good morning coat more give ladies and 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.619
 gentlemen today to a something 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.270
 another video of me and that in short 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.530
 yes you can already a bit 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.380
 call presentation video 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:30.260
 it's about this so-called 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.860
 check freaks here i hope that king 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:39.040
 put 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:41.780
 So these are little essays for the 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.730
 controls he thinks for the analog stick 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.380
 At the same time I do it 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:51.620
 have a second field is for the 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.930
 Right hand find the wall for the left and 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.820
 you see it yourself something 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.930
 now a bit more than the new country 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.850
 much higher 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:05.180
 that has the following reason for that 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.190
 aiming around so on the website 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.729
 the game in the video description 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:15.760
 stands that aiming at ten to fifty 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:19.580
 percent increases and I'm after 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.350
 one and a half to two hours I can there 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.869
 In any case, just agree 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.090
 it's brutal you just have ten times 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:31.100
 better feeling are there that by that 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.229
 the higher are the ent analog sticks and 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.850
 Here I can show how to do that 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.740
 You just do it on a stick 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.560
 here on it and already they are there 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:47.390
 is really an effort of few 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.830
 seconds and the same here also 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.500
 expenditure of a few seconds 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.939
 if you have them on it then it is one 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.770
 really a lot better 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:01.009
 you can just better one 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:04.400
 yes that with heavier green but fits 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.200
 now also and yes it just does more 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.500
 fun and of course they still look 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.450
 must be really cool 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.610
 say I find really a bomb detail 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.960
 you can just stay here you have to stop 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.820
 let's say two or three games off 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.280
 So get used to a quarter to half 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.800
 hour then one is used to and 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.560
 then everything fits and it does 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.170
 really much more fun with that too 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.180
 play because you just better room 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.800
 until it really is just me 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.300
 show now I now also blind 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.670
 times a gameplay where I then mine 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.530
 Meanwhile, I was checking 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.810
 record like play and you will see 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.200
 that my aiming in comparison to the 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.230
 other videos games or videos resp 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.430
 Gameplay is just a lot better 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.890
 so i do not have it yet 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.040
 tried how to offer again take 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.400
 like the gesture, that is the left one 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.590
 stick while running is but I think 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.600
 that it is not much different and 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.170
 that's why yes I think the things easy 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.820
 just awesome 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:16.980
 conclusion also to look so one of the 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:20.549
 right now so here are two and 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.299
 which of them I have second 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.940
 two of them and the right ones 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.610
 So I believe that's exactly the right one 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.660
 have cost 16 eur 99 and the left 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.790
 13 90 and this price has grown up 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.570
 in any case, this almost 40 euros was worth it 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.250
 have really paid off because of the mx 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.600
 just a lot better and you can 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.980
 really investing in particular plays 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.650
 are not as good as me now 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.150
 For example, it is really a chance to 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.430
 Just emming to improve you are 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.180
 just you just feel like that 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.489
 as if you were like somehow 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.019
 now ten times better I can 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.030
 somehow do not imagine it but it 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.239
 is just like that and is just real 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.950
 really great 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.370
 and yes, for example, so vital or something 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.799
 just go faster because you 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.989
 makes a headshots one on one hand 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.680
 but also just the 400 ball on the 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.379
 opponent meets 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.610
 and not too much good 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.359
 I'll have one more day after that 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.729
 a bit of gameplay probably like that 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:28.419
 345 minutes show where he then me 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:31.680
 you can see it on a controller 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:37.750
 By the way, things are called control freaks 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:41.949
 hey werk and i believe it with katy 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.889
 So you can see for that too 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:50.889
 can 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:54.310
 that is k11 good on it then I hope 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.389
 let's say this little review 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.199
 have liked it so much 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:02.310
 and then let it go up or down 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.310
 if you want to see you next time 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.990
 they are 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.400
 Mannheim 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:34.059
 the caretaker a flag or 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.509
 fierce fighting 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:16.600
 May the mood is heatedly closed 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.600
 cyclist celebrated 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.570
 st 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.800
 Yes
