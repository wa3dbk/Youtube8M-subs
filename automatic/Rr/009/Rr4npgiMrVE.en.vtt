arse<00:03:16.120> might<00:03:16.420> light<00:03:16.569> up<00:03:16.689> a<00:03:16.750> little<00:03:16.959> better<00:03:17.109> but

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
arse might light up a little better but

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.190 
arse might light up a little better but
it's<00:03:18.640> still<00:03:18.760> pretty<00:03:19.120> good<00:03:19.569> it's<00:03:19.750> blue<00:03:19.989> though

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
it's still pretty good it's blue though

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.410 
it's still pretty good it's blue though
because<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.890> color<00:03:21.129> light<00:03:21.400> they<00:03:21.579> used<00:03:21.849> is

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
because the color light they used is

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.289 
because the color light they used is
blue<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:25.950> they<00:03:26.950> give<00:03:27.189> you<00:03:27.220> a<00:03:27.340> pink<00:03:27.640> blade<00:03:27.909> so

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
blue and they give you a pink blade so

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.080 
blue and they give you a pink blade so
it<00:03:28.599> doesn't<00:03:28.900> really<00:03:29.019> make<00:03:29.230> much<00:03:29.290> sense<00:03:30.090> also

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
it doesn't really make much sense also

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.500 
it doesn't really make much sense also

hold it here's my little phase two ya
see<00:05:37.370> clones<00:05:38.120> hands<00:05:38.960> are<00:05:39.140> too<00:05:39.260> why<00:05:39.410> didn't<00:05:39.710> I

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
see clones hands are too why didn't I

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.490 
see clones hands are too why didn't I
don't<00:05:40.130> even<00:05:40.240> if<00:05:41.240> you<00:05:41.420> do<00:05:41.600> it<00:05:41.810> have<00:05:42.140> to<00:05:42.260> hold<00:05:42.410> one

don't even if you do it have to hold one
on<00:05:42.680> hand<00:05:42.890> so<00:05:43.010> it's<00:05:43.160> not<00:05:43.280> really<00:05:43.340> practical<00:05:43.700> for

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
on hand so it's not really practical for

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.590 
on hand so it's not really practical for
consoles<00:05:44.750> it<00:05:44.900> yet<00:05:45.370> they<00:05:46.370> expect<00:05:46.820> just<00:05:47.480> the

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
consoles it yet they expect just the

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.050 
consoles it yet they expect just the
