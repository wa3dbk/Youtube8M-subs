00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.960
 hello on this video it's about 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.150
 of the DIY mister's video that's 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.460
 free electricity and infinite art of 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.110
 all good game explain to you why I 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.000
 think like others I make you 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.960
 know that's how long on 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.010
 internet that's because wade like the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.160
 people have pointed out is that 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.449
 widow we play video good on 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.029
 will wait a little bit otherwise you 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.679
 are going to be at the 5 minute in 54 seconds 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.600
 I think to be comments 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.420
 just at that moment good one more 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.640
 second sees it here you see 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.110
 clearly when it is rare 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.090
 League 1 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.680
 we can see that there is a hole and that is 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.890
 movies coming out 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:52.620
 that's after six months here it's that's what 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:55.520
 passage over here he cut the right 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.829
 millions too so he's reviewing the 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.649
 scramble especially the imam who shows 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.140
 clearly for thierry what they like 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.390
 to make hole that connects it actually who 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.280
 took him out because by chance he 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.350
 then well how to connect here and 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.650
 then it's normal that's how he 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.780
 can shoot then declined shows by 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.130
 122 light because otherwise it's 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.720
 impossible since it is necessary to reflect 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.790
 lifts the second point he says 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.009
 we can even shoot a kilo at 3000 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.540
 watts also impossible because that's 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.250
 impossible because here it's actually 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.200
 it's even a DC motor 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.979
 la rochelle language what you have released 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.619
 12 volts 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.890
 2 if you want to remove 500 masts by 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.799
 example well it takes already more than 40 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.200
 in earth this is what we call the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.750
 computing power of these current 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.460
 cold the attention so when their 40 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.930
 years loses in such a wind that he actually 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.860
 it's impossible because otherwise 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.020
 air filters 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.630
 it's not possible by now to be in 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.009
 this 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.350
 in this fan you did 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.610
 mention of two years lost about a 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.360
 start it's a good one it will depend on the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.039
 power so already that's sleazy me 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.429
 learned to another thing too that's when 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:09.670
 even if yes they explain to you that this 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.440
 kind of device here it looks like 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.300
 strongly you know to an adapter of 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:19.090
 sectors as wanted for 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.849
 processors the laptop funds here that 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.530
 speak rather I do not know 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.319
 between a mobile phone between a 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.720
 laptop computer or always a little 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.970
 size so be aware that this 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.230
 kind of load couple uses in 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.260
 the moment is that you can 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.450
 transform the 230 volts into a current 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.780
 alternative 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:44.170
 you can compromise that have current 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.670
 continuous for 12 votes in yes to three 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.940
 years apart in value that comes from 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.370
 the tension and then you've got it 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.150
 you have a bendy bridge for your 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.680
 current test if you also have 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.720
 capacitors in parallel break for 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.560
 smooth the current that eventually a 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.660
 direct current 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.100
 but it does not work the other way 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.290
 as they say to five or six you 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.970
 can try it does not work it will take 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.400
 would be inconsistent more meant 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.720
 okay he may have used a 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.940
 inverter will tell itself that something that 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.889
 will transform the continuous current here 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:24.970
 ac current agree 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:26.200
 just if you want that if that 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.910
 seems shady 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.670
 because I do not think there is a physiotherapist 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.019
 of the device it's because that if you 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.000
 use it as their instances 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.069
 the nights precise though that kind 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.359
 of apparatus used in both directions gold 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.090
 the only thing you drank in 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:43.209
 innocence and a pure transformer the 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.410
 tasted a transformer is it 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.799
 really that when you just have to 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.510
 through you that have current 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.489
 alternative on both sides come in 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.049
 knit of alternating current and have 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.010
 especially the art of alternating current or 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.120
 in the other direction as input or 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.510
 policies in the other direction 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.129
 in reprendant 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.750
 relative to the output of the alternating current 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.989
 but here again it's clear that in 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.239
 this kind of two fans unless the 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.090
 life of the eyebrow to tinker a little bit 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:13.340
 but he does not specify it you have to 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.540
 direct current so what social if 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.519
 it does not make sense 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.449
 that's why it's really strong 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:22.669
 chances this is felt that this 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.990
 man does it's a quack 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.020
 is that even if they have nothing to do 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.070
 it's deception so I think it's 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.010
 like a relay because there really is 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.050
 who who who will invest who 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:37.070
 will take the time that the reproduce 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.110
 and finally see that body health 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.360
 most likely it does not work 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.060
 not because as I read you the full 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.729
 of things that matter in this way 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.100
 however, you should know that in any 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.380
 what is called energy 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.570
 free on unit and all that you go 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.820
 we will say sites that are more 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.600
 seriously the street to say we are going to 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.820
 mislead it's for example here the site of 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.930
 ps vita who off energy this system 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.820
 that is to say that really a lot of 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.870
 system and all that and are risky little 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.250
 So that means your driveway 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.990
 seek to understand what they say 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.120
 not necessarily that's true but he 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.220
 was only an informative site that 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.680
 are looking for other skis and see 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.479
 energy that we will say as a Title 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.680
 l says this is this site is very 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.150
 interesting I put the link in the 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.460
 description so we'll also 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.070
 lucid that's called would unity 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.180
 like yours personally calling 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.770
 the administrator agreed that 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.190
 it's a very honest site so 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.979
 it's just a sepa format telling km 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.240
 so video but that's live there you have 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:43.169
 really people who know about it and 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.639
 they go fast that's true too 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.830
 it's fake there is a starting point 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:50.190
 interesting so without success I 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:53.940
 plays I advise you two years in 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.919
 English only to the opponent and that's it 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:00.210
 you find these workers a point of 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:02.849
 yes view with people sticking to it 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:06.449
 on the electro technique in mechanics in 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:07.620
 physics in general about chemistry and that's 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.090
 interesting is happening 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.639
 you are sure to find the right ones 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.759
 information and please do not say 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:15.570
 that it works when everything 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:16.169
 that you find in 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.970
 policies 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.440
 it gives you the choice because you 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.270
 believe it works I think it 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.220
 not walk so I concede you too 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.720
 want to put in the description and then 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.789
 that's it if you want you can you 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.990
 subscribe to china because i'm going 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:29.099
 really make me soon a 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.139
 demonstration i will show you 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:33.389
 how does the city ​​cheat because 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:35.789
 that she has lots of that kind of videos and 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:37.620
 Here was stolen if you want 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:39.930
 comment I will take their questions 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.099
 and if you liked the area and but 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.659
 it takes a second to click on 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:43.139
 I like if you like it not obvious you 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:47.389
 click on 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:47.389
 I do not like a thank you their aura
