instead install the props make sure to

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.009 
instead install the props make sure to
run<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.739> motor<00:04:18.009> without<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.269> props<00:04:19.539> in<00:04:19.780> order

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
run the motor without the props in order

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.129 
run the motor without the props in order
to<00:04:20.139> see<00:04:20.320> whether<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:21.240> throttle<00:04:22.240> is<00:04:22.449> reverse

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
to see whether the throttle is reverse

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.129 
to see whether the throttle is reverse
it's<00:04:23.710> quite<00:04:24.520> confused<00:04:24.970> power<00:04:25.270> this<00:04:25.840> is<00:04:25.900> how

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
it's quite confused power this is how

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.999 
it's quite confused power this is how
I've<00:04:26.639> set<00:04:27.639> it<00:04:27.789> up<00:04:27.940> so<00:04:28.210> Iran<00:04:28.570> servers<00:04:29.080> elevator

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
I've set it up so Iran servers elevator

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.689 
I've set it up so Iran servers elevator
reverse<00:04:30.370> and<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.150> throttle<00:04:31.330> remains<00:04:31.750> the

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
reverse and the throttle remains the

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.450 
reverse and the throttle remains the
normal<00:04:33.699> and<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.240> rudder<00:04:34.419> is<00:04:34.720> reverse<00:04:35.050> I'm<00:04:35.460> Gyr

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
normal and the rudder is reverse I'm Gyr

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.540 
normal and the rudder is reverse I'm Gyr
that's<00:04:36.760> the<00:04:37.590> that's<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.860> channel<00:04:39.220> that<00:04:39.400> has

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
that's the that's the channel that has

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.689 
that's the that's the channel that has
been<00:04:41.159> for<00:04:42.159> the<00:04:42.310> flaps<00:04:43.650> so<00:04:44.650> even<00:04:45.159> that<00:04:45.340> has<00:04:45.490> been

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
been for the flaps so even that has been

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.570 
been for the flaps so even that has been
reversed<00:04:46.060> so<00:04:46.750> overall<00:04:47.380> this<00:04:47.710> is<00:04:47.770> my<00:04:48.159> setting

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
reversed so overall this is my setting

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.810 
reversed so overall this is my setting
for<00:04:48.760> this<00:04:48.880> particular<00:04:49.389> plane<00:04:50.220> so<00:04:51.220> I<00:04:51.460> will<00:04:51.610> show

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
for this particular plane so I will show

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.210 
for this particular plane so I will show
you<00:04:51.880> how<00:04:52.770> how<00:04:53.770> all<00:04:54.099> the<00:04:54.370> control<00:04:54.789> surfaces

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
you how how all the control surfaces

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:14.089 
you how how all the control surfaces
respond<00:04:57.220> to<00:04:57.370> my

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:17.189 

which<00:05:15.099> I'll<00:05:15.279> be<00:05:15.519> doing<00:05:15.549> it<00:05:15.969> later<00:05:16.299> there<00:05:17.110> you

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
which I'll be doing it later there you

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.899 
which I'll be doing it later there you
can<00:05:17.379> see<00:05:17.529> the<00:05:17.679> control<00:05:18.039> surfaces<00:05:18.429> do<00:05:18.759> though

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
can see the control surfaces do though

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:22.589 
can see the control surfaces do though
it<00:05:19.029> is<00:05:19.179> in<00:05:19.360> neutral<00:05:19.569> there<00:05:20.499> is<00:05:20.649> a<00:05:20.679> lot<00:05:21.610> of<00:05:21.639> gap

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:22.599 
it is in neutral there is a lot of gap

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.749 
it is in neutral there is a lot of gap
so<00:05:22.899> all<00:05:23.139> I<00:05:23.169> have<00:05:23.409> to<00:05:23.499> do<00:05:23.679> is<00:05:23.889> remove<00:05:24.819> the<00:05:26.759> the

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
so all I have to do is remove the the

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:32.639 
so all I have to do is remove the the
connecting<00:05:29.039> rod<00:05:30.039> and<00:05:31.139> remake<00:05:32.139> the<00:05:32.289> fixture

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:32.649 
connecting rod and remake the fixture

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:36.179 
connecting rod and remake the fixture
there<00:05:33.149> so<00:05:34.149> there's<00:05:34.719> a<00:05:34.809> lot<00:05:35.499> of<00:05:35.679> crap<00:05:35.979> which

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:36.189 
there so there's a lot of crap which

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:38.159 
there so there's a lot of crap which
needs<00:05:36.459> strength<00:05:36.939> so<00:05:37.329> I<00:05:37.360> am<00:05:37.419> now<00:05:37.599> gonna<00:05:37.749> trim<00:05:38.139> it

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
needs strength so I am now gonna trim it

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.819 
needs strength so I am now gonna trim it
but<00:05:38.860> what<00:05:39.129> I'm<00:05:39.249> going<00:05:39.399> to<00:05:39.489> do<00:05:39.639> is<00:05:39.819> I'm<00:05:40.059> going<00:05:40.239> to

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:40.829 
but what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:45.179 
but what I'm going to do is I'm going to
remove<00:05:41.829> the<00:05:42.129> linkage<00:05:42.579> and<00:05:43.529> refix<00:05:44.529> it<00:05:44.769> so<00:05:45.159> I

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:45.189 
remove the linkage and refix it so I

00:05:45.189 --> 00:07:13.800 
remove the linkage and refix it so I
align<00:05:45.819> the<00:05:45.939> servos<00:05:46.389> and<00:05:46.629> then

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:13.810 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:22.480 

all<00:07:14.810> right<00:07:19.870> just<00:07:20.870> tested<00:07:21.800> the<00:07:21.889> electronics

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.490 
all right just tested the electronics

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.930 
all right just tested the electronics
everything<00:07:22.760> works<00:07:23.750> perfectly<00:07:24.380> filing<00:07:24.889> mmm<00:07:25.669> so

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:25.940 
everything works perfectly filing mmm so

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.850 
everything works perfectly filing mmm so
next<00:07:26.240> I<00:07:26.720> will<00:07:26.870> be<00:07:27.200> trimming<00:07:27.770> this<00:07:29.530> when<00:07:30.530> I<00:07:30.560> say

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:30.860 
next I will be trimming this when I say

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.140 
next I will be trimming this when I say
trimming<00:07:31.310> I<00:07:31.400> will<00:07:31.700> be<00:07:33.310> reviewing<00:07:34.310> my<00:07:34.550> linkages

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.150 
trimming I will be reviewing my linkages

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.909 
trimming I will be reviewing my linkages
in<00:07:35.419> order<00:07:35.720> to<00:07:35.870> fix<00:07:36.139> these<00:07:37.030> gaps<00:07:38.380> which<00:07:39.380> is

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 
in order to fix these gaps which is

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:45.129 
in order to fix these gaps which is
which<00:07:40.580> is<00:07:40.610> not<00:07:40.910> aligned<00:07:41.690> properly<00:07:43.360> so<00:07:44.360> I<00:07:44.720> will

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:45.139 
which is not aligned properly so I will

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:47.230 
which is not aligned properly so I will
be<00:07:45.260> doing<00:07:45.440> that<00:07:45.740> which<00:07:46.460> I<00:07:46.610> will<00:07:46.669> be<00:07:46.760> showing<00:07:46.790> in

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.240 
be doing that which I will be showing in

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.470 
be doing that which I will be showing in
