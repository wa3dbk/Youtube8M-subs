moments ago m570 and it basically it

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.469 
moments ago m570 and it basically it
looks<00:01:07.860> very<00:01:08.250> similar<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.000> look<00:01:09.240> at<00:01:09.360> them

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
looks very similar if you look at them

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.660 
looks very similar if you look at them
side<00:01:09.689> by<00:01:09.720> side<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.140> here's<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.860> top<00:01:11.460> down

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
side by side like here's the top down

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.850 
side by side like here's the top down
view<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.530> old<00:01:13.530> one

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
view of the old one

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.090 
view of the old one
and<00:01:14.980> the<00:01:15.580> new<00:01:15.820> one<00:01:16.230> so<00:01:17.230> no<00:01:17.530> one<00:01:17.650> obviously<00:01:17.980> it's

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
and the new one so no one obviously it's

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.440 
and the new one so no one obviously it's
got<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.310> two<00:01:18.460> new<00:01:18.610> buttons<00:01:19.410> here<00:01:20.410> and<00:01:21.450> instead

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
got the two new buttons here and instead

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.360 
got the two new buttons here and instead
of<00:01:22.600> having<00:01:22.780> an<00:01:23.110> optical<00:01:23.560> sensor<00:01:23.890> like<00:01:24.250> this

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
of having an optical sensor like this

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.210 
of having an optical sensor like this
one<00:01:24.520> does<00:01:24.700> you<00:01:25.030> know<00:01:25.290> probably<00:01:26.290> early<00:01:26.650> 2000

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
one does you know probably early 2000

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.770 
one does you know probably early 2000
late<00:01:27.460> 90s<00:01:27.820> technology<00:01:28.300> this<00:01:28.510> one's<00:01:28.690> actually

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
late 90s technology this one's actually

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.740 
late 90s technology this one's actually
got<00:01:29.050> a<00:01:29.080> full-on<00:01:29.400> laser<00:01:30.400> sensor<00:01:30.910> which<00:01:31.600> would

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
got a full-on laser sensor which would

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.450 
got a full-on laser sensor which would
be<00:01:31.840> far<00:01:32.170> more<00:01:32.200> accurate<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.860> allows<00:01:33.040> it<00:01:33.250> I

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
be far more accurate and allows it I

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.990 
be far more accurate and allows it I
have<00:01:34.060> a<00:01:34.150> much<00:01:34.420> higher<00:01:34.540> DPI<00:01:34.990> now<00:01:35.970> one<00:01:36.970> thing

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
have a much higher DPI now one thing

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.430 
have a much higher DPI now one thing
I've<00:01:37.510> noticed<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:38.350> far<00:01:38.380> is<00:01:38.920> this<00:01:39.550> ball<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:41.380> a

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
I've noticed so far is this ball is a

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.230 
I've noticed so far is this ball is a
little<00:01:41.590> bit<00:01:41.920> stiffer<00:01:42.250> to<00:01:42.460> move<00:01:42.700> I<00:01:43.000> don't<00:01:43.180> know

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
little bit stiffer to move I don't know

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.930 
little bit stiffer to move I don't know
if<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:44.530> needs<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.800> be<00:01:44.890> broken<00:01:45.100> in<00:01:45.340> yet<00:01:45.520> like<00:01:45.820> I

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
if just needs to be broken in yet like I

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.760 
if just needs to be broken in yet like I
said<00:01:46.000> I<00:01:46.120> just<00:01:46.360> unbox<00:01:47.110> this<00:01:47.259> thing<00:01:47.500> I<00:01:47.619> haven't

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
said I just unbox this thing I haven't

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.710 
said I just unbox this thing I haven't
had<00:01:47.920> time<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.160> use<00:01:48.400> it<00:01:48.430> I'll<00:01:49.119> probably<00:01:49.330> post<00:01:49.600> a

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
had time to use it I'll probably post a

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.690 
had time to use it I'll probably post a
follow-up<00:01:49.900> video<00:01:50.229> in<00:01:50.650> like<00:01:50.860> a<00:01:50.890> few<00:01:51.310> weeks<00:01:51.460> or

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
follow-up video in like a few weeks or

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.430 
follow-up video in like a few weeks or
month<00:01:51.880> or<00:01:52.030> something<00:01:52.180> once<00:01:52.479> I've<00:01:52.630> had<00:01:52.780> it's

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
month or something once I've had it's

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.540 
month or something once I've had it's
more<00:01:53.650> time<00:01:53.800> to<00:01:53.920> use<00:01:54.040> it<00:01:54.160> this<00:01:54.250> one<00:01:54.400> is<00:01:54.460> actually

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
more time to use it this one is actually

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.730 
more time to use it this one is actually
going<00:01:54.790> to<00:01:54.850> be<00:01:54.910> going<00:01:55.090> on<00:01:55.150> a<00:01:55.210> gaming<00:01:55.570> PC<00:01:55.930> this<00:01:56.590> is

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740

all right go and looks pretty similar in
there<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:36.719> another<00:02:37.719> one<00:02:40.260> I'll<00:02:41.260> see<00:02:41.500> if<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:41.620> can

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
there to another one I'll see if I can

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.020 
there to another one I'll see if I can
find<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:42.040> way<00:02:42.129> to<00:02:42.189> make<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.519> thing<00:02:42.730> roll<00:02:43.000> a

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
see it well that's the old optical

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.789 
see it well that's the old optical
sensor<00:02:53.970> where's<00:02:54.970> this<00:02:55.060> new<00:02:55.120> ones<00:02:55.480> got<00:02:55.659> the

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.530 

laser<00:02:59.799> sensor<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.430> that<00:03:00.670> ball<00:03:00.879> does<00:03:01.060> not<00:03:01.329> like

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
laser sensor and that ball does not like

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.409 
laser sensor and that ball does not like
coming<00:03:01.810> out<00:03:01.870> of<00:03:01.930> there<00:03:02.139> oh<00:03:05.430> well<00:03:06.430> I'll<00:03:07.299> leave

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.900 

and<00:04:05.739> hold<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.040> camera<00:04:06.250> with<00:04:06.430> one<00:04:06.550> hand<00:04:06.730> and

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
operate that cover with the other is not

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.790 
operate that cover with the other is not
too<00:04:09.940> easy<00:04:10.060> ah<00:04:10.450> it's<00:04:10.989> a<00:04:11.080> wound<00:04:11.260> up<00:04:11.379> line<00:04:11.530> that's

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
too easy ah it's a wound up line that's

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.800 
too easy ah it's a wound up line that's
it<00:04:11.980> and<00:04:12.629> this<00:04:13.629> little<00:04:13.900> thing<00:04:14.110> right<00:04:15.419> here<00:04:16.419> is

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
it and this little thing right here is

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.180 
it and this little thing right here is
the<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.940> receiver<00:04:19.419> and<00:04:19.600> also<00:04:20.260> I'm<00:04:20.590> there's<00:04:21.130> a

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
the the receiver and also I'm there's a

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.150 
the the receiver and also I'm there's a
trick<00:04:21.430> to<00:04:21.459> getting<00:04:21.760> these<00:04:21.790> balls<00:04:22.120> out<00:04:23.160> you

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
trick to getting these balls out you

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.150 
trick to getting these balls out you
just<00:04:24.340> pop<00:04:24.490> them<00:04:24.580> out<00:04:24.699> from<00:04:24.910> back<00:04:25.060> here<00:04:26.160> you

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
just pop them out from back here you

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.550 
just pop them out from back here you
probably<00:04:27.490> need<00:04:27.729> two<00:04:27.910> hands<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.180> do<00:04:28.360> that<00:04:28.560> wow

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
probably need two hands to do that wow

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.010 
probably need two hands to do that wow
