figure so what I've been doing recently
is<00:00:21.539> just<00:00:22.140> taking<00:00:22.439> normal<00:00:23.100> pop<00:00:23.250> figures<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
is just taking normal pop figures in the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.759 
is just taking normal pop figures in the
way<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.300> they<00:00:24.390> come<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.869> kind<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.560> looking

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
way that they come and kind of looking

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.170 
way that they come and kind of looking
at<00:00:25.890> them<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.099> see<00:00:26.310> who<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.490> could<00:00:26.640> possibly

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
at them and see who I could possibly

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.150 
at them and see who I could possibly
transform<00:00:27.779> them<00:00:27.990> as<00:00:28.170> an<00:00:28.349> inspiration<00:00:28.890> to

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
transform them as an inspiration to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.859 
transform them as an inspiration to
another<00:00:29.580> character<00:00:29.849> by<00:00:30.480> either<00:00:30.660> like

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
another character by either like

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.209 
another character by either like
removing<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:31.619> what<00:00:31.800> they<00:00:31.920> have<00:00:32.099> in

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
removing the like what they have in

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.770 
removing the like what they have in
their<00:00:32.340> hands<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.880> by<00:00:32.969> just<00:00:33.180> repainting<00:00:33.660> them

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
their hands and by just repainting them

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.479 
their hands and by just repainting them
so<00:00:34.200> it's<00:00:34.290> more<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> repaint<00:00:34.980> tutorial

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
so it's more like a repaint tutorial

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.729 
so it's more like a repaint tutorial
versus<00:00:35.880> really<00:00:36.120> like<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.540> full<00:00:37.290> customization

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
which is this and I mean it worked okay

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.470 
which is this and I mean it worked okay
I<00:06:38.740> think<00:06:39.250> if<00:06:39.520> I<00:06:39.640> just<00:06:39.850> rubbed<00:06:40.030> it<00:06:40.120> with<00:06:40.150> album

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:40.480 
I think if I just rubbed it with album

school than done covered it with blue

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.530 
school than done covered it with blue
glitter<00:06:42.070> would<00:06:42.310> have<00:06:42.400> worked<00:06:42.520> better<00:06:42.760> but

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:43.540 
glitter would have worked better but

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.480 
glitter would have worked better but
they<00:06:43.900> didn't<00:06:44.140> have<00:06:44.320> the<00:06:44.470> color<00:06:44.650> I<00:06:44.740> wanted<00:06:45.100> so<00:06:45.460> I
