00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.910

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.930
 how could you hear my video this

 feeling too much like you can 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.790
 see here this is stained enough what 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.860
 is the pad of what are the 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.680
 hearing aids and good many 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.060
 They asked how I can clean it and 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.380
 well this is very simple very easy what 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.659
 The only thing they have to do is put a 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.600
 tablecloth down so you do not go to 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.880
 stain your table this is not going to get wet 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.229
 the spike or the inside of the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.410
 pads because you can throw 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.119
 lose soap and a little water and a 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.990
 toothbrush does not need it 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.360
 make new 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.220
 only that they need and the only thing 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.200
 have to do is wet the brush in 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.560
 soap 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.210
 Drain it must not be too wet 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.600
 and turning to this port 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.400
 and to think about what this is the 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.920
 pad as you can notice it goes 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.060
 removing what is the excess of muve there 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.800
 as you can see it is going 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.590
 whitening is getting the color that 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.110
 it was natural green as you can see if 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.900
 it works only should spin 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.119
 kilos in circles in what is the part 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.440
 that is dirty this we are going to do in 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.540
 all that is the pad for 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.229
 withdraw the excess of woman and good we go 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.850
 to cut this video and in the end 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.739
 that I finish cleaning it I'm going to 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.360
 show the result I hope you like it and 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.120
 help them for what it is to clean their 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.569
 hearing aids and they look much better and they will be 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.359
 like new now we come back 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.480
 this good as you can see this have 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:25.239
 they are clean and they look much better and 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.710
 they look the same as they just bought us already 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.990
 they do not have any stain this 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.030
 I recommend that they are a soap or a 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.700
 detergent that is bleach to like 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.040
 clothes so you can eliminate the 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.110
 spots this 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.420
 do it gently on what is all 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.969
 the pad since they can scratch the o 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.549
 It can be spoiled I recommend them 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:50.530
 do not let the water enter here 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.909
 neither in this part nor in those of 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.129
 the screws because if they can not oxidize 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:56.170
 this as you know here we have a small 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.140
 screw which can be oxidized in this 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.019
 part then do not wet this you're 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.150
 parts this all this does not matter if it 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.010
 wet since all this part does not have 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.109
 no cable the cable is not inside 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.530
 but it is only a diadem of 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:13.540
 plastic and good as you can see the 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.599
 result is very good stay be very 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.060
 well are they give a better look this one already 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.400
