00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:31.890
 the new nissan qashqai last on board 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.080
 of this new qashqai 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.550
 we immediately see that the design 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.500
 from the inside has been completely redesigned 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.600
 has modernized it's very nice 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.879
 look it remains relatively classic 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.250
 the quality of plastics at the level of 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.750
 the dashboard to progress there remains 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.100
 still a little bit hard at the level of 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.629
 againstportes it's a pity but 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.460

 was in the category average 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.859
 it's good but not exceptional 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.320
 finding for the chest that offers a 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.670
 volume of 440 liters is good but 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:10.950
