00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
day I just was always washing my hair I

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.200 
day I just was always washing my hair I
found<00:00:38.680> out<00:00:38.949> I<00:00:38.980> was<00:00:39.219> reading<00:00:39.609> some<00:00:39.879> different

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
found out I was reading some different

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.450 
found out I was reading some different
things<00:00:40.449> about<00:00:40.989> how<00:00:41.199> to<00:00:41.230> train<00:00:41.649> oil<00:00:41.890> a<00:00:42.070> hair<00:00:42.280> and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
things about how to train oil a hair and

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.709 
things about how to train oil a hair and
I<00:00:42.519> thought<00:00:42.699> that<00:00:42.969> was<00:00:43.090> so<00:00:43.210> interesting<00:00:43.629> I

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
I thought that was so interesting I

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.479 
I thought that was so interesting I
thought<00:00:43.870> that<00:00:44.109> maybe<00:00:44.289> I<00:00:44.559> was<00:00:45.039> like<00:00:45.219> well<00:00:45.460> that

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
thought that maybe I was like well that

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.540 
thought that maybe I was like well that
doesn't<00:00:46.090> apply<00:00:46.239> to<00:00:46.329> me<00:00:46.629> because<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:48.250> of<00:00:48.399> my

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
doesn't apply to me because just of my

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.810 
doesn't apply to me because just of my
hair<00:00:48.789> type<00:00:49.059> and<00:00:49.300> all<00:00:49.480> that<00:00:49.629> stuff<00:00:50.339> but<00:00:51.339> I<00:00:51.399> tried

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
hair type and all that stuff but I tried

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.470 
hair type and all that stuff but I tried
to<00:00:51.850> do<00:00:52.149> what<00:00:52.480> it<00:00:52.719> had<00:00:52.929> said<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:53.469> do<00:00:53.620> so<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:55.329> it

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
to do what it had said to do so and it

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.720 
to do what it had said to do so and it
actually<00:00:55.719> worked<00:00:56.320> and<00:00:56.589> so<00:00:57.219> you<00:00:57.280> can<00:00:57.550> actually

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
actually worked and so you can actually

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.479 
actually worked and so you can actually
train<00:00:58.269> if<00:00:58.510> you<00:00:58.629> cuz<00:00:59.019> like<00:00:59.140> I<00:00:59.320> have<00:00:59.559> I<00:00:59.890> don't

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
train if you cuz like I have I don't

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.000 
train if you cuz like I have I don't
have<00:01:00.760> thin<00:01:01.030> here<00:01:01.239> I<00:01:01.269> have<00:01:01.539> fine<00:01:01.870> hair<00:01:02.320> so<00:01:02.350> it's

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
have thin here I have fine hair so it's

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.110 
have thin here I have fine hair so it's
it's<00:01:03.579> just<00:01:03.789> fine<00:01:04.570> texture<00:01:05.290> so<00:01:05.650> oil<00:01:06.100> you<00:01:07.000> know

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
it's just fine texture so oil you know

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.670 
it's just fine texture so oil you know
all<00:01:07.240> that<00:01:07.390> stuff<00:01:07.660> shows<00:01:07.900> up<00:01:08.080> really<00:01:08.440> easily

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
all that stuff shows up really easily

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.660

and so I have trained my hair to not be

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.630 
and so I have trained my hair to not be
as<00:01:12.880> oily<00:01:13.570> not<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:14.020> produce<00:01:14.230> as<00:01:14.590> much<00:01:14.950> oil<00:01:15.250> and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640

out<00:01:56.740> of<00:01:56.920> oil<00:01:57.130> produce<00:01:58.090> more<00:01:58.330> oil<00:01:58.780> and<00:01:59.140> so<00:01:59.770> the

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
out of oil produce more oil and so the

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.860 
out of oil produce more oil and so the
more<00:02:00.430> that<00:02:00.550> we<00:02:00.610> wash<00:02:00.940> our<00:02:01.210> hair<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.720> more

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
more that we wash our hair the more

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.440 
more that we wash our hair the more
we're<00:02:02.050> training<00:02:02.380> our<00:02:02.620> scalp<00:02:03.060> saying<00:02:04.060> this<00:02:04.270> is

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
we're training our scalp saying this is

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.230 
we're training our scalp saying this is
how<00:02:04.570> much<00:02:04.720> oil<00:02:04.900> needs<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.260> be<00:02:05.320> produced<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.250> so

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
how much oil needs to be produced and so

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.320 
how much oil needs to be produced and so
our<00:02:07.600> body<00:02:07.840> knows<00:02:08.259> at<00:02:08.679> some<00:02:09.340> point<00:02:09.640> when<00:02:10.030> to

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
our body knows at some point when to

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.720 
our body knows at some point when to
kind<00:02:10.569> of<00:02:10.660> stop<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.110> slow<00:02:11.590> down<00:02:11.800> found<00:02:12.490> out

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
kind of stop and slow down found out

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.590 
kind of stop and slow down found out
that<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.270> need<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.810> go<00:02:14.380> without<00:02:14.710> washing<00:02:15.010> your

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
that you need to go without washing your

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.570 
that you need to go without washing your

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
here for a little while and then your

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.910 
here for a little while and then your
scalp<00:02:18.000> will<00:02:18.240> stop<00:02:18.480> producing<00:02:18.690> as<00:02:19.320> much<00:02:19.680> oil

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
scalp will stop producing as much oil

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.640 
scalp will stop producing as much oil
and<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:21.570> know<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.720> thought<00:02:21.960> that<00:02:22.020> was<00:02:22.410> kind<00:02:22.590> of

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
and you know I thought that was kind of

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.940 
and you know I thought that was kind of
a<00:02:22.770> myth<00:02:23.010> but<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.550> tried<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:25.350> course<00:02:25.410> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
a myth but I tried it and of course the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.800 
a myth but I tried it and of course the
you<00:02:26.280> know<00:02:26.400> my<00:02:26.580> second<00:02:26.940> day<00:02:27.060> here<00:02:27.090> by<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.720> end

you know my second day here by the end

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.750 
you know my second day here by the end
of<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.050> day<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.290> was<00:02:28.440> super<00:02:28.890> oil<00:02:29.070> in<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.640> was

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
of the day it was super oil in it it was

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.660 
of the day it was super oil in it it was
gross<00:02:30.090> but<00:02:30.360> over<00:02:31.080> time<00:02:31.320> what<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.680> did<00:02:31.980> was<00:02:32.340> if

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
gross but over time what I did was if

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.970 
gross but over time what I did was if
whenever<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.210> could<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.900> would<00:02:34.110> wash<00:02:34.590> my<00:02:34.770> hair

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
whenever I could I would wash my hair

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.610 
whenever I could I would wash my hair
every<00:02:35.010> other<00:02:35.430> day<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.180> then<00:02:36.930> over<00:02:37.320> time<00:02:37.560> I

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
every other day and then over time I

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.030 
every other day and then over time I
would<00:02:37.950> find<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.930> second<00:02:40.380> day<00:02:40.560> wouldn't

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
would find that the second day wouldn't

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.520 
would find that the second day wouldn't
be<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:41.550> oily<00:02:42.120> as<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.540> used<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.960> be<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.500> was

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
be as oily as it used to be and it was

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.740 
be as oily as it used to be and it was
actually<00:02:43.800> quite<00:02:44.190> nice<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.970> second<00:02:45.330> day<00:02:45.450> and

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
actually quite nice the second day and

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.670 
actually quite nice the second day and
it<00:02:45.900> was<00:02:46.080> like<00:02:47.120> normal<00:02:48.120> hair<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.630> then<00:02:49.320> if

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
it was like normal hair and then if

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.590 
it was like normal hair and then if
there<00:02:49.890> were<00:02:50.010> times<00:02:50.250> where<00:02:50.490> I<00:02:50.520> had<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.790> few<00:02:51.300> days

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
some of you guys might think this is

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.440

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
because it definitely helped me where I

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.580 
because it definitely helped me where I
had<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.190> few<00:02:56.580> days<00:02:56.880> where<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.480> would<00:02:57.600> go<00:02:57.900> three

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
had a few days where I would go three

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.370 
had a few days where I would go three
days<00:02:58.830> without<00:02:59.280> washing<00:02:59.670> my<00:02:59.880> hair<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.540> the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
days without washing my hair and the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.580 
days without washing my hair and the
longer<00:03:01.770> I<00:03:01.800> went<00:03:02.840> when<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:03.870> would<00:03:04.080> finally<00:03:04.320> wash

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
longer I went when I would finally wash

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.260 
longer I went when I would finally wash
my<00:03:04.830> hair<00:03:05.070> that<00:03:05.280> second<00:03:05.730> day<00:03:05.850> hair<00:03:06.090> was

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
my hair that second day hair was

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.210 
my hair that second day hair was
beautiful<00:03:07.050> it<00:03:07.170> was<00:03:07.200> great<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.860> was<00:03:07.980> not

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
beautiful it was great it was not

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.970 
beautiful it was great it was not
producing<00:03:08.730> as<00:03:08.850> much<00:03:09.060> oil<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:10.620> think

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
producing as much oil and so I think

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.650 
producing as much oil and so I think
I've<00:03:11.190> gone<00:03:11.550> without<00:03:11.730> like<00:03:12.030> four<00:03:12.300> days<00:03:12.510> without

I've gone without like four days without

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.570 
I've gone without like four days without
washing<00:03:12.990> my<00:03:13.350> hair<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:13.950> would<00:03:14.100> just<00:03:14.250> train

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580

washing my hair and I would just train
it<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.570> longer<00:03:15.960> I<00:03:15.990> would<00:03:16.230> go<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:17.340> the

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
it and the longer I would go the the

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.270 
it and the longer I would go the the
longer<00:03:18.090> my<00:03:18.270> my<00:03:18.780> hair<00:03:19.050> would<00:03:19.230> be<00:03:19.620> fine<00:03:19.980> without

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.580 
and it's like a hairspray type of
applicator<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.570> basically<00:04:15.960> you<00:04:16.230> shake<00:04:16.560> it

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
applicator and basically you shake it

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.500 
applicator and basically you shake it
and<00:04:16.859> then<00:04:16.950> you<00:04:17.040> spray<00:04:17.609> it<00:04:17.850> on<00:04:18.000> your<00:04:18.210> hair<00:04:18.480> you

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
and then you spray it on your hair you

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.260 
and then you spray it on your hair you
leave<00:04:19.080> it<00:04:19.230> in<00:04:19.440> for<00:04:19.710> two<00:04:19.920> minutes<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.549> then<00:04:21.210> you

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
leave it in for two minutes and then you

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.350 
leave it in for two minutes and then you
brush<00:04:21.750> it<00:04:21.960> out<00:04:22.080> and<00:04:22.140> it's<00:04:22.500> basically<00:04:23.360> almost

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
brush it out and it's basically almost

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.540 
brush it out and it's basically almost
like<00:04:24.870> powder

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
like powder

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.899 
like powder
in<00:04:26.669> a<00:04:26.909> hairspray<00:04:27.389> form<00:04:28.129> because<00:04:29.129> if<00:04:29.430> you<00:04:29.639> spray

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:29.909 
in a hairspray form because if you spray

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:32.420 
in a hairspray form because if you spray
too<00:04:29.970> much<00:04:30.360> it<00:04:30.930> will<00:04:31.199> turn<00:04:31.470> white<00:04:31.740> so<00:04:32.159> I<00:04:32.190> think

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
too much it will turn white so I think

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.159 
too much it will turn white so I think
that's<00:04:32.789> kind<00:04:33.000> of<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.270> whole<00:04:33.479> it's<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.900> same

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
that's kind of the whole it's the same

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.529 
that's kind of the whole it's the same
type<00:04:34.530> of<00:04:34.560> concept<00:04:35.000> except<00:04:36.000> you<00:04:36.090> can<00:04:36.270> kind<00:04:36.479> of

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
type of concept except you can kind of

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.490 
type of concept except you can kind of
brush<00:04:36.870> it<00:04:36.900> brush<00:04:37.830> it<00:04:37.889> out<00:04:38.990> unless<00:04:39.990> you<00:04:40.050> put<00:04:40.379> too

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
brush it brush it out unless you put too

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.559 
brush it brush it out unless you put too
much<00:04:40.680> and<00:04:40.860> then<00:04:40.949> it's<00:04:41.099> you<00:04:41.400> know<00:04:41.550> so<00:04:42.120> I<00:04:42.150> don't
