00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.460
 in raw food we do not forget to 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.259
 those that are also traditions 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.180
 cultural and the dish par excellence 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.389
 Italian for example is spaghetti 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.929
 in tourism we will make our spaghetti on 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.060
 our first course with zucchini 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.520
 that we're going to cut this way 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.470
 cut the top of the courgette e 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.250
 the part below when we go to 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.330
 choose courgettes from ours 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.189
 trustworthy greengrocer we try to 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.500
 possibly choose the straightest 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.750
 as hard as possible because we will use 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.820
 this instrument the spirit al 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.000
 in this way we will support row joints 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.880
 in these 20 thousand back and the 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.090
 upper part is very simple there is a 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.920
 crank and we're going to do this job 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.620
 and we'll see how magically from this 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.150
 movement will produce their own 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.550
 spaghetti with this recipe we will go to 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.170
 amaze all our friends who don't 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.060
 they will realize that they will be spaghetti 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.720
 zucchini you see real ones 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.720
 spaghetti 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.570
 see this way 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.320
 a zucchini usually vast for one 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.940
 portion therefore also depending on the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.940
 we will adjust the size of the courgette 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:41.000
 it also depends on how much they eat 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:43.119
 your friends here they are if they are too much 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.630
 long we can safely 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:54.460
 cut them in this way it looks like a cut 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.460
 and these are how they present themselves
