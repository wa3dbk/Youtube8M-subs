00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hi my homies my name is merkin 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.990
 and welcome to the new review 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.070
 furnished under the name 15w 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.230
 31a almost release 1 and 9 I congratulate you 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.730
 and this is a short overview of all 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.320
 innovations that are in this dream in 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.900
 new blocks were added to shock 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.789
 magenta block magenta table magenta 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.789
 purple bull and block and also 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.350
 stone brick with ander block 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.960
 unfortunately there are no crafts, but they look 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.609
 they are very cool there is also 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.980
 small changes to ender world like 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.630
 see ender portal to the ordinary world already 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.790
 immediately generated in a certain 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.739
 place he will not appear where we are 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.170
 killed the dragon he has his place already 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.030
 it is very convenient also as you see on 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.590
 some crystals have such a cell 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.260
 which must first be broken to 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.020
 knock down this crystal this is very cruel 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.270
 done but still very cool dragon 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.039
 had to spew flame out of his mouth 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.930
 but unfortunately for some reason it is not 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.480
 does probably will do it in 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.219
 the following snapshot ah same supplies 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.719
 my killed our dragon appears here 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.879
 such a small portal which is very 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.729
 interesting animation if we take 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.390
 his usual pearls then we'll fly in 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.119
 wondrous wonderful world in which there is immediately 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.310
 same fortress we just appeared the most 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.439
 the luckiest people in the world see there are 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.780
 small trees they are called from not 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.759
 I am mistaken chorus client is a tree and also 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.229
 at the top they have and their flowers 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.479
 which which look very very 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.520
 cool here and so is as even that 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.780
 in the new world they are very long 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.759
 All such interesting look 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.220
 relatives look very cool 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.320
 so let's take a closer look at 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.930
 the corners of the fortress are such small 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.850
 endor endor shelves that can 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.560
 put in different ways it is very 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.960
 Looks cool for now I don't know which one 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.060
 they have a role but as you can see they just 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.549
 publish some particles and illuminate 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.200
 territory to get to the top in 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.210
 the tower you will need to pass a number 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.210
 tests but as you can see there is 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.340
 small gifts are such blocks 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.710
 these are real monsters who 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.320
 may begin to knock you down after passing 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.149
 Some height levels you can find 20 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.590
 ball in which are very valuable prizes 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.350
 sometimes even to you 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.840
 enchanted at the maximum frequency yet 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.610
 take small flags in the corners of the tower 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.100
 which symbolize this fortress 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.990
 I noticed him here and there 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.970
 a small sensor which is very very 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.520
 wildly like a ship and if we 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.860
 we will get him then we can for free 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.590
 get our lighthouse that looks like this 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.750
 so and a little more iron blocks here 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.520
 there are no buffs and no life 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.230
 the fact that there is a small cooking 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.510
 stand with two business it is very 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.610
 cool looks so dare 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.560
 Well, as you can see , these monsters are called 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.540
 shockers and after I go out with 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.560
 their creative mode then they 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.650
 start to stay me small 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.110
 bombs that after hitting me 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.310
 start to give the effect of levitation and i don't 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.020
 I can do nothing about it, I just 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.430
 flying up when this pub ends 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.380
 I will just fall and crash to death 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.330
 uman kraft add my father in law now we 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.980
 we can finally enjoy her very 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.110
 sweet taste and after two we have it 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.120
 planted she grows up and looks like that 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.340
 this way was added very 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.560
 many different arrows they all have their 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.900
 effects from very good to very 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.850
 the best and there is also one very 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.760
 interesting arrow called aru spectrum 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.040
 ana if we get some object and 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.720
 he were zip up then we can him 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.790

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.670
 fall I see this this man this 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.650
 such a small one and I am not mistaken in 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.420
 counter strike is very convenient to play 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.070
 hunger games just gorgeous 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.990
 release it on I finally appeared 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.510

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.160
 now starts walking from his bow 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.890
 moving in different directions and now i'm 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.410
 get out of your mode and we'll see how he 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.960

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.330

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.370
 Not massively channel tensioned 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.440
 string 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.490
 it's gorgeous at the beets just so not 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.100
 left without attention 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.800
 still added subs and beet looks 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.410
 rather strange but probably tasty 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.820
 now if we click the project on in 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.350
 reeds on the grass we can do 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.230
 small tropinochku 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.090

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.330
 only defend and also pick in the cold 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.250
 but what is most interesting here added 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.229
 now when we ourselves will dig any 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.479
 blocks we can with the left button 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.790
 put the torch it will not tear us 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.030
 but 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.890
