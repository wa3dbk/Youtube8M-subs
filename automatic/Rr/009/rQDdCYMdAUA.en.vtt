put the peyton manning up on the screen

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.260 
put the peyton manning up on the screen
is<00:01:58.530> because<00:01:59.040> i<00:01:59.219> don't<00:01:59.640> think<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.969> there<00:02:00.240> are

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
is because i don't think that there are

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.120 
is because i don't think that there are
any<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:00.840> on<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> auction<00:02:01.290> block<00:02:01.530> i<00:02:01.829> mean<00:02:01.979> we

any up on the auction block i mean we

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.770

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.530 
but i highly doubt it i haven't seen one
yet<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.860> let's<00:02:10.860> go<00:02:11.099> ahead<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.400> see<00:02:11.550> none<00:02:12.150> are

paintings up at the current moment so

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.470 
paintings up at the current moment so
now<00:02:15.960> that<00:02:16.200> we<00:02:16.320> know<00:02:16.350> that<00:02:16.890> let's<00:02:17.550> go<00:02:17.760> ahead<00:02:18.150> and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
now that we know that let's go ahead and

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.200 
now that we know that let's go ahead and
cancel<00:02:19.350> out<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:19.980> actually<00:02:20.820> I<00:02:20.880> can<00:02:21.030> just

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
cancel out this actually I can just

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.900 
cancel out this actually I can just

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
reset all using l3 and we're going to

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.510 
reset all using l3 and we're going to

fast<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:27.300> kind<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.600> get<00:02:27.690> an<00:02:27.750> idea<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:28.230> how<00:02:28.500> much

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
fast to kind of get an idea of how much

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.200 
fast to kind of get an idea of how much
it<00:02:28.830> would<00:02:28.920> cost<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.280> do<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.670> set<00:02:29.910> if<00:02:30.090> you're

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
it would cost to do the set if you're

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.030 
it would cost to do the set if you're
going<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.390> risk<00:02:30.720> trying<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.440> get<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.710> peyton

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
going to risk trying to get the peyton

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.040 
going to risk trying to get the peyton
manning<00:02:32.370> let's<00:02:32.940> see<00:02:33.120> how<00:02:33.240> many<00:02:33.420> coins<00:02:33.660> you're

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
manning let's see how many coins you're

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.100 
manning let's see how many coins you're
looking<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:35.040> spend<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.610> do<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.970> set<00:02:36.270> no

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
looking to spend to do that set no

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.050 
looking to spend to do that set no
Peyton<00:02:37.380> Manning's<00:02:37.800> up<00:02:37.920> yet<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:38.370> whoever<00:02:38.760> gets

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
Peyton Manning's up yet so whoever gets

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.940 
Peyton Manning's up yet so whoever gets
it's<00:02:39.300> probably<00:02:39.840> going<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.110> get<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.530> crazy

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
it's probably going to get a crazy

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.400 
it's probably going to get a crazy
amount<00:02:41.370> for<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.670> first<00:02:41.970> one<00:02:42.180> selling<00:02:42.630> elite

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
amount for the first one selling elite

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.250 
amount for the first one selling elite
badges<00:02:43.830> are<00:02:43.980> 48<00:02:44.580> thousand<00:02:45.090> coins<00:02:45.210> 48<00:02:45.990> 49

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
badges are 48 thousand coins 48 49

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.370 
badges are 48 thousand coins 48 49
around<00:02:46.770> 50k<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:47.450> you'd<00:02:48.450> multiply<00:02:48.660> that<00:02:49.140> times

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
around 50k so you'd multiply that times

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.640 
around 50k so you'd multiply that times
seven<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.460> I<00:02:50.900> guess<00:02:51.900> we're<00:02:52.140> sitting<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.560> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
seven and I guess we're sitting in the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.070 
seven and I guess we're sitting in the
ballpark<00:02:53.220> around<00:02:53.730> maybe<00:02:54.090> three<00:02:54.600> hundred<00:02:54.990> and

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
ballpark around maybe three hundred and

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.130 
ballpark around maybe three hundred and
thirty<00:02:55.440> thousand<00:02:56.010> coins<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.550> do<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.910> set<00:02:57.150> so

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
thirty thousand coins to do the set so

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.900 
thirty thousand coins to do the set so
there<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:58.440> guys<00:02:58.620> have<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.610> is<00:02:59.640> the
