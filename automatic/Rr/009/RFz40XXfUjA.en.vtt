00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.830 
just make sure it's 4 ounces and I
strongly<00:02:30.950> into<00:02:31.310> little<00:02:31.520> pieces<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.150> I'm

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
strongly into little pieces and I'm

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.090 
strongly into little pieces and I'm
going<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:33.020> pop<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:33.320> in<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.500> microwave

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
going to pop it in a microwave

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.190 
going to pop it in a microwave
I<00:02:34.250> think<00:02:34.820> it's<00:02:34.940> at<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.060> time<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.810> then<00:02:36.020> probably

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
I think it's at a time and then probably

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.770 
I think it's at a time and then probably
in<00:02:36.410> 10<00:02:36.620> seconds<00:02:37.010> stir<00:02:37.430> it<00:02:37.640> as<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.330> guess<00:02:38.540> and

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
in 10 seconds stir it as I guess and

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.440 
in 10 seconds stir it as I guess and
