 this time I come to introduce you 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.810
 our five models of trucks a 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.019
 pent our leading product in our 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.600
 brand where we have been selling for six years 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:36.220
 and marketing this product we have 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.809
 For more than six years we have arrived 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.900
 to the Colombian market with five 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:44.019
 water truck references 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:46.510
 symbolic 527 and gymkhana that they have in 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.750
 common the five finished references of 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.400
 First both exteriors and interiors 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.430
 the support we have in Colombia with 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.080
 More than 25 thousand spare parts in 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.210
 the five stores that we have 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.769
 nationwide cargo entity is 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.280
 it would be our second reference that is 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.050
 of chimba 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.239
 and the load capacity of this vehicle 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.270
 is 4.1 tons and the long 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.520
 carrozable is 3.6 meters that we have 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.280
 with this a team with a good very good 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.680
 very good motor very good long carrozable 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.090
 which allows us to bring volume and a 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.220
 very good load capacity what we 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.330
 It allows to carry very good weight 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.979
 This vehicle is equipped with an engine 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.930
 115-horsepower yutai is 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.220
 It is also important to highlight that the 5 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.020
 units of vehicles with which 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.540
 we have a device to which 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.460
 we call us electric master is 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.900
 a very simple button in the cabin what 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.509
 what this button does is isolate the 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.369
 current completely from the cabin to 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.140
 the batteries that we make with this 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.710
 we have a longer lifespan of the 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.600
 electronic equipment inside the cabin 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.520
 we avoid that we are suddenly downloaded 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.880
 on a trip or somewhere in which 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.800
 we can not count on the equipment to 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.600
 reveal us in this aspect in our 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.550
 trucks this is the smallest we have 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.009
 It is simple and we call for the 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.250
 Colombian market drowns capacity 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.470
 load of this truck is 2.6 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.459
 tons and the long truck is 3 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.280
 and 3.5 meters that we have with this car 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.050
 a very good team for the service 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.019
 urban for the people who 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.310
 require inside the city we count 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.290
 with the shower motor and how I had them 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.510
 commented previously with 101 horses 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.310
 of power in load capacity this 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.470
 would be our third reference to be 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.239
 publish 5 we can say that it is the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.130
 consented due to the units that 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.840
 we have at this moment rolling the 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.500
 automotive park is the reference that 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.500
 more we sell we have four types of 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.440
 balls and two simple cabins with air 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.330
 no air and two cab extended with air 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.459
 and without air what we do with this we give 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.260
 to the customer the possibility to choose 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.360
 we are at this moment one of the only 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.380
 brands that you have in this ability to 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.240
 load 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.250
 the option to tell the client if you 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.020
 he wants it big if he wants it with 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.310
 stateroom if you are going to have your trips 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.980
 long you can have a place to 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.600
 rest if you want something more 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.270
 simple then we have the option too 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.030
 of doing this the car was equipped 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.920
 with a 125 horsepower cummins engine 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.160
 power the load capacity of this 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.970
 vehicle is 5.8 tons and the length 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.130
 carrozable is 5.6 meters with our 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.100
 third reference would be double 5 in 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.120
 this we have four versions without 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.370
 air conditioning with air 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.780
 air conditioning extended cab without 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.850
 conditioning and cabin lit with 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.010
 air conditioning if we do with this 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.420
 we are one of the only brands in the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.280
 Colombian market that offers to the 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.010
 client a broad portfolio because 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.380
 These vehicles are for mobilizations 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.180
 already between cities unlike the 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.280
 two little ones that we already saw that is something 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.810
 for more urban by having these four 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.120
 options the client chooses if he wants it 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.580
 with cabin or without stateroom as for 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.330
 internal equipment 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.430
 this vehicle is a cummins engine of 125 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.580
 horsepower the ability to 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.060
 load is 5 thousand 800 kilograms and the 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:06.570
 long truck is 5,500 mm 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.430
 the 5.5 meters in terms of cabin chassis 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.470
 2 this would be our last reference 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.900
 but in trucks it is the fourth reference 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.420
 I will explain you why is the 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.609
 we call duplicate 7 is a truck 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.370
 equipped with a motor starts the same 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.770
 than the ica 5 of 3.9 but this one 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.900
 It has 140 horsepower and has 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.130
 Six forward speeds fit 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.050
 highlight that the three vehicles that 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.210
 we have seen before they have only five 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.300
 speeds the carrying capacity of 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.360
 this 6.8 tons and the long carrozable 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.070
 6.6 tons as well as the ica 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.900
 5 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.670
 This is a very well equipped vehicle 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.980
 very well motorized for capacity 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.900
 load in weight and for load capacity 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.190
 in volume to close our 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.900
 truck portfolio 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.980
 we have a dump truck to which 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.810

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.730
 we have it at this moment in a single 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.310
 version that is extended cabin with air 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.720
 factory conditioning this gives us the 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.470
 Load capacity of 10 tons 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:06.430
 already has a cummins engine of 180 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:10.170

 This is our truck portfolio 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:18.610
