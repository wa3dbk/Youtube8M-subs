so<00:00:24.380> here<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:26.840> obviously<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.050> zoomed<00:00:28.320> in<00:00:28.470> a

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
so here it is obviously it zoomed in a

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.620 
so here it is obviously it zoomed in a
little<00:00:28.560> bit<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.279> we'll<00:00:29.460> just<00:00:30.500> take<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.769> out

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
little bit so we'll just take it out

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.170 
little bit so we'll just take it out
here<00:00:33.630> we<00:00:33.750> go

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
here we go

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:45.369 
here we go
so<00:00:36.180> right<00:00:36.660> here<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:41.329> waffen-ss<00:00:44.270> figure

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
so right here is a a waffen-ss figure

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.360 
so right here is a a waffen-ss figure
that<00:00:46.379> i<00:00:46.410> painted<00:00:48.079> it's<00:00:49.079> not<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.410> greatest<00:00:49.860> but

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
that i painted it's not the greatest but

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.470 
that i painted it's not the greatest but
um<00:00:51.829> yeah<00:00:52.829> for<00:00:53.100> an<00:00:53.190> idea<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.640> how<00:00:53.820> big<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> tank

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
um yeah for an idea of how big the tank

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.660 
um yeah for an idea of how big the tank
is<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:54.989> not<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.410> scale<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.070> do<00:00:56.129> want<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.520> make

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
is it's not in scale I do want to make

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.670 
is it's not in scale I do want to make
the<00:00:56.850> tiger<00:00:57.239> slightly<00:00:57.629> smaller<00:00:57.989> because<00:00:58.440> it's

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the tiger slightly smaller because it's

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.250 
the tiger slightly smaller because it's
just<00:00:58.859> unrealistically<00:00:59.460> big<00:01:00.059> right<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:03.260> like

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
just unrealistically big right now like

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.090 
just unrealistically big right now like
this<00:01:04.439> guy's<00:01:04.650> chin<00:01:05.250> should<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:06.000> above<00:01:06.390> this

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
this guy's chin should be above this

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.260 
this guy's chin should be above this
this<00:01:08.100> corner<00:01:08.460> right<00:01:08.670> here<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:08.970> as<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.119> can

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
this corner right here but as you can

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.500 
this corner right here but as you can
see<00:01:09.330> his<00:01:09.659> eyes<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:10.409> barely<00:01:10.619> see<00:01:11.010> over<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.510> so

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
see his eyes can barely see over it so

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.179 
see his eyes can barely see over it so
that's<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.840> bit<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.140> problem<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:13.979> want

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
that's a bit of a problem and I do want

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.460 
that's a bit of a problem and I do want
to<00:01:14.280> fix<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.610> at<00:01:14.760> some<00:01:14.909> stage<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.470> that

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
to fix that at some stage and that

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.190 
to fix that at some stage and that
probably<00:01:16.950> means<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.700> I'll<00:01:17.820> be<00:01:18.200> downgrading

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
probably means that I'll be downgrading

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.859 
probably means that I'll be downgrading
from<00:01:19.409> these<00:01:19.560> three<00:01:19.890> right<00:01:20.100> treads<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.869> some

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
from these three right treads to some

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.670 
from these three right treads to some
Burke<00:01:22.830> mania<00:01:23.189> double<00:01:23.549> wide<00:01:24.409> instead<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.590> these

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
Burke mania double wide instead of these

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.060 
Burke mania double wide instead of these
Lego<00:01:26.369> 3-wood<00:01:26.990> anyway<00:01:27.990> almost<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.380> review<00:01:28.650> so

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
Lego 3-wood anyway almost a review so

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.710 
Lego 3-wood anyway almost a review so
with<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.549> front<00:01:31.009> we<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.509> few<00:01:33.509> little

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
with the front we have a few little

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.420 
with the front we have a few little
things<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.229> here<00:01:34.439> we<00:01:34.530> got<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.829> drive<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.250> you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
things on here we got the drive with you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.859 
things on here we got the drive with you
port<00:01:35.990> which<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.020> um<00:01:38.570> quite<00:01:39.570> nicely

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
port which is um quite nicely

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.780 
port which is um quite nicely
brick-built<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.650> think<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.400> got<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.670> little

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
brick-built I think it's got this little

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.060 
brick-built I think it's got this little
panel<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.329> front<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:42.960> makes<00:01:43.770> for

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
panel in front of it just makes for

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.310 
panel in front of it just makes for
protection<00:01:44.490> either<00:01:44.850> shovel<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.360> couple<00:01:46.200> of

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
protection either shovel a couple of

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.080 
protection either shovel a couple of
hooks<00:01:46.979> on<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> front<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:49.820> machine<00:01:50.820> gun

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
hooks on the front and the machine gun

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.130 
hooks on the front and the machine gun
port<00:01:51.840> here<00:01:52.170> which<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:53.479> poseable<00:01:55.909> as<00:01:56.909> well<00:01:57.329> so

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
port here which is poseable as well so

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.910 
port here which is poseable as well so
that's<00:01:58.290> quite<00:01:58.469> nice

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.810 

moving<00:02:01.670> on<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.450> side<00:02:03.370> you<00:02:04.370> can<00:02:04.400> see<00:02:04.700> it's

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
moving on to the side you can see it's

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.290 
moving on to the side you can see it's
an<00:02:04.940> incredibly<00:02:05.300> long<00:02:05.659> tank<00:02:06.080> as<00:02:06.320> well<00:02:07.179> but<00:02:08.179> it

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
an incredibly long tank as well but it

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.969 
an incredibly long tank as well but it
doesn't<00:02:08.450> have<00:02:08.720> any<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:08.990> that<00:02:09.050> sloping<00:02:09.860> you

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
doesn't have any of that sloping you

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.100 
doesn't have any of that sloping you
know<00:02:10.100> should<00:02:10.429> actually<00:02:11.090> slip<00:02:11.450> downwards

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
know should actually slip downwards

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.210 
know should actually slip downwards
which<00:02:12.560> it<00:02:12.740> doesn't

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
which it doesn't

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.840 
which it doesn't
mm<00:02:13.880> this<00:02:14.450> Tiger<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:14.810> pretty<00:02:15.080> much<00:02:15.230> just<00:02:15.380> a<00:02:15.500> box

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
mm this Tiger is pretty much just a box

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.190 
mm this Tiger is pretty much just a box
which<00:02:16.850> is<00:02:17.090> partly<00:02:17.450> why<00:02:17.630> I<00:02:17.660> want<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:17.900> redo<00:02:18.170> it

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
which is partly why I want to redo it

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.110 
which is partly why I want to redo it
because<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:18.680> didn't<00:02:18.980> get<00:02:19.070> any<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.610> slipping

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
because I didn't get any of the slipping

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.440 
because I didn't get any of the slipping
right<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:21.560> first<00:02:21.800> time<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.040> did<00:02:22.190> it

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
right the first time I did it

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.720 
right the first time I did it
hey<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.540> can<00:02:23.750> see<00:02:23.900> we've<00:02:24.050> got<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.730> road

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
hey you can see we've got the road

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.870
