00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
ahead and start learning a little bit of

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.099 
ahead and start learning a little bit of
this<00:00:20.699> because<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.270> opens<00:00:21.600> up<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.840> lot<00:00:21.869> of

they going to add to it for now is just

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.420 
they going to add to it for now is just
snare<00:00:30.630> drum<00:00:30.960> on<00:00:31.140> two<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.590> four<00:00:31.769> my<00:00:32.130> leave<00:00:32.309> the

snare drum on two and four my leave the
right<00:00:32.610> hand<00:00:32.910> out<00:00:33.120> because<00:00:33.860> it's<00:00:34.860> usually<00:00:35.190> if

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
right hand out because it's usually if

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.590 
right hand out because it's usually if
you<00:00:35.430> try<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.640> do<00:00:35.760> everything<00:00:36.000> at<00:00:36.149> once<00:00:36.180> it's<00:00:36.570> a

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
you try to do everything at once it's a

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.510 
you try to do everything at once it's a
little<00:00:36.840> tricky<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.440> want<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.680> isolate<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
little tricky so you want to isolate the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.160 
little tricky so you want to isolate the
new<00:00:38.700> thing<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.480> easiest<00:00:39.510> way<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.960> do<00:00:40.140> that

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
new thing and the easiest way to do that

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.750 
new thing and the easiest way to do that
is<00:00:40.350> put<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:40.829> something<00:00:41.010> familiar<00:00:41.309> and

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
is put it with something familiar and

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.280 
is put it with something familiar and
the<00:00:42.210> hi-hat<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.660> bass<00:00:42.809> drum<00:00:42.930> are<00:00:43.140> lining

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
the hi-hat and the bass drum are lining

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.869 
the hi-hat and the bass drum are lining
up<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.860> do<00:00:43.980> them<00:00:44.100> together<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> snare

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
up so do them together and the snare

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.610 
up so do them together and the snare
drum<00:00:45.149> lines<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.899> right<00:00:46.079> with<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.320> so

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
drum lines up right with it so

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.990 
drum lines up right with it so
everything<00:00:46.950> should<00:00:47.070> work<00:00:47.129> together<00:00:47.399> just

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
everything should work together just

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.950 
everything should work together just
take<00:00:48.149> your<00:00:48.270> time<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:51.920> 1234

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
take your time and you can do it 1234

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.110 
take your time and you can do it 1234
1234<00:00:56.719> now<00:00:57.719> once<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.070> go<00:00:59.699> ahead<00:00:59.940> and

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
1234 now once you have that go ahead and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.340 
1234 now once you have that go ahead and
try<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.449> eighth<00:01:00.660> notes<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.140> hi-hat

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
try and do eighth notes on the hi-hat

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.889 
try and do eighth notes on the hi-hat
and<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.430> opens<00:01:02.699> up<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.940> whole<00:01:02.969> nother<00:01:03.449> pattern

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
and it opens up a whole nother pattern

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.219 
and it opens up a whole nother pattern
so<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.739> would<00:01:05.040> be<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.930> actually<00:01:06.930> I'll<00:01:07.140> do

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
so that would be this I actually I'll do

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.070 
so that would be this I actually I'll do
one<00:01:07.439> measure<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:08.090> just<00:01:09.090> what<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.270> did<00:01:09.450> then<00:01:09.930> I'll

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
one measure of just what I did then I'll

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.210 
one measure of just what I did then I'll
add<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> eighth<00:01:10.439> notes<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.890> hi-hat<00:01:11.040> and

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
add the eighth notes on the hi-hat and

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.880 
add the eighth notes on the hi-hat and
you'll<00:01:11.430> see<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> difference<00:01:11.700> ok<00:01:12.450> here<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:12.780> go

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
you'll see the difference ok here we go

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:27.380 
you'll see the difference ok here we go
one<00:01:24.500> so<00:01:25.500> basically<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.909> get<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.119> really

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
one so basically you get that really

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.149 
one so basically you get that really
cool<00:01:27.570> sound<00:01:27.900> out<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:28.380> by<00:01:28.560> timing<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
cool sound out of it just by timing that

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.890 
cool sound out of it just by timing that
left<00:01:29.400> foot<00:01:29.579> right<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.119> line<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.540> up<00:01:30.720> with<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
left foot right and line it up with the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.870 
left foot right and line it up with the
bass<00:01:31.140> drum<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.650> little<00:01:31.979> faster<00:01:32.369> sounds<00:01:32.790> like

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
bass drum a little faster sounds like

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:45.510 
bass drum a little faster sounds like
this<00:01:33.119> one<00:01:33.450> too

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.149 

okay<00:01:46.630> real<00:01:47.630> easy<00:01:47.659> another<00:01:48.649> trick<00:01:48.860> you<00:01:48.979> can<00:01:49.009> do

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
okay real easy another trick you can do

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.800 
okay real easy another trick you can do
right<00:01:49.369> away<00:01:49.399> is<00:01:49.759> just<00:01:49.820> put<00:01:50.149> the<00:01:50.210> right<00:01:50.360> hand<00:01:50.630> on

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
right away is just put the right hand on

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.779 
right away is just put the right hand on
the<00:01:50.840> ride<00:01:51.110> cymbal<00:01:51.140> keep<00:01:51.770> this<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:52.189> same<00:01:52.429> so

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
the ride cymbal keep this the same so

00:01:52.789 --> 00:02:00.649 
the ride cymbal keep this the same so
now<00:01:52.969> you<00:01:53.030> have<00:01:53.270> this

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.179 

put<00:02:01.659> based<00:02:01.840> remote<00:02:01.990> quarter<00:02:02.560> notes<00:02:02.740> I<00:02:02.920> wasn't
