it's<00:02:41.150> always<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.480> tough<00:02:41.750> line<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:43.370> know<00:02:43.490> you

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
it's always a tough line you know you

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.940 
it's always a tough line you know you
want<00:02:44.420> your<00:02:44.540> defense<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:44.990> be<00:02:45.020> physical<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.620> the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
want your defense to be physical and the

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.170 
want your defense to be physical and the
way<00:02:46.130> they<00:02:46.280> were<00:02:46.400> in<00:02:46.520> the<00:02:46.580> goal<00:02:46.760> line<00:02:46.940> in<00:02:47.120> the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
way they were in the goal line in the

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.380 
way they were in the goal line in the
mentality<00:02:47.660> but<00:02:48.650> also<00:02:48.860> make<00:02:49.850> great<00:02:49.880> decisions

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
mentality but also make great decisions

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.600 
mentality but also make great decisions
so<00:02:51.820> just<00:02:52.820> like<00:02:53.950> would<00:02:54.950> be<00:02:55.070> if<00:02:55.160> we<00:02:55.190> just<00:02:55.460> got

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
so just like would be if we just got

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.950 
so just like would be if we just got
here<00:02:55.790> were<00:02:55.940> right<00:02:56.450> now<00:02:56.600> into<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.550> into<00:02:58.960> going
