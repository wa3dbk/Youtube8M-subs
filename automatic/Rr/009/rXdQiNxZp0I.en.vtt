we<00:02:22.129> have<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.280> pretty<00:02:22.519> base<00:02:22.700> or<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.750> know<00:02:23.870> a

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
we have a pretty base or you know a

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.660 
we have a pretty base or you know a
bunch<00:02:24.200> of<00:02:24.319> tulips<00:02:24.620> or<00:02:24.859> some<00:02:25.099> roses<00:02:25.459> or<00:02:25.640> a

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
bunch of tulips or some roses or a

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.069 
bunch of tulips or some roses or a
mixture<00:02:26.000> ranking<00:02:26.359> whatever<00:02:26.659> you<00:02:26.780> decide<00:02:27.049> to

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
mixture ranking whatever you decide to

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:27.640 
mixture ranking whatever you decide to
put<00:02:27.290> in<00:02:27.439> it

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
put in it

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.470 
put in it
another<00:02:28.129> version<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:28.609> this<00:02:28.730> base<00:02:28.939> that<00:02:29.180> I<00:02:29.269> like

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
another version of this base that I like

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.110 
another version of this base that I like
to<00:02:29.599> do<00:02:29.750> is<00:02:29.959> putting<00:02:30.439> a<00:02:30.590> bow<00:02:31.400> at<00:02:31.760> each

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
to do is putting a bow at each

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.569 
to do is putting a bow at each
intersection<00:02:32.510> where<00:02:33.109> the<00:02:33.230> ribbon<00:02:33.530> process<00:02:34.010> so

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
intersection where the ribbon process so

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.240 
intersection where the ribbon process so
to<00:02:34.640> make<00:02:35.030> this<00:02:35.239> bow<00:02:35.540> I'm<00:02:36.170> going<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.590> tie<00:02:36.859> a<00:02:36.889> to

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
to make this bow I'm going to tie a to

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.949 
to make this bow I'm going to tie a to
Lupo<00:02:37.700> but<00:02:37.730> I'm<00:02:37.969> going<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.209> do<00:02:38.329> it<00:02:38.480> in<00:02:38.629> a<00:02:38.719> little

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
Lupo but I'm going to do it in a little

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.349 
Lupo but I'm going to do it in a little
bit<00:02:39.019> different<00:02:39.439> way<00:02:39.620> I'll<00:02:39.920> do<00:02:40.069> is<00:02:40.189> I<00:02:40.310> take<00:02:40.549> two

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
bit different way I'll do is I take two

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.199 
bit different way I'll do is I take two
loops<00:02:41.629> in<00:02:41.810> my<00:02:41.930> hand<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.500> ribbon<00:02:42.889> and<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:43.939> just

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
loops in my hand the ribbon and I just

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:51.940 
loops in my hand the ribbon and I just
flip<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.659> around<00:02:47.530> tight<00:02:48.530> in<00:02:49.040> itself<00:02:50.799> what<00:02:51.799> you

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
flip it around tight in itself what you

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.069 
flip it around tight in itself what you
create<00:02:52.340> is<00:02:52.669> a<00:02:52.700> two<00:02:53.000> loop<00:02:53.269> bow<00:02:54.639> with<00:02:55.639> no<00:02:55.819> ends

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
create is a two loop bow with no ends

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.690 
create is a two loop bow with no ends
but<00:02:57.079> constraints<00:02:57.799> and<00:02:57.919> too<00:02:58.099> loose<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.639> that

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
but constraints and too loose and that

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.390 
but constraints and too loose and that
can<00:02:59.599> be<00:02:59.750> glued

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
can be glued

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.400 
can be glued
