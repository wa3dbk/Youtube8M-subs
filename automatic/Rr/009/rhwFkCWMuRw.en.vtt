00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
gum and white colorway which looks very

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.359 
gum and white colorway which looks very
similar<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.019> odd<00:00:25.170> future<00:00:25.500> tide<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
similar to the odd future tide of the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.580 
similar to the odd future tide of the
creator<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.730> golf<00:00:27.029> wing<00:00:27.330> bands<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.470> they

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
creator of golf wing bands that they

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.220 
creator of golf wing bands that they
released<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.160> first<00:00:29.189> time<00:00:29.730> around<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.869> I

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
released the first time around so I

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.359 
released the first time around so I
thought<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.590> would<00:00:31.710> be<00:00:31.740> an<00:00:31.920> interesting

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
thought this would be an interesting

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.700 
thought this would be an interesting
video<00:00:32.520> because<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.660> very<00:00:33.960> similar<00:00:34.320> other

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
video because it's very similar other

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.619 
video because it's very similar other
than<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:36.000> isn't<00:00:36.600> swayed<00:00:36.860> only<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.160> toe

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
than this isn't swayed only on the toe

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.799 
than this isn't swayed only on the toe
the<00:00:39.629> eyelid<00:00:40.110> area<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.100> back<00:00:41.809> another

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
the eyelid area and the back another

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.299 
the eyelid area and the back another
difference<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.440> there's<00:00:43.649> no<00:00:43.739> golf<00:00:43.980> playing

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
difference is there's no golf playing

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.310 
difference is there's no golf playing
layer<00:00:46.250> they<00:00:47.250> put<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:48.030> doughnut<00:00:48.719> sprinkles

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
layer they put like doughnut sprinkles

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.610 
layer they put like doughnut sprinkles
in<00:00:49.559> here<00:00:49.829> which<00:00:50.190> looks<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.120> q2id<00:00:52.079> future

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
in here which looks like a q2id future

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.709 
in here which looks like a q2id future
even<00:00:53.579> though<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> other<00:00:54.120> ones<00:00:54.329> they<00:00:54.570> had

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
even though in the other ones they had

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.540 
even though in the other ones they had
cats<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:56.760> tags<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.750> tongue<00:00:58.550> it

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
cats in it the tags not on the tongue it

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.420 
cats in it the tags not on the tongue it

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
the same shade as this but I went with

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.550 
the same shade as this but I went with
the<00:01:04.559> white<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.129> looks<00:01:05.460> better<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.909> me<00:01:06.560> but

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
the white it just looks better to me but

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.870 
the white it just looks better to me but
other<00:01:07.710> than<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:07.950> they<00:01:08.280> look<00:01:08.460> really<00:01:08.729> similar

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
other than that they look really similar

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.570 
other than that they look really similar
there's<00:01:09.630> not<00:01:09.810> really<00:01:10.080> anything<00:01:10.580> different

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
there's not really anything different

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.770 
there's not really anything different
other<00:01:11.700> than<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.229> aesthetically<00:01:13.369> I<00:01:14.780> got

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
other than that aesthetically I got

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.749

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
just because I really liked the odd

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.069 
just because I really liked the odd
future<00:01:28.290> bans<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.100> these<00:01:30.060> were<00:01:30.240> cheaper<00:01:30.810> and

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
future bans and these were cheaper and

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.490 
future bans and these were cheaper and
they<00:01:31.890> look<00:01:32.189> like<00:01:32.430> exactly<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.030> same<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.750> plus

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
they look like exactly the same so plus

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.590 
they look like exactly the same so plus
it's<00:01:34.680> impossible<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.310> find<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.549> gum<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.030> long

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
it's impossible to find the gum so long

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.870 
it's impossible to find the gum so long

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.899 
know bands fit different to me compared
to<00:01:44.100> like<00:01:44.250> my<00:01:44.430> Nike<00:01:44.790> shoes<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:46.369> yeah<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.399> even

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
went 12 with those janowski's you see in

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.740 
went 12 with those janowski's you see in
the<00:01:50.130> back<00:01:50.310> there<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.829> yeah<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.159> I'm<00:01:54.030> curious<00:01:54.600> to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the back there so yeah I I'm curious to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.850 
the back there so yeah I I'm curious to
hear<00:01:54.869> what<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.140> guys<00:01:55.170> think<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.710> these

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
hear what you guys think of these

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.679 
hear what you guys think of these
considering<00:01:56.670> they're<00:01:56.820> not<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.299> tire

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
considering they're not the tire

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.880 
considering they're not the tire
liquidator<00:01:58.200> ones<00:01:58.409> but<00:01:58.770> they<00:01:59.040> look<00:01:59.250> exactly

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
liquidator ones but they look exactly

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.300 
liquidator ones but they look exactly
the<00:02:00.010> same<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.540> that<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:02.409> tire<00:02:02.620> creator<00:02:03.040> ones

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
the same and that the tire creator ones

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.260 
the same and that the tire creator ones
they<00:02:03.790> retailed<00:02:04.540> I<00:02:04.659> think<00:02:04.870> for<00:02:05.020> 110<00:02:05.850> or<00:02:06.850> maybe

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
they retailed I think for 110 or maybe

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.990 
they retailed I think for 110 or maybe
it<00:02:07.450> was<00:02:07.600> like<00:02:07.750> $90<00:02:08.440> or<00:02:08.590> something<00:02:08.830> but<00:02:09.490> these

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
it was like $90 or something but these

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.050 
it was like $90 or something but these
were<00:02:10.209> 65<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.470> I<00:02:11.740> checked<00:02:12.100> on<00:02:12.250> bands<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.940> it's

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
were 65 and I checked on bands and it's

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.670 
were 65 and I checked on bands and it's
even<00:02:13.300> cheaper<00:02:13.330> than<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:13.990> it's<00:02:14.200> like<00:02:14.350> 50

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
even cheaper than that it's like 50

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.970 
even cheaper than that it's like 50
something<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:16.260> it's<00:02:17.260> interesting

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
something so it's interesting

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.860 
something so it's interesting
this<00:02:18.310> definitely<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:19.060> something<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:19.720> would

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
this definitely is something that would

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.710 
this definitely is something that would
prove<00:02:20.140> whether<00:02:20.590> or<00:02:20.740> not<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:21.640> hype<00:02:21.880> is<00:02:22.150> totally

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
prove whether or not the hype is totally
