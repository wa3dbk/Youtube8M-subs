simple<00:00:00.359> these<00:00:01.350> two<00:00:01.620> wheels<00:00:01.949> are<00:00:02.220> mounted<00:00:02.580> on

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
simple these two wheels are mounted on

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.920 
simple these two wheels are mounted on
separate<00:00:03.210> axles<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:04.020> supported<00:00:04.890> by<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.069> frame

separate axles and supported by a frame

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.100 
separate axles and supported by a frame
so<00:00:06.930> that<00:00:06.960> they<00:00:07.230> can<00:00:07.470> revolve<00:00:07.859> freely<00:00:08.610> at

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
so that they can revolve freely at

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.539 
so that they can revolve freely at
different<00:00:10.110> speeds<00:00:10.849> let's<00:00:11.849> fasten<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.420> spoke<00:00:12.780> on

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
different speeds let's fasten a spoke on

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.470 
different speeds let's fasten a spoke on
the<00:00:14.549> inner<00:00:14.759> end<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.330> each<00:00:15.900> axle<00:00:17.119> so<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.300> by

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
the inner end of each axle so that by

the inner end of each axle so that by
turning<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.990> spokes<00:00:20.060> we<00:00:21.060> can<00:00:21.330> turn<00:00:21.600> each

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
turning the spokes we can turn each

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.720 
turning the spokes we can turn each
wheel<00:00:22.260> separately<00:00:27.470> with<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> bar<00:00:28.949> or<00:00:29.250> cross

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.840 

let's<00:01:23.100> put<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.520> bar<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.179> a<00:01:24.240> pivot<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.549> that<00:01:26.549> it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
let's put this bar on a pivot so that it

same speed and because it pivots it lets

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.929 
same speed and because it pivots it lets
one<00:01:44.969> wheel<00:01:45.270> turn<00:01:46.069> even<00:01:47.069> when<00:01:47.459> the<00:01:47.579> other<00:01:47.729> is

and another gear is added to share the

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.640 
and another gear is added to share the
work<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.430> driving<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:16.970> axles<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:18.170> principle

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
work of driving the axles the principle

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.210 
work of driving the axles the principle
is<00:03:18.770> the<00:03:18.800> same<00:03:19.900> in<00:03:20.900> order<00:03:21.110> to<00:03:21.350> turn<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.740> support

notice that the power is connected to

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.940 
notice that the power is connected to
the<00:03:42.120> differential<00:03:42.570> at<00:03:42.960> the<00:03:43.560> center<00:03:43.950> line<00:03:45.950> we

the differential at the center line we

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.640 
the differential at the center line we
can<00:03:47.160> make<00:03:47.400> our<00:03:47.610> model<00:03:48.060> more<00:03:48.210> compact<00:03:48.840> by

can make our model more compact by

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.420 
can make our model more compact by
moving<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.220> gears<00:03:50.520> closer<00:03:50.940> together<00:03:52.250> when<00:03:53.250> we

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
moving the gears closer together when we

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.420 
moving the gears closer together when we
put<00:03:53.640> our<00:03:53.790> differential
