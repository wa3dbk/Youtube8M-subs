facilitate the lessons that they're

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.669 
facilitate the lessons that they're
teaching<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.630> think<00:01:52.080> there's<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.470> misconception

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
teaching I think there's a misconception

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.940 
teaching I think there's a misconception
that<00:01:53.250> art<00:01:53.580> is<00:01:53.909> just<00:01:54.299> fluff<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.959> just<00:01:55.229> art<00:01:55.530> but

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
that art is just fluff and just art but

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.620 
that art is just fluff and just art but
there<00:01:56.220> are<00:01:56.369> definite<00:01:56.789> ways<00:01:56.819> that<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.420> can

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
there are definite ways that you can

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.710 
there are definite ways that you can
weave<00:01:58.619> academics<00:01:59.280> into<00:01:59.670> art<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.060> weave<00:02:00.360> art

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
weave academics into art and weave art

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.840 
weave academics into art and weave art
into<00:02:01.229> academics<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.280> think<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.670> we're

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
into academics and I think that we're

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.300 
into academics and I think that we're
very<00:02:03.209> successful<00:02:03.450> at<00:02:03.929> doing<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.289> here<00:02:04.560> we

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
very successful at doing that here we

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.580 
very successful at doing that here we
study<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.030> orchestral<00:02:06.600> strings<00:02:06.929> the<00:02:07.140> violin

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
study the orchestral strings the violin

Wallace<00:02:19.530> James<00:02:19.859> I<00:02:20.160> think<00:02:20.609> there<00:02:20.880> are<00:02:20.970> obvious

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
Wallace James I think there are obvious

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.229 
Wallace James I think there are obvious
academic<00:02:22.680> benefits<00:02:23.250> because<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.760> students

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
academic benefits because the students

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.630 
academic benefits because the students
at<00:02:24.870> our<00:02:25.019> school<00:02:25.049> really<00:02:25.560> excel<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.340> know<00:02:26.430> and

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
at our school really excel you know and

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.370 
at our school really excel you know and
year<00:02:26.880> after<00:02:27.030> year<00:02:27.329> after<00:02:27.480> year<00:02:27.660> our<00:02:27.989> students

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
year after year after year our students

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.199 
year after year after year our students
have<00:02:28.620> him<00:02:28.829> continue<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.459> improve<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.150> our

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
have him continue to improve and our

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.759 
have him continue to improve and our
test<00:02:30.480> scores<00:02:30.750> have<00:02:30.870> gone<00:02:30.930> up<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.470> up<00:02:31.560> it's

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
test scores have gone up and up it's

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:32.960 
test scores have gone up and up it's
something<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.040> we're<00:02:32.130> very<00:02:32.160> proud<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.640> here

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
something that we're very proud of here

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.729 
something that we're very proud of here
at<00:02:33.060> our<00:02:33.180> school<00:02:34.640> so<00:02:35.640> academic<00:02:36.560> success<00:02:37.560> I

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
at our school so academic success I

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.280 
at our school so academic success I
think<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.130> is<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.549> great<00:02:39.269> result<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.959> we<00:02:40.079> get

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
think is a is a great result that we get

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.410 
think is a is a great result that we get
at<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:41.010> same<00:02:41.220> time<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.459> think<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.940> students

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
at the same time I think the students

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.960 
at the same time I think the students
when<00:02:42.630> they<00:02:42.750> get<00:02:42.870> into<00:02:43.109> an<00:02:43.230> art<00:02:43.470> form<00:02:43.640> that<00:02:44.640> they

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
when they get into an art form that they

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.509 
when they get into an art form that they
enjoy<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.350> they<00:02:46.500> connect<00:02:47.010> with<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.459> think

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
enjoy and that they connect with I think

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.590 
enjoy and that they connect with I think
that<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.940> gives<00:02:48.299> them<00:02:48.720> some<00:02:49.709> self-esteem<00:02:50.640> some

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
that it gives them some self-esteem some

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.890 
that it gives them some self-esteem some
pride<00:02:52.049> some<00:02:52.739> reason<00:02:53.280> above<00:02:53.549> and<00:02:53.700> beyond<00:02:54.030> the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
pride some reason above and beyond the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.069 
pride some reason above and beyond the
daily<00:02:55.850> academic<00:02:56.850> things<00:02:57.090> they're<00:02:57.420> also<00:02:57.690> a

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
daily academic things they're also a

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.319 
daily academic things they're also a
wonderful<00:02:58.799> singer<00:02:59.010> they're<00:02:59.370> also<00:02:59.670> talented

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
wonderful singer they're also talented

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.390 
wonderful singer they're also talented
piano<00:03:00.750> player<00:03:01.049> I<00:03:01.079> think<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.440> brings<00:03:02.030> another

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
piano player I think it brings another

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.050 
piano player I think it brings another
facet<00:03:05.400> of

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
facet of

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.570 
facet of
of<00:03:06.690> excitement<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.530> their<00:03:07.680> day<00:03:07.830> at<00:03:07.980> school<00:03:08.550> I

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
of excitement to their day at school I

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.770 
of excitement to their day at school I
think<00:03:09.510> they<00:03:09.780> benefit<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.620> most<00:03:10.920> from

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
think they benefit the most from

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.970 
think they benefit the most from
integrated<00:03:12.780> curriculum<00:03:13.260> with<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.500> Arts<00:03:13.830> and

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
integrated curriculum with the Arts and

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.520 
integrated curriculum with the Arts and
Technology<00:03:14.700> because<00:03:15.510> they<00:03:16.319> have<00:03:16.500> a

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
Technology because they have a

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.570 
Technology because they have a
well-rounded<00:03:17.510> core<00:03:18.510> education<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.680> whatever

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
well-rounded core education and whatever

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.610 
well-rounded core education and whatever
subject<00:03:21.390> that<00:03:21.510> might<00:03:21.720> be<00:03:21.990> that<00:03:22.380> they're

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
subject that might be that they're

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.650 
subject that might be that they're
studying<00:03:22.950> it's<00:03:23.819> very<00:03:25.520> varied<00:03:26.520> and<00:03:26.670> integrated

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
studying it's very varied and integrated

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.290 
studying it's very varied and integrated
with<00:03:27.870> those<00:03:28.230> things<00:03:28.650> so<00:03:29.520> that<00:03:29.819> by<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.030> time

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
with those things so that by the time

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.290 
with those things so that by the time
we're<00:03:30.480> done<00:03:30.660> studying<00:03:31.260> math<00:03:32.130> fractions<00:03:33.000> for

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
we're done studying math fractions for
