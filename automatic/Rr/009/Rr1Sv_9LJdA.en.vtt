00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.070
 but no money at all 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.530
 participated in Korea on the site to become a poet 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.200
 start 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.849
 reference to which there is a description 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.599
 try your luck 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:12.809
 we are cool dressed with you panda do not tolerate 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.839
 I can but the mayor of the flows believe that this is 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.380
 exhausted sad but nevertheless all 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.330
 Subscribers when pitch in my it 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.380
 crying therefore it was decided to solve this 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.359
 the problem 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.269
 it sounded great hour 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.720
 and raise yourself a little may 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.479
 and since i got into one mayor war 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:31.099
 Actually that I really like to play 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.510
 nasa ports and nadya having played especially 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.140
 designer that is basically a favorite role 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.390
 in the Dagis team, most often or soloha 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.080
 but here is most often the players method 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.640
 Once Tom 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.480
 m fsa ports hiv doctor such here 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.130
 heroes for an ax match and that I really 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.200
 like 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.440
 and correspondingly 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.910
 find the heroes sent by mayor a 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.120
 when you play very much calibration 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.110
 hard to get normal 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.430
 and of course a lot of traces 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.490
 unconditionally because as before the dog 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.080
 port and the game depends slightly on you 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.290
 and correspondingly 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.850
 getting what is sachini theme 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.010
 Mari your team merges because 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.590
 well we already told more than once 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.230
 as 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.460
 it is considered that we are marks shorter but profit itself 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.950
 on this play heroes of cyprus egg skirmishes there 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.040
 view that 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.430
 when you will have the most decent 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.120
 is there any world 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.300
 so by listening to various tips on 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.930
 couple idle guides 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.530
 I had to choose a hero in which 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.530
 can be run sol montmartre 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.270
 basically now 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.160
 options such as viper and speed 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.580
 j 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.020
 Ottinger 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.800
 own country one of the most 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.420
 priority there is there too this conversation 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.840
 punctured but 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.930
 clever man still more dogs clever though 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.700
 you can even pull out a ton of command 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.240
 kneaded old age will be less 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.330
 at least as it is in Ukraine fall asleep 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.049
 it was decided Mayus mayor on 4 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.539
 and the starting point was two 100 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.450
 I would be marna moment the beginning of this 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.450
 experiment 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.440
 let's see what kind of for a few 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.030
 weeks maybe even 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.360
 per month this one can be two ap free 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.880
 time will be a boy solo and 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.779
 accordingly increase leading 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:10.659
 And the first series of today's precisely 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.449
 the rise from the full we have two 100 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:15.479
 what's the problem but here you saw the first 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:17.389
 movie on the same there wins corp 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:20.099
 get a discount that is, though against 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.809
 you glory guys here Narita alive 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.359
 that is, in a market like people who 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.629
 or not yet required 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.419
 quite often the sechin rejoiced badly and in the end 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:32.540
 almost everyone is not everything but there are two people 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.239
 commander sapir is bad but this question 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.699
 as such statistics yes 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:37.639
 the rest as they can but here are two 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.309
 human team well for the sake of justice 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:41.599
 the enemy team also has a pair 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:42.869
 man who usually 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.289
 Fedur do not understand what 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:48.169
 drink and you can see for yourself 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:49.840
 let's say so interesting 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.009
 interesting goes with us for example 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:54.869
 Alissa ports only microphone from which of 

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:56.309
 apatite especially 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.519
 as you see the field stubbornly unwilling 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.239
 entry in this password bison exist 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.169
 better choice in my opinion but to us from such 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:03.419
 socks look now 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:05.079
 This is still a hero who will not go 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.639
 only feel confident need to go 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:07.479
 mid 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.209
 in place you can farm mida can 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.380
 run a congress 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.020
 mismatch mid in principle probably 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.120
 the basis of any game you are all the same if 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.490
 talk about the most important hero himself 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.839
 strong hero then 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:18.759
 but it seems to me the most so powerful player 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:20.529
 must go to mid if you want all the same 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:22.669
 win pitching day take care of yourself 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.859
 better than children 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.929
 because role percent solo hart 

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:30.249
 my favorite is very controversial 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:31.629
 may appeal 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.609
 on command because god you come he 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.540
 what will be the way do you have prepared not 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.140
 will there be a lot of clubbing there 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.569
 support role is definitely not suitable 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.869
 Kiev can upa lucky not support 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:44.799
 can arrange will not work mate 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.589
 if the snail wean off this spectrum which 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:47.649
 anything 

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:49.329
 the result is unity of option 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:50.610
 solo trivia amr 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.240
 and with the advisor mates more 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.989
 experienced and na 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.949
 my humble experience 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.299
 but now it's a big plus max 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.769
 need to take mid rf 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:00.799
 Well, you see the result 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.389
 konstantin cinema and accordingly in 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:03.769
 I will show such rollers at the end 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.049
 the plate here is 100 brains climbed to two 600 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:08.739
 but in general terms 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.269
 hip the good truth was full 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.049
 received another are given in 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.569
 small plus temporarily nonetheless 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:15.109
 proceeds 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:16.779
 normal start 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.359
 write in the capital how much do you need it 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.909
 be able to run to mind 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.449
 hopefully at least there 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:23.789
 three and a half we get to
