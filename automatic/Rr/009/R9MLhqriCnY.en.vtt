00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
madness is also in the stillness the

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.639 
madness is also in the stillness the
contrast<00:01:26.350> between<00:01:26.969> an<00:01:28.200> expression<00:01:29.200> maybe<00:01:29.469> of

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
contrast between an expression maybe of

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.679 
contrast between an expression maybe of
anger<00:01:30.100> that<00:01:30.369> suddenly<00:01:30.729> goes<00:01:30.939> like<00:01:31.299> this<00:01:31.479> and

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
anger that suddenly goes like this and

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:47.180 
anger that suddenly goes like this and
then<00:01:31.810> this<00:01:31.960> very<00:01:32.319> very<00:01:32.740> stillness

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.800 

I've<00:01:48.190> done<00:01:48.430> many<00:01:48.700> many<00:01:48.850> productions<00:01:49.360> of<00:01:49.450> lucha

I've done many many productions of lucha
and<00:01:50.020> this<00:01:50.140> is<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.410> first<00:01:50.620> time<00:01:50.860> I've<00:01:51.070> had<00:01:51.460> the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
and this is the first time I've had the

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
and this is the first time I've had the
pleasure<00:01:51.850> of<00:01:52.030> singing<00:01:52.330> with<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.450> glass

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
pleasure of singing with a glass

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.630 
pleasure of singing with a glass
harmonica<00:01:52.870> and<00:01:53.410> it's<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.980> completely

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
harmonica and it's a completely

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.490 
harmonica and it's a completely
different<00:01:54.940> experience<00:01:55.300> for<00:01:55.990> me<00:01:56.200> and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
different experience for me and

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.080 
different experience for me and
certainly<00:01:56.920> for<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.340> audience<00:01:57.640> I<00:01:57.760> think<00:01:57.790> as

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
certainly for the audience I think as

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.110 
certainly for the audience I think as
well<00:01:58.270> it's<00:01:58.840> a<00:01:58.960> very<00:01:59.170> eerie<00:01:59.470> sound<00:01:59.860> I<00:02:00.250> know<00:02:00.820> in

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
well it's a very eerie sound I know in

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.000 
well it's a very eerie sound I know in
there<00:02:01.330> at<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.750> time<00:02:01.930> they<00:02:02.170> believed<00:02:02.470> it<00:02:02.620> this

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
there at the time they believed it this

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.310 
there at the time they believed it this
sound<00:02:03.280> itself<00:02:03.730> would<00:02:03.940> make<00:02:04.120> people<00:02:04.420> lose

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
sound itself would make people lose

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:16.500 
sound itself would make people lose
their<00:02:05.530> minds<00:02:05.710> just<00:02:06.010> listening<00:02:06.430> to<00:02:06.460> it<00:02:15.510> the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
their minds just listening to it the

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.840 
their minds just listening to it the
roll<00:02:16.720> is<00:02:17.020> is<00:02:17.410> great<00:02:18.010> fun<00:02:18.250> because<00:02:18.640> there's

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
roll is is great fun because there's

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.490 
roll is is great fun because there's
nothing<00:02:19.030> like<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.750> know<00:02:19.870> losing<00:02:20.110> your<00:02:20.320> mind

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
nothing like you know losing your mind

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.550 
nothing like you know losing your mind
in<00:02:20.650> front<00:02:20.740> of<00:02:20.950> 2,000<00:02:21.490> people<00:02:21.640> it's<00:02:21.880> very

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
in front of 2,000 people it's very

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:55.240 
in front of 2,000 people it's very
liberating
