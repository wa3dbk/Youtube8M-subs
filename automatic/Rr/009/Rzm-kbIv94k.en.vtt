One of the things I do is teach my clients
how to make green smoothies.

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.360
And I can't tell you how fun it is to see
their expression when I tell them they're

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.310
going to be making a green smoothie.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.529
So what actually is a green smoothie?

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.350
A green smoothie is a fruit smoothie with
greens added in; it could be kale, it could

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.189
be spinach, it could be broccoli, where the
fruit overpowers the flavor of the greens

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.470
and you don't taste the greens, but you get
the multiple health benefits of greens in

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.470
your diet.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.030
So it's a great way to get greens in your
diet, and we need more of them, it's the most

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.730
missing food in the American diet.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.540
What are some of the health benefits of drinking
your green smoothie on a regular basis?

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.760
It tends to minimize your cravings, it works
as a natural detoxifier, it tends to give

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.399
your skin a natural glow because it improves
the circulation throughout your system.

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.640
So I definitely recommend trying a green smoothie.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.380
And I'm going to give you the recipe to one
of my favorite green smoothies that I've actually

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:22.970
created and that recipe is, I call it a Kale-Orange
green smoothie.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:32.820
It's one cup of kale, that's actually chopped
up, it's one orange, peeled, it's one cup

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.580
of coconut water, and a cup of ice.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.440
You put all those ingredients together, and
you get a tangy, delicious green smoothie.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.740
One of the things that can make the green
smoothies taste even better is working with

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.170
an emulsifying blender.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.490
And that would be a blender that actually
liquefies the fruits and vegetables.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.479
So, one of the blenders that I use is a Vitamix.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.320
It's not to say that you can't make a green
smoothie with a regular blender, it's just

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.939
that it's gonna be a little bit smoother and
more liquefied.

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:14.790
So go ahead and try my green smoothie recipe.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.549
I'd love to hear what you think of it.
