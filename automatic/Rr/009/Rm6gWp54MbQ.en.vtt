00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.460
 disassemble a headlight of a nissan platina 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:14.519
 in a renault clio what you have to do 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.130
 is to remove the two screws that join the 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.900
 defense with the fender that is this 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.510
 strong system down 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.960
 and one on the side that is this 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.329
 another we retire 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:34.050
 then you just have to pull the 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:38.270
 fenders down to challenge him 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.270
 even side parts 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.329
 we 're going too 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.530
 the next step is to dismantle the two 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.450
 screws 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.310

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.310
 they are on the inside 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.380
 We can see 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.380
 this one that is there 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:10.310

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.620
 what to disassemble with the help of 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.690
 a rattle 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.790
 and two extensions haciendas of 10 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.430
 millimeters the next step is 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.860
 dismantle the grill that is attached by 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.410
 four staples two on top 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.990
 that unite the grill under the 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.320
 radiator 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.170
 and a part that links the grill to the 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.720
 front fascia this way 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:40.229
 finally you will have thanks this 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.720
 additionally screw are all staples 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.100
 already removed the four staples what 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.470
 you have to do is win the grill in 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.110
 front but be careful because in the 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.439
 bottom part brings four guides that the 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.550
 join the facial I'm not just going to the 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:59.810
 we remove is a matter of pulling it 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.810
 and this would be the staples 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.310
 that joins this part of the grill 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.909
 there are four in total 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.780
 Y 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.000
 the phase of the part of the rim towards 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.400
 you be careful because you also have 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.120
 three days 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.870
 in the hip 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.150
 ok here to the remove these are the 23 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.220
 suppression that there are the guidelines of the 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.400
 join the fascia and eye you have to have 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.709
 Be careful when you pull the fascia out 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.790
 with this clothes because you never have to 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.280
 stay in the next step is 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.650
 remove 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.830
 this screw and another one that has in this 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.810
 part of the lower hopper with the help 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.900
 of a rattle and the die of 10 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.090
 millimeters the next step is to cut 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.090
 is involved plastic that is 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:01.590
 riveted in the metal are smaller than 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.840
 impact this is one and this is the other and 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.970
 cutting them with the help of a cutter is not 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.670
 a cut to pull the defense 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.060
 forward already cut only 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.060
 we pull 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:17.599
 well totally free 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.689
 if they want to remove the others and the 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.920
 defense will be free the next step 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:34.140
 and so without working or explaining this 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.459
 screw top and two 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.459
 screws on the bottom 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.130
 and here in this part is the other equal 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.340
 with the rattle and the die of 10 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.340
 millimeters 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.850
 forward to be able to be by the 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.320
 connectors 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.250
 in this case there are funds 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:00.270
 originals only have to be removed 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.270
 the little ones 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.030
 we removed all the connectors already 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.620
 we can remove the place without any 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.420
 problem 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.510
 and that would be all I hope it was 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.099
 served if they liked the blanket up 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.700
 soon upload a new video 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.700
