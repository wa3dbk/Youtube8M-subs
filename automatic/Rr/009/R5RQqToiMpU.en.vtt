00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.359 
tricks for drifting and how to get more
points<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.550> they<00:01:24.540> better<00:01:25.229> angled<00:01:25.800> so<00:01:26.010> you<00:01:26.070> can

get more points and booster squash on
the<00:01:29.070> online<00:01:29.220> lobbies<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.850> hopefully

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
the online lobbies and hopefully

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.120 
the online lobbies and hopefully
progressed<00:01:31.560> your<00:01:31.910> ability<00:01:32.910> to<00:01:32.940> drift<00:01:33.420> more<00:01:34.130> so

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
progressed your ability to drift more so

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.040 
progressed your ability to drift more so
on<00:01:35.550> the<00:01:35.610> first<00:01:36.330> thing<00:01:36.450> I'm<00:01:36.600> gonna<00:01:36.690> go<00:01:36.780> show<00:01:36.960> you

on the first thing I'm gonna go show you
what<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.940> when<00:01:38.940> you<00:01:39.030> come<00:01:39.150> around<00:01:39.300> to<00:01:39.479> last

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
what to do when you come around to last

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.330 
what to do when you come around to last
corner

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
corner

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.139 
corner
he's<00:01:41.479> what<00:01:42.479> you'd<00:01:42.660> need<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.080> with<00:01:44.149> shadow

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
he's what you'd need to do with shadow

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.800 
he's what you'd need to do with shadow
drifting<00:01:46.100> if<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.190> don't<00:01:47.369> know<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.850> means

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
drifting if you don't know that is means

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.180 
drifting if you don't know that is means
you're<00:01:48.990> basically<00:01:49.259> pre<00:01:49.530> entering<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
you're basically pre entering in the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.570 
you're basically pre entering in the
corner<00:01:50.640> with<00:01:51.270> angle<00:01:51.979> already<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.430> I

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
corner with angle already so like I

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.660 
corner with angle already so like I
start<00:01:53.880> here<00:01:54.710> I've<00:01:55.710> already<00:01:55.890> got<00:01:56.130> angle<00:01:56.430> coming

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
start here I've already got angle coming

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
start here I've already got angle coming
into<00:01:56.789> the<00:01:56.910> corner<00:01:57.410> it's<00:01:58.410> basically<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.070> am<00:01:59.690> got

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
into the corner it's basically I am got

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.660 
into the corner it's basically I am got
the<00:02:00.810> car<00:02:00.990> ready<00:02:01.200> for<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.440> angle<00:02:01.800> means<00:02:02.430> I'm

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
the car ready for the angle means I'm

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.090 
the car ready for the angle means I'm
going<00:02:02.789> to<00:02:02.850> get<00:02:03.000> as<00:02:03.240> much<00:02:03.420> points<00:02:03.810> as<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.050> can<00:02:04.289> to

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
going to get as much points as I can to

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.750 
going to get as much points as I can to
come<00:02:05.250> around<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.490> corner

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
come around the corner

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.070 
come around the corner
and<00:02:07.860> second<00:02:08.860> thing<00:02:09.010> is<00:02:09.310> when<00:02:09.940> you<00:02:10.120> coming<00:02:10.960> out

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
and second thing is when you coming out

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.200 
and second thing is when you coming out
of<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.230> corner<00:02:11.650> won't<00:02:12.430> go<00:02:12.580> around<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.850> corner

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
of the corner won't go around the corner

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.330 
of the corner won't go around the corner
and<00:02:13.990> you<00:02:14.110> ain't<00:02:14.230> got<00:02:14.350> much<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:14.620> an<00:02:14.710> angle<00:02:14.830> just

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
and you ain't got much of an angle just

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.100 
and you ain't got much of an angle just
toughen<00:02:16.060> your<00:02:16.180> brakes<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.690> flicking<00:02:16.960> your

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
toughen your brakes and flicking your

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.240 
toughen your brakes and flicking your
back<00:02:17.260> end<00:02:17.470> out<00:02:17.560> like<00:02:17.740> so

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
back end out like so

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.430 
back end out like so
I'll<00:02:18.880> show<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:19.150> I'll<00:02:19.480> show<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:19.780> again<00:02:20.080> just

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
I'll show you I'll show you again just

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.850 
I'll show you I'll show you again just
on<00:02:20.620> this<00:02:20.920> apex<00:02:21.250> that's<00:02:21.490> coming<00:02:21.730> up<00:02:21.820> now<00:02:22.860> you

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
on this apex that's coming up now you

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.090 
on this apex that's coming up now you
say<00:02:24.010> like<00:02:24.190> I'm<00:02:24.490> ready<00:02:24.790> pre<00:02:25.000> drifted<00:02:26.010> did<00:02:27.010> you

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
say like I'm ready pre drifted did you

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.760 
say like I'm ready pre drifted did you
see<00:02:27.250> I'm<00:02:27.370> not<00:02:27.550> going<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.760> angle<00:02:28.620> type<00:02:29.620> the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
see I'm not going to angle type the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.090 
see I'm not going to angle type the
brakes<00:02:30.990> as<00:02:31.990> you<00:02:32.260> can<00:02:32.410> see<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.650> bucking<00:02:32.950> will

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
brakes as you can see the bucking will

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.000 
brakes as you can see the bucking will
switch<00:02:33.280> around<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:34.840> depends<00:02:35.290> on<00:02:35.350> how<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:35.680> have

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
switch around it depends on how you have

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.320 
switch around it depends on how you have
your<00:02:36.040> brake<00:02:36.370> pressure<00:02:36.550> laid<00:02:36.820> out<00:02:37.030> as<00:02:37.150> well

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
your brake pressure laid out as well

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.840 
your brake pressure laid out as well
like<00:02:38.110> I<00:02:38.320> often<00:02:38.590> wine<00:02:38.860> more<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.430> front<00:02:39.670> so

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
like I often wine more to the front so

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.350 
like I often wine more to the front so
we'll<00:02:40.120> step<00:02:40.360> my<00:02:40.540> back<00:02:40.690> end<00:02:40.900> out<00:02:41.020> quite<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.320> lot

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
we'll step my back end out quite a lot

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.550 
we'll step my back end out quite a lot
as<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.540> goes<00:02:43.690> there

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
as it goes there

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.740 
as it goes there
I'll<00:02:45.980> do<00:02:46.160> it<00:02:46.190> again<00:02:46.730> just<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.209> show<00:02:47.360> you<00:02:47.390> so<00:02:47.720> you

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
I'll do it again just to show you so you

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.330 
I'll do it again just to show you so you
can<00:02:47.990> just<00:02:48.170> see<00:02:48.319> it<00:02:49.990> go<00:02:50.990> around

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
can just see it go around

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
can just see it go around
tap<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.490> brakes<00:02:52.730> backing<00:02:53.510> kicks<00:02:53.720> out

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
tap the brakes backing kicks out

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.850 
tap the brakes backing kicks out
as<00:02:56.360> you<00:02:56.540> see<00:02:56.720> it<00:02:57.020> will<00:02:57.080> just<00:02:57.260> keep<00:02:57.440> swinging<00:02:57.770> it

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
as you see it will just keep swinging it

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.430 
as you see it will just keep swinging it
round<00:02:59.020> and<00:03:00.020> third<00:03:00.980> thing<00:03:01.490> is<00:03:02.020> the<00:03:03.020> handbrake

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
round and third thing is the handbrake

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.680 
round and third thing is the handbrake
smell<00:03:04.100> like<00:03:04.190> you<00:03:04.340> gonna<00:03:04.550> need<00:03:04.640> to<00:03:04.760> corner<00:03:05.120> you

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
smell like you gonna need to corner you

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.260 
smell like you gonna need to corner you
can<00:03:05.810> hold<00:03:06.110> your<00:03:06.230> hand<00:03:06.410> brakes<00:03:06.590> on<00:03:06.770> time<00:03:07.210> so<00:03:08.210> you

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
can hold your hand brakes on time so you

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.810 
can hold your hand brakes on time so you
get<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:08.720> right<00:03:08.900> speed<00:03:09.890> around<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.430> corner

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
get the right speed around the corner

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.670 
get the right speed around the corner
and<00:03:10.940> then<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.210> can<00:03:11.390> really<00:03:11.630> accelerate<00:03:11.930> by

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
and then you can really accelerate by

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.070 
and then you can really accelerate by
this<00:03:12.860> one

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
this one

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.810 
this one
Honda<00:03:15.080> brakes<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:16.010> I<00:03:16.040> can<00:03:16.280> sling<00:03:16.550> you<00:03:16.640> on<00:03:16.730> the

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
Honda brakes so I can sling you on the

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.980 
Honda brakes so I can sling you on the
