want to place an order before you do

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.020 
want to place an order before you do
place<00:01:59.299> an<00:01:59.450> order<00:01:59.570> this<00:02:00.320> is<00:02:00.500> a<00:02:00.530> loose<00:02:01.340> wave<00:02:01.640> and

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
place an order this is a loose wave and

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.960 
place an order this is a loose wave and
this<00:02:02.600> is<00:02:02.750> just<00:02:02.900> a<00:02:02.990> 20<00:02:03.290> inch<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:04.190> this<00:02:04.670> is<00:02:04.790> what

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
this is just a 20 inch and this is what

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.919 
this is just a 20 inch and this is what
it<00:02:05.030> looks<00:02:05.210> like

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.140 

so<00:02:09.890> I'm<00:02:09.979> not<00:02:10.159> really<00:02:10.369> going<00:02:10.579> to<00:02:10.670> review<00:02:10.969> it

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
so I'm not really going to review it

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.880 
so I'm not really going to review it
because<00:02:11.329> I<00:02:11.359> can't<00:02:11.599> view<00:02:11.870> my<00:02:12.230> own<00:02:12.379> hair<00:02:12.620> because

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
because I can't view my own hair because

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.800 
because I can't view my own hair because
obviously<00:02:13.069> I<00:02:13.340> would<00:02:13.489> be<00:02:13.609> biased<00:02:14.060> cuz<00:02:14.510> it's<00:02:14.659> my

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
obviously I would be biased cuz it's my

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.990 
obviously I would be biased cuz it's my
head<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:16.189> this<00:02:16.459> is<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.760> wavy<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:19.000> this

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
head and this this is the wavy and this

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.789 
head and this this is the wavy and this
is<00:02:20.120> what<00:02:20.269> that<00:02:20.450> looks<00:02:20.659> like<00:02:20.780> it's<00:02:21.469> just<00:02:21.500> got<00:02:21.769> a

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
is what that looks like it's just got a

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.319 
is what that looks like it's just got a
really<00:02:22.010> nice<00:02:22.189> wave<00:02:22.489> to<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:22.819> and<00:02:22.939> this<00:02:23.030> is<00:02:23.180> also

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
really nice wave to it and this is also

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:28.229 
really nice wave to it and this is also
brazilian<00:02:23.840> hair<00:02:24.019> and<00:02:24.349> this<00:02:24.950> is<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.219> 16<00:02:25.639> inch

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.759 

so<00:02:29.239> it<00:02:29.510> would<00:02:29.659> stop<00:02:29.959> about<00:02:30.859> he<00:02:31.129> and<00:02:32.590> then<00:02:33.590> this

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
so it would stop about he and then this

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.500 
so it would stop about he and then this
is<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:33.950> straight<00:02:34.370> texture<00:02:34.969> and<00:02:35.120> this<00:02:35.269> is<00:02:35.420> just

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
is the straight texture and this is just

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.259 
is the straight texture and this is just
the<00:02:35.629> 14<00:02:36.019> inch<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:37.280> is<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.400> bit<00:02:37.639> like<00:02:37.819> all

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
the 14 inch and it is a bit like all

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.949

over<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.599> place<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:41.450> this<00:02:41.599> is<00:02:41.720> what<00:02:41.840> the

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
over the place and this is what the

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.520 
over the place and this is what the
straight<00:02:42.200> looks<00:02:42.439> like<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.959> I<00:02:45.019> just<00:02:45.169> wanted<00:02:45.319> to
