00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
demonstrator with character these

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.510 
demonstrator with character these

far it's got some swirl but you can see
the<00:05:05.130> nib<00:05:05.370> through<00:05:05.700> it<00:05:05.850> you<00:05:06.300> can<00:05:06.510> see<00:05:06.780> the

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
mechanism through it and of course when

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.460 
mechanism through it and of course when
the<00:05:08.970> pen<00:05:09.270> is<00:05:09.389> filled<00:05:09.690> you<00:05:09.900> can<00:05:10.020> see<00:05:10.139> the<00:05:10.260> ink

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
the pen is filled you can see the ink

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.500 
the pen is filled you can see the ink
through<00:05:10.800> it<00:05:10.919> so<00:05:11.430> these<00:05:11.760> have<00:05:12.030> been<00:05:12.180> doing

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
through it so these have been doing

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.960 
through it so these have been doing
really<00:05:12.750> well<00:05:13.130> and<00:05:14.130> again<00:05:14.280> you<00:05:14.610> know<00:05:14.700> there's<00:05:14.880> a

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
really well and again you know there's a

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.150 
really well and again you know there's a
red<00:05:15.479> version<00:05:15.810> a<00:05:16.290> green<00:05:16.830> version<00:05:17.160> amber<00:05:17.910> blue

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
red version a green version amber blue

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.210 
red version a green version amber blue
orange<00:05:20.160> dark<00:05:20.820> blue<00:05:21.120> so<00:05:21.660> those<00:05:21.900> have<00:05:21.930> been<00:05:22.229> very

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220

orange dark blue so those have been very
nice<00:05:23.490> I<00:05:23.700> thought<00:05:23.850> I'd<00:05:23.970> highlight<00:05:24.300> those<00:05:24.600> the

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
nice I thought I'd highlight those the

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:31.969 
nice I thought I'd highlight those the
rest<00:05:25.169> of<00:05:25.320> these<00:05:25.440> are<00:05:25.740> Menlo's<00:05:26.520> of<00:05:26.729> course<00:05:30.979> some

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
rest of these are Menlo's of course some

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.740 
rest of these are Menlo's of course some

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
with ink windows and some without and

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.110 
with ink windows and some without and
then<00:05:34.440> these<00:05:34.620> are<00:05:34.680> Beaumont<00:05:35.430> pneumatic

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
then these are Beaumont pneumatic

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.159 
then these are Beaumont pneumatic
fillers<00:05:36.539> I<00:05:38.360> think<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:39.450> majority<00:05:39.600> of<00:05:39.930> what<00:05:40.050> you

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
fillers I think the majority of what you

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.730 
fillers I think the majority of what you
see<00:05:40.380> here<00:05:40.650> are<00:05:40.710> acrylic<00:05:41.340> and<00:05:41.720> then<00:05:42.720> the<00:05:43.500> rest

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
see here are acrylic and then the rest

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.330 
see here are acrylic and then the rest
