00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.070
 water such a technique is called 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.619
 ebru 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.539
 this is a real dance of all kinds of colors 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.029
 colors and shades intertwined between 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.250
 yourself and create amazing patterns 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.619
 feature of technology is that in contrast 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.079
 from traditional painting never exactly 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.689
 I do n’t know what I’m going to create 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:35.360
 two identical pictures are simply impossible 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.360
 children like to draw on water 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.370
 let's start here are the materials that 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.010
 need to draw plastic 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.230
 tray or tub of paint it 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.960
 special paints for and bruno im quite 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.570
 You can find a replacement suitable oil 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.510
 Acrylic or stained glass is important to 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:59.230
 they were liquid from the tool on us 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.230
 that brush comb is still useful 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.000
 fan she can be from horse 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.820
 hair or 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.820
 or bristles also we need a sila for 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.710
 drawing details 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.080
 pour special water into the tray 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.210
 seal it can also be done at home 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.860
 self cook based on 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.110
 starch liquid paste 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.090
 or even easier to add water 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:32.300
 water-based acrylic lacquer 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.369
 or office glue now we take 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.229
 tassel 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:39.130
 typing paint and splashing on 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.130
 water surface 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.329
 liquid paints remain on the surface 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.130
 the water will be such round drops 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.219
 and the colors with each other are not 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.649
 mixed baby easy to deal with 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.350
 this task to the same technique Ebru 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.000
 develops imagination and fine motor skills 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.679
 and also relieves stress and calms 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.479
 earlier we will take sewing and will 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.970
 draw our magic pattern 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.629
 these are the bands like this 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.629
 side to the other 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.580
 interesting patterns are obtained with 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.550
 comb with a few teeth we already 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.770
 there is a bright background add him nuances with 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.860
 using a pipette, we drip a few drops 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.870
 contrast color 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:35.440
 the middle of our big yellow droplet 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.440
 we will dig 5 droplets of blue dye 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.170
 we take stitching and will draw 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.340
 the details 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.640
 we carry out an awl from edge to center 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.330
 are obtained here are from the middle of the petals 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.370
 to the center turn out leaves 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.240
 Well, now the most interesting thing is 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.190
 magic 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.910
 we take paper and we will print 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.620
 our wonderful image 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.080
 we put the paper right on the surface of the water 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.030
 paint several times on it 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.030
 thin awl and take out
