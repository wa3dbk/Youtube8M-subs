what<00:00:00.780> do<00:00:00.870> you<00:00:00.960> get<00:00:01.110> when<00:00:01.290> you<00:00:01.410> take<00:00:01.560> poly

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
what do you get when you take poly

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.190 
what do you get when you take poly
tubing<00:00:02.220> and<00:00:02.429> some<00:00:02.550> keychains<00:00:03.120> it's<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:03.990> way<00:00:04.140> to

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
tubing and some keychains it's a way to

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.349 
tubing and some keychains it's a way to
put<00:00:04.500> your<00:00:04.650> PVC<00:00:04.980> projects<00:00:05.580> together<00:00:05.730> without

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
put your PVC projects together without

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:07.789 
put your PVC projects together without
having<00:00:06.629> them<00:00:06.750> fall<00:00:06.960> apart<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.470> without

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
having them fall apart and without

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.980 
having them fall apart and without
having<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.189> use<00:00:08.340> glue<00:00:08.580> this<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.480> more<00:00:09.570> stay

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
having to use glue this and more stay

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:25.910 
having to use glue this and more stay
tuned<00:00:10.230> on<00:00:10.500> mechanical<00:00:11.010> master

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.529 

so<00:00:26.920> why<00:00:27.130> would<00:00:27.340> you<00:00:27.369> want<00:00:27.460> to<00:00:27.730> build<00:00:27.910> something

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
so why would you want to build something

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.630 
so why would you want to build something
that<00:00:28.779> would<00:00:29.109> pin<00:00:29.590> things<00:00:29.890> together<00:00:30.189> well

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
that would pin things together well

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.310 
that would pin things together well
first<00:00:30.970> of<00:00:31.119> all<00:00:31.210> is<00:00:31.390> if<00:00:31.689> you<00:00:31.779> build<00:00:31.960> something

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
first of all is if you build something

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.950 
first of all is if you build something
like<00:00:32.349> this<00:00:32.800> this<00:00:33.220> camera<00:00:33.640> dolly<00:00:33.850> part<00:00:34.840> of<00:00:34.899> the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
like this this camera dolly part of the

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.180 
like this this camera dolly part of the
problem<00:00:35.230> is<00:00:35.320> that<00:00:35.440> it<00:00:35.530> doesn't<00:00:35.680> fit<00:00:35.949> into<00:00:36.100> a

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
problem is that it doesn't fit into a

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.819 
problem is that it doesn't fit into a
duffel<00:00:36.550> bag<00:00:36.579> all<00:00:36.879> that<00:00:37.059> well<00:00:37.270> and<00:00:37.570> that<00:00:38.470> can<00:00:38.710> be

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
duffel bag all that well and that can be

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.200 
duffel bag all that well and that can be
a<00:00:38.860> bit<00:00:39.040> of<00:00:39.070> a<00:00:39.220> problem<00:00:39.460> especially<00:00:39.760> if<00:00:40.120> you

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
a bit of a problem especially if you

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.329 
a bit of a problem especially if you
want<00:00:40.420> to<00:00:40.480> be<00:00:40.600> mobile<00:00:40.780> so<00:00:41.320> you<00:00:41.860> want<00:00:42.010> to<00:00:42.100> make<00:00:42.190> it

want to be mobile so you want to make it

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:43.860 
want to be mobile so you want to make it
so<00:00:42.460> you<00:00:42.519> can<00:00:42.670> take<00:00:42.820> it<00:00:42.940> apart<00:00:43.030> no<00:00:43.570> I<00:00:43.600> did<00:00:43.839> that

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
so you can take it apart no I did that

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.170 
so you can take it apart no I did that
with<00:00:44.110> this<00:00:44.290> guy<00:00:44.489> problem<00:00:45.489> is<00:00:45.640> is<00:00:45.850> that<00:00:45.879> now

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
with this guy problem is is that now

with this guy problem is is that now
that<00:00:46.390> I<00:00:46.420> use<00:00:46.750> it<00:00:46.989> and<00:00:47.140> occasionally<00:00:47.589> I'll<00:00:47.739> like

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
that I use it and occasionally I'll like

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.560 
that I use it and occasionally I'll like
not<00:00:48.309> put<00:00:48.489> it<00:00:48.550> together<00:00:48.670> properly<00:00:49.300> I'll<00:00:49.420> have

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
put something that will pin this

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.150 
put something that will pin this
together<00:00:55.840> and<00:00:56.109> that's<00:00:56.289> what<00:00:56.530> this<00:00:56.680> project<00:00:56.920> is

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
together and that's what this project is

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.340 
together and that's what this project is
all<00:00:57.250> about<00:00:57.309> keep<00:00:58.270> in<00:00:58.420> mind<00:00:58.660> that<00:00:58.840> you<00:00:58.960> can<00:00:59.170> use

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
this in the camera stabilizer project

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.109 
this in the camera stabilizer project
had<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:02.710> shoulder<00:01:03.070> mount<00:01:03.280> project<00:01:03.820> that<00:01:04.030> we

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
had the shoulder mount project that we

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.410 
had the shoulder mount project that we
have<00:01:04.740> you<00:01:05.740> have<00:01:05.890> a<00:01:05.920> multitude<00:01:06.430> of<00:01:06.700> other<00:01:06.850> PVC

projects and a few more coming up for

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.300 
projects and a few more coming up for

light stands and whatnot with me and you

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.910 
light stands and whatnot with me and you
know<00:01:12.720> basically<00:01:13.720> what<00:01:13.929> it<00:01:14.050> comes<00:01:14.080> down<00:01:14.320> to<00:01:14.710> is

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
know basically what it comes down to is

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.980 
know basically what it comes down to is
that<00:01:14.950> this<00:01:15.550> little<00:01:15.940> pin<00:01:16.179> is<00:01:16.390> an<00:01:16.509> incredible

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
that this little pin is an incredible

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.290 
that this little pin is an incredible
little<00:01:17.289> prototyping<00:01:18.009> tool<00:01:18.369> that<00:01:18.670> I<00:01:18.700> use<00:01:19.000> all

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
little prototyping tool that I use all

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.540 
little prototyping tool that I use all
the<00:01:19.630> time<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:20.200> I<00:01:20.470> honestly<00:01:20.800> don't<00:01:21.190> think<00:01:21.460> I

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
the time and I honestly don't think I

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.440 
the time and I honestly don't think I
could<00:01:21.700> live<00:01:21.820> without<00:01:21.940> it

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
could live without it

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.380 
could live without it
so<00:01:22.990> without<00:01:23.289> further<00:01:23.470> ado<00:01:24.000> check<00:01:25.000> out<00:01:25.149> how<00:01:25.330> the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
so without further ado check out how the

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:48.080 
so without further ado check out how the
build<00:01:25.690> goes

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.100

thing you got to do is take one of your

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.460 
thing you got to do is take one of your
key<00:02:59.590> chains<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.660> hook<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.780> in<00:03:01.870> here<00:03:02.110> now<00:03:02.260> all

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
of this key chain is doing he's just

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.810 
of this key chain is doing he's just
giving<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.590> little<00:03:05.800> tab<00:03:06.130> so<00:03:06.430> that<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:06.670> can

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
giving you a little tab so that you can

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.820 
giving you a little tab so that you can
pull<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:07.150> out<00:03:07.269> this<00:03:07.840> makes<00:03:08.110> your<00:03:08.260> projects

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
disassemble if that isn't work next

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.070 
disassemble if that isn't work next
thing<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:12.519> like<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.730> do<00:03:13.000> is<00:03:13.239> is<00:03:13.450> that<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.750> tip<00:03:13.959> of

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
thing I like to do is is that the tip of

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.870 
thing I like to do is is that the tip of
this<00:03:14.260> can<00:03:14.560> sometimes<00:03:14.800> get<00:03:15.100> stuck<00:03:15.400> in<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.640> hole

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
this can sometimes get stuck in the hole

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.610 
this can sometimes get stuck in the hole
so<00:03:16.120> I<00:03:16.150> just<00:03:16.570> kind<00:03:16.810> of<00:03:16.900> run<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:17.380> through<00:03:17.560> a

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
so I just kind of run it through a

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.320 
so I just kind of run it through a
pencil<00:03:18.160> sharpener<00:03:18.190> really<00:03:18.730> quick<00:03:18.970> just<00:03:19.000> to

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
pencil sharpener really quick just to

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.210 
pencil sharpener really quick just to
get<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.510> little<00:03:19.900> tiny<00:03:20.080> taper<00:03:20.410> in<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:20.800> so<00:03:21.100> we've

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
get a little tiny taper in it so we've

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.699 
get a little tiny taper in it so we've
got<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.400> little<00:03:21.580> taper<00:03:21.880> in<00:03:22.120> it<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:23.140> last<00:03:23.380> step

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
got a little taper in it the last step

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.740 
got a little taper in it the last step
and<00:03:23.860> what<00:03:24.670> we're<00:03:24.820> doing<00:03:25.060> here<00:03:25.269> is<00:03:25.360> just<00:03:25.390> making

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
and what we're doing here is just making

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.030 
and what we're doing here is just making
it<00:03:25.989> into<00:03:26.380> a<00:03:26.410> little<00:03:26.800> tiny<00:03:27.130> spring<00:03:27.610> pin<00:03:28.080> is<00:03:29.080> that

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
it into a little tiny spring pin is that

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.680 
it into a little tiny spring pin is that
we're<00:03:30.130> gonna<00:03:30.190> take<00:03:30.489> a<00:03:30.550> slice<00:03:30.940> right<00:03:31.269> down<00:03:31.330> the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
we're gonna take a slice right down the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.800 
we're gonna take a slice right down the
center<00:03:31.870> all<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.920> way<00:03:33.040> along<00:03:33.280> its<00:03:33.519> length<00:03:33.810> just

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
center all the way along its length just

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.050 
center all the way along its length just
like<00:03:34.959> that<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:35.500> so<00:03:35.800> what<00:03:36.370> we<00:03:36.489> can<00:03:36.610> do<00:03:36.760> here<00:03:37.000> now

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
like that and so what we can do here now

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.790 
like that and so what we can do here now
is<00:03:37.209> we<00:03:37.510> can<00:03:37.540> pinch<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.050> tube<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.410> squeeze<00:03:38.650> it

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
is we can pinch the tube and squeeze it

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.800 
is we can pinch the tube and squeeze it
together<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.430> it<00:03:39.820> makes<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.180> nice<00:03:40.360> tight

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
together and it makes a nice tight

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.990 
together and it makes a nice tight
little<00:03:41.110> spring<00:03:41.500> pimp<00:03:42.600> last<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:43.959> final<00:03:44.530> step

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
little spring pimp last and final step

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.500 
little spring pimp last and final step
really<00:03:46.000> simple

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
really simple

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.690 
really simple
get<00:03:46.959> a<00:03:46.989> drill<00:03:47.260> bit<00:03:47.410> that<00:03:47.470> is<00:03:47.799> slightly<00:03:48.370> smaller

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
get a drill bit that is slightly smaller

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.070 
get a drill bit that is slightly smaller
in<00:03:48.820> diameter<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.540> then<00:03:49.690> quarter<00:03:50.080> inch<00:03:50.230> tubing

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
in diameter and then quarter inch tubing

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.990 
in diameter and then quarter inch tubing
and<00:03:53.080> you<00:03:53.350> throw<00:03:53.709> it<00:03:53.799> into<00:03:53.920> your<00:03:54.070> drill

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
and you throw it into your drill

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.119 
and you throw it into your drill
just<00:03:57.000> like<00:03:57.180> this<00:03:57.390> now<00:03:58.200> any<00:03:58.500> connections<00:03:59.010> that
