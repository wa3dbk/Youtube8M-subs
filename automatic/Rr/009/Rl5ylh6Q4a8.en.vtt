00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:05.020
 and now you never see too late says high eyes with all kinds of knee and loft 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.240
 video cards 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.480
 after this two new models received no major tx5 cestus in June 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.459
 beijing 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.169
 The HP share picked were selected 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.740
 at the hawks he threw nonsense as far as she was concerned ekstra dipped yes it is 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:21.679
 actually a store within the duo cards hang on the market it is 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:22.919
 actually a no brainer 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.060
 relatively cheaper as an affiliate 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.119
 how nice it is better cooling and usually dylan has it 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.890
 good results but in practice it does not seem to work everything out 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.610
 I think back with nostalgia on one of the first cards that GT4 has 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.050
 championship loft yes that was 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.570
 the most popular video card on her phone for a year 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.520
 and rightly sieneke who are not very much more expensive than normal kitty bike sps 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.650
 much better to overclock and quieter and cooler 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.540
 yes they are so easy 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:58.160
 at 60 execution yes and that falls the actually dated 5 6 3 that you state is yes me 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.780
 would almost say that that pretty name hokker is almost not true 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.090
 why is the morning after many of their colleges 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.090
 yes a lot of extra features that the roccat we have put we hope so 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.170
 it is the beast baby the once again fully engaged in more improved vases 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.729
 and overclocker not so extreme 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.020
 When we sell the lightning cards I stand by phases 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.030
 here you have a multi of these connections back to all 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.360
 can read voltages feet so I have formats q3 voltages now chebet 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.270
 unite and have inside that there is certainly a meter free 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.220
 special 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.090
 and that on the weekend and we see special twin voser three cooler on the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.330
 cooler and preferably with 4 barrios 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.280
 new what will propeller turned fans m 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.490
 The fans used for its mission itself can save up to 20 percent more 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.060
 to move air 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.969
 so in that respect once all the appearance of a loft digid x 5 6 3 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.159
 he has overclocked all addresses if you view a standard fictional 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.320
 against this, four pawns hit 822 megahertz on this card 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.370
 it is all directly at 950 digits 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.229
 130 along says standard led by the honored that I am full of sun 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.359
 major over proxy not very often 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:15.379
 but there comes a price and then they have euros again but then have it 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.989
 tell about sound about that nature yes then it is just a little tired less 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.919
 Said from their own horses they made tomorrow stops should be actually again 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.650
 a year or a good time added 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.219
 buy it because it is not to listen to 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.519
 I am above this pen is a button that switches between the 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.430
 performance and the sail in three months but you could almost say between the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.169
 settle a lot of noise that and even more its residents of salsa incident mode 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:39.799
 striker that will soon be silent, almost silent 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.909
 and i make a blow hari but a bottle title will happen to be very good 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.579
 distributing is also disappointing because in those in those default settings and then must 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.209
 The council did say that 109 was lost immediately from the X5 song session 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.389
 against normal and 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.329
 before and also see the voltage also have to live but then 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.519
 Horse stables settings are directly at about 65 degrees Celsius 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:03.069
 If it is overclocking we have obviously done so we are very proud 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.669
 1,000 employees attended the session 1015 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:07.709
 and 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.699
 then eating kaká thinks how often the 100 degrees celsius is 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.109
 Just like the entire crew too much that is commonly known is one of a one chip 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.279
 or the long circuit in the stands to make it a bit of a lifetime 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:19.869
 to hold 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:22.659
 I don't like people below 40 degrees 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.129
 he is a bit nice it also makes sense with that card has died well what 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.279
 If you want to get into your closet I can also play a bit of fatigue so you actually have 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:31.489
 it's not such a very interesting choice 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.010
 And then I have enough of those other orcas that are on the same time almost simultaneously 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.680
 market 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.430
 3 opposite what this would you like a few days year also applies here 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.800
 again that via a few tens are more expensive in standard than the standard five 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.340
 year baptism about a decade so the 68 70 also a radeon hd 68 17 so 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.149
 if you have the perfect look with this and and you will see the cheapest hassle 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:57.879
 there is a choice between the clubs as a bit crazy because then I see that I am three 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.949
 male who will be the standard 27 our 2 they have an overclock version of that 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:07.249
 and then up there this Oct and I hope so sell then that over block version anyway 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:10.799
 among the wireless millionaire when looking at the complicated all but good 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.549
 his trip well priced and heineken and gives good performance yes he would 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:15.940
 think two foxes 3 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.360
 the same group as it is good all these twenty laps 3 the cooler that is the same 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.200
 name is a lot bigger than those few tracks and the party is justified 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.600
 sea ​​pain fifth place four a worker sees that we are nice 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.550
 makes a difference this week mother 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.520
 there is a standard city looking for 45 degrees 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.550
 if it is possible to overclock, yes, then you will always realize 65 degrees 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.620
 come out pretty much much more than suicide very differently than others 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.850
 Roosendaal card 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.800
 and this one is really just great overclocking part harry bakker 76 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.360
 runs as standard on 900 employees and they live this card in the box on 930 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.020
 that is not too bad, but it is a clock 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.180
 but still if we get to work ourselves and come to 1017 megaherz to the already nice 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.659
 bit above that standard 900 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:04.830
 Analysts look after the memory that has and is such a concern 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.129
 let's agree with this 1050 card 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:10.479
 and then with great difficulty we come 12 150 meters from where the rest is 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:11.680
 an interesting characters 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.930
 does not add together so yes 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.460
 and here too the same features that are done every now and then 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.940
 study that those connection points for someone who has measurements also briefly 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.030
 that that can be connected to the presence of independer is easy 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.620
 and again plenty of pcb also with this card 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.120
 all four voltages can be adjusted at 14 hours a minute 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.710
 so if you are looking for the young horses 68 70 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.190
 This is actually pretty much the best cards you can find better than 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.529
 has sent all other arrests 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:44.429
 and if you are looking for critical 5 6 3 that has been approved but also offers 

00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:45.710
 do not take 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.260
 after a short time of this episode of hart tvv next friday 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:51.720
 sent there left and right you then discuss
