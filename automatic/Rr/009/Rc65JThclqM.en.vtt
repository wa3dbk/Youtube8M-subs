00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.960
 this is the second generation atleon 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.939
 the rise in c has always been raining here 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.090
 it varies for every you weather of 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.710
 generation to generation 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.349
 from winds china 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.939
 this car quite well but exposed sporty 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.739
 sauce 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.540
 with for many strong engines that 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.460
 available and basically what it 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.560
 Spanish temperament a little rap in 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.200
 again 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.270
 this generation of young, nice and spacious light 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.330
 interior 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.830
 spicy car to sit in but in terms of 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.360
 finish 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.150
 use of plastics in it 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.940
 interior for example after the facelift 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.010
 2009 slightly better but just still 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.630
 not something an audi rider you how 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.760
 can become 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.590
 spanish tim price yes that will come back 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.330
 in the engines 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.239
 many different types live true 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.060
 been that also versions with 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.160
 just a lot of b broken at 300 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.980
 kicking horses in the front 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.840
 to, but more about that later 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.020
 points for attention 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.890
 nice diesel so up to 170 hp so certainly 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.140
 to become 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.320
 sporty rider has c either too 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.320
 offer 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.340
 old scouts and almost 800 copies of 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.010
 this generation leon to find it 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.000
 the majority with gasoline engines 60% there 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.130
 about 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.110
 and despite the dsg machine I too 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.090
 was available for the leon is that 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.200
 namely very limited there are 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.200
 just not so much about it 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.330
 Well looking for real luxury with Leon is 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.340
 which is difficult because they cover angel 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.600
 lighting than what all these things 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.709
 more exotic 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.790
 but many cars with 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:15.190
 navigation system on a quarter and yes it 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.160
 range of thick engines also okay sentence 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.910
 is quite a bit more than 25 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.790
 percent has 150hp plus and 7% has 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.230
 more than two and that is in this class 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.230
 certainly not common 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.290
 it also comes to the points for attention 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.200
 Spanish temperament back and the leon 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.760
 the certainly no trouble-free car without 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.950
 things are a bit smaller 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.790
 without things there are some bigger 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.250
 inhibit 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.170
 door seals that nice regularity 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.230
 a point four atmospheric block with 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.600
 85hp yes that is actually too little for that 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.800
 this type of car at the gasoline engines 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.310
 ignition coils 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.750
 vulnerable arrangements can be made 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.190
 and check things at improver is in 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.440
 our abs psp light out of something and remains the 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.680
 control unit that often breaks and then 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.570
 the light is on and make sure you 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.400
 check if you are aware 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.640
 turn off with the button 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.020
 between the seats on the land still 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.020
 then there are a number 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.030
 t-shirt with certain engines that version 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.459
 with that one hundred and ten horsepower that was one 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.280
 limited edition with chip tuning 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.480
 because in black or white especially for 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.400
 built in the Netherlands 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.800
 there are already a lot of complaints about it 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.170
 formerly do not get the power and where 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.540
 other shows and it is something 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.520
 not only with the chip tuning engines 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.220
 for the leon but also with other brands 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.900
 of course and you wonder if you want to 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.910
 and whether the claims in terms of assets 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.770
 actually be met and 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.020
 by-products from a Volkswagen 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.480
 not to cock 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.060
 have about distribution chains for 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.550
 all tsi engines that is a fragile 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.860
 point you can watch the cauwer start stand 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.870
 your worry ratchet becomes like the diesel is 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.120
 then something could be wrong 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.370
 are with the distribution chain in it 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.710
 issue is that he ensures distribution chain 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.480
 actually for all that in the engines and 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.700
 but runs on times and if not 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.360
 is created for a fat may 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.820
 crowd 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.709
 you want to have lots of cars they 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.770
 will have had adjustments but 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.570
 asks for an anna and has more with the 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.850
 make riders just because there is 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.530
 nice thick engines fast version true 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.230
 and think a young audience 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.960
 therefore beware yes tire wear 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:35.080
 brakes and you keep your car without it 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.340
 in copy he not all nice car 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.819
 2 meters tfsi 200hp 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.370
 nice blue color little color is allowed 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:49.289
 on a car of a tasty run and 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.289
 fine fine certainly runs smoothly
