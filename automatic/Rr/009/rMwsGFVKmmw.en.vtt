now<00:00:12.420> in<00:00:12.540> technical<00:00:12.990> terminology<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.799> is

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
now in technical terminology this is

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.799 
now in technical terminology this is
known<00:00:14.160> as<00:00:14.190> an<00:00:14.429> RS<00:00:14.759> nor<00:00:15.000> latch<00:00:15.059> array<00:00:15.480> but<00:00:15.690> we're

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
known as an RS nor latch array but we're

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.029 
known as an RS nor latch array but we're
not<00:00:15.929> going<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.109> be<00:00:16.199> getting<00:00:16.410> into<00:00:16.590> too<00:00:16.859> much

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
not going to be getting into too much

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.070 
not going to be getting into too much
detail<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.640> one<00:00:17.970> all<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.600> have<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.930> know

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
detail on that one all you have to know

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.990 
detail on that one all you have to know
is<00:00:19.350> when<00:00:19.680> we<00:00:19.770> press<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> bun<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.730> will<00:00:20.850> get

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
is when we press a bun you will get

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.820 
is when we press a bun you will get
yourselves<00:00:21.480> an<00:00:21.570> independent<00:00:22.260> output<00:00:22.680> now

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
yourselves an independent output now

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.500 
yourselves an independent output now
that<00:00:23.010> may<00:00:23.189> not<00:00:23.340> sound<00:00:23.580> very<00:00:23.880> exciting<00:00:24.480> but

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
that may not sound very exciting but

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.019 
that may not sound very exciting but
trust<00:00:25.260> me<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.710> very<00:00:25.800> useful<00:00:26.460> for<00:00:26.609> certain

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
trust me this is very useful for certain

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.210 
trust me this is very useful for certain
mechanisms<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.869> I'll<00:00:27.990> get<00:00:28.170> into<00:00:28.349> those<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.980> a

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
mechanisms and I'll get into those in a

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.910 
mechanisms and I'll get into those in a
little<00:00:29.460> bit<00:00:29.869> so<00:00:30.869> as<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.230> said<00:00:31.439> at<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.560> start

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
little bit so as I said at the start

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.920 
little bit so as I said at the start
this<00:00:32.099> design<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.640> completely<00:00:33.210> silent<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.719> have

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
this design is completely silent I have

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.620 
this design is completely silent I have
turned<00:00:34.200> my<00:00:34.320> sound<00:00:34.680> up<00:00:34.860> right<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.370> 100%<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.300> you

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
turned my sound up right to 100% so you

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.690 
turned my sound up right to 100% so you
can<00:00:36.750> get<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> surround<00:00:37.410> sound<00:00:37.700> immersive

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
can get a surround sound immersive

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.459 
can get a surround sound immersive
experience<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.390> how<00:00:39.540> silent<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.230> thing

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
experience of how silent this thing

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.290 
experience of how silent this thing
actually<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.980> now<00:00:41.670> another<00:00:41.879> thing<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.149> I

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
actually is now another thing that I

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.299 
actually is now another thing that I
have<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.570> mention<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.140> these<00:00:43.770> lights<00:00:44.070> up

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
have to mention is that these lights up

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.100 
have to mention is that these lights up
here<00:00:44.489> are<00:00:44.700> just<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.000> display<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.629> they're<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
here are just a display and they're a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.500 
here are just a display and they're a
little<00:00:46.500> bit<00:00:46.649> behind<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.340> actual<00:00:47.700> output<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
little bit behind the actual output the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.540 
little bit behind the actual output the
back<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.930> much<00:00:49.379> faster<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.039> you'll<00:00:50.190> see<00:00:50.399> when

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
back is much faster but you'll see when

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.729 
back is much faster but you'll see when
we<00:00:50.640> press<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.000> barn<00:00:51.239> here<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:52.199> output

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
we press this barn here this output

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.920 
we press this barn here this output
turns<00:00:52.980> off<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.489> then<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:54.059> one<00:00:54.329> turns<00:00:54.690> on

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
turns off and then this one turns on

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.350 
turns off and then this one turns on
completely<00:00:55.829> independent<00:00:56.520> no<00:00:56.730> other<00:00:57.030> lights

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
completely independent no other lights

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.970 
completely independent no other lights
are<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:58.170> if<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.379> do<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> same<00:00:58.800> thing

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
are on then if we do the same thing

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.529 
are on then if we do the same thing
again<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.219> press<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.699> button<00:00:59.760> this<00:01:00.329> one

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
again just press this button this one

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.080 
again just press this button this one
goes<00:01:00.750> off<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.530> one<00:01:01.800> comes<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.520> I

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
goes off and this one comes on and I

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.880 
goes off and this one comes on and I
guess<00:01:03.359> we<00:01:03.539> can<00:01:03.690> do<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.930> again<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.710> rule<00:01:04.860> a

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
guess we can do it again just rule a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.320 
guess we can do it again just rule a
three<00:01:05.339> there<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.000> go

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
three there we go

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.840 
three there we go
it's<00:01:06.450> working<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.990> charm<00:01:07.610> now<00:01:08.610> another

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
it's working like a charm now another

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.280 
it's working like a charm now another
great<00:01:09.060> thing<00:01:09.270> about<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.630> designer<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
great thing about this designer is the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.469 
great thing about this designer is the
Redstone<00:01:10.860> behind<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.460> really<00:01:11.490> compact<00:01:12.270> in

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
Redstone behind it is really compact in

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.260 
Redstone behind it is really compact in
fact<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.049> would<00:01:13.350> go<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:14.010> say<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.549> it's

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
fact I would go on to say that it's

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.719 
fact I would go on to say that it's
probably<00:01:15.630> one<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.200> smallest<00:01:16.500> silent<00:01:17.369> RS

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
probably one of the smallest silent RS

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.490 
probably one of the smallest silent RS
nor<00:01:17.909> latch<00:01:17.970> erase<00:01:18.420> now<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:18.960> don't<00:01:19.110> want<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.350> say

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
nor latch erase now I don't want to say

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.410 
nor latch erase now I don't want to say
that<00:01:19.650> too<00:01:19.920> suddenly<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.460> case<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.850> get<00:01:20.909> loads<00:01:21.270> of

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
that too suddenly in case I get loads of

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.990 
that too suddenly in case I get loads of
people<00:01:21.570> saying<00:01:21.960> oh<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.710> too<00:01:22.950> big<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.460> too<00:01:23.700> big

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
people saying oh it's too big is too big

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.789 
people saying oh it's too big is too big
you're<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:24.930> gonna<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.259> deal<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:25.680> it

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
you're just gonna have to deal with it

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.200 
you're just gonna have to deal with it
now<00:01:26.070> I'm<00:01:26.189> going<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.400> show<00:01:26.549> off<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.820> Redstone

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
now I'm going to show off the Redstone

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.030 
now I'm going to show off the Redstone
behind<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.659> get<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> jam<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.259> my<00:01:28.380> cameras<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.890> do

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
behind it get a jam on my cameras to do

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.969 
behind it get a jam on my cameras to do
mods<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.520> let's<00:01:29.700> take<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> look<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:31.560> hopefully

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
mods so let's take a look so hopefully

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.740 
mods so let's take a look so hopefully
if<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.250> haven't<00:01:32.520> been<00:01:32.640> too<00:01:32.850> lazy<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.509> one

if I haven't been too lazy on this one
this<00:01:34.140> cinematic<00:01:34.619> should<00:01:35.070> be<00:01:35.189> split<00:01:35.400> up<00:01:35.490> into

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
this cinematic should be split up into

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.819 
this cinematic should be split up into
two<00:01:36.119> different<00:01:36.150> segments<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.470> l'épée

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
two different segments the l'épée

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.069 
two different segments the l'épée
circuit<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.670> button<00:01:38.880> selector<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.869> part

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
circuit is the button selector the part

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.840 
circuit is the button selector the part
that<00:01:40.259> does<00:01:40.409> all<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.920> work<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.369> then<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
that does all of the work and then the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.940 
that does all of the work and then the
iron<00:01:42.270> will<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.810> part<00:01:43.079> for<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> light<00:01:43.619> it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
iron will be the part for the light it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.770 
iron will be the part for the light it
will<00:01:44.280> show<00:01:44.520> which<00:01:44.729> lamp<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.210> on<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.630> which

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
will show which lamp is on and which

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.810 
will show which lamp is on and which
barn<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.409> selected<00:01:46.920> which<00:01:47.399> isn't

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
barn you have selected which isn't

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.969 
barn you have selected which isn't
necessary<00:01:48.299> for<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.689> band<00:01:48.869> panel<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.829> does

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
necessary for the band panel but it does

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.889 
necessary for the band panel but it does
look<00:01:50.189> pretty<00:01:50.220> cool<00:01:50.700> now<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.450> see<00:01:51.720> that

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
look pretty cool now you can see that

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.440 
look pretty cool now you can see that
this<00:01:52.110> extra<00:01:52.680> iron<00:01:52.860> line<00:01:53.189> actually<00:01:53.460> adds<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.180> lot

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
this extra iron line actually adds a lot

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.780 
this extra iron line actually adds a lot
of<00:01:54.509> bulk<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.380> fairly<00:01:55.740> small<00:01:56.070> circuit<00:01:56.610> and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
of bulk to this fairly small circuit and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.219 
of bulk to this fairly small circuit and
it's<00:01:57.210> something<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.750> might<00:01:57.930> want<00:01:58.170> to

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
it's something that you might want to

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.050 
it's something that you might want to
consider<00:01:58.590> leaving<00:01:58.979> out<00:01:59.100> if<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.460> are<00:01:59.640> short<00:01:59.969> on

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
consider leaving out if you are short on

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.010 
consider leaving out if you are short on
space<00:02:01.430> now<00:02:02.430> because<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.180> one<00:02:03.509> wide<00:02:03.719> and

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
space now because this is a one wide and

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.020 
space now because this is a one wide and
tiny<00:02:04.290> bull<00:02:04.530> design<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.920> thought<00:02:05.430> there<00:02:05.640> was<00:02:05.729> no

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
tiny bull design I thought there was no

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.719 
tiny bull design I thought there was no
point<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.450> me<00:02:06.509> doing<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.899> tutorial<00:02:07.200> because

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
point in me doing a tutorial because

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.859 
point in me doing a tutorial because
where's<00:02:08.729> one<00:02:08.910> wide<00:02:09.090> entire<00:02:09.450> level<00:02:09.720> there

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
where's one wide entire level there

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.540 
where's one wide entire level there
shouldn't<00:02:10.110> be<00:02:10.170> any<00:02:10.349> redstone<00:02:10.860> hidden<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.340> this

shouldn't be any redstone hidden on this

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.640 
shouldn't be any redstone hidden on this

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
one so in front of you

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.670 
one so in front of you
is<00:02:13.769> a<00:02:13.980> side-on<00:02:14.670> view<00:02:14.939> of<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.720> build<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.409> gold

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
block is the input block and the diamond

block is the input block and the diamond
block<00:02:19.379> out<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.769> back<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.549> the<00:02:20.730> output<00:02:20.939> if

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
block out the back that is the output if

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.089 
block out the back that is the output if
you<00:02:21.629> have<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.780> torch<00:02:22.079> on<00:02:22.260> top<00:02:22.439> that<00:02:22.680> will<00:02:22.799> invert

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
you have a torch on top that will invert

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.550 
you have a torch on top that will invert
it<00:02:23.340> because<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.329> signals<00:02:24.780> are<00:02:25.019> actually

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
it because the signals are actually

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.830 
it because the signals are actually
inverted<00:02:26.189> on<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.700> way<00:02:26.819> out<00:02:27.000> now<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:27.269> do<00:02:27.450> want<00:02:27.810> to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
inverted on the way out now I do want to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.089 
inverted on the way out now I do want to
run<00:02:28.019> through<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.319> couple<00:02:28.349> of<00:02:28.620> things<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.069> first

otherwise<00:02:34.079> it<00:02:34.409> won't<00:02:34.739> work<00:02:34.859> now<00:02:35.549> obviously

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
otherwise it won't work now obviously

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
section right here including our dropper

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.270 
section right here including our dropper
that<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:44.939> all<00:02:45.209> of<00:02:45.480> our<00:02:45.900> button<00:02:46.319> panel<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.859> then

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
that is all of our button panel and then

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.849 
that is all of our button panel and then
this<00:02:47.549> iron<00:02:48.090> going<00:02:48.359> Brown<00:02:48.659> like<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.139> this<00:02:49.650> is

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
this iron going Brown like this this is

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.280 
this iron going Brown like this this is
for<00:02:50.099> our<00:02:50.129> lamp<00:02:50.639> output<00:02:50.909> like<00:02:51.629> the<00:02:51.840> show<00:02:52.079> off

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
for our lamp output like the show off

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.190 
for our lamp output like the show off
display<00:02:53.040> type<00:02:53.549> thing<00:02:53.879> so<00:02:54.269> that<00:02:54.810> should<00:02:55.079> be

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
display type thing so that should be

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.869 
display type thing so that should be
enough<00:02:55.560> for<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.799> to<00:02:56.040> build<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.459> you

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
enough for you to build this you

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.250 
enough for you to build this you
shouldn't<00:02:57.060> have<00:02:57.269> any<00:02:57.420> trouble<00:02:57.450> doing<00:02:58.019> just

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
shouldn't have any trouble doing just

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.720 
shouldn't have any trouble doing just
that<00:02:58.349> so<00:02:58.950> there<00:02:59.459> we<00:02:59.549> go

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
that so there we go

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.920 
that so there we go
I'll<00:02:59.879> leave<00:03:00.180> that<00:03:00.209> on<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.510> screen<00:03:00.750> for<00:03:00.870> a

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
I'll leave that on the screen for a

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.089 
I'll leave that on the screen for a
little<00:03:01.079> bit<00:03:01.170> longer<00:03:01.379> so<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.769> can<00:03:01.889> get<00:03:02.010> your

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
little bit longer so you can get your

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.559 
little bit longer so you can get your
screenshots<00:03:03.200> yeah<00:03:04.700> but<00:03:05.700> unfortunately<00:03:06.389> that

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
screenshots yeah but unfortunately that

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.240 
screenshots yeah but unfortunately that
is<00:03:06.720> all<00:03:06.900> I've<00:03:07.109> got<00:03:07.139> time<00:03:07.560> for<00:03:07.769> for<00:03:08.010> today<00:03:08.040> I

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
is all I've got time for for today I
