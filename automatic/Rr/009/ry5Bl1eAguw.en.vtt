other words gold's price may be

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.500 
other words gold's price may be
double<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.739> points<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.400> Dow<00:02:14.549> the<00:02:14.879> fair

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
double the points of the Dow the fair

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.809 
double the points of the Dow the fair
value<00:02:15.959> of<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.379> Dow<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.739> probably<00:02:17.219> around<00:02:17.430> four

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
value of the Dow is probably around four

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.580 
value of the Dow is probably around four
ounces<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.239> gold<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:18.840> it'd<00:02:18.959> be<00:02:19.079> four<00:02:19.319> times

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
ounces of gold so it'd be four times

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.250 
ounces of gold so it'd be four times

about twenty four hundred dollars an

ounce gold today if that was the fair
value<00:02:28.230> ratio<00:02:28.859> but<00:02:29.579> we<00:02:30.420> went<00:02:30.569> up<00:02:30.689> to<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.900> bubble

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
crashed it went to just two in 1966 we

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.229 
crashed it went to just two in 1966 we

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
went to 28 ounces of a gold a bigger

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.500

bubble<00:02:39.480> when<00:02:40.319> gold<00:02:41.189> corrected<00:02:41.819> and<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.329> Dow

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
bubble when gold corrected and the Dow

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.410 
bubble when gold corrected and the Dow
moved<00:02:42.840> sideways<00:02:43.200> for<00:02:43.739> 14<00:02:44.189> years<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:45.030> went<00:02:45.299> to

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
moved sideways for 14 years it went to

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.780 
moved sideways for 14 years it went to
just<00:02:45.659> one<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.230> then<00:02:46.950> we<00:02:47.099> went<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.489> biggest

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
just one and then we went to the biggest

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.250 
just one and then we went to the biggest
bubble<00:02:47.939> in<00:02:48.150> history<00:02:48.569> where<00:02:48.720> gold<00:02:48.930> was<00:02:49.139> the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
bubble in history where gold was the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.500 
bubble in history where gold was the
most<00:02:49.470> undervalued<00:02:49.769> at<00:02:50.189> than<00:02:50.430> in<00:02:50.730> any<00:02:51.180> time<00:02:51.269> in

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
most undervalued at than in any time in

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.460 
most undervalued at than in any time in
the<00:02:51.780> last<00:02:51.889> 5000<00:02:52.889> years<00:02:52.919> basically<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:54.480> stocks

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
the last 5000 years basically and stocks

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.679 
the last 5000 years basically and stocks
were<00:02:55.799> more<00:02:55.950> overvalued<00:02:56.639> than<00:02:56.970> at<00:02:57.389> any<00:02:57.569> time

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:57.689 
were more overvalued than at any time

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.979 
were more overvalued than at any time
since<00:02:57.930> there's<00:02:58.439> been<00:02:58.500> exchanges<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.459> stuff

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
since there's been exchanges and stuff

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.770 
since there's been exchanges and stuff
and<00:03:00.989> it<00:03:01.739> took<00:03:01.919> 45<00:03:02.220> ounces<00:03:02.909> of<00:03:03.060> gold<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.359> buy<00:03:03.569> one

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
and it took 45 ounces of gold to buy one

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.379 
and it took 45 ounces of gold to buy one
share<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.260> down<00:03:04.519> we're<00:03:05.519> now<00:03:05.669> down<00:03:05.909> to<00:03:05.970> nine

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
share of the down we're now down to nine

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.899 
share of the down we're now down to nine
so<00:03:07.230> gold<00:03:07.799> has<00:03:07.980> outperformed<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.760> Dow

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
so gold has outperformed the Dow

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.140 
so gold has outperformed the Dow
significantly<00:03:10.159> over<00:03:11.159> the<00:03:11.189> last<00:03:11.280> decade<00:03:11.939> and

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
significantly over the last decade and

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.960 
significantly over the last decade and
we're<00:03:13.109> probably<00:03:13.379> on<00:03:13.590> our<00:03:13.709> way<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.430> point

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
we're probably on our way to the point

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.550 
we're probably on our way to the point
where<00:03:15.120> it'll<00:03:15.359> be<00:03:15.480> at<00:03:15.629> least<00:03:15.840> one<00:03:16.139> but<00:03:16.319> probably

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
where it'll be at least one but probably

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.379 
where it'll be at least one but probably
one<00:03:16.739> half<00:03:17.099> of<00:03:17.280> an<00:03:17.370> ounce<00:03:17.519> which<00:03:17.819> means<00:03:18.030> Gold's

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
one half of an ounce which means Gold's

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.449 
one half of an ounce which means Gold's
price<00:03:18.629> will<00:03:18.900> be<00:03:19.019> double<00:03:19.379> whatever<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.159> points

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
price will be double whatever the points

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.879 
price will be double whatever the points
of<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.669> Dow<00:03:20.819> is<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.299> it's<00:03:21.659> just<00:03:21.930> this<00:03:22.440> is<00:03:22.620> just

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
of the Dow is and it's just this is just

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:27.319 
of the Dow is and it's just this is just
logic<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.729> math<00:03:24.209> I'm<00:03:24.780> using<00:03:25.790> $15,000<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:27.030> high

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
logic and math I'm using $15,000 is high

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.020 
logic and math I'm using $15,000 is high
but<00:03:27.930> what<00:03:28.199> if<00:03:28.319> I<00:03:28.440> had<00:03:28.560> told<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:28.889> back<00:03:29.129> in<00:03:29.310> 2000

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
but what if I had told you back in 2000

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.009 
but what if I had told you back in 2000
that<00:03:30.120> gold<00:03:30.510> prices<00:03:30.569> would<00:03:31.290> be<00:03:31.319> at<00:03:31.739> 1,100<00:03:32.549> today

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
that gold prices would be at 1,100 today

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.159 
that gold prices would be at 1,100 today
