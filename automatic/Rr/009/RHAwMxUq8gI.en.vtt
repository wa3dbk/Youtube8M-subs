the<00:00:04.920> whale<00:00:05.160> shark<00:00:05.190> passes<00:00:05.790> right<00:00:06.420> in<00:00:06.660> front<00:00:06.930> of

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
the whale shark passes right in front of

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.919 
the whale shark passes right in front of
me<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.950> water<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.460> not<00:00:08.610> very<00:00:08.970> clear<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.599> this

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
me the water is not very clear and this

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.049 
me the water is not very clear and this
is<00:00:10.110> where<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.320> get<00:00:10.590> my<00:00:10.620> first<00:00:11.160> clue<00:00:11.610> what<00:00:11.940> is

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
is where I get my first clue what is

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
this section of the ocean because it's

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.220 
this section of the ocean because it's
filled<00:00:18.060> with<00:00:18.270> plankton

and small fish the word plankton comes

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.099 
and small fish the word plankton comes
from<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.160> Greek<00:00:29.400> word<00:00:29.429> meaning<00:00:29.699> drifter<00:00:30.660> so
