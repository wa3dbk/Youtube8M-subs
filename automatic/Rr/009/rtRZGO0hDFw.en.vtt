00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.510

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.599

 we are guests at the steelers and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.180
 Actually we had thought when we were 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.579

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.109

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.879

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.470
 then of course we want the pinguins 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.510
 in the new arena here in bidigheim 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.160
 watch and see games win 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.050
 unfortunately it will not work out 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.970
 the new arena we right 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.100

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.370
 that is not finished yet 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.549
 see building fences building site atmosphere 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.129
 backhoe and unfortunately no 

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:54.930
 Ice hockey game ready venue 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.600
 we will play in the game today 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.100
 time-honored ellental stadium also has 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.629
 harm this arena reminds one 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.089
 little bit of the old ice stadium 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.830
 at the wilhelm kaisen place and there will 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.140
 today so dished up the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.030
 Fans want the last official game 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.090
 celebrate a bit in this arena and 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.619
 we'll just take a look 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.850
 Finally we are outside in the arena 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.439
 It rains we are finally dry 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.179
 grad we have seen the new arena 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.770
 not quite finished but the old one 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.359
 ellental ice stadium that also has its 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.130
 Henning's charm will be the same 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.810
 catch a few impressions and the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.640
 Jobs is being created next to me because today 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.979
 last game in this arena is a 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.570
 a little sad or we said 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.840
 have new arena and blues with this 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.229
 thing 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.210
 Well, it is divided into two parts in the old hall 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.109
 there was a lot of history 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.240
 written 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:42.390
 I experienced a lot in myself 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.979
 all the time and yes 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.719
 now it's only when it 's new 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.859
 be built because otherwise it with 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.170
 ice hockey in bidigheim no longer 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.749
 Therefore, would have looked forward to the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.759
 new but also a bit sad at the 

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:57.509
 old what makes this hall of this 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.389
 old stadium tradition just like that 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.149
 The whole history of the bdk witnessed 

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:03.689
 and you can not 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.069
 describe 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.719
 that reminds me a bit 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.970
 our old stadium in bremerhaven one 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.590
 is very close to happening 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.810
 really correct, I was myself 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.230
 even in bremerhaven was small 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.260
 schnuckelig but the new is just too 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.530
 Great new progress Everything fits 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.270
 beautiful 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.860
 Now we are sad that we are here today 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.450
 can not play the opening game 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.230
 but in quotes only that 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.990
 farewell game 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.130
 you would rather have against us now 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.380
 plays in the new hall or at least 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.020
 rather against Heilbronn next week well 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.880
 So preparation for the derby was 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.500
 maybe already been good 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.590
 to have a game in the new hall 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.360
 but is also now has the bremerhaven 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.400
 chance the last game in the old one 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.380
 to have a hall that will never be forgotten 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.860
 stay you have many transparent ones here 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.360
 made 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.760
 that means you want to get it right today 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.560
 to after event show right that 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.570
 so that the old one all right 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.910
 it is also adopted as it is 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.040
 belongs also to the alde therefore 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.200
 just say goodbye 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.850
 the beautiful is yes this stadium remains 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.140
 The hall was preserved in Bremerhaven 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.270
 demolished the old stadium 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.380
 that's just a short one 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.540
 section choice, it is not at all 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.610
 real farewell yes but it will stop 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.920
 no longer played in it and then it is 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.920
 already a farewell should be full and 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.260
 sold out I hope so but I believe 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.270
 I hope not as full as possible 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.670
 and it warmer nice street party then 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.410
 make that penguin tv wishes first 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.300
 once the steelers all the best for this 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.920
 season of course also a lot in the future 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.770
 the new arena tonight, however 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.240
 if the penguin goes ok 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.970
 you can live with bremerhaven 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.810
 Well, we do not really look any further 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.810
