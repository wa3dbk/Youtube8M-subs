 a question. 19 thousand north huge 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.140

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.140

 i really don't like guns and i will 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.120
 and what they say Pushkin is our everything I 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.460
 I think this is not true but in essence 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.130
 there were good works before they were studied 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.700
 at school or read out and but I don’t 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.590
 like absolutely 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.069
 Yesenin write Pushkin namaz for the soul 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.829
 frost amount 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.650
 that is why I don’t remember very much 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:49.090
 I remember all a lot oh and there is an interesting 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.090
 a fairy tale otherwise 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:57.580
 just Pushkin 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.580
 which are rare elements 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.420
 but I was never particularly interested 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.910
 I remember only school I remember the wonderful 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.630
 the munes 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.520
 sheets as fleeting vision as a genius 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:17.350
 pure beauty and so honestly not mine 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.320
 Absolutely please, but there is an oak 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.780
 green golden chain on oak that afternoon and 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.470
 at night the cat scientist walks around the chain 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:35.100
 around 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:35.100
 finish reading or chaotic 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:47.530
 I 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:52.040
 alexander sergeevich pushkin bukin bar on 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.960
 this gun is not why you think because 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.830
 what 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.260
 that's the world of god so much moment to 2 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.980
 in front of me you appeared as fleeting 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:06.840
 vision as a genius of pure beauty 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:10.390
 fencing everything so long ago but not even 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:32.080
 few lines and full of thick pushkin 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:34.270
 from children's fairy tales day and night I tell you 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.050
 I'm writing what more can I do? 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.810
 ask 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.810
 now with on your shin not but contempt 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.050
 it is important to also say contempt me 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:49.590
 punish up 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:51.490
 Now I know, but you remember my 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.790
 unfortunate share 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:59.790
 my miserable lobe. pity keeping you 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.790
 don't leave me like that 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.740
 at husband 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.910
 but clean burn 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.000
 look like but of course we 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.000
 of course you go some kind of classic 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:21.240
 but there is this shame just fine 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:25.229
 give a prompt alexander 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:29.940
 oh well sergeevich it's true he is not 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:32.280
 very similar to the real true and 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:37.160
 I am very, very similar to myself if 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:40.510
 honestly maybe maybe because 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:44.370
 The first Uzi was of course they me 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:47.920
 unexpectedly and we have some date he 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:51.460
 got a spoonful of flour born and through 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.590
 week he invites everyone by how much 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.210
 undertook which will be after this 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.150
 hear remains 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.720
 musical work and you are not from 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.450
 Pushkin 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.510
 can remember oh my gosh that's what i remember 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.100
 wonderful moment before the wise and shame 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.700
 as fleeting vision 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.110
 what unclean beauty probably on 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.750
 the first will start a war just well 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.940
 surprisingly of course you have to be 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.140
 probably more decisively always your thoughts 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.140
 the site of all the best
