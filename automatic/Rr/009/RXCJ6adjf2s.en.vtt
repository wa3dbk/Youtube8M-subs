now<00:01:16.870> these<00:01:17.650> run<00:01:18.130> into<00:01:19.000> my<00:01:19.270> sound<00:01:19.720> card<00:01:20.020> which

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
now these run into my sound card which

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.910 
now these run into my sound card which
I'm<00:01:20.560> using<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:21.040> MK<00:01:21.580> 4<00:01:22.000> I<00:01:22.330> choose<00:01:23.229> to<00:01:23.440> use<00:01:23.620> this

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
I'm using the MK 4 I choose to use this

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.569 
I'm using the MK 4 I choose to use this
over<00:01:24.729> an<00:01:25.270> audio<00:01:25.840> 8<00:01:26.229> or<00:01:26.590> do<00:01:26.979> you<00:01:27.070> attend<00:01:27.340> for

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
over an audio 8 or do you attend for

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.050 
over an audio 8 or do you attend for
example<00:01:28.030> because<00:01:28.240> I<00:01:28.329> just<00:01:28.479> like<00:01:28.659> to<00:01:28.810> have<00:01:28.930> more

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
example because I just like to have more

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.149 
example because I just like to have more
flexibility<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.090> have<00:01:31.630> enable<00:01:32.439> more<00:01:32.649> stuff

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
flexibility to have enable more stuff

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.330 
flexibility to have enable more stuff
with<00:01:33.490> in<00:01:33.670> Traktor<00:01:34.149> are<00:01:34.270> lighter<00:01:34.450> more<00:01:34.810> buttons

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
with in Traktor are lighter more buttons

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:43.260 
with in Traktor are lighter more buttons
but<00:01:36.340> basically<00:01:37.619> your<00:01:39.990> RCA<00:01:40.990> in<00:01:41.170> channel<00:01:41.680> 1<00:01:42.270> will

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
but basically your RCA in channel 1 will

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.950 
but basically your RCA in channel 1 will
go<00:01:43.509> to<00:01:43.740> your<00:01:44.740> output<00:01:45.009> on<00:01:46.920> channel<00:01:47.920> 1<00:01:48.820> on<00:01:49.180> your

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
go to your output on channel 1 on your

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.099 
go to your output on channel 1 on your
sound<00:01:50.320> card<00:01:50.729> these<00:01:51.729> are<00:01:52.000> my<00:01:52.119> turntables

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.109 
sound card these are my turntables

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.870 
sound card these are my turntables
this<00:01:53.950> is<00:01:54.100> turntable<00:01:54.759> 1<00:01:55.060> this<00:01:55.689> is<00:01:55.840> turntable<00:01:56.590> to

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
this is turntable 1 this is turntable to

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.270 
this is turntable 1 this is turntable to
your<00:01:57.880> turntables<00:01:58.659> must<00:01:59.140> go<00:01:59.409> into<00:01:59.710> the<00:02:00.009> sound

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
your turntables must go into the sound

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.489 
your turntables must go into the sound
card<00:02:00.579> no<00:02:00.939> matter<00:02:01.149> what<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:03.460> output<00:02:04.060> then<00:02:04.499> goes

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:05.499 
card no matter what the output then goes

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:08.430 
card no matter what the output then goes
into<00:02:05.859> the<00:02:06.310> mix<00:02:06.609> our<00:02:06.909> external<00:02:07.450> mixer<00:02:08.050> whatever

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
into the mix our external mixer whatever

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.760 
into the mix our external mixer whatever
external<00:02:09.340> mixer<00:02:09.670> you're<00:02:09.850> using<00:02:10.210> in<00:02:11.200> my<00:02:11.440> case

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
external mixer you're using in my case

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.450 
external mixer you're using in my case
the<00:02:12.340> behringer<00:02:13.110> channel<00:02:14.110> 1<00:02:14.290> channel<00:02:14.760> 4<00:02:15.760> and

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
the behringer channel 1 channel 4 and

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.260 
the behringer channel 1 channel 4 and
then<00:02:18.460> all<00:02:18.610> you're<00:02:18.760> doing<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:19.090> just

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
then all you're doing is just

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.420 
then all you're doing is just
manipulating<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.960> sound<00:02:20.290> basically<00:02:21.040> but

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
manipulating the sound basically but

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.260 
manipulating the sound basically but
it's<00:02:21.640> still<00:02:22.030> reading<00:02:22.540> from<00:02:22.990> your<00:02:23.170> sound<00:02:23.440> card

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
it's still reading from your sound card

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.809 
it's still reading from your sound card
the<00:02:25.270> turntables<00:02:26.050> which<00:02:26.380> is<00:02:26.530> directly<00:02:27.160> then

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
the turntables which is directly then

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.310 
the turntables which is directly then
into<00:02:28.450> tractor<00:02:29.550> so<00:02:30.840> basically<00:02:31.840> I'll<00:02:32.080> show<00:02:32.260> you

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
into tractor so basically I'll show you

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.790 
into tractor so basically I'll show you
the<00:02:32.560> back<00:02:32.740> again<00:02:33.870> we've<00:02:34.870> got<00:02:34.900> line<00:02:35.350> in
