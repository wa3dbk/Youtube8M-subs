00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.190 

I<00:00:07.519> thought<00:00:08.519> I'd<00:00:08.639> show<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:08.880> today<00:00:09.330> one<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.080> the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
I thought I'd show you today one of the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.990 
I thought I'd show you today one of the
projects<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.679> actually<00:00:11.040> in<00:00:11.190> my<00:00:11.340> book<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.880> it's

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
projects is actually in my book and it's

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.990 
projects is actually in my book and it's
called<00:00:12.059> do<00:00:12.450> drop<00:00:12.719> spiral<00:00:13.309> the<00:00:14.309> dew<00:00:14.790> drop

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
called do drop spiral the dew drop

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.599 
called do drop spiral the dew drop
spiral<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> simple<00:00:16.139> spiral<00:00:16.529> rope<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:17.070> have<00:00:17.580> a

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
spiral is a simple spiral rope I have a

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.960 
spiral is a simple spiral rope I have a
whole<00:00:17.789> section<00:00:18.150> in<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.750> book<00:00:18.930> on<00:00:19.170> various

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
whole section in the book on various

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.090 
whole section in the book on various
well<00:00:20.970> variations<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.260> simple<00:00:22.560> spiral<00:00:22.920> rope

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
well variations of a simple spiral rope

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.460 
well variations of a simple spiral rope
this<00:00:23.730> one<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.359> kind<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.689> my<00:00:24.840> favorite<00:00:25.080> though

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
this one is kind of my favorite though

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.670 
this one is kind of my favorite though
because<00:00:26.180> it's<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.330> combination<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.260> spiral

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
because it's a combination of spiral

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.679 
because it's a combination of spiral
rope<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.099> peyote<00:00:29.400> stitch<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
rope and peyote stitch one of the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.209 
rope and peyote stitch one of the
reasons<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.050> decided<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.560> demonstrate<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:32.189> here

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
reasons I decided to demonstrate it here

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.090 
reasons I decided to demonstrate it here
on<00:00:32.759> video<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.450> because<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.260> way<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.440> hold<00:00:34.829> it

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
on video is because the way you hold it

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.910 
on video is because the way you hold it
can<00:00:35.430> really<00:00:35.550> make<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.820> difference<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.680> how<00:00:37.680> easy

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
can really make a difference in how easy

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.970 
can really make a difference in how easy
it<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.750> figured<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.649> was<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> good

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
it is to do so I figured that was a good

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.670 
it is to do so I figured that was a good
reason<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.520> bring<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.149> on<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.660> show<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.410> a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
reason to bring it on on the show for a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.770 
reason to bring it on on the show for a
video<00:00:44.190> let's<00:00:44.820> take<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.030> closer<00:00:45.329> look<00:00:45.450> at<00:00:45.660> what

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
video let's take a closer look at what

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.799 
video let's take a closer look at what
I'm<00:00:45.870> talking<00:00:46.200> about<00:00:46.260> here<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.910> this<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
I'm talking about here so this is the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.740 
I'm talking about here so this is the
dewdrop<00:00:49.140> spiral<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.309> see<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.510> has

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
dewdrop spiral you can see that it has

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.920 
dewdrop spiral you can see that it has
these<00:00:52.260> brightly<00:00:52.890> colored<00:00:53.340> shiny<00:00:54.180> beads<00:00:54.510> and

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
these brightly colored shiny beads and

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.869 
these brightly colored shiny beads and
on<00:00:55.410> top<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.100> they<00:00:56.160> kind<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.489> look<00:00:56.850> like

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
on top and they kind of look like

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.750 
on top and they kind of look like
they're<00:00:57.180> almost<00:00:57.390> glowing<00:00:58.020> by<00:00:58.739> comparison<00:00:59.520> to

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
they're almost glowing by comparison to

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.150 
they're almost glowing by comparison to
the<00:01:00.210> beads<00:01:00.420> underneath<00:01:00.960> which<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.559> purposely

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the beads underneath which I purposely

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.530 
the beads underneath which I purposely
chose<00:01:02.250> as<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> matte<00:01:03.149> darker<00:01:04.140> bead<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.390> it's

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
chose as a matte darker bead and so it's

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.620 
chose as a matte darker bead and so it's
just<00:01:06.659> these<00:01:07.200> these<00:01:07.880> shiny<00:01:08.880> beads<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.420> look

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
just these these shiny beads just look

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.320 
just these these shiny beads just look
like<00:01:09.750> they<00:01:09.900> pop<00:01:10.229> right<00:01:10.560> off<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.760> spiral

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
like they pop right off of the spiral

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.719 
like they pop right off of the spiral
rope<00:01:12.540> which<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.900> really<00:01:13.320> really<00:01:13.439> cool<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.610> let

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
rope which is really really cool so let

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.510 
rope which is really really cool so let
me<00:01:14.790> show<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.000> how<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.479> done<00:01:16.400> it's<00:01:17.400> going

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
me show you how this is done it's going

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.460 
me show you how this is done it's going
to<00:01:17.610> seem<00:01:17.759> really<00:01:17.850> familiar<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.780> guys<00:01:18.960> who

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.760 
to seem really familiar to you guys who
have<00:01:19.710> already<00:01:20.070> done<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> simple<00:01:20.729> spiral<00:01:20.939> rope

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
have already done a simple spiral rope

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.859 
have already done a simple spiral rope
for<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.830> first<00:01:23.130> step<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.729> then<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.509> gets<00:01:24.750> a

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
for the first step and then it gets a

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.359 
for the first step and then it gets a
little<00:01:24.900> different<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.530> happen<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.220> this

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
little different I happen to have this

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.710 
little different I happen to have this
drop<00:01:26.640> bead<00:01:26.820> right<00:01:27.000> here<00:01:27.060> which<00:01:27.420> I'm<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.600> to

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
drop bead right here which I'm going to

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.859 
drop bead right here which I'm going to
use<00:01:28.020> as<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> stopper<00:01:29.040> bead<00:01:29.329> so<00:01:30.329> I'm<00:01:30.479> just

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
use as a stopper bead so I'm just

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.450 
use as a stopper bead so I'm just
putting<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.770> my<00:01:31.950> thread<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:33.320> passing

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
putting it on my thread and passing

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.520 
putting it on my thread and passing
through<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.939> hole<00:01:36.119> again<00:01:36.270> leaving<00:01:37.140> myself<00:01:37.290> a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
through that hole again leaving myself a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.640 
through that hole again leaving myself a
tail<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:38.009> weave<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.340> later<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.530> we're<00:01:40.530> going

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
tail to weave in later and we're going

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.880 
tail to weave in later and we're going
to<00:01:40.680> start<00:01:40.920> out<00:01:41.040> by<00:01:41.189> picking<00:01:41.369> five<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:43.680> size

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
to start out by picking five of the size

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.690 
to start out by picking five of the size
8<00:01:44.310> seed<00:01:44.670> beads<00:01:44.970> here<00:01:46.189> so<00:01:47.189> that'll<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:47.579> our

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
8 seed beads here so that'll be our

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.940 
8 seed beads here so that'll be our
spine<00:01:48.060> beads<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.810> then<00:01:49.350> we're<00:01:49.500> going<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.649> pick

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
spine beads and then we're going to pick

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.410 
spine beads and then we're going to pick
up<00:01:50.159> eight<00:01:50.689> of<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.970> matte<00:01:54.630> colors<00:01:55.170> that's<00:01:55.500> five

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
up eight of the matte colors that's five

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.319 
up eight of the matte colors that's five
six<00:01:57.420> seven<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.560> eight<00:02:00.619> then<00:02:01.939> just<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.090> any

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
six seven and eight then just like any

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.389 
six seven and eight then just like any
spiral<00:02:03.840> rope<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.350> would<00:02:04.469> do<00:02:04.710> you're

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
spiral rope that you would do you're

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.280 
spiral rope that you would do you're
going<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.579> pass<00:02:05.850> through<00:02:06.329> those<00:02:06.540> spine<00:02:06.930> beads

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
going to pass through those spine beads

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.449 
going to pass through those spine beads
from<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.860> bottom<00:02:08.340> up<00:02:08.610> through<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.060> top<00:02:09.270> again

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
from the bottom up through the top again

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.320 
from the bottom up through the top again
so<00:02:11.459> there<00:02:11.700> we<00:02:11.819> go

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
so there we go

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.610 
so there we go
it

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
it

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.589 
it
it's<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:13.980> loop<00:02:14.250> let<00:02:14.519> me<00:02:14.610> get<00:02:14.760> mr.<00:02:15.000> tail<00:02:15.360> out

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
it's that loop let me get mr. tail out

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.890 
it's that loop let me get mr. tail out
of<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.780> way<00:02:15.930> here<00:02:16.349> come<00:02:17.069> on<00:02:17.190> baby<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:18.720> don't

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
of the way here come on baby you don't

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.460 
of the way here come on baby you don't
get<00:02:19.019> to<00:02:19.170> play<00:02:19.319> there<00:02:20.040> we<00:02:20.190> go<00:02:20.629> okay<00:02:21.629> so<00:02:22.290> there's

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
get to play there we go okay so there's

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.740 
get to play there we go okay so there's
our<00:02:22.620> first<00:02:22.830> loop<00:02:23.280> but<00:02:23.879> we're<00:02:24.060> not<00:02:24.239> done<00:02:24.540> with

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
our first loop but we're not done with

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.059 
our first loop but we're not done with
that<00:02:24.810> loop<00:02:25.140> because<00:02:25.440> what<00:02:25.590> we're<00:02:25.709> going<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:25.890> do

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
that loop because what we're going to do

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.860 
that loop because what we're going to do
now<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.489> we're<00:02:26.640> going<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.790> peyote<00:02:27.299> that<00:02:27.599> loop

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
now is we're going to peyote that loop

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.940 
now is we're going to peyote that loop
it<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.830> way<00:02:29.099> easier<00:02:29.129> to<00:02:29.819> flip<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.799> that

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
it is way easier to flip this so that

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.740 
it is way easier to flip this so that
your<00:02:32.069> working<00:02:32.310> thread<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.849> now<00:02:33.000> coming<00:02:33.269> out<00:02:33.540> of

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
your working thread is now coming out of

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.910 
your working thread is now coming out of
the<00:02:33.870> bottom<00:02:34.379> and<00:02:35.420> now<00:02:36.420> we<00:02:36.480> can<00:02:36.870> peyote<00:02:37.319> up<00:02:37.650> this

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
the bottom and now we can peyote up this

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.759 
the bottom and now we can peyote up this
loop<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.569> it's<00:02:39.720> on<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.989> right<00:02:40.140> side<00:02:40.500> and

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
loop so that it's on the right side and

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.199 
loop so that it's on the right side and
you're<00:02:40.890> going<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.340> right<00:02:41.459> direction<00:02:41.700> it

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
you're going in the right direction it

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.479 
you're going in the right direction it
just<00:02:42.269> makes<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.019> so<00:02:43.230> much<00:02:43.379> easier<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:44.040> what

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
just makes it so much easier so what

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.500 
just makes it so much easier so what
we're<00:02:44.579> going<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.730> do<00:02:44.879> is<00:02:45.000> we're<00:02:45.090> going<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.239> pass

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
we're going to do is we're going to pass

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.259 
we're going to do is we're going to pass
through<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.930> first<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.859> base<00:02:47.609> bead<00:02:47.970> in

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
through the first of the base bead in

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.119 
through the first of the base bead in
the<00:02:48.359> loop<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:48.870> then<00:02:49.620> we're<00:02:49.739> going<00:02:49.859> to<00:02:49.890> pick<00:02:50.099> up

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
the loop and then we're going to pick up

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.059 
the loop and then we're going to pick up
one<00:02:50.579> of<00:02:50.910> our<00:02:51.150> top<00:02:51.870> bead<00:02:52.319> what<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.560> did<00:02:52.799> here<00:02:53.040> is

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
one of our top bead what I did here is

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.550 
one of our top bead what I did here is
this<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.459> not<00:02:53.609> a<00:02:53.940> shiny<00:02:54.359> bead<00:02:54.629> I<00:02:54.870> love<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.440> way

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
this is not a shiny bead I love the way

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.530 
this is not a shiny bead I love the way
the<00:02:55.680> shiny<00:02:55.920> beads<00:02:56.160> look<00:02:56.459> but<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.150> went<00:02:57.359> for<00:02:57.510> a

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
the shiny beads look but I went for a

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.020 
the shiny beads look but I went for a
very<00:02:57.720> highly<00:02:58.140> contrasting<00:02:59.040> color<00:02:59.310> bead<00:02:59.640> so

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
very highly contrasting color bead so

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.509 
very highly contrasting color bead so
that<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.780> would<00:03:00.930> really<00:03:01.109> show<00:03:01.470> up<00:03:01.739> when<00:03:02.129> we

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
that it would really show up when we

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.300 
that it would really show up when we
work<00:03:02.700> this<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.659> I'm<00:03:03.750> skipping<00:03:04.049> a<00:03:04.379> bead<00:03:04.590> for

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
work this so I'm skipping a bead for

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.520 
work this so I'm skipping a bead for
this<00:03:05.730> new<00:03:05.970> one<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.239> sit<00:03:06.420> on<00:03:06.599> top<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.379> then

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
this new one to sit on top of and then

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.860 
this new one to sit on top of and then
I'm<00:03:07.650> passing<00:03:08.159> through<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.549> next<00:03:08.730> bead<00:03:08.970> so

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
I'm passing through the next bead so

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.130 
I'm passing through the next bead so
this<00:03:10.019> will<00:03:10.230> just<00:03:10.560> be<00:03:10.799> like<00:03:11.040> doing<00:03:11.640> a<00:03:11.879> first<00:03:12.420> row

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
this will just be like doing a first row

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.190 
this will just be like doing a first row
of<00:03:13.440> peyote<00:03:14.280> stitch<00:03:14.519> picking<00:03:15.390> up<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.569> new<00:03:15.720> one

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
of peyote stitch picking up a new one

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.890 
of peyote stitch picking up a new one
skipping<00:03:16.920> one<00:03:17.389> passing<00:03:18.389> through<00:03:18.419> the<00:03:18.690> next

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
skipping one passing through the next

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:27.199 
skipping one passing through the next
one<00:03:21.799> picking<00:03:22.799> up<00:03:22.950> one<00:03:24.919> skipping<00:03:25.919> one<00:03:26.209> passing

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
one picking up one skipping one passing

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.420 
one picking up one skipping one passing
through<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.690> next<00:03:28.019> one<00:03:30.709> so<00:03:31.709> there<00:03:31.950> we<00:03:32.069> go<00:03:32.099> we

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
through the next one so there we go we

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.970 
through the next one so there we go we
just<00:03:32.459> added<00:03:33.329> three<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:34.230> those<00:03:34.410> little<00:03:34.709> spine

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
just added three of those little spine

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.030 
just added three of those little spine
beads<00:03:35.250> there<00:03:35.639> and<00:03:35.900> then<00:03:36.900> here<00:03:37.620> I'm<00:03:37.769> just<00:03:37.889> going

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
beads there and then here I'm just going

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.860 
beads there and then here I'm just going
to<00:03:38.129> pass<00:03:38.340> through<00:03:38.609> that<00:03:38.730> but<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.180> last<00:03:39.510> bead

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
to pass through that but that last bead

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.860 
to pass through that but that last bead
by<00:03:40.200> itself<00:03:42.530> then<00:03:43.530> we<00:03:43.889> can<00:03:44.040> flip<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.430> again<00:03:44.870> come

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
by itself then we can flip it again come

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.430 
by itself then we can flip it again come
back<00:03:45.900> up<00:03:46.319> that<00:03:46.530> spine<00:03:48.019> so<00:03:49.019> that<00:03:49.049> we<00:03:49.260> are<00:03:49.319> now

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
back up that spine so that we are now

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.030 
back up that spine so that we are now
coming<00:03:49.650> out<00:03:49.889> the<00:03:50.190> top<00:03:50.459> of<00:03:50.849> the<00:03:51.090> spine<00:03:51.389> again

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
coming out the top of the spine again

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.150 
coming out the top of the spine again
okay<00:03:53.299> so<00:03:54.299> there<00:03:54.449> we<00:03:54.480> go<00:03:54.599> there<00:03:55.290> is<00:03:55.560> our<00:03:55.739> first

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
okay so there we go there is our first

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.289 
okay so there we go there is our first
loop<00:03:57.000> done<00:03:57.620> now<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.680> way<00:03:58.980> of<00:03:59.549> course<00:03:59.849> we<00:04:00.060> grow

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
loop done now the way of course we grow

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.020 
loop done now the way of course we grow
any<00:04:00.569> simple<00:04:01.019> spiral<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:01.620> by<00:04:01.889> adding<00:04:02.129> a<00:04:02.639> spine

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
any simple spiral is by adding a spine

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.460 
any simple spiral is by adding a spine
bead<00:04:04.669> for<00:04:05.669> our<00:04:06.060> next<00:04:06.299> loop<00:04:06.599> and<00:04:06.870> then<00:04:07.079> another

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
bead for our next loop and then another

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:14.089 
bead for our next loop and then another
eight<00:04:07.949> one<00:04:08.879> two<00:04:09.419> three<00:04:10.069> four<00:04:11.329> five<00:04:12.329> six<00:04:13.199> seven

as<00:04:14.940> I'm<00:04:15.629> doing<00:04:15.840> this<00:04:16.079> I'm<00:04:16.320> wondering<00:04:16.859> if<00:04:17.039> my

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
as I'm doing this I'm wondering if my

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.219 
as I'm doing this I'm wondering if my
instructions<00:04:17.699> actually<00:04:17.970> tell<00:04:18.419> you<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.870> do<00:04:19.049> it

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
instructions actually tell you to do it

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.949 
instructions actually tell you to do it
pick<00:04:19.769> up<00:04:19.889> nine<00:04:20.099> in<00:04:20.370> that<00:04:20.400> loop<00:04:20.699> so<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.389> might

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
pick up nine in that loop so you might

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.409 
pick up nine in that loop so you might
have<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.260> go<00:04:22.349> by<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.560> book<00:04:22.830> eight<00:04:23.669> is<00:04:24.000> working

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
have to go by the book eight is working

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.850 
have to go by the book eight is working
perfectly<00:04:24.810> I<00:04:24.900> think<00:04:25.140> if<00:04:25.229> you<00:04:25.349> picked<00:04:25.560> up<00:04:25.620> nine

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
perfectly I think if you picked up nine

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.020 
perfectly I think if you picked up nine
you<00:04:26.219> would<00:04:26.340> end<00:04:26.460> up<00:04:26.550> with<00:04:26.700> four

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
you would end up with four

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.900 
you would end up with four
war<00:04:27.150> beads<00:04:28.040> popping<00:04:29.040> out<00:04:29.160> here<00:04:29.190> instead<00:04:29.730> of

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
war beads popping out here instead of

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.210 
war beads popping out here instead of
just<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.420> three<00:04:30.720> so<00:04:31.110> I<00:04:31.410> think<00:04:31.530> I'm<00:04:31.770> actually

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
just the three so I think I'm actually

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.060 
just the three so I think I'm actually
picking<00:04:32.550> up<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:32.850> wrong<00:04:33.000> number<00:04:33.360> just<00:04:33.570> FYI<00:04:34.070> so

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
picking up the wrong number just FYI so

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.100 
picking up the wrong number just FYI so
you're<00:04:35.580> going<00:04:35.700> to<00:04:35.730> go<00:04:36.030> through<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.300> top<00:04:36.510> five

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
you're going to go through the top five

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.990 
you're going to go through the top five
of<00:04:37.530> the<00:04:37.650> spine<00:04:37.919> beads<00:04:38.220> including<00:04:38.730> that<00:04:38.850> and

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
of the spine beads including that and

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.510 
of the spine beads including that and
brand<00:04:39.300> new<00:04:39.480> one<00:04:39.600> that<00:04:39.750> you<00:04:39.810> just<00:04:39.960> put<00:04:40.169> on

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
brand new one that you just put on

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.280 
brand new one that you just put on
there's<00:04:41.520> your<00:04:41.730> new<00:04:41.850> loop<00:04:42.090> we're<00:04:43.080> going<00:04:43.110> to

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
there's your new loop we're going to

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.879 
there's your new loop we're going to
flip<00:04:44.070> it<00:04:44.100> so<00:04:44.780> that<00:04:45.780> your<00:04:46.200> working<00:04:46.530> thread<00:04:46.710> is

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
flip it so that your working thread is

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.159 
flip it so that your working thread is
coming<00:04:47.040> out<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:47.340> bottom<00:04:47.810> pass<00:04:48.810> through<00:04:49.080> that

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
coming out the bottom pass through that

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:55.310 
coming out the bottom pass through that
first<00:04:49.410> bead<00:04:51.110> pick<00:04:52.110> up<00:04:52.320> one<00:04:53.450> skip<00:04:54.450> one<00:04:54.480> pass

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
first bead pick up one skip one pass

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.710 
first bead pick up one skip one pass
through<00:04:55.350> the<00:04:55.710> next<00:04:55.889> one

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
through the next one

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.720 
through the next one
you're<00:04:57.720> just<00:04:57.840> peyote<00:04:58.260> and<00:04:58.530> up<00:05:01.430> there's<00:05:02.430> the

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
you're just peyote and up there's the

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:08.650 
you're just peyote and up there's the
second<00:05:03.120> bead<00:05:03.680> and<00:05:06.650> there's<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:07.950> third<00:05:08.250> bead

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
second bead and there's the third bead

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.000 
second bead and there's the third bead
this<00:05:09.660> is<00:05:09.870> going<00:05:10.020> to<00:05:10.080> have<00:05:10.290> us<00:05:10.320> I'm<00:05:10.680> going<00:05:10.860> to<00:05:10.919> go

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
this is going to have us I'm going to go

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.920 
this is going to have us I'm going to go
through<00:05:11.250> those<00:05:11.370> last<00:05:11.640> two<00:05:12.030> together<00:05:12.240> like<00:05:13.850> so

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
through those last two together like so

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.969 
through those last two together like so
we<00:05:15.930> can<00:05:16.080> flip<00:05:16.350> it<00:05:16.530> again<00:05:18.080> we<00:05:19.080> can<00:05:19.260> pass<00:05:19.560> through

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
we can flip it again we can pass through

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.990 
we can flip it again we can pass through
those<00:05:20.400> top<00:05:20.700> five<00:05:20.970> spine<00:05:21.479> beads<00:05:21.780> again<00:05:22.850> so<00:05:23.850> this

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
those top five spine beads again so this

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.900 
those top five spine beads again so this
does<00:05:24.210> add<00:05:24.450> an<00:05:24.720> extra<00:05:25.050> pass<00:05:25.290> of<00:05:25.770> your<00:05:26.610> thread

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
does add an extra pass of your thread

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.270 
does add an extra pass of your thread
through<00:05:26.940> the<00:05:27.210> spine<00:05:27.450> beads<00:05:27.720> if<00:05:28.380> you're<00:05:29.100> paying

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
through the spine beads if you're paying

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.390 
through the spine beads if you're paying
attention<00:05:30.320> alright<00:05:31.320> like<00:05:31.680> so<00:05:31.919> let<00:05:32.100> me<00:05:32.190> get<00:05:32.310> the

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
attention alright like so let me get the

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.150 
attention alright like so let me get the
tail<00:05:32.580> out<00:05:32.729> of<00:05:32.760> the<00:05:32.880> way<00:05:33.000> and<00:05:33.290> there's<00:05:34.290> two<00:05:34.740> of

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
tail out of the way and there's two of

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.250 
tail out of the way and there's two of
our<00:05:35.550> loops<00:05:35.790> so<00:05:36.690> you<00:05:36.780> can<00:05:36.900> see<00:05:37.020> how<00:05:37.140> that's

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
our loops so you can see how that's

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.590 
our loops so you can see how that's
really<00:05:37.770> going<00:05:37.919> to<00:05:37.979> pop<00:05:38.190> that<00:05:38.820> color<00:05:39.300> is<00:05:39.510> going

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
really going to pop that color is going

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.060 
really going to pop that color is going
to<00:05:39.690> really<00:05:39.840> pop<00:05:40.110> out<00:05:40.410> they're<00:05:40.740> really

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
to really pop out they're really

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.010 
to really pop out they're really
gorgeously<00:05:41.610> so<00:05:42.210> that's<00:05:42.390> what<00:05:42.690> you're<00:05:42.870> doing

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
gorgeously so that's what you're doing

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.170 
gorgeously so that's what you're doing
when<00:05:43.410> you're<00:05:43.530> doing<00:05:43.919> the<00:05:44.190> dewdrop<00:05:44.520> spiral<00:05:45.000> is

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
when you're doing the dewdrop spiral is

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.719 
when you're doing the dewdrop spiral is
it's<00:05:45.750> just<00:05:45.810> that<00:05:45.960> one<00:05:46.200> extra<00:05:46.380> step<00:05:46.830> everything

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
it's just that one extra step everything

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.480 
it's just that one extra step everything
else<00:05:48.090> is<00:05:48.470> going<00:05:49.470> to<00:05:49.560> be<00:05:49.680> just<00:05:49.890> the<00:05:50.010> same<00:05:50.039> as<00:05:50.250> a

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
else is going to be just the same as a

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.700 
else is going to be just the same as a
regular<00:05:50.729> simple<00:05:51.300> spiral<00:05:51.570> if<00:05:51.900> you<00:05:52.229> need<00:05:52.440> more

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
regular simple spiral if you need more

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.529 
regular simple spiral if you need more
information<00:05:53.039> about<00:05:53.550> a<00:05:53.760> regular<00:05:54.210> simple

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
information about a regular simple

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.140 
information about a regular simple
spiral<00:05:54.780> I<00:05:55.050> do<00:05:55.110> have<00:05:55.410> a<00:05:55.440> video<00:05:55.680> for<00:05:56.550> that<00:05:56.580> and<00:05:57.060> I

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
spiral I do have a video for that and I

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.029 
spiral I do have a video for that and I
will<00:05:57.300> pop<00:05:57.450> a<00:05:57.479> link<00:05:57.780> up<00:05:57.930> for<00:05:57.960> that<00:05:58.260> so<00:05:58.680> if<00:05:58.950> you

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
will pop a link up for that so if you

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:01.610 
will pop a link up for that so if you
want<00:05:59.220> to<00:05:59.310> to<00:05:59.760> kind<00:06:00.030> of<00:06:00.090> get<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.419> more<00:06:01.169> in-depth

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
want to to kind of get the more in-depth

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.969 
want to to kind of get the more in-depth
view<00:06:02.160> of<00:06:02.220> the<00:06:02.820> simple<00:06:03.150> spiral<00:06:03.440> and<00:06:04.440> then<00:06:04.650> this

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
view of the simple spiral and then this

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.940 
view of the simple spiral and then this
is<00:06:05.220> the<00:06:05.430> variation<00:06:05.700> on<00:06:06.150> how<00:06:06.210> to<00:06:06.500> jazz<00:06:07.500> it<00:06:07.740> up<00:06:07.800> a

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
is the variation on how to jazz it up a

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.430 
is the variation on how to jazz it up a
little<00:06:08.100> bit<00:06:08.660> then<00:06:09.660> I've<00:06:09.900> got<00:06:10.050> those<00:06:10.169> both

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
little bit then I've got those both

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.409 
little bit then I've got those both
those<00:06:10.620> videos<00:06:10.950> available<00:06:11.130> for<00:06:11.400> you<00:06:11.669> so<00:06:12.180> I<00:06:12.210> hope
