minutes to talk about the symptoms of a
concussion<00:00:56.300> now<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> concussion<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.760> viewed<00:00:59.760> as

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
concussion now a concussion is viewed as

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.569 
concussion now a concussion is viewed as
a<00:01:00.149> form<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.109> mild<00:01:01.410> traumatic<00:01:01.620> brain<00:01:01.949> injury

other video podcasts you've heard me say

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.899 
other video podcasts you've heard me say
on<00:01:09.000> more<00:01:09.630> than<00:01:09.720> one<00:01:09.900> occasion<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.909> there

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
on more than one occasion that there

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.370 
on more than one occasion that there
really<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.240> no<00:01:12.420> such<00:01:12.659> thing<00:01:12.900> as<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> mild

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
really is no such thing as a mild

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.499 
really is no such thing as a mild
traumatic<00:01:13.650> brain<00:01:13.950> injury<00:01:14.640> there's<00:01:15.000> traumatic

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
traumatic brain injury there's traumatic

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.630 
traumatic brain injury there's traumatic
brain<00:01:15.780> injury<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.530> there's<00:01:17.040> nothing<00:01:17.400> ever

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
brain injury and there's nothing ever

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.690 
brain injury and there's nothing ever
mild<00:01:18.060> about<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.780> as<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.470> go<00:01:19.680> through<00:01:19.979> these

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
mild about it and as we go through these

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460 
mild about it and as we go through these
podcasts<00:01:21.060> you're<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.990> learn<00:01:22.140> why

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
podcasts you're going to learn why

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.039 
podcasts you're going to learn why
because<00:01:22.950> even<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.820> smallest<00:01:24.150> brain<00:01:24.600> injury

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
because even the smallest brain injury

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.920 
because even the smallest brain injury
can<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.680> huge<00:01:26.549> consequences<00:01:26.750> for<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
can have huge consequences for the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.920 
can have huge consequences for the
person<00:01:28.380> who's<00:01:28.560> suffering<00:01:28.740> from<00:01:29.159> brain<00:01:29.460> injury

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
person who's suffering from brain injury

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.330 
person who's suffering from brain injury
so<00:01:31.460> concussion<00:01:32.460> typically<00:01:33.409> involves<00:01:34.409> in

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
so concussion typically involves in

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.219 
so concussion typically involves in
terms<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.119> how<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.450> historically<00:01:36.780> been

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
terms of how it's historically been

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.039 
terms of how it's historically been
viewed<00:01:37.530> loss<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.310> consciousness<00:01:38.869> for<00:01:39.869> less

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
viewed loss of consciousness for less

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.899 
viewed loss of consciousness for less
than<00:01:40.259> 30<00:01:40.560> minutes<00:01:41.150> now<00:01:43.460> don't<00:01:44.460> be<00:01:44.640> fooled

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
than 30 minutes now don't be fooled

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.440 
than 30 minutes now don't be fooled
though<00:01:45.270> by<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:46.909> requirement<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.060> there<00:01:48.240> be<00:01:48.299> a

because there wasn't a noted loss of

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
concussion but when concussion is viewed

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
minutes all that is doing is identifying

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.990 
minutes all that is doing is identifying
that<00:02:06.030> there's<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.329> differentiation<00:02:07.020> between

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
that there's a differentiation between

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.300 
that there's a differentiation between
the<00:02:09.000> categorization<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:10.160> certain<00:02:11.160> brain

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
the categorization of certain brain

the categorization of certain brain
injuries<00:02:11.970> where<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.569> loss<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.930> conscious

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
injuries where the loss of conscious

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.670 
injuries where the loss of conscious
was<00:02:13.760> less<00:02:14.030> than<00:02:14.240> 30<00:02:14.480> minutes<00:02:14.660> versus<00:02:15.260> more

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
was less than 30 minutes versus more

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.160 
was less than 30 minutes versus more
than<00:02:15.890> 30<00:02:16.160> minutes<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:17.600> other<00:02:17.750> thing<00:02:18.140> that

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
than 30 minutes the other thing that

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.230 
than 30 minutes the other thing that
needs<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.860> be<00:02:19.010> noted<00:02:19.370> is<00:02:19.460> it's<00:02:19.640> not<00:02:19.790> just<00:02:19.850> loss

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
needs to be noted is it's not just loss

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.100 
needs to be noted is it's not just loss
of<00:02:20.450> consciousness<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:22.190> is<00:02:22.460> also<00:02:23.090> level<00:02:23.990> of

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
of consciousness it is also level of

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.020 
of consciousness it is also level of
consciousness<00:02:24.770> so<00:02:25.130> if<00:02:25.250> there's<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.490> decreased

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
consciousness so if there's a decreased

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.060 
consciousness so if there's a decreased
level<00:02:26.270> of<00:02:26.720> consciousness<00:02:26.990> in<00:02:27.650> other<00:02:27.800> words

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
level of consciousness in other words

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.300 
level of consciousness in other words
