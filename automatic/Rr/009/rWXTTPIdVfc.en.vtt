00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.280
 but since it has its card 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.420
 capture the worst we're going to do good 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.600
 The first thing I'm going to do is 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.490
 to show 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.180
 the error that marks when you connect 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.180
 directly your playstation 3 to your 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.180
 computer 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.080
 this already connect the two I'm going to open 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.080
 the program 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.530
 I'm going to give you a record 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.530
 and I get the following error that says 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.900
 the program is protected and its 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.210
 content can not be recorded 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.830
 is the famous hcp that has been the 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.090
 protection in own word that has 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.989
 playstation3 then 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.090
 to pass this protection we are going to 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.640
 can do now 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.990
 in this case I'm going to use the 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.990
 converter that I have here 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.070
 I'm going to disconnect the cable that I have 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.620
 direct 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.630
 fucking mother command out there 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.630
 connect the HDMI cable 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:35.140
 that goes from the playstation 3 the converter 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.140
 the converter of an hdmi converter 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.159
 which has two entries has several 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.810
 but in this case we use the hdmi to the baby 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.659
 and that is going to transport just the pure 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.310
 video and the optical cable that is going to 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:51.870
 transport playstation3 audio 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.260
 has the being practically 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:58.500
 these two this hdmi goes for the 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:02.710
 computer n gets the signal already without 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.930
 Video and audio protection 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.869
 let's remove this one also from here and 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:12.509
 let's connect the cable that already has 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.509
 and to which it already carries the protection 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:20.020
 let's try to see 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.020
 now they tell us when they try to record 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.810
 we give him to record and practically already 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.680
 is recording we did not get any 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.780
 message already let us record directly 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.980
 up there to the left and we 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.250
 shows the red circle that is 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.250
 recording 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.079
 and so you can record your highlights 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.079
 definitions with the one you want so
