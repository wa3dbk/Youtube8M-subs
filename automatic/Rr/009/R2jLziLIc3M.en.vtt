00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.129
 this morning to all and to all that is 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.839
 captain chop of the french army zone is 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.780
 today down I want a little video 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.490
 which had no place at the base but 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:24.269
 but here I am relatively done 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:27.099
 attack by one by a moderator so 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.359
 so here I am stupidly I 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.640
 sent the small recruitment message 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.080
 usual 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.850
 so that's it for chips and join 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.480
 youtube channel so with absolutely had 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.440
 no connection and I had small 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.930
 threats from a moderator 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:46.149
 so so here's his message I had done 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.370
 a little screen and so that's it 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.780
 apparently we do not have the right so 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.250
 I had heard about it but I 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.750
 did not think it's a rigorous one 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.460
 does not have the right to speak ring of 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.660
 talk about youtube either in a 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.460
 recruitment in the trade 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.720
 whether it's football or bullshit 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.860
 like that it's the same it's forbidden 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.560
 so here it is just a place 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.530
 to discuss we were born here 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.080
 it does not appear to me the right to 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.330
 the ad and so that was who sent me 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.370
 a message this message copy them paste 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.350
 I 'm going into recruiting a 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.880
 mercy forgiveness and groan is there way 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.860
 to answer and that's how I get 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.010
 am here 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.990
 so here's a nice reminder about 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.300
 the rails regarding advertising towards 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.380
 a third site 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.740
 so here's how prince is forbidden 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.740
 speak of it 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.760
 this is the moderator is called who hated 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.830
 so here is this very rigorous moderator 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.150
 on the rules his petition nor so there 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.530
 down as usual we are on server 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:47.650
 shackles so here I would say we are 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.600
 on sunday april 7 that out of seven during 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.550
 at least two weeks 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.140
 he strongly advises against talking 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.940
 something else because you risk 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.330
 the other same place as me maybe 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.330
 even to banish you so 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:08.180
 so that's just stupidly he farted 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.180
 a little a lead not much 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.970
 I remember just happy by the anthem and 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.680
 the point of tools whose message 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.709
 while at the mayor so here is the fuss 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.690
 lead on his part here send me in 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.130
 so then obviously that's 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.870
 absolutely him no control in front of a 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.670
 computer 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.239
 we sent his message I clicked on 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.489
 acropolis 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.670
 bmes direct it made me as if the 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:37.080
 price for reminder I ended up here 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:41.340
 So here we have this good day in him 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:45.470
 saying that his ca will reproduce more so 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.470
 here it is a little abused but brief 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.510
 so that's it so here's this little 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.380
 video one ends that you could see 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.980
 than 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.290
 how small a moderators are 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.510
 broken in your momentum but we have not 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.640
 the choice we make with we can send 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.810
 sure 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.270
 prison instruments no longer there 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.940
 do so so here I hope this 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.220
 video i will not say you liked it here 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.710
 that you still liked 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.820
 follow and bassist and the cabba then on 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.500
 the little green thumb and if you want 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.110
 continue to follow we have duration our 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.460
 setbacks as we have seen and 20 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.460
 subscribe to our these gentlemen
