to page three turn to page three it says
gacho<00:00:20.210> point<00:00:21.210> being<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.680> we<00:00:22.680> all<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.550> a

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
gacho point being that we all have a

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.339 
gacho point being that we all have a
basic<00:00:25.920> awareness<00:00:26.689> that<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:27.990> are<00:00:28.019> making

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
basic awareness that we are making

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.089 
basic awareness that we are making
decisions<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.039> are<00:00:29.519> ours<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:31.560> we<00:00:31.859> have

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
decisions that are ours and that we have

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.040 
decisions that are ours and that we have
at<00:00:32.460> least<00:00:32.610> some<00:00:32.910> significant<00:00:33.540> measure<00:00:33.840> of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
at least some significant measure of

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.990 
at least some significant measure of
freedom<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.890> question<00:00:35.309> really<00:00:35.460> becomes<00:00:35.790> is

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
freedom the question really becomes is

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.549 
freedom the question really becomes is
how<00:00:36.180> does<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.420> play<00:00:36.690> into<00:00:36.719> theological

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
how does this play into theological

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.440 
how does this play into theological
issues<00:00:37.890> because<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.820> one<00:00:39.000> hand<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.420> have

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
issues because in the one hand you have

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.030 
issues because in the one hand you have
the<00:00:39.690> reform<00:00:40.050> point<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.379> view<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.649> says<00:00:40.860> God

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the reform point of view that says God

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.850 
the reform point of view that says God
chooses<00:00:41.579> us<00:00:41.899> the<00:00:42.899> other<00:00:43.079> hand<00:00:43.350> people<00:00:43.620> will

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
chooses us the other hand people will

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.020 
chooses us the other hand people will
point<00:00:44.070> out<00:00:44.190> what<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.460> scripture<00:00:44.820> says<00:00:44.850> that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
point out what the scripture says that

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.619 
point out what the scripture says that
we<00:00:45.210> should<00:00:45.539> choose<00:00:45.780> God<00:00:46.250> so<00:00:47.250> how<00:00:48.180> does<00:00:48.239> all

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
we should choose God so how does all

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.119 
we should choose God so how does all
this<00:00:48.809> work<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.350> if<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.590> believe<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:49.860> God

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
this work and if you believe that God

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.209 
this work and if you believe that God
chooses<00:00:50.430> us<00:00:50.820> then<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.690> somehow<00:00:52.440> seems<00:00:52.980> to

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
chooses us then that somehow seems to

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.990 
chooses us then that somehow seems to
deny<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:54.390> concept<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.960> free<00:00:55.649> choice<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.699> our

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
deny the concept of free choice on our

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.229 
deny the concept of free choice on our
part<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:58.039> let<00:00:59.039> me<00:00:59.129> lay<00:00:59.280> some<00:00:59.520> foundation<00:00:59.550> for

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
part so let me lay some foundation for

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.790 
part so let me lay some foundation for
you<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.629> can<00:01:00.809> think<00:01:01.109> about<00:01:01.199> how<00:01:01.379> this

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
you so you can think about how this

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.789 
you so you can think about how this
works<00:01:02.010> together<00:01:02.219> with<00:01:02.489> your<00:01:02.760> individual

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
works together with your individual

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.289 
works together with your individual
theology<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:05.369> almost<00:01:05.580> never<00:01:05.820> happens<00:01:06.210> in

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
theology what almost never happens in

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.990 
theology what almost never happens in
these<00:01:06.450> conversations<00:01:07.170> about<00:01:08.000> predestination

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
these conversations about predestination

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.969 
these conversations about predestination
and<00:01:09.270> free<00:01:09.600> will<00:01:09.780> at<00:01:10.049> least<00:01:10.140> theological

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
and free will at least theological

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.010 
and free will at least theological
predestination<00:01:11.640> salvation<00:01:12.330> etc<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.869> free

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
predestination salvation etc and free

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.580 
predestination salvation etc and free
will<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.470> what<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:14.189> free<00:01:14.520> well<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.500> there<00:01:16.500> are

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
will is what is free well and there are

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.859 
will is what is free well and there are
basically<00:01:16.920> three<00:01:17.790> different<00:01:17.820> categories<00:01:18.330> I'm

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
basically three different categories I'm

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:19.850 
basically three different categories I'm
going<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.049> tell<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.320> right<00:01:19.470> now<00:01:19.530> I'm<00:01:19.830> not

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
going to tell you right now I'm not

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.469 
going to tell you right now I'm not
satisfied<00:01:20.250> with<00:01:20.820> these<00:01:20.939> classical

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
satisfied with these classical

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.359 
satisfied with these classical
categories<00:01:22.049> but<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.290> don't<00:01:22.500> have<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.680> fourth<00:01:23.100> and

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
categories but I don't have a fourth and

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.969 
categories but I don't have a fourth and
I'm<00:01:23.970> probably<00:01:24.150> not<00:01:24.360> smart<00:01:24.750> enough<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.590> pass

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
I'm probably not smart enough to to pass

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.649 
I'm probably not smart enough to to pass
one<00:01:26.310> out<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.700> I'll<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:26.970> give<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.360> three

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
one out so I'll just give you the three

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.569 
one out so I'll just give you the three
that<00:01:27.869> are<00:01:27.979> characteristically<00:01:28.979> part<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.460> this

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
that are characteristically part of this

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.990 
that are characteristically part of this
conversation<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.869> first<00:01:30.900> category<00:01:31.530> is

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
conversation the first category is

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.120 
conversation the first category is
determinism<00:01:33.259> determinism

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
determinism determinism

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.010 
determinism determinism
it's<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.700> picture<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> bunch<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.570> dominoes

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
it's just picture a bunch of dominoes

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.859 
it's just picture a bunch of dominoes
falling<00:01:37.320> all<00:01:37.650> their<00:01:38.490> events<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.570> are<00:01:39.659> caused

apart from consciousness you have a

apart from consciousness you have a

deterministic set of events and if you

deterministic set of events and if you
set<00:01:52.710> up<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.009> dominoes<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.060> exactly<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.720> same

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
set up the dominoes in exactly the same

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.899 
set up the dominoes in exactly the same
way<00:01:55.110> they're<00:01:55.320> going<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.500> fall<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.100> exactly<00:01:56.700> the

way they're going to fall in exactly the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
same way every single time because they

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.050 
same way every single time because they

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
are determined based on the physical

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.609 
are determined based on the physical
setup<00:02:03.360> that's<00:02:03.630> why<00:02:03.750> science<00:02:04.110> works<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.530> way

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
setup that's why science works the way

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.929 
setup that's why science works the way
it<00:02:04.710> does<00:02:04.770> that's<00:02:05.130> why<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.640> could<00:02:05.790> have

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
it does that's why you could have

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.789 
it does that's why you could have
scientific<00:02:06.780> repeatability

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
scientific repeatability

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.520 
scientific repeatability
so<00:02:08.039> that's<00:02:08.250> determinism<00:02:09.119> no<00:02:09.750> choices<00:02:10.319> are

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
so that's determinism no choices are

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.919 
so that's determinism no choices are
made

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
made

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.580 
made
of<00:02:10.989> any<00:02:11.170> kind<00:02:11.430> things<00:02:12.430> just<00:02:12.700> happened<00:02:13.590> then

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
of any kind things just happened then

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.380 
of any kind things just happened then
you<00:02:14.680> have<00:02:14.829> freedom<00:02:15.189> it<00:02:15.790> turns<00:02:16.030> out<00:02:16.150> there<00:02:16.329> are

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
you have freedom it turns out there are

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.970 
you have freedom it turns out there are
two<00:02:16.420> different<00:02:16.810> types<00:02:17.019> of<00:02:17.260> freedom<00:02:17.650> two

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
two different types of freedom two

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.910 
two different types of freedom two
different<00:02:18.219> ways<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.549> defining<00:02:18.700> freedom<00:02:19.390> and

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
different ways of defining freedom and

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.979 
different ways of defining freedom and
these<00:02:20.920> are<00:02:21.159> important<00:02:21.730> depending<00:02:22.030> on<00:02:22.359> how

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
these are important depending on how

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.259 
these are important depending on how
your<00:02:23.590> theology<00:02:23.980> goes<00:02:24.579> so<00:02:24.819> let<00:02:24.969> me<00:02:25.030> give<00:02:25.180> you

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
your theology goes so let me give you

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.209 
your theology goes so let me give you
the<00:02:25.359> first<00:02:25.540> one<00:02:25.810> because<00:02:26.560> both<00:02:26.799> definitions

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:27.219 
the first one because both definitions

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:29.099 
the first one because both definitions
trade<00:02:27.730> on<00:02:27.909> basic<00:02:28.209> intuitions<00:02:28.659> that<00:02:28.719> we<00:02:28.930> have

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:29.109 
trade on basic intuitions that we have

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:30.959 
trade on basic intuitions that we have
about<00:02:29.769> what<00:02:29.980> it's<00:02:30.129> like<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.549> make<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.730> free

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:30.969 
about what it's like to make a free

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:32.640 
about what it's like to make a free
choice<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.569> first<00:02:31.719> definition<00:02:32.319> of<00:02:32.439> freedom

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
choice the first definition of freedom

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.890 
choice the first definition of freedom
is<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:34.120> do<00:02:35.109> what<00:02:35.409> you<00:02:35.530> want<00:02:36.269> your<00:02:37.269> choice<00:02:37.569> is

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
is you do what you want your choice is

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.309 
is you do what you want your choice is
free<00:02:38.230> if<00:02:38.889> you<00:02:39.370> are<00:02:39.670> doing<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.599> choosing<00:02:41.079> and

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
free if you are doing the choosing and

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.899 
free if you are doing the choosing and
you're<00:02:41.680> doing<00:02:41.859> what<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:42.430> want<00:02:42.670> you're<00:02:42.879> not

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
you're doing what you want you're not

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:47.640 
you're doing what you want you're not
being<00:02:43.269> forced<00:02:43.720> by<00:02:44.200> some<00:02:45.030> exterior<00:02:46.030> thing<00:02:46.989> that

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
being forced by some exterior thing that

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.190 
being forced by some exterior thing that
causes<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.519> to<00:02:48.549> do<00:02:48.909> what<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:49.269> do<00:02:49.450> instead<00:02:49.870> you

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
causes you to do what you do instead you

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.190 
causes you to do what you do instead you
just<00:02:50.579> choose<00:02:51.579> it<00:02:51.790> it's<00:02:52.569> your<00:02:52.689> choice

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
just choose it it's your choice

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.349 
just choose it it's your choice
fine<00:02:53.590> most<00:02:54.129> people<00:02:54.459> think<00:02:54.639> that's<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.180> pretty

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
fine most people think that's a pretty

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.159 
fine most people think that's a pretty
good<00:02:55.629> way<00:02:56.469> of<00:02:56.680> characterizing<00:02:58.049> freedom<00:02:59.049> of

00:02:59.159 --> 00:02:59.169 
good way of characterizing freedom of

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.459 
good way of characterizing freedom of
the<00:02:59.260> will<00:02:59.379> we<00:03:00.090> exercise<00:03:01.090> our<00:03:01.299> will<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.810> if<00:03:02.290> we

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:02.469 
the will we exercise our will and if we

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:05.270 
the will we exercise our will and if we
can<00:03:02.650> do<00:03:02.799> what<00:03:03.040> we<00:03:03.250> want<00:03:03.519> then<00:03:03.849> our<00:03:04.000> act<00:03:04.239> is<00:03:04.480> free

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
can do what we want then our act is free

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.429 
can do what we want then our act is free
now<00:03:06.280> some<00:03:06.639> are<00:03:06.879> not<00:03:07.120> satisfied<00:03:07.870> with<00:03:07.900> that<00:03:08.260> and

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439 
now some are not satisfied with that and

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.110 
now some are not satisfied with that and
their<00:03:08.530> reasons<00:03:08.950> for<00:03:09.040> this<00:03:09.310> they<00:03:09.549> want<00:03:09.760> to<00:03:09.849> add

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
their reasons for this they want to add

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.709 
their reasons for this they want to add
another<00:03:10.810> condition<00:03:11.469> that<00:03:11.709> is<00:03:12.340> freedom<00:03:13.239> of<00:03:13.480> the

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:13.719 
another condition that is freedom of the

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:17.460 
another condition that is freedom of the
will<00:03:14.010> entails<00:03:15.010> much<00:03:15.790> of<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.060> time<00:03:16.269> doing<00:03:17.049> what

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
will entails much of the time doing what

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.349 
will entails much of the time doing what
you<00:03:17.680> want<00:03:18.010> but<00:03:18.310> it<00:03:18.459> also<00:03:18.729> needs<00:03:19.359> to<00:03:19.599> entail<00:03:20.229> the

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
you want but it also needs to entail the

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.979 
you want but it also needs to entail the
possibility<00:03:22.359> of<00:03:22.540> doing<00:03:23.199> something<00:03:23.949> else<00:03:24.989> it

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
possibility of doing something else it

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.069 
possibility of doing something else it
could<00:03:26.319> be<00:03:26.349> that<00:03:26.739> you<00:03:27.669> you<00:03:27.970> are<00:03:28.180> doing<00:03:28.599> what<00:03:28.840> you

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
could be that you you are doing what you

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.250 
could be that you you are doing what you
want<00:03:29.379> but<00:03:29.590> if<00:03:29.709> you<00:03:29.829> have<00:03:30.040> no<00:03:30.609> real<00:03:31.419> possibility

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
want but if you have no real possibility

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.339 
want but if you have no real possibility
of<00:03:32.439> doing<00:03:32.680> some<00:03:32.889> other<00:03:33.549> thing<00:03:33.970> instead<00:03:34.689> then

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
of doing some other thing instead then

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.219 
of doing some other thing instead then
that's<00:03:35.560> not<00:03:35.799> considered<00:03:36.340> real<00:03:37.299> freedom<00:03:37.599> so

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:38.229 
that's not considered real freedom so

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:41.699 
that's not considered real freedom so
this<00:03:38.859> idea<00:03:39.159> of<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.989> could<00:03:41.349> have<00:03:41.500> done

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
this idea of you could have done

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.189 
this idea of you could have done
otherwise<00:03:42.400> is<00:03:42.939> a<00:03:43.000> condition<00:03:43.750> that<00:03:43.780> many

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:44.199 
otherwise is a condition that many

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:45.960 
otherwise is a condition that many
people<00:03:44.470> will<00:03:44.739> add<00:03:44.949> to<00:03:45.159> freedom<00:03:45.549> it's<00:03:45.699> called

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
people will add to freedom it's called

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.689 
people will add to freedom it's called
the<00:03:46.479> CEO<00:03:46.720> condition<00:03:47.500> this<00:03:47.699> couldn't

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
the CEO condition this couldn't

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:51.869 
the CEO condition this couldn't
unauthorized<00:03:49.859> condition<00:03:50.859> and<00:03:51.069> if<00:03:51.459> you<00:03:51.699> are

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
unauthorized condition and if you are

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.659 
unauthorized condition and if you are
doing<00:03:52.329> what<00:03:52.509> you<00:03:52.689> want<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.229> you<00:03:54.129> could<00:03:54.489> have

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
doing what you want and you could have

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:58.830 
doing what you want and you could have
done<00:03:55.169> otherwise<00:03:57.150> that<00:03:58.150> is<00:03:58.329> a<00:03:58.359> more<00:03:58.659> refined

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
done otherwise that is a more refined

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.960 
done otherwise that is a more refined
understanding<00:03:59.409> of<00:04:00.099> freedom<00:04:00.310> so<00:04:00.639> let's<00:04:00.819> give

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
understanding of freedom so let's give

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.490 
understanding of freedom so let's give
these<00:04:01.120> names<00:04:01.419> just<00:04:01.750> for<00:04:01.989> the<00:04:02.049> sake<00:04:02.229> of<00:04:02.259> clarity

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
these names just for the sake of clarity

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.119 
these names just for the sake of clarity
so<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.310> have<00:04:03.459> determinism<00:04:04.290> then<00:04:05.290> you<00:04:05.470> have<00:04:05.739> on

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
so you have determinism then you have on

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.479 
so you have determinism then you have on
the<00:04:06.549> other<00:04:06.699> end<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:07.359> have<00:04:08.290> doing<00:04:09.189> what<00:04:09.340> you

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
the other end you have doing what you

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.219 
the other end you have doing what you
want<00:04:09.729> and<00:04:09.939> you<00:04:10.299> could<00:04:10.540> have<00:04:10.659> done<00:04:10.720> otherwise

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:11.229 
want and you could have done otherwise

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:12.899 
want and you could have done otherwise
that<00:04:11.560> seems<00:04:11.829> like<00:04:12.040> a<00:04:12.069> very<00:04:12.189> robust

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
that seems like a very robust

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.240 
that seems like a very robust
understanding<00:04:13.180> of<00:04:13.780> freedom<00:04:14.259> and<00:04:15.099> that's

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
understanding of freedom and that's

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.310 
understanding of freedom and that's
called<00:04:15.519> libertarian<00:04:16.329> freedom<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:16.930> then<00:04:17.229> you

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
called libertarian freedom and then you

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.199 
called libertarian freedom and then you
have<00:04:17.470> this<00:04:17.590> hybrid<00:04:17.919> in<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.370> middle<00:04:18.639> that

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
have this hybrid in the middle that

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.319 
have this hybrid in the middle that
you're<00:04:19.329> doing<00:04:19.570> what<00:04:19.900> you<00:04:20.019> want

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
you're doing what you want

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.140 
you're doing what you want
but<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:21.900> couldn't<00:04:22.229> have<00:04:22.349> done<00:04:22.590> otherwise

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
but you couldn't have done otherwise

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.960 
but you couldn't have done otherwise
that<00:04:24.150> is<00:04:24.419> your<00:04:25.259> wants<00:04:25.770> are<00:04:25.919> determined<00:04:26.849> by

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
that is your wants are determined by

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.790 
that is your wants are determined by
other<00:04:27.180> things<00:04:27.539> even<00:04:28.199> though<00:04:28.319> you're<00:04:28.500> choosing

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
other things even though you're choosing

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.320 
other things even though you're choosing
what<00:04:28.919> you<00:04:28.949> want<00:04:29.069> to<00:04:29.430> do<00:04:29.610> your<00:04:29.969> wants

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
what you want to do your wants

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.290 
what you want to do your wants
themselves<00:04:30.930> are<00:04:31.110> determined<00:04:32.090> maybe<00:04:33.090> they're

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
themselves are determined maybe they're

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.010 
themselves are determined maybe they're
determined<00:04:33.840> by<00:04:34.080> a<00:04:34.110> fallen<00:04:34.560> nature<00:04:35.389> maybe<00:04:36.389> when

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
determined by a fallen nature maybe when

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.320 
determined by a fallen nature maybe when
you<00:04:37.139> sin<00:04:37.530> you're<00:04:37.889> doing<00:04:38.250> what<00:04:38.430> you<00:04:38.610> want<00:04:38.909> but

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
you sin you're doing what you want but

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.119 
you sin you're doing what you want but
you<00:04:39.479> it's<00:04:39.930> not<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.139> case<00:04:40.469> that<00:04:40.500> you<00:04:40.860> could

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:41.129 
you it's not the case that you could

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:42.550 
you it's not the case that you could
have<00:04:41.310> done<00:04:41.340> otherwise

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
have done otherwise

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.260 
have done otherwise
maybe<00:04:43.560> when<00:04:43.949> you<00:04:44.189> are<00:04:44.490> eating<00:04:44.639> chocolate<00:04:45.180> ice

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
maybe when you are eating chocolate ice

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.420 
maybe when you are eating chocolate ice
cream<00:04:45.300> you're<00:04:45.750> doing<00:04:46.050> what<00:04:46.229> you<00:04:46.379> want<00:04:46.650> but

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
cream you're doing what you want but

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.920 
cream you're doing what you want but
just<00:04:47.669> to<00:04:47.789> be<00:04:47.879> belligerent<00:04:48.180> you<00:04:48.659> could<00:04:48.840> eat

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
just to be belligerent you could eat

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.040 
just to be belligerent you could eat
mustard<00:04:49.580> if<00:04:50.580> you<00:04:50.789> wanted<00:04:51.090> if<00:04:51.360> you<00:04:51.449> chose<00:04:52.020> to

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
mustard if you wanted if you chose to

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.110 
mustard if you wanted if you chose to
not<00:04:52.770> if<00:04:52.889> you<00:04:52.979> wanted<00:04:53.280> to<00:04:53.400> you<00:04:53.669> don't<00:04:53.819> want<00:04:53.969> to

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
not if you wanted to you don't want to

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.939 
not if you wanted to you don't want to
but<00:04:54.300> you<00:04:54.330> could<00:04:54.569> choose<00:04:54.810> to<00:04:55.050> so<00:04:55.560> you<00:04:55.620> could

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
but you could choose to so you could

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:57.709 
but you could choose to so you could
have<00:04:56.069> done<00:04:56.219> otherwise<00:04:56.550> and<00:04:56.789> so<00:04:56.819> there<00:04:57.090> you<00:04:57.569> can

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:57.719 
have done otherwise and so there you can

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:59.920 
have done otherwise and so there you can
see<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.050> different<00:04:58.409> variations<00:04:59.159> of<00:04:59.340> these

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
see the different variations of these

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.869 
see the different variations of these
senses<00:05:00.930> of<00:05:01.080> freedom<00:05:01.469> now<00:05:02.069> I<00:05:02.099> actually<00:05:02.400> believe

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:02.879 
senses of freedom now I actually believe

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:05.270 
senses of freedom now I actually believe
that<00:05:02.909> all<00:05:03.270> things<00:05:03.659> are<00:05:03.930> an<00:05:04.050> operation<00:05:04.650> that

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
that all things are an operation that

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.379 
that all things are an operation that
there<00:05:05.460> are<00:05:05.550> some<00:05:05.759> things<00:05:06.030> that<00:05:06.270> are

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
there are some things that are

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.990 
there are some things that are
determined<00:05:06.930> that<00:05:07.080> is<00:05:07.259> our<00:05:07.469> molecules<00:05:08.400> are

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
determined that is our molecules are

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.029 
determined that is our molecules are
like<00:05:09.060> dominoes<00:05:09.810> falling<00:05:10.259> in<00:05:10.500> a<00:05:10.590> certain<00:05:10.919> way

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
like dominoes falling in a certain way

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.649 
like dominoes falling in a certain way
according<00:05:11.490> to<00:05:11.610> their<00:05:11.729> chemistry<00:05:12.150> and<00:05:12.300> natural

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:12.659 
according to their chemistry and natural

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:13.999 
according to their chemistry and natural
law<00:05:12.810> and<00:05:12.960> we<00:05:13.080> don't<00:05:13.229> make<00:05:13.289> any<00:05:13.469> decisions

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
law and we don't make any decisions

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:15.980 
law and we don't make any decisions
about<00:05:14.129> those<00:05:14.430> kinds<00:05:14.849> of<00:05:14.909> things<00:05:15.150> there<00:05:15.870> are

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
about those kinds of things there are

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.200 
about those kinds of things there are
other<00:05:16.110> things<00:05:16.409> that<00:05:16.650> I<00:05:17.129> seem<00:05:17.879> to<00:05:18.060> make

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
other things that I seem to make

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.519 
other things that I seem to make
decisions<00:05:18.719> on<00:05:18.900> and<00:05:19.110> I<00:05:19.169> could<00:05:19.379> have<00:05:19.469> done

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:19.529 
decisions on and I could have done

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:21.080 
decisions on and I could have done
otherwise<00:05:19.889> so<00:05:20.310> I<00:05:20.340> believe<00:05:20.729> that<00:05:20.909> there<00:05:21.060> are

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
otherwise so I believe that there are

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.559 
otherwise so I believe that there are
libertarian<00:05:22.009> freedoms<00:05:23.009> that<00:05:23.129> we<00:05:23.430> have<00:05:23.569> when

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:24.569 
libertarian freedoms that we have when

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:26.330 
libertarian freedoms that we have when
we're<00:05:24.750> trying<00:05:24.900> to<00:05:25.289> make<00:05:25.800> decisions<00:05:26.279> about

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
we're trying to make decisions about

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.779 
we're trying to make decisions about
things<00:05:27.020> but<00:05:28.020> there<00:05:28.139> also<00:05:28.289> seemed<00:05:28.770> to<00:05:28.889> me<00:05:29.039> and

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
things but there also seemed to me and

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:31.339 
things but there also seemed to me and
then<00:05:30.000> you<00:05:30.029> can<00:05:30.300> decide<00:05:30.509> for<00:05:30.659> yourself<00:05:31.020> on<00:05:31.199> this

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
then you can decide for yourself on this

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:32.719 
then you can decide for yourself on this
that<00:05:31.560> there<00:05:31.650> are<00:05:31.770> some<00:05:31.949> things<00:05:32.250> that<00:05:32.430> I<00:05:32.580> do

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
that there are some things that I do

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:34.730 
that there are some things that I do
because<00:05:33.240> I<00:05:33.270> want<00:05:33.599> to<00:05:33.750> do<00:05:33.960> them<00:05:34.199> but<00:05:34.349> I<00:05:34.409> I

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
because I want to do them but I I

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.100 
because I want to do them but I I
couldn't<00:05:35.430> have<00:05:35.520> done<00:05:35.610> otherwise<00:05:36.000> I<00:05:36.389> don't

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
couldn't have done otherwise I don't

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.689 
couldn't have done otherwise I don't
think<00:05:37.289> it's<00:05:37.560> possible<00:05:38.069> for<00:05:38.219> us<00:05:38.310> to<00:05:38.520> live<00:05:38.669> a

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
think it's possible for us to live a

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:44.019 
think it's possible for us to live a
sinless<00:05:38.940> life<00:05:39.120> why<00:05:39.569> I<00:05:39.810> I<00:05:40.729> seem<00:05:41.729> to<00:05:42.139> want<00:05:43.139> to<00:05:43.259> sin

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029 
sinless life why I I seem to want to sin

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:47.839 
sinless life why I I seem to want to sin
and<00:05:45.029> sometimes<00:05:45.779> I<00:05:45.930> want<00:05:46.110> to<00:05:46.229> do<00:05:46.409> right<00:05:46.849> but

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
and sometimes I want to do right but

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.839 
and sometimes I want to do right but
even<00:05:48.210> when<00:05:48.389> I<00:05:48.419> want<00:05:49.349> to<00:05:49.500> sin<00:05:49.740> and<00:05:49.919> I<00:05:49.979> do<00:05:50.039> the

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
even when I want to sin and I do the

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:54.290 
even when I want to sin and I do the
sinful<00:05:51.300> things<00:05:51.569> these<00:05:52.469> are<00:05:52.800> things<00:05:53.159> that<00:05:53.400> are

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
sinful things these are things that are

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.110 
sinful things these are things that are
to<00:05:55.199> some<00:05:55.379> degree<00:05:55.409> dictated<00:05:56.159> by<00:05:56.310> my<00:05:56.339> nature

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
to some degree dictated by my nature

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.510 
to some degree dictated by my nature
now<00:05:57.690> how<00:05:57.900> it<00:05:58.080> all<00:05:58.199> plays<00:05:58.500> out<00:05:58.710> in<00:05:58.860> our<00:05:58.919> theology

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
now how it all plays out in our theology

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.959 
now how it all plays out in our theology
is<00:05:59.669> a<00:05:59.699> complex<00:06:00.300> kind<00:06:00.719> of<00:06:00.870> notion<00:06:01.669> but<00:06:02.669> when

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:02.969 
is a complex kind of notion but when

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.240 
is a complex kind of notion but when
you're<00:06:03.180> addressing<00:06:04.080> the<00:06:04.500> question<00:06:04.919> of<00:06:05.039> free

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
you're addressing the question of free

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.939 
you're addressing the question of free
will<00:06:05.460> think<00:06:05.909> of<00:06:06.060> these<00:06:06.210> different<00:06:06.629> categories

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:06.949 
will think of these different categories

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:13.579 
will think of these different categories
strict<00:06:08.750> determinism<00:06:11.659> strict<00:06:12.659> libertarian

00:06:13.579 --> 00:06:13.589 
strict determinism strict libertarian

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:15.409 
strict determinism strict libertarian
freedom<00:06:14.009> and<00:06:14.219> then<00:06:14.400> right<00:06:14.610> in<00:06:14.789> the<00:06:14.849> middle<00:06:14.909> I

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 
freedom and then right in the middle I

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:16.969 
freedom and then right in the middle I
don't<00:06:15.779> think<00:06:15.960> I<00:06:16.020> gave<00:06:16.080> this<00:06:16.379> a<00:06:16.440> name<00:06:16.710> but<00:06:16.830> it's

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
don't think I gave this a name but it's

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.430 
don't think I gave this a name but it's
called<00:06:17.190> compatibilism<00:06:17.969> or<00:06:18.389> maybe<00:06:19.050> soft

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
called compatibilism or maybe soft

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.249 
called compatibilism or maybe soft
determinism<00:06:19.909> that<00:06:20.909> is<00:06:21.150> yes<00:06:21.839> some<00:06:22.110> of<00:06:22.139> the

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 
determinism that is yes some of the

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:25.119 
determinism that is yes some of the
things<00:06:22.500> that<00:06:22.560> determined<00:06:23.129> by<00:06:23.339> your<00:06:23.550> desires

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:25.129 
things that determined by your desires

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:29.689 
things that determined by your desires
otherwise<00:06:26.129> and<00:06:26.550> in<00:06:27.389> that<00:06:27.599> mix<00:06:28.550> you're<00:06:29.550> gonna

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 
otherwise and in that mix you're gonna

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.830 
otherwise and in that mix you're gonna
find<00:06:29.969> a<00:06:30.089> place<00:06:30.300> for<00:06:30.330> your<00:06:30.719> particular<00:06:31.050> yellow

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
find a place for your particular yellow

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.390 
find a place for your particular yellow
and<00:06:32.080> that's<00:06:32.230> really<00:06:32.470> the<00:06:32.590> more<00:06:32.889> complex

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
and that's really the more complex

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.920 
and that's really the more complex
question<00:06:33.910> but<00:06:34.030> those<00:06:34.210> are<00:06:34.330> the<00:06:34.419> categories

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
question but those are the categories

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:43.279 
question but those are the categories
that<00:06:34.990> you're<00:06:35.199> working

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:43.289 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:45.349
