as<00:00:25.019> bad<00:00:25.230> as<00:00:25.349> I<00:00:25.470> thought<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.890> like<00:00:26.070> my<00:00:26.220> eyes

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
as bad as I thought in like my eyes

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.420 
and it's like it's gotten in my mouth
before<00:02:22.160> is<00:02:22.460> very<00:02:22.730> salty<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:25.600> think<00:02:26.600> it<00:02:27.020> is

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
before is very salty so I think it is

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.910 
before is very salty so I think it is
some<00:02:28.430> type<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.870> sea<00:02:29.870> salt<00:02:30.080> in<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.860> the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
some type of sea salt in it and the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.950 
some type of sea salt in it and the
thing<00:02:30.980> is<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.490> think<00:02:31.550> what<00:02:32.150> people<00:02:32.390> when<00:02:32.780> they

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.960 

sorry<00:02:36.250> when<00:02:37.250> they<00:02:37.400> develop<00:02:37.940> it<00:02:38.090> with<00:02:38.180> a<00:02:38.300> crusty

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
sorry when they develop it with a crusty

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.370 
sorry when they develop it with a crusty
when<00:02:40.970> people<00:02:41.300> develop<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.780> little<00:02:42.020> crust<00:02:42.260> is

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
when people develop the little crust is

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.620 
when people develop the little crust is
I<00:02:42.500> think<00:02:42.560> it's<00:02:42.890> because<00:02:42.980> they<00:02:43.370> are<00:02:43.430> salt<00:02:43.790> the

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
I think it's because they are salt the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.490 
I think it's because they are salt the
salt<00:02:44.900> content<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.860> you<00:02:47.080> it's<00:02:48.080> all<00:02:48.260> custom

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
salt content that you it's all custom

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.290 
salt content that you it's all custom
that<00:02:48.830> uses<00:02:49.160> higher<00:02:49.370> than<00:02:49.580> their<00:02:49.730> body<00:02:49.940> salt

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
that uses higher than their body salt

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.850 
that uses higher than their body salt
content<00:02:50.570> i<00:02:50.990> think<00:02:51.230> that's<00:02:51.410> what<00:02:51.590> makes<00:02:51.740> the

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
content i think that's what makes the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.600 
content i think that's what makes the
little<00:02:52.010> crusty<00:02:52.550> this<00:02:53.180> is<00:02:53.480> like<00:02:54.610> proportion

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
little crusty this is like proportion

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.060 
little crusty this is like proportion
and<00:02:55.940> factoring<00:02:56.570> done<00:02:56.840> so<00:02:57.200> i<00:02:57.230> guess<00:02:57.500> that's<00:02:57.800> why

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
and factoring done so i guess that's why

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.260 
and factoring done so i guess that's why
it<00:02:58.130> doesn't<00:02:58.700> form<00:02:59.239> a<00:02:59.300> crust<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:01.610> in<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.030> only

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
it doesn't form a crust so in the only

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.410 
it doesn't form a crust so in the only
crusties<00:03:02.780> I've<00:03:03.770> had<00:03:04.160> was<00:03:04.400> like<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.850> little<00:03:04.970> play

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
crusties I've had was like a little play

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.540 
crusties I've had was like a little play
that<00:03:05.900> came<00:03:06.290> out<00:03:06.500> but<00:03:06.739> other<00:03:06.950> than<00:03:07.130> that<00:03:07.190> that's

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
that came out but other than that that's

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.350 
that came out but other than that that's
it<00:03:08.170> so<00:03:09.170> that's<00:03:09.200> just<00:03:09.800> basically<00:03:10.280> what<00:03:11.030> i<00:03:11.060> do<00:03:11.180> to

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
it so that's just basically what i do to

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.830 
it so that's just basically what i do to
clean<00:03:11.840> it<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:12.680> can<00:03:13.220> see<00:03:13.489> it<00:03:13.640> my<00:03:14.209> mouth<00:03:14.450> maybe<00:03:14.690> a

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
clean it and can see it my mouth maybe a

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.270 
clean it and can see it my mouth maybe a
little<00:03:15.020> wet<00:03:16.510> from<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.959> nasal<00:03:18.650> mist<00:03:18.800> what<00:03:19.040> I<00:03:19.220> do

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
little wet from the nasal mist what I do

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.430 
little wet from the nasal mist what I do
i<00:03:19.730> do<00:03:20.030> recommend<00:03:20.330> this<00:03:20.720> i<00:03:20.870> haven't<00:03:21.170> had<00:03:21.260> any

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
i do recommend this i haven't had any

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.650 
i do recommend this i haven't had any
problems<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:22.100> far<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.970> only<00:03:23.060> problems<00:03:23.540> i

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
problems so far the only problems i

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.070 
problems so far the only problems i
really<00:03:23.959> didn't<00:03:24.320> have<00:03:24.530> was<00:03:24.950> i<00:03:25.959> noticed<00:03:26.959> that

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
really didn't have was i noticed that

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.370 
really didn't have was i noticed that
when<00:03:27.950> i<00:03:27.980> wake<00:03:28.220> up<00:03:28.430> i<00:03:28.640> rub<00:03:28.940> my<00:03:29.120> nose<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.600> I<00:03:29.870> need

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
when i wake up i rub my nose and I need

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.560 
when i wake up i rub my nose and I need
to<00:03:30.470> get<00:03:30.590> out<00:03:30.650> of<00:03:30.799> that<00:03:30.950> heavy<00:03:31.310> because<00:03:31.580> it<00:03:32.060> is<00:03:32.540> a

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
to get out of that heavy because it is a

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.449 
to get out of that heavy because it is a
little<00:03:32.840> sore<00:03:33.260> like<00:03:33.799> I<00:03:33.920> don't<00:03:33.980> feel<00:03:34.280> the

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
little sore like I don't feel the

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.250 
little sore like I don't feel the
soreness<00:03:34.700> now<00:03:34.970> when<00:03:35.180> if<00:03:35.269> I<00:03:35.360> like<00:03:35.540> bump<00:03:35.840> into<00:03:36.110> my

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
soreness now when if I like bump into my

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.530 
soreness now when if I like bump into my
nose<00:03:36.320> I'll<00:03:36.739> feel<00:03:37.010> it<00:03:37.239> so<00:03:38.239> that's<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.510> only

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
nose I'll feel it so that's the only

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.810 
nose I'll feel it so that's the only
problem<00:03:39.049> I've<00:03:39.170> had<00:03:39.200> so<00:03:39.590> far<00:03:39.640> piercing<00:03:40.640> went

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
problem I've had so far piercing went

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.030 
problem I've had so far piercing went
great<00:03:41.120> and<00:03:41.450> this<00:03:42.290> is<00:03:42.440> just<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:42.709> follow<00:03:42.920> up
