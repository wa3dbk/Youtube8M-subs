I'm gonna start at the ends get a nice
heavy<00:02:44.920> score<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.580> probably<00:02:45.790> want<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:45.970> go

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
heavy score you probably want to go

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.630 
heavy score you probably want to go
halfway<00:02:46.300> through<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.870> drywall<00:02:50.310> this<00:02:51.310> snaps

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
halfway through the drywall this snaps

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.510 
halfway through the drywall this snaps
nice<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.090> easy<00:02:53.190> snap<00:02:54.570> then<00:02:55.570> you<00:02:55.720> just<00:02:56.400> peel<00:02:57.400> it

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
nice and easy snap then you just peel it

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.940 
nice and easy snap then you just peel it
back<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:57.990> that<00:02:58.990> front<00:02:59.260> paper<00:02:59.500> is<00:02:59.709> pretty

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
back and that front paper is pretty

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.010 
back and that front paper is pretty
pretty<00:03:00.760> heavy-duty<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:01.420> it'll<00:03:01.600> stay<00:03:01.780> pretty

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
pretty heavy-duty so it'll stay pretty

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:33.240 
pretty heavy-duty so it'll stay pretty
good<00:03:02.550> so<00:03:03.550> there's<00:03:03.760> one<00:03:03.990> 3/4<00:03:04.990> down<00:03:05.200> here

thick in there all right so you can see

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.539 
thick in there all right so you can see
I've<00:04:12.109> got<00:04:12.730> mud<00:04:13.730> and<00:04:13.970> all<00:04:14.060> around<00:04:15.220> so<00:04:16.220> we<00:04:16.310> take

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
I've got mud and all around so we take

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.650 
I've got mud and all around so we take
it<00:04:17.410> press<00:04:18.410> it<00:04:18.560> into<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.829> hole<00:04:18.979> there<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:20.269> then

it press it into the hole there and then

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.210 
it press it into the hole there and then
we're<00:04:20.750> gonna<00:04:20.840> try<00:04:21.109> to<00:04:21.169> essentially<00:04:22.010> like

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
we're gonna try to essentially like

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:51.129 
we're gonna try to essentially like
squeegee<00:04:22.550> all<00:04:22.789> the<00:04:23.380> mud<00:04:24.380> behind<00:04:49.990> there's<00:04:50.990> your

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
squeegee all the mud behind there's your

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:56.379 
squeegee all the mud behind there's your
initial<00:04:54.220> now<00:04:55.220> walk<00:04:55.520> done<00:04:55.789> I'm<00:04:56.090> at<00:04:56.270> the

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
initial now walk done I'm at the

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.240 
initial now walk done I'm at the
skin.this<00:04:56.690> you<00:04:57.440> know<00:04:57.530> to<00:04:57.590> get<00:04:57.740> it<00:04:57.800> off<00:04:57.889> floated

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
skin.this you know to get it off floated

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.510 
skin.this you know to get it off floated
out<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.520> wall<00:04:59.030> is<00:04:59.270> not<00:04:59.449> a<00:05:00.130> perfectly<00:05:01.130> flat

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
out the wall is not a perfectly flat

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.060 
out the wall is not a perfectly flat
they<00:05:01.820> had<00:05:02.000> like<00:05:02.150> a<00:05:02.410> plaster<00:05:03.410> finish<00:05:03.590> on<00:05:03.860> it

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
they had like a plaster finish on it

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.219 
they had like a plaster finish on it
with<00:05:04.940> a<00:05:04.970> little<00:05:05.389> bit<00:05:05.570> of<00:05:05.599> roughness<00:05:05.810> so<00:05:06.139> you

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
with a little bit of roughness so you

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:07.600 
with a little bit of roughness so you
can<00:05:06.349> see<00:05:06.530> there's<00:05:06.710> some<00:05:06.919> high<00:05:07.099> spots<00:05:07.370> and

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
can see there's some high spots and

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.409 
can see there's some high spots and
whatnot<00:05:07.970> but<00:05:08.199> um<00:05:09.820> but<00:05:10.820> yeah<00:05:10.909> after<00:05:11.030> this<00:05:11.300> is

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
whatnot but um but yeah after this is

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.300 
whatnot but um but yeah after this is
not<00:05:11.599> oh<00:05:11.630> no<00:05:11.990> this<00:05:12.349> is<00:05:12.470> ninety<00:05:12.770> minute<00:05:13.010> mud<00:05:13.159> so

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
not oh no this is ninety minute mud so

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.080 
not oh no this is ninety minute mud so
it's<00:05:13.460> gonna<00:05:13.550> take<00:05:13.760> some<00:05:13.970> time<00:05:14.530> but<00:05:16.090> skimming

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
it's gonna take some time but skimming

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.839 
it's gonna take some time but skimming
that<00:05:17.180> again<00:05:17.680> get<00:05:18.680> it<00:05:18.770> all<00:05:18.830> nice<00:05:19.010> and<00:05:19.070> flat<00:05:19.460> and

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
that again get it all nice and flat and
