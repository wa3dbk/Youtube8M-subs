00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.490 
see I'm on feature points comm and here
are<00:01:11.430> some<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> apps<00:01:12.180> there<00:01:12.780> are<00:01:12.930> apps<00:01:13.170> that

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
are some of the apps there are apps that

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.770 
are some of the apps there are apps that
are<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.040> aren't<00:01:14.340> really<00:01:14.369> worth<00:01:14.909> your<00:01:15.479> time

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
are and aren't really worth your time

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.039 
are and aren't really worth your time
for<00:01:16.590> example<00:01:16.799> these<00:01:17.610> eight<00:01:17.909> ones<00:01:18.150> down<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:18.479> I

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
for example these eight ones down here I

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.080 
for example these eight ones down here I
wouldn't<00:01:19.979> really<00:01:20.130> suggest<00:01:20.369> doing<00:01:20.939> because

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
wouldn't really suggest doing because

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.140 
wouldn't really suggest doing because
that's<00:01:21.479> not<00:01:21.810> worth<00:01:22.049> very<00:01:22.080> much<00:01:22.439> at<00:01:22.770> all<00:01:23.150> it

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
that's not worth very much at all it

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.490 
that's not worth very much at all it
takes<00:01:24.479> 600<00:01:25.320> points<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:26.100> make<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.580> dollar<00:01:26.909> and

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
takes 600 points to make a dollar and

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.289 
takes 600 points to make a dollar and
luckily<00:01:28.500> there<00:01:28.799> are<00:01:28.950> apps<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.490> are<00:01:29.700> worth

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
luckily there are apps that are worth

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.960 
luckily there are apps that are worth
way<00:01:30.600> more<00:01:30.630> points<00:01:31.369> typically<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.610> apps<00:01:32.820> that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
way more points typically the apps that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.260 
way more points typically the apps that
I<00:01:33.180> like<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.570> do<00:01:34.020> are<00:01:34.350> 100<00:01:34.860> points<00:01:35.310> some<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.090> them

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
I like to do are 100 points some of them

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.179 
I like to do are 100 points some of them
are<00:01:36.450> even<00:01:36.869> more<00:01:37.229> than<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.590> some<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.890> them<00:01:38.070> are

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
are even more than that some of them are

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.240 
are even more than that some of them are
200<00:01:38.759> or<00:01:38.880> more<00:01:39.119> um<00:01:39.500> so<00:01:40.500> those<00:01:40.680> are<00:01:40.860> usually<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
200 or more um so those are usually the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.179 
200 or more um so those are usually the
ones<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.729> actually<00:01:42.000> end<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.570> downloading

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
ones that I actually end up downloading

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.120 
ones that I actually end up downloading
but<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.549> already<00:01:45.479> used<00:01:45.720> up<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.320> apps<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:46.920> now

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
but I already used up the apps for now

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.999 
but I already used up the apps for now
that<00:01:47.610> are<00:01:47.820> worth<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.329> much<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:49.049> for<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009
