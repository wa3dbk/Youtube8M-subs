red<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.160> model<00:00:59.489> I'm<00:00:59.789> actually

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
red on to this model I'm actually

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.270 
red on to this model I'm actually
painting<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> clear<00:01:01.590> primer<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.129> use

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
painting it on to a clear primer I use

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.000 
painting it on to a clear primer I use
this<00:01:02.820> was<00:01:03.120> testers<00:01:03.600> lacquer<00:01:03.840> which<00:01:04.229> holds

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
this was testers lacquer which holds

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.890 
this was testers lacquer which holds
paint<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.580> as<00:01:05.729> well<00:01:05.970> as<00:01:06.119> any<00:01:06.360> other<00:01:06.450> primer

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
paint on it as well as any other primer

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.780 
paint on it as well as any other primer
but<00:01:07.320> because<00:01:07.560> plastic<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.130> red<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.369> thought<00:01:08.640> it

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
but because plastic is red I thought it

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.280 
but because plastic is red I thought it
would<00:01:08.880> make<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> good<00:01:09.479> base<00:01:09.750> coat<00:01:10.080> color

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
would make for a good base coat color

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.780 
would make for a good base coat color
and<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.799> would<00:01:10.950> save<00:01:11.159> me<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.400> having<00:01:11.700> to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
and that would save me on having to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.310 
and that would save me on having to
paint<00:01:11.939> more<00:01:12.299> coats<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.720> red<00:01:12.900> for<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.290> show

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
paint more coats of red for it to show

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.410 
paint more coats of red for it to show
up<00:01:13.530> really<00:01:13.920> nicely<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.549> model<00:01:14.790> evenly
