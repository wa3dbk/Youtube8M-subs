 products at a multitude of points 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.290
 before entering into manufacturing each ingredient must be careful and 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.790
 precisely heavy 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.250

 the other essential ingredient is water 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.040
 the water used in the manufacture of cosmetics is first subsidized by 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.040
 a reverse osmosis system 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.370
 depending on the complexity of the recipe 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.040
 24 to 10 working hours are required to manufacture a product 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.890
 had a foam bath recipe 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.580

 2 at each step all the products undergo several tests 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.780
 here with a fish acid neutralization total base reaction is 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.780
 performed with the coconut indicator
