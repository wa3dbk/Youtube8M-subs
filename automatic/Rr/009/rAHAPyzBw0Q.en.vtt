00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
wing antenna I just knew it was

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.500 
wing antenna I just knew it was
something<00:00:52.530> had<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.770> eat<00:00:52.890> boiled<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.300> at

something had to eat boiled and it's at

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.479 
something had to eat boiled and it's at
that<00:00:54.539> point<00:00:54.660> when<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.230> decided<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.190> had

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
that point when you decided that you had

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.790 
that point when you decided that you had
to<00:00:56.640> get<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> team<00:00:56.940> together<00:00:57.350> yeah<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.590> that's

and textures seems straightforward

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.980 
and textures seems straightforward
enough<00:01:59.670> but<00:02:00.670> getting<00:02:01.030> a<00:02:01.210> gun<00:02:01.360> shooting<00:02:01.869> would

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
enough but getting a gun shooting would

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.140 
enough but getting a gun shooting would
