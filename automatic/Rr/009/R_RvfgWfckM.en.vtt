00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.189
 hey people today with new ball for you 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:10.410
 and always yes you can understand 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.700
 As always, you do not hear often 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.580
 But the thing is here for the ball 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.210
 a grenade and that's why ima 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.240
 haible training is the first ball of the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.250
 has a new panel design and 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.170
 although not about your own pattern 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.810
 wait for designers to come 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.699
 but the pattern of the ball 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.030
 view that is the glued structure 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.010
 the structure is used 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.140
 is not just glued but it 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.300
 In addition, that means differently us 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.370
 about other sources such as the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.980
 great the peat factory or the jako 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.379
 There is no technique here 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.230
 processed but both that means we 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.899
 have extremely durable stitched one 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.670
 very very hard surface 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.120
 still one press and still 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.239
 cool takes the speed that is one 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.890
 hard night a really robust kind 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.750
 combined with one 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.270
 surface coating the very 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.520
 is durable and thus a ball 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.080
 especially for clubs 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.900
 who train a lot on the artificial turf 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.720
 or on harder surfaces of the 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.000
 reha training is the only ball of the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.090
 about this one's about this glue and 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.770
 that means a ball of technology 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.290
 should keep longer 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.729
 the durability promises the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.590
 clearly above all others 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.479
 training balls and where already 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.670
 first tests have shown that this 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.170
 Seam construction on time 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.950
 will definitely prevail 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.110
 that is glued and sewn only when 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.960
 hall training the ball is something for that 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.299
 more expensive but the playing comfort is 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.329
 really on extremely high drinks at 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.670
 level and with the seam construction and 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.170
 This durable surface has 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.759
 you just hold something longer 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.579
 durability and very big 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.380
 game features what do you think of it 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.140
 Let me know you have 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.460
 maybe even trained for the ball 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.170
 since you are generally ready a bit 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.979
 spend more money on ball like that 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.930
 hybrid training 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.789
 Just leave it to me through the comments 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.129
 Above all, how do you like that? 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.080
 design of the ball until then 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.170
 I'm glad 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.170
 there
