00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.949
 ripe bananas are so straight ripe 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.449

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.199

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.620

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.920
 I put a speed of 6 and so here 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.830
 it turned out further you can also 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.810
 of course it is cooked and with help without 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.090
 thermomix and of course just a fork 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.490
 grind this one here and these bananas 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.729
 add corn 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:24.630
 oatmeal and on there as desired 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:35.130
 chocolate rub and I go there all the same yes and 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:38.780

 and then she added me all 5 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.490
 took 12 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:02.760
 and it turned out that's such a homogeneous 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:07.120
 mass now we take this mass 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:09.600
 spread with tea spoon 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.180
 spoon spread on 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.790
 for baking and we will bake 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.770
 and we will bake 15 minutes at 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.050
 temperature 250 degrees 200 250 who 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.230

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.940
 look of things but i didnâ€™t make it 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.440
 very small let's see what happens 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.470
 will still be located a little bit 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.130
 I have a little analysis left 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.739
 I probably just add milk 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:06.040
 I will do the same as 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:08.550
 milk shake for our cookies you 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.550

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.329
 or a little bit here looks very me 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:23.530

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:25.510
 milk valley there per gram 300 son 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.530
 we liked it and knocked it all on 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:33.359
 speeds of 89 are generally very very tasty 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.560
 It should be chocolate and already 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:40.060
 oatmeal count 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.810
 nuts and very significant drink 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:49.510
 It turned out we wait until our baked and 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:52.870
 then, well, that our cookies are ready here 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.540
