00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.980
 as a momo king I will leave a mark and that 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.650
 I'm going to comply because one of the 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.119
 issues that I have in mind for 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.580
 for the question that looming is 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:20.279
 have been elected a momo king in 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.140
 the bicentennial of canyon more than 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.830
 it is added that canyon in the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:30.499
 world capital of the american culture 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.499
 that for me is a pride and that I wear it 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.670
 through the mask is that I 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.190
 I see the possibility of founding or organizing 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.850
 groups and in the year there as of the year 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.320
 69 here was the ga dance the combo 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.930
 peasant I made more than 50 mask and 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.280
 we went with the dance but here in 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.479
 galapa already considering that that caused a 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.070
 innovation here see so much wildlife in one 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:10.740
 dance because the dances carry their fauna 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.990
 then they are liked by the boys and 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.369
 then we decided to organize ourselves 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.460
 themselves a group was in 1970 organized 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.729
 I founded the tiger dance we went to 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.479
 barranquilla but I did not buy in that no no 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.179
 there was the question of workshops that 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.520
 they said no this can not compete here 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:36.150
 in dance because not three turbans but 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.990
 however African jungle was presented 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.360
 Barranquilla as a dance and through 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.480
 the workshops and he was that they said that 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.310
 I could not register as a dance 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.640
 how do you share popular foresight 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.810
 then in that time I had founded 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.479
 the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.540
 the tiger dance I leave it to the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.810
 acosta family after organized another 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.939
 dance was called the tiger bengal the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.340
 we differ because this was a streak and 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.380
 That big stain was left by a 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.119
 My friend Manuel Herrera and afterwards 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.119
 he organized the African jungle 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.330
 good the making of a mask 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.470
 depends on volume and in a process of 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.330
 you can dry in two or three days because 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.210
 you have to wait because when a 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.970
 big mask you have to 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.940
 include or put enough paper with 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.700
 In order for it to be a tough mask 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.340
 for a carnival and not just for 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.470
 this carnival but for many others 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.080
 carnivals 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.300
 for example here if I can tell you there 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.300
 masks that are more than 30 years old and so 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.450
 still all we do is make you 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.910
 some retouching and come back and leave for the 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.590
 next carnival looming the 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.830
 carnival of canyon we have the 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.070
 owned by tourists and 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.620
 come to do this complement to come 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.750
 to enjoy a party like the carnival of 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.510
 canyon because because it is that the 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.630
 barranquillero culture and carnival 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.780
 Barranquilla is like the sauce 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.270
 complements that salsa is the rhythm that 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.630
 pick up all the air 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.670
 call and mix and that 's that's what 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.570
 to the carnival of Barranquilla 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.560
 here at the carnival of Barranquilla 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:31.290
 we have the property that we are creative 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.540
 we are innovative and that is the essence of 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.360
 Rescue this carnival of Barranquilla 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.250
 go and respect the traditions 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.709
 culturally good this dress that this and 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.890
 wearing is a tribute to the dances 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.930
 black with this 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.760
 personify 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.590
 after the little black man of santa lucia I can 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.850
 personify a dance 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.810
 how are the gorillas of 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:00.590
 when it will be done more closely and so with 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.210
 I can make this dress 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.010
 diversification of all headdresses 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:08.590
 as you see later a gorilla 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.319
 now let's personify 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.750
 the fauna because it can not be left 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.540
 outside the fauna and here is the character 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.650
 of the mandril as we see it 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.380
 and so on what comes to us what 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.070
 we can put 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.830
 to scene good the truth we are not going to 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.780
 show this different figure but it will 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.300
 they will account for different costumes 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.250
 because the idea is that my dad like rhythm 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.910
 not only show your African jungle 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.700
 your comparsa but show all the 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.820
 dance troupes the cumbia congo everything 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.650
 everything that is this all the carnival in the 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.020
 so that's why it's more like 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.370
 we work like this all that is the 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.750
 comparsa of him with one another 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.130
 dance then that what we are 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.630
 showing and every time a 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.860
 presentation we always do something new 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.200
 and different 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.140
 embodied the sculpture and that's what we're going 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.420
 to rescue a traditional culture I will 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:07.200
 invite all the actors to do 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.600
 of the carnival because I here through the 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.640
 I have some regulations I have some duties 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.580
 and some rights but it's working on 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.150
 rescue all those traditional parts 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.150
 that have been lost
