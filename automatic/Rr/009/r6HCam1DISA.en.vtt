00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.810
 oha a flying chocolate where is it ? 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.730
 like this 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.530
 they have too tiny wings around 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.900
 to be able to fly that's true 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.799
 but also is not thanks to heavens word 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.080
 problem more 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.840
 the first content extension for final 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.970
 Fantasy 14 takes the air flow in the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.189
 new zones so that we with 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.500
 airships kite and even ours 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.269
 self-bred companion for the first time 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.099
 may make the sky unsure what 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.730
 the online roleplay addons otherwise 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.450
 has to offer 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.800
 we betray about harbors right at the beginning 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.050
 you have to be able to play sword 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.660
 Mandatory that campaign finale of 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.610
 reborn mastered the story 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.700
 the extension is right there 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.500
 where patch 2.5 was released a few weeks ago 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.600
 has stopped those who do not yet has come 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.230
 may not addons new areas 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.820
 to enter 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.309
 that is natural for all concerned 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.350
 stupid but explained by the story 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.270
 Context, however , does not work 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.160
 only recent events continue 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.090
 We deliberately do not work at this point 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.519
 want to betray 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.250
 the warrior of light so we have to 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.659
 with his allies also new 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.760
 Danger spots in the north of the country 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.680
 namely, has been raging for 1000 years 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.840
 A war between the people of the kites 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.640
 and the city state is now too 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.979
 the templar threatens to escalate 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.799
 already expect the final blow of the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.659
 mighty lizards still messed up 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.299
 the situation because the native 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.250
 Wild tribes to protect the primary 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.259
 deities ravenna and bismarck 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.509
 have called since the kite 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.909
 and attack humanoid alike 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.680
 So there is more than enough to do and 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.970
 a peaceful solution to the conflicts 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.470
 seems hopeless 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.930
 The campaign will be like in the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.729
 main game with countless video sequences 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.009
 nicely set in scene especially the 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.530
 appearances of the primrose are a true one 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.060
 augenweide 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.369
 pity is that only selected 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.409
 passages of the action of the actually 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.390
 good speakers were set to music mostly 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.430
 we only have a look at the dialogue 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.500
 lyrics because the protagonists storm 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.880
 Opposite stand beside the campaign there 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.920
 it also countless, of course 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.110
 side missions but very stale 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.860
 be presented and also rarely 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.480
 tell exciting stories 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.610
 to make friends to the 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.820
 Updates of happens word is one of those 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.470
 folk of the aura that easily attached to the tank 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.990
 had scales in the face and the 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.700
 recognizing stylish horns is chic 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.650
 or who betting on a new one? 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.260
 by chance, he has learned with his 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.270
 Level 50 hero one of the three fresh 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.070
 added jobs the dark knight 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.290
 grabs as a genuine tank the 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.550
 attention of the enemies of the astrologer 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.560
 cares about the well the meanwhile 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.000
 group and the machinist here in the picture 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.430
 takes his enemies with his 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.660
 firearm and various magic tech 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.790
 Devices under fire 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.160
 no matter if you are new or new 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.410
 The old job is about daring a genre 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.400
 revolution is allowed in heppen's words 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.800
 not expecting 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.830
 on the contrary, the glass design falls 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.900
 similar to stale ones like in reborn though 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.420
 we do not fight we do lame 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.370
 Get and usually do henchmen jobs 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.530
 let's see the creatures in the nearer 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.020
 blow up the environment or save someone 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.030
 by resurrecting our opponents 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.010
 Thresh and if we are on something extra 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.080
 Experience and support us in the 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.330
 fans appear everywhere in the country 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.950
 So they can be a kind of public fixed 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.900
 but here is a change 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.760
 we usually grow shortcomings 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.709
 all about the one box symbol above that 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.510
 wear head before time runs out and 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.610
 if there are enough people in the vicinity 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.489
 that is not even demanding 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.830
 that the quests and fans are still fun 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.540
 make is the fight system of final 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.940
 Although this is a heaven's door in the fantasy world 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.010
 not touched but at least about 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.290
 a few new skills will be added 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.000
 especially in the groups battled the 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.980
 new dungeons or in the crisp 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.959
 this is the primary challenge 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.700
 Dodge and beat to the full 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.989
 constantly we must be dangerous 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.330
 escape or attack 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.220
 Emerging things do exist 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.690
 it usually special boss mechanics the 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.549
 want to be noticed and ours 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.440
 own spell order also has to 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.930
 the challenges are mastered 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.340
 it's not all that hard 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.230
 but also because that is every player 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.030
 who is already in heaven there 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.829
 a long way behind 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.930
 has and many won 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:13.769
 has mastered really crisp opponents 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.769
 but should follow 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.560
 The start of Ports Spot ran 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.480
 supple the servers kept that 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.160
 rush of players was also because of the 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.830
 Japanese developers become a wise one 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.360
 Gone on heavily populated worlds 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.400
 the gameplay simply becomes 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.380
 multiple instanced version of the 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.330
 Homeland researcher distributes it there though 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.460
 Waiting times after logging in but the 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.930
 fall out surprisingly short and too 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.120
 We were looking for annoying bugs so far 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.860
 the vain leaves otherwise 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.590
 extension a very good impression 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.810
 thanks to new directx 11 support for 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.370
 the pc hp pretty graphic of the 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.230
 play again a noticeable jump 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.270
 made to the front of the character models 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.520
 are crisp sharp the magic effects 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.680
 Look great and so consistent 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.270
 how varied the sides zones 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.000
 We like it very much 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.850
 on the playstation 4 sees final 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.880
 By the way, fantasy 14 also looks great when 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.860
 We want to find a hair in the soup 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.600
 then maybe with some background 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.640
 Textures from the near but bad 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.530
 muddy act due to the size of the 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.600
 new areas of the earth to players and 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:20.360
 the otherwise very positive overall picture 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:21.860
 but if we live with it 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.010
 Preserves the strengths and weaknesses 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.870
 from final fantasy 14 o'clock am riedborn and 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.880
 she takes over almost one to one in 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.830
 Heaven Sword The campaign is exciting 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.270
 The graphics are pretty and the lootings 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.770
 especially in the groups 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.330
 fight a lot of mood 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.300
 You have to stop with the stale ones 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.470
 quest design and the generic 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.690
 ancillary activities like the fans live 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.100
 who was good at the main game? 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.660
 will also be with the extensive 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.970
 extension to have fun and 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.660
 besides you can finally chocobos 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.660
 fly
