installing<00:01:14.970> fixtures<00:01:15.480> into<00:01:15.780> your<00:01:15.900> ceiling

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
installing fixtures into your ceiling

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.200 
installing fixtures into your ceiling
tiles<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.950> as<00:01:17.160> easy<00:01:17.310> as<00:01:17.520> transferring<00:01:18.120> the

measurements<00:01:18.660> and<00:01:18.780> cutting<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> hole<00:01:19.560> now

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
measurements and cutting the hole now

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.370 
measurements and cutting the hole now
remember<00:01:20.730> when<00:01:21.000> installing<00:01:21.360> fixtures<00:01:21.930> that

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
remember when installing fixtures that

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.750 
remember when installing fixtures that
the<00:01:22.560> tiles<00:01:22.980> themselves<00:01:23.550> are<00:01:23.730> not

the tiles themselves are not
load-bearing<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:25.530> fixtures<00:01:25.950> need<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.220> be

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
load-bearing the fixtures need to be

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.190 
load-bearing the fixtures need to be
self-supporting<00:01:26.730> we'll<00:01:27.420> be<00:01:27.540> using<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.960> dremel

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
self-supporting we'll be using a dremel

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.470 
self-supporting we'll be using a dremel
tool<00:01:28.590> available<00:01:29.310> at<00:01:29.460> any<00:01:29.580> hardware<00:01:29.820> store<00:01:30.030> to

make a plunge cut and follow the line

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.450 
make a plunge cut and follow the line
now<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:43.020> your<00:01:43.200> dremel<00:01:43.530> tool<00:01:43.710> has<00:01:43.920> an<00:01:44.100> RPM

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
now if your dremel tool has an RPM

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.690 
now if your dremel tool has an RPM
adjustment<00:01:45.000> make<00:01:45.150> sure<00:01:45.300> it's<00:01:45.450> not<00:01:45.570> too<00:01:45.780> high

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.500 

okay<00:01:54.020> we're<00:01:55.020> done<00:01:55.370> now<00:01:56.370> don't<00:01:56.760> worry<00:01:57.060> if<00:01:57.300> your

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
okay we're done now don't worry if your

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.290 
okay we're done now don't worry if your
circle<00:01:58.080> isn't<00:01:58.230> perfect<00:01:59.030> let's<00:02:00.030> put<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
circle isn't perfect let's put the

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.630 
circle isn't perfect let's put the
bezels<00:02:00.660> for<00:02:00.870> but<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.410> get<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.650> close<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:02.160> think

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
bezels for but just get it close I think
