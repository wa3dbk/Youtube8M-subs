00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
love it went with it in four by three

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.760 
love it went with it in four by three
when<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.540> guys<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> lot<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.990> case<00:01:43.140> apparently

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
when you guys a lot of case apparently

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.170 
when you guys a lot of case apparently
there's<00:01:44.250> three<00:01:44.490> different<00:01:44.579> aspect<00:01:45.119> ratios

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
there's three different aspect ratios

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.789 
there's three different aspect ratios
yeah<00:01:45.689> one<00:01:45.930> was<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> four<00:01:46.649> by<00:01:46.770> three

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
yeah one was like a four by three

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.469 
yeah one was like a four by three
looking<00:01:47.220> type<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.549> thing<00:01:47.670> not<00:01:47.790> exactly<00:01:48.149> 4<00:01:48.360> by<00:01:48.450> 3

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
looking type of thing not exactly 4 by 3

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.289 
looking type of thing not exactly 4 by 3
then<00:01:49.229> there's<00:01:49.530> wider<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.369> then<00:01:50.640> even<00:01:50.880> wider

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
then there's wider and then even wider

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.060 
then there's wider and then even wider
and<00:01:51.630> apparently<00:01:52.439> they<00:01:52.619> are<00:01:52.710> all<00:01:52.860> different

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
and apparently they are all different

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.620 
and apparently they are all different
time<00:01:53.399> periods<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> movie<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.329> they<00:01:54.420> each

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
time periods in the movie so they each

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.450 
time periods in the movie so they each
each<00:01:54.960> aspect<00:01:55.259> ratio<00:01:55.770> tells<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.100> different<00:01:56.250> time

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
each aspect ratio tells a different time

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.160 
each aspect ratio tells a different time
period<00:01:56.820> that's<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.149> as<00:01:57.270> far<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.630> that's

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
period that's what as far as I that's

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.770 
period that's what as far as I that's
cool<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.439> guess<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.950> know<00:01:59.100> interesting<00:01:59.880> well

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
cool I guess you know interesting well

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.499 
cool I guess you know interesting well
yet<00:02:00.930> again<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.500> cast<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.280> there<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:03.000> style<00:02:03.329> is

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
yet again the cast is there the style is

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.389 
yet again the cast is there the style is
there<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.810> colors<00:02:04.079> are<00:02:04.229> there<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.649> now<00:02:05.189> we're

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
there the colors are there and now we're

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.039 
there the colors are there and now we're
adding<00:02:05.549> an<00:02:05.729> aspect<00:02:06.210> ratio<00:02:06.240> thing<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.869> think

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
adding an aspect ratio thing I think

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.279 
adding an aspect ratio thing I think
it's<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> be<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:08.099> ultimate<00:02:08.330> movie<00:02:09.330> if

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289
