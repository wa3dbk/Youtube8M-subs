00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.379

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.379
 turn into 7 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.620

 panini comics and publishers happen 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.239
 who sends me manga and take orders

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.680
 video for damn that analysis is now 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.360
 read out with a couple of gangs 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.580
 was why not start with this one from here 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.530
 superman sentenced to be released 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.320
 here in Brazil in two editions in value 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.110
 of 28 90 and kappa cartón history plot 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.330
 more or less of them fled the area 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.550
 ghost and is in the land again 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.740
 causing chaos and only our 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.840
 hero is Superman finds a way about them that 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.120
 the only one that can hit the front with two 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.370
 day and between this fight and superman the 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.380
 apocalypse this time the apocalypse very 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.140
 stronger than before and is more 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.700
 stronger than before, this allows you to 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.680
 this fight with him where he ends up 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.470
 deciding to have to end once the 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.909
 apocalypse and he does it 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.860
 apocalypse in the middle 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.450
 only in that the apocalypse emphasized a 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.969
 of gases that ends up causing the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.520
 superman and I read that gas and it ends 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:36.740
 contaminating the superman and that's where it comes in. 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.990
 the league of justice the lex luthor and others 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.030
 heroes trying to help the super me 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.920
 deal with this contamination 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.659
 ended up having to kill a 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.939
 apocalypse that they did not expect the 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.530
 superman could become something more 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.750
 he ends up becoming the 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.329
 own apocalypse own of the day 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.250
 he begins to have the form and begins to act 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.770
 totally different as his apocalypse 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.869
 exactly inside the body of the 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.219
 my face is a great story, I 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.960
 I think it's worth you give a read 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.030
 not only that it's not much of a fuck 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.159
 so do not go with too many expectations it is 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.320
 in fact the return of the apocalypse only 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.210
 You certainly have a more powerful mind. 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.430
 behind this whole class 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.710
 I'm going to kick and I can shine because 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.720
 There are times when light appears there. 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.700
 that it is also being dominated by 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.360
 somebody there and such I will mention that you can 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.010
 be the guild 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.140
 I put it in the comments you think 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.939
 so this is a story that cool 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.280
 to me only it is not all that is more 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:29.599
 once they using an apocalypse one 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.790
 Which way I think it would not be nice 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.560
 I think you should use it differently. 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.170
 so here's my superman tip 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.549
 condemned to you that you 're curious 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.200
 it's good or not 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.110
 the next material here a taste 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.970
 pretty much want earth forms expensive and if 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.129
 Send me I found it too hard for me to enjoy 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.870
 damn the idea of ​​the place 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.659
 early in the mandate we are shown 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.549
 leave a ship with 15 crew and not 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.720
 until Mars apparently it seems that this 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.000
 I work with some kind of 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.340
 loyalty they will go in there and you 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.200
 disarm but this is all explained 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.269
 because they are going to do mars 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.579
 one of congratulation is that in the past 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.560
 they set out to meet the goal of 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.989
 machine to make a good 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.269
 preparation of the earth they sent algae 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.829
 and they also sent some cockroaches and 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.889
 after some time one of the land 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.540
 prepared to be able to have them 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.670
 they sent those 15 crew there 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.049
 to clear all these stops 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.180
 they just said they did not 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.000
 expected to get there and these cockroaches 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.250
 developed in a way that they 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.079
 Which are human are you, good night? 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.060
 so you can see the scene and blessing 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.109
 program the cockroaches are the ones that were very 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.060
 ugly house 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.489
 only that these 15 crew send to 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.069
 they were not ordinary humans they had 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.989
 prepare the mind, they had to 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.180
 they mixed with them there 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.010
 Is there anything of the kind where they have 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.199
 the ability to transform into 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.760
 insects and every insect is logical has its 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:51.230
 skill that is so cool 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.609
 we have an insect that is the time to 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.699
 I'm not mistaken, we have praises to God. 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:58.069
 we have a boat going to have microbes too 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:59.810
 funny and very fucking the way the 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.639
 car goes without saying that art too 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.069
 It's very good, I particularly liked it. 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:06.530
 much of the art of telling the story is 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.430
 basically this is the first goal 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.739
 military staff 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.590
 the other volumes will still show all around 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.299
 the time brings that it seems two types of 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.459
 stories there the guy who wants to bring 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.229
 these cheap paper and have a face that 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.489
 I want you to let me explain everything 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.949
 be there 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.449
 It's just a very strong and fast question in the 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.240
 end of the world you see that the cockroaches 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:28.430
 they evolve to the point of flying 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.550
 because we have flying rogues 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.500
 so it's all very well imagine the face 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.630
 of the galley seeing those cheap a year already 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.250
 that it is already fast only good damage and 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.470
 If you do not know, you also have a 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.720
 animation gives even an anime is the form of 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.550
 it's only three episodes I watched 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.440
 it's worth it also just that it is a bit 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.039
 different from what we have here in 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.960
 mango 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:50.030
 It's but a very good anime too. 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.139
 I recommend that you watch Olympic I think 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.729
 that is very worth it 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.139
 then it is only these fans 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.270
 materials I took here today to 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.669
 tell you that there are even shapes and 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.830
 condemned superman hope you have 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.330
 liked to put it in the comment that you 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.620
 did you find any of the materials you already 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.330
 Do you know what you've read? 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.310
 leave it there for us to be able to 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.780
 discussing this, do not forget to 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.690
 follow me on twitter 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.319
 facebook city everything else people are 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.449
 that's right 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.449
 Thank you and see you next time.
