00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
nice and comfy wouldn't go any more

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.269 
nice and comfy wouldn't go any more
padded<00:00:26.910> than<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.150> though<00:00:27.359> but<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:28.279> just

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
padded than this though but it just

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.620 
padded than this though but it just
feels<00:00:29.460> really<00:00:29.670> comfortable<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
feels really comfortable and I like the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.179 
feels really comfortable and I like the
fact<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:30.929> instead<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.470> having<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.769> correctly

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
fact that instead of having it correctly

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.250 
fact that instead of having it correctly
attached<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.360> bag<00:00:33.510> itself<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.960> see<00:00:34.110> like

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
attached to the bag itself you see like

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.979 
attached to the bag itself you see like
this<00:00:34.410> little<00:00:34.620> material<00:00:35.100> right<00:00:35.250> here<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.989> these

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
this little material right here so these

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.600 
this little material right here so these
straps<00:00:37.320> actually<00:00:37.620> extend<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.070> little<00:00:38.340> bit<00:00:38.460> out

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
straps actually extend a little bit out

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.389 
straps actually extend a little bit out
from<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.480> main<00:00:39.870> panel<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> bag<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:41.010> like

from the main panel of the bag I like
that<00:00:41.640> actually<00:00:41.820> for<00:00:42.300> some<00:00:42.390> reason<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:42.719> like

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
that actually for some reason just like

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
this added extra little few inches of

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.310 
this added extra little few inches of
space<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.480> make<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> bag<00:00:45.899> feel<00:00:46.140> more

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
integrated whistle like that that should

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.869 
integrated whistle like that that should
be<00:00:55.350> standard<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.829> all<00:00:55.860> bags<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.430> my<00:00:56.520> opinion

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
padded just enough so it feels

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.929 
padded just enough so it feels
comfortable<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.830> one<00:01:05.339> thing<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.549> really<00:01:05.790> like

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
comfortable and one thing I really like

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.420 
comfortable and one thing I really like
is<00:01:06.180> hip<00:01:06.780> belt<00:01:06.990> pockets<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:08.010> take<00:01:08.189> up<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
is hip belt pockets that take up the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.460 
is hip belt pockets that take up the
entire<00:01:08.820> length<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.869> waist<00:01:10.020> belt<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.409> that

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
entire length of the waist belt so that

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.050 
entire length of the waist belt so that
you<00:01:10.590> could<00:01:10.710> stick<00:01:10.950> not<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.640> something<00:01:11.909> small

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
you could stick not just something small

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.250 
you could stick not just something small
like<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.390> phone<00:01:12.570> but<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.780> could<00:01:12.900> stick<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
like a phone but you could stick in a

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.070 
like a phone but you could stick in a
full-on<00:01:13.590> GPS<00:01:14.159> or<00:01:14.479> actually<00:01:15.479> tools<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.900> here

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
full-on GPS or actually tools in here

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.630 
full-on GPS or actually tools in here
and<00:01:16.290> not<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.740> worry<00:01:16.890> about<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.189> taking

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
and not have to worry about it taking

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.160 
and not have to worry about it taking
off<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.909> bag<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.299> order<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.540> access<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.110> do

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
off the bag in order to access it I do

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.530 
off the bag in order to access it I do
like<00:01:19.530> these<00:01:20.040> hip<00:01:20.250> pockets<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:21.090> either<00:01:21.240> side

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
like these hip pockets on either side

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.359 
like these hip pockets on either side
the<00:01:21.900> only<00:01:22.080> hit<00:01:22.200> I'll<00:01:22.320> give<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.890> instead<00:01:23.250> of

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
the only hit I'll give is is instead of

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.920 
the only hit I'll give is is instead of
mesh<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.640> would<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:23.880> like<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.090> two<00:01:24.240> material

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
mesh I would have like this two material

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.570 
mesh I would have like this two material
so<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.259> way<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.799> would<00:01:25.920> protect<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.310> items

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
so that way it would protect the items

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.910 
so that way it would protect the items
from<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> elements<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:28.890> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
from the elements but as it is I like to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.520 
from the elements but as it is I like to
design<00:01:29.280> anyway<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:29.880> because<00:01:30.290> not<00:01:31.290> enough

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
design anyway just because not enough

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.260 
design anyway just because not enough
bags<00:01:31.770> have<00:01:31.979> hip<00:01:32.130> belt<00:01:32.340> pockets<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.790> my<00:01:32.820> opinion

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
bags have hip belt pockets in my opinion

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.719 
bags have hip belt pockets in my opinion
and<00:01:34.170> also<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:34.979> zipper<00:01:35.159> pulls<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.520> love

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
and also for the zipper pulls I love

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.039 
and also for the zipper pulls I love
that<00:01:35.880> they<00:01:35.970> use<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.270> loop<00:01:36.509> design<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.960> way

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
that they use this loop design that way

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.630 
that they use this loop design that way
if<00:01:37.140> I'm<00:01:37.259> wearing<00:01:37.470> gloves<00:01:37.680> or<00:01:37.860> whatever<00:01:38.340> reason

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
if I'm wearing gloves or whatever reason

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.130 
if I'm wearing gloves or whatever reason
it's<00:01:38.790> easy<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.090> loop<00:01:39.299> my<00:01:39.450> finger<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.840> instead

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
it's easy to loop my finger and instead

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.569 
it's easy to loop my finger and instead
of<00:01:40.200> having<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.470> grab<00:01:40.770> some<00:01:40.979> little<00:01:41.220> nub<00:01:41.400> to

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
of having to grab some little nub to

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.690 
of having to grab some little nub to
pull<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.720> good<00:01:42.840> design<00:01:43.430> looking<00:01:44.430> at

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
pull a so it's a good design looking at

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.789 
pull a so it's a good design looking at
the<00:01:44.970> actual<00:01:45.600> suspension<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.380> bag<00:01:46.500> itself

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
the actual suspension of the bag itself

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.600 
the actual suspension of the bag itself
it<00:01:47.729> uses<00:01:48.119> what<00:01:48.420> Osprey<00:01:49.290> calls<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.979> air<00:01:50.310> core

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
it uses what Osprey calls the air core

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.149 
it uses what Osprey calls the air core
system<00:01:51.079> it's<00:01:52.079> probably<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> familiar<00:01:52.590> design

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
system it's probably a familiar design

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.469 
system it's probably a familiar design
to<00:01:53.310> everybody<00:01:53.670> here<00:01:53.939> what<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.240> basically

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
to everybody here what you basically

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.080 
to everybody here what you basically
have<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.810> an<00:01:54.899> aluminum<00:01:55.380> or<00:01:55.530> alloy<00:01:55.920> frame<00:01:56.610> that

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
have is an aluminum or alloy frame that

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.649 
have is an aluminum or alloy frame that
extends<00:01:57.810> from<00:01:57.960> your<00:01:58.560> body<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:59.159> pulls<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.659> main

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
extends from your body it pulls the main

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.539 
extends from your body it pulls the main
part<00:02:00.960> body<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.740> pack<00:02:01.860> away<00:02:02.130> from<00:02:02.369> your

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
part body of the pack away from your

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.209 
part body of the pack away from your
back<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.000> then<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.780> elastic<00:02:04.560> mesh

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
back and then you have this elastic mesh

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.980 
back and then you have this elastic mesh
sheet<00:02:05.520> over<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.240> way<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.479> allows<00:02:06.509> air

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
sheet over it so that way it allows air

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.630 
sheet over it so that way it allows air
circulation<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.649> go<00:02:07.740> through<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.369> way<00:02:08.489> when

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
circulation to go through that way when

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.699 
circulation to go through that way when
you're<00:02:08.759> wearing<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.629> bag<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.140> don't<00:02:10.590> get

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
you're wearing this bag you don't get

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.680 
you're wearing this bag you don't get
sweaty<00:02:10.920> back<00:02:11.099> syndrome<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.480> really

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
sweaty back syndrome this is really

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.820 
sweaty back syndrome this is really
important<00:02:13.050> for<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.230> bag<00:02:13.410> this

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
important for a bag this

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.990 
important for a bag this
just<00:02:13.980> because<00:02:14.220> if<00:02:14.370> you're<00:02:14.490> gonna<00:02:14.610> go<00:02:14.790> with<00:02:14.820> the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
just because if you're gonna go with the

just because if you're gonna go with the
bag<00:02:15.150> with<00:02:15.330> this<00:02:15.480> little<00:02:15.810> capacity<00:02:16.320> basically

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
bag with this little capacity basically

very appropriate for a bag this size and
if<00:02:23.220> whatever<00:02:23.580> reason<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.030> need<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.180> access

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
if whatever reason you need to access

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.170 
if whatever reason you need to access
that<00:02:24.870> isn't<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.410> frame<00:02:25.680> sheet<00:02:25.950> or<00:02:26.370> get<00:02:27.090> to

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
that isn't that frame sheet or get to

that isn't that frame sheet or get to
the<00:02:27.270> inside<00:02:27.600> of<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:27.780> panel<00:02:28.050> you'll<00:02:28.860> notice

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
the inside of this panel you'll notice

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.320 
the inside of this panel you'll notice
here<00:02:29.310> underneath<00:02:29.670> this<00:02:29.850> hall<00:02:30.120> loop<00:02:30.390> and

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
shoulder straps out of the way you have

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.160 
shoulder straps out of the way you have
this<00:02:37.740> zipper<00:02:38.010> if<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.580> open<00:02:38.820> this<00:02:38.910> up<00:02:39.140> check<00:02:40.140> it

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
this zipper if I open this up check it

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.230 
this zipper if I open this up check it
out<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:42.030> can<00:02:42.210> access<00:02:42.900> this<00:02:43.200> sheet<00:02:43.650> or<00:02:44.460> the

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
out you can access this sheet or the

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.940 
out you can access this sheet or the
mesh<00:02:45.390> panel<00:02:45.630> for<00:02:46.050> whatever<00:02:46.230> reason<00:02:46.710> so

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
mesh panel for whatever reason so

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.260 
mesh panel for whatever reason so
basically<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.430> just<00:02:47.490> have<00:02:47.700> these<00:02:47.850> two<00:02:48.030> bars

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
basically you just have these two bars

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.070 
basically you just have these two bars
here<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:49.260> look<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:50.310> yeah<00:02:50.430> it's<00:02:50.610> nice<00:02:50.959> you<00:02:51.959> have

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
here you look so yeah it's nice you have

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.480 
here you look so yeah it's nice you have
easy<00:02:52.200> access<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.830> or<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.370> could

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
easy access to that or you could

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.580 
easy access to that or you could
actually<00:02:53.640> since<00:02:54.390> this<00:02:54.510> seems<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.470> be

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
actually since this seems to be

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.530 
actually since this seems to be
completely<00:02:55.950> sealed<00:02:56.250> off<00:02:56.459> if<00:02:57.030> for<00:02:57.390> whatever

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
completely sealed off if for whatever

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.030 
completely sealed off if for whatever
reason<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:58.170> needed<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:58.470> stick<00:02:58.680> something<00:02:58.860> in

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
reason you needed to stick something in

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.410 
reason you needed to stick something in
here<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.310> actually<00:02:59.700> could<00:02:59.880> use<00:03:00.090> this<00:03:00.240> as

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
here you actually could use this as

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.240 
here you actually could use this as
carry<00:03:01.140> capacity<00:03:01.320> it'll<00:03:01.860> be<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:01.950> little<00:03:02.160> bit

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
carry capacity it'll be a little bit

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.199 
carry capacity it'll be a little bit
awkward<00:03:02.400> just<00:03:02.730> because<00:03:02.940> you'll<00:03:03.060> have<00:03:03.120> a

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
awkward just because you'll have a

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.790 
awkward just because you'll have a
jangling<00:03:03.660> back<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.110> forth<00:03:04.290> because<00:03:04.590> this

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
jangling back and forth because this

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.770 
jangling back and forth because this
doesn't<00:03:05.130> compress<00:03:05.430> but<00:03:06.060> if<00:03:06.270> you<00:03:06.420> need<00:03:06.570> for

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
doesn't compress but if you need for

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.090 
doesn't compress but if you need for
some<00:03:06.930> reason<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.290> stick<00:03:07.470> something<00:03:07.650> in<00:03:07.920> here

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
some reason to stick something in here

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.730 
some reason to stick something in here
you<00:03:08.250> could<00:03:08.430> that's<00:03:09.030> nice
