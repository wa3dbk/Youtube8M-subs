00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.320
So, last sunday we published in Stade 2 (French TV show]

00:00:04.338 --> 00:00:07.730
a short documentary about Chris Froome's power data.

00:00:08.393 --> 00:00:13.094
Team Sky, the trainers, and Chris Froome himself wanted to answer,

00:00:13.165 --> 00:00:16.325
and to publish their numbers.

00:00:16.325 --> 00:00:18.901
It was very interesting [no doubt you understood everything Gerard]

00:00:18.916 --> 00:00:23.793
It was yesterday during rest day, let's listen to their explanations.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:55.290
The "watts expert war" is about the ratio watts per kilogram of Chris Froome

00:00:55.512 --> 00:01:00.886
If this ratio stays below 6.5W/Kg

00:01:00.886 --> 00:01:05.406
the performance of the yellow jersey can't be questioned [WTF ??]

00:01:05.406 --> 00:01:07.009
[Transcription of the french journalist]

00:01:07.052 --> 00:01:11.898
To have a better comprehension of Chris's performance and the other cyclists at La Pierre-Saint-Martin,

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.474
We would like to publish some data recorded during this climb.

00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:23.589
What we know about Chris's power, is that he uses an ovoid chainrings.

00:01:23.713 --> 00:01:29.400
Asymetric chain rings mean that our power values over-read by about 6%.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.975
That's why you have to take account of this parameter when you deal with Chris's power data.

00:01:34.335 --> 00:01:42.868
With his weight, around 67.5kg, we have a correct ratio of...

00:01:42.876 --> 00:01:46.986
5.78W/kg [you can laugh now !]

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.382
Voilà ! The numbers announced by the Team Sky, about Froome's performances

00:01:53.702 --> 00:01:58.747
Christopher told us about the support he received from other cyclists of the peloton,

00:01:58.777 --> 00:02:02.131
that's the case of Tony Gallopin who wanted to react.

00:02:03.477 --> 00:02:05.274
I'm one of their first defender

00:02:05.274 --> 00:02:08.316
Because during the climb on the other day [Pierre-Saint-Martin]

00:02:08.316 --> 00:02:11.652
I think I climbed at 5.9 W/kg [more than the official numbers of Froome !]

00:02:11.652 --> 00:02:15.450
The legends of my childhood were around 6.7W/kg or 7W/kg

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.021
I would have lost 5 or 10 minutes !

00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:21.240
In my case, It's a power I'm able to produce,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.326
I passed a test before the French Championship in high mountains

00:02:25.326 --> 00:02:27.994
I pushed exactly the same watts during Le Tour de France

00:02:27.994 --> 00:02:30.781
So I'm the first to defend Sky

00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:35.444
I lost 2 minutes to Froome on the other day [Pierre-Saint-Martin]

00:02:35.646 --> 00:02:39.231
I think he climbed at 6.1W/kg or 6.2W/kg [-&gt; chronoswatts.com]

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:42.440
These are really normal watts

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.680
I'm not surprised,

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.076
quite the opposite,

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:52.634
I think the peloton is really clean,

00:02:52.634 --> 00:02:54.519
and I can make progress like that.

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.870
That's my analysis."

00:02:57.872 --> 00:02:59.972
And in order to complete the file,

00:02:59.972 --> 00:03:03.030
normally, during the next 2 or 3 stages in the Alps,

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:11.840
Froome promised us to show immediately his whole mechanic and bike !

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.585
Voilà !
