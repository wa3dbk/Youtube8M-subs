animal pack antioxidants are very

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.140 
animal pack antioxidants are very
important<00:01:04.100> in<00:01:04.190> helping<00:01:04.370> us<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.790> stay<00:01:04.970> healthy

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
important in helping us to stay healthy

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.600 
important in helping us to stay healthy
to<00:01:05.840> boost<00:01:06.050> our<00:01:06.200> immunity<00:01:06.560> as<00:01:06.799> we<00:01:06.950> know<00:01:07.130> and

to boost our immunity as we know and

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.860 
to boost our immunity as we know and
it's<00:01:07.909> very<00:01:07.940> important<00:01:08.540> when<00:01:08.659> we're<00:01:08.780> working

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
it's very important when we're working

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.810 
it's very important when we're working
out<00:01:09.200> because<00:01:09.440> we<00:01:09.590> put<00:01:09.770> a<00:01:09.799> lot<00:01:09.979> of<00:01:10.070> strain<00:01:10.340> a<00:01:10.610> lot

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
out because we put a lot of strain a lot

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.730 
out because we put a lot of strain a lot
of<00:01:10.909> stress<00:01:11.180> on<00:01:11.360> our<00:01:11.450> body<00:01:11.720> and<00:01:11.930> so<00:01:12.409> it's<00:01:12.560> very

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
of stress on our body and so it's very

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.440 
of stress on our body and so it's very
easy<00:01:12.890> to<00:01:13.220> get<00:01:13.310> sick<00:01:13.610> if<00:01:13.820> we're<00:01:14.030> not<00:01:14.180> getting

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
easy to get sick if we're not getting

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.420 
easy to get sick if we're not getting
the<00:01:14.540> proper<00:01:14.950> antioxidant<00:01:15.950> formula<00:01:16.310> in<00:01:16.370> our

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
the proper antioxidant formula in our

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.370 
the proper antioxidant formula in our
bodies<00:01:16.760> and<00:01:16.970> I<00:01:17.210> think<00:01:17.510> animal<00:01:17.990> pack<00:01:18.170> does<00:01:18.350> a

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
bodies and I think animal pack does a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.170 
bodies and I think animal pack does a
really<00:01:18.590> good<00:01:18.800> job<00:01:18.860> with<00:01:19.280> their<00:01:19.550> combination

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
really good job with their combination

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.490 
really good job with their combination
and<00:01:20.300> the<00:01:20.390> components<00:01:20.870> that<00:01:20.960> they've<00:01:21.110> used<00:01:21.140> for

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
and the components that they've used for

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.050 
and the components that they've used for
their<00:01:21.620> antioxidants<00:01:22.340> now<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.760> very<00:01:23.000> last

previous videos amino acids are the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.350 
previous videos amino acids are the
building<00:01:30.470> blocks<00:01:31.040> of<00:01:31.280> protein<00:01:31.820> in<00:01:31.940> our<00:01:32.000> bodies

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
building blocks of protein in our bodies

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.090 
building blocks of protein in our bodies
so<00:01:32.870> it's<00:01:33.020> going<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.230> help<00:01:33.350> rebuild<00:01:33.950> those
