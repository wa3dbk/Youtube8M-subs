00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
this is a formula 1 game that the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.000 
this is a formula 1 game that the
controls<00:00:50.180> are<00:00:50.720> a<00:00:50.750> lot<00:00:51.110> different<00:00:51.140> than<00:00:51.680> grand

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
controls are a lot different than grand

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.010 
controls are a lot different than grand
chorizo<00:00:52.310> a<00:00:52.520> lot<00:00:52.670> more<00:00:52.760> Twitty<00:00:53.120> these<00:00:53.750> cars

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
chorizo a lot more Twitty these cars

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.510 
chorizo a lot more Twitty these cars
have<00:00:54.140> a<00:00:54.320> lot<00:00:54.530> of<00:00:54.560> downforce<00:00:54.860> so<00:00:55.280> they<00:00:55.370> can

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
have a lot of downforce so they can

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.700 
have a lot of downforce so they can
really<00:00:55.700> get<00:00:55.910> around<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.660> track<00:00:56.990> really<00:00:57.500> well

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
really get around the track really well

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.220 
really get around the track really well
and<00:00:58.220> they<00:00:58.730> just<00:00:58.940> they're<00:00:59.270> light<00:00:59.600> they're<00:00:59.630> fast

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
and they just they're light they're fast

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.290 
and they just they're light they're fast
and<00:01:00.590> they're<00:01:00.650> kind<00:01:01.370> of<00:01:01.430> hard<00:01:01.580> to<00:01:01.730> control<00:01:02.030> but

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
and they're kind of hard to control but

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.550 
and they're kind of hard to control but
that's<00:01:02.480> kind<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:02.720> the<00:01:02.810> challenge<00:01:03.170> of<00:01:03.230> the<00:01:03.350> game

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
that's kind of the challenge of the game

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.690 
that's kind of the challenge of the game
so<00:01:05.470> let's<00:01:06.470> get<00:01:06.620> right<00:01:06.800> into<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:07.190> we're<00:01:07.490> about

one<00:01:10.430> of<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.610> nicest<00:01:10.820> tracks<00:01:11.270> on<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:11.570> formula

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
one of the nicest tracks on the formula

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.719 
one of the nicest tracks on the formula
one<00:01:12.050> circuit<00:01:12.440> it's<00:01:12.560> beautiful<00:01:13.130> it's<00:01:13.340> really

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
one circuit it's beautiful it's really

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:14.510 
one circuit it's beautiful it's really
long

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
long

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.240
