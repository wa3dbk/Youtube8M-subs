00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.370
 Yes Hello summer town it is this time 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.630
 I say it is a little development of origami 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:17.100
 By applying the origami 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:20.460
 I think that I would like to explain how to make the selling method such as how to fold the equine and equilateral triangle 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.140
 Well the multiple-that such common copy 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.210
 Make a square from 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:30.710
 Furthermore, when making an equilateral triangle 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:35.540
 We explain how to make It is how to make the west right first 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:42.489
 Well this is a common copy oc but make a square from a rectangle 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.489
 In pattern best as the first one simple to is here of 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:50.510
 Large leaves you in accordance with the individual sticky notes 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.680
 Well I know this is anyone better Well 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.100
 In the forestem 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:01.100
 I think I will be fishing 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:03.940
 9 will flow and 9 will be together, so the names of the four gods are like 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.940
 When it becomes equal 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.750
 Well say here 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.750
 It's beautifully folded 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.980
 This is a square duty 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:30.380
 I will have one more pattern 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:30.380
 Fold in seismic half by half this I'd I also knew 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.500
 I will do that 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.890
 In accordance with the line of middle here 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.890
 I am at a right angle 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.520
 Follow this 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.320
 in this way 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.320
 Match to 9 battles 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.790
 I wonder if little Shinoda and no water 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.240
 And place 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:09.759
 9 ah to meet here 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.759
 Then here and here 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.490
 Target 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.760
 Joint or not 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.410
 Because it is coverage 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.420
 The length here and heart flow all together 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:26.790
 Follow 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:28.790
 Visiting the first line and the second line 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.239
 By'm leading 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.239
 olde 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:42.230
 Then here is 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.230
 It will be a little difficult for production Ha square 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.000
 Oh hey eh 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.750
 Ah 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:57.510
 There is also a way to make such a square 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:03:02.540
 Yes, but following it or the next 's government phimosis is how to get off of an equilateral triangle 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:05.319
 Please start from a square with an equilateral triangle 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.319
 In this 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.600
 In half 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.530
 Horima 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.150
 Wait 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:18.519
 Go ask spread 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.519
 With the middle line here 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:30.900
 This corner is so straight 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.900
 A little technique is called in Mishima Ha Doppo 2-string so 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.160
 A beautiful hole as it comes to the corner 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:48.130
 Here it does not have the same approximate number is also certain the same want to tell the 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.850
 Here beautifully 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:55.010
 In this corner groove 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.010
 It 's a bit difficult to come 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:04.819
 If you take it like this 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:08.010
 In short, here and here the length is not the same 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:11.580
 In length of here 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:19.139
 If you bring it here, the catfish here and the length here 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:20.630
 Of course triangle made individual length also here because together in a will to the fact that an equilateral triangle 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:27.410
 I will 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:29.969
 Well this Ha that One useful if the actual aged gold Well, but is how to make a do of an equilateral triangle 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:34.430
 I do not think so much 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:37.760
 It seems like a knowledgeable doctor if you know 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:42.700
 I think that there is no loss if you know that everyone will try 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.700
 Please look this time Thank you looks like
