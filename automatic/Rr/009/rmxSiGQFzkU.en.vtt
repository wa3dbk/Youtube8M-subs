00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
the gain pot basically pedal pretty much

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.230 
the gain pot basically pedal pretty much
sounds<00:01:40.830> like<00:01:40.920> an<00:01:41.040> overdrive<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:41.730> most<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
sounds like an overdrive for most of the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.020 
sounds like an overdrive for most of the
the<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:43.080> range<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.340> gain<00:01:44.520> pop<00:01:44.790> when<00:01:44.970> you

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
the the range of the gain pop when you

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.880 
the the range of the gain pop when you
get<00:01:45.150> it<00:01:45.240> up<00:01:45.360> above<00:01:45.600> 2<00:01:45.780> or<00:01:45.930> 3<00:01:46.140> o'clock<00:01:46.230> it<00:01:46.650> really

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
get it up above 2 or 3 o'clock it really

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.680 
get it up above 2 or 3 o'clock it really
becomes<00:01:47.160> kind<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.640> fuzz<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.570> it's

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
becomes kind of like a fuzz so it's

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.320 
becomes kind of like a fuzz so it's
really<00:01:48.840> versatile<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.350> cool<00:01:50.090> you<00:01:51.090> heard<00:01:51.240> it

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
really versatile and cool you heard it

really versatile and cool you heard it
on<00:01:51.390> all<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.720> guitars<00:01:52.050> at<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.620> beginning<00:01:52.830> of

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
on all the guitars at the beginning of

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.520 
on all the guitars at the beginning of
the<00:01:53.070> video<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.120> song<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.930> Telecaster

the video on that song the Telecaster

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.320 
the video on that song the Telecaster
part<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.830> was<00:01:55.950> aiming<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.310> kind<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.730> add<00:01:57.000> a

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
part I was aiming to kind of add a

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.380 
part I was aiming to kind of add a
little<00:01:57.360> bit<00:01:57.720> of<00:01:57.750> crunch<00:01:58.050> and<00:01:58.380> thickness<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.550> to

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
little bit of crunch and thickness to to

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.240 
little bit of crunch and thickness to to
that<00:02:00.540> particular<00:02:01.020> tone<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.620> you<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.040> hear<00:02:02.220> it

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
that particular tone and you can hear it

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.760 
that particular tone and you can hear it
just<00:02:02.340> adds<00:02:02.640> girth<00:02:02.940> and<00:02:03.300> you<00:02:03.810> know<00:02:03.930> mix<00:02:04.560> that

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
just adds girth and you know mix that

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.340 
just adds girth and you know mix that
that<00:02:05.330> crunch<00:02:06.330> up<00:02:06.480> really<00:02:06.750> nice<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:06.960> just

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
that crunch up really nice and just

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.960 
that crunch up really nice and just
sounded<00:02:07.590> really<00:02:07.800> cool<00:02:08.040> I<00:02:08.100> thought<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.730> a<00:02:08.790> kind

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
sounded really cool I thought in a kind

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.140 
sounded really cool I thought in a kind
of<00:02:09.030> vintage<00:02:09.240> /<00:02:09.600> driveway<00:02:10.280> on<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.820> Les<00:02:12.120> Paul

part<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.959> used<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.380> setting<00:02:13.680> on<00:02:13.740> this<00:02:13.920> pedal<00:02:14.220> not

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
part I used a setting on this pedal not

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.160 
part I used a setting on this pedal not
available<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.270> original<00:02:15.780> color<00:02:15.959> sound

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
available on the original color sound

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.600 
available on the original color sound
pedal<00:02:16.560> at<00:02:16.650> all<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.130> that's<00:02:17.190> it's<00:02:17.400> got<00:02:17.520> the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
pedal at all and that's it's got the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.949 
pedal at all and that's it's got the
switch<00:02:17.880> here<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.209> allows<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.600> switch<00:02:18.750> in

switch here that allows you to switch in

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.350 
switch here that allows you to switch in
some<00:02:19.170> germanium<00:02:19.709> transistors<00:02:20.400> for<00:02:20.970> an<00:02:21.090> extra

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
some germanium transistors for an extra

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.840 
some germanium transistors for an extra
little<00:02:21.510> layer<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.840> compressed<00:02:22.650> fuzzy<00:02:23.550> grind

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
little layer of compressed fuzzy grind

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.170 
little layer of compressed fuzzy grind
and<00:02:24.209> I<00:02:24.930> love<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:25.470> slide<00:02:25.800> toner<00:02:26.070> got<00:02:26.370> on<00:02:27.000> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
and I love that slide toner got on the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.280 
and I love that slide toner got on the
song<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.540> beginning<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.930> video<00:02:28.050> so

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
song of the beginning of the video so

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.420 
song of the beginning of the video so
that<00:02:28.380> something<00:02:28.560> I'll<00:02:28.739> definitely<00:02:29.100> want<00:02:29.400> to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
that something I'll definitely want to

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.449 
that something I'll definitely want to
be<00:02:29.580> using<00:02:29.880> again<00:02:30.770> also<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:32.190> pedal<00:02:32.430> has

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
be using again also the pedal has

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.699 
be using again also the pedal has
throwbacks<00:02:33.300> pregame<00:02:33.780> circuit<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.470> what<00:02:34.530> that

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
throwbacks pregame circuit and what that

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.080 
throwbacks pregame circuit and what that
is<00:02:34.890> there's<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.250> little<00:02:35.430> trim<00:02:35.640> pot<00:02:35.880> on<00:02:36.000> the

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
is there's a little trim pot on the

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.580 
is there's a little trim pot on the
inside<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.540> pedal<00:02:36.840> if<00:02:36.989> you<00:02:37.080> hit<00:02:37.470> this

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
inside of the pedal if you hit this

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.500 
inside of the pedal if you hit this
button<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:38.070> its<00:02:38.280> which<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.760> trim<00:02:39.120> pot<00:02:39.330> in

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
button on its which is that trim pot in

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.330 
button on its which is that trim pot in
line<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.020> allows<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.739> basically<00:02:40.860> fine

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
line and allows you to basically fine

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.010

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
off the gain a little bit here and see

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:17.540 
off the gain a little bit here and see
what<00:07:08.919> that<00:07:09.039> sounds<00:07:09.340> like

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 
you can get quite a bit of sustained

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.200 
you can get quite a bit of sustained
Haffner<00:07:20.010> with<00:07:20.100> the<00:07:20.190> gain<00:07:20.370> almost<00:07:20.700> maxed<00:07:20.910> out

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.670 
Haffner with the gain almost maxed out
now<00:07:21.720> let's<00:07:21.900> turn<00:07:22.080> on<00:07:22.200> the<00:07:22.290> germanium

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 
now let's turn on the germanium

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.080 
now let's turn on the germanium
transistors<00:07:23.490> and<00:07:23.640> you<00:07:23.700> can<00:07:23.790> hear<00:07:23.940> what<00:07:23.970> that

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.090 
transistors and you can hear what that

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.600 
transistors and you can hear what that
does<00:07:24.420> just<00:07:24.720> adds<00:07:24.900> a<00:07:24.990> subtle<00:07:25.230> compression<00:07:26.070> and

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:26.610 
does just adds a subtle compression and

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:44.290 
does just adds a subtle compression and
it's<00:07:27.270> cool

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:44.300 

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.430 

and<00:07:45.300> it<00:07:45.390> gives<00:07:45.570> that<00:07:45.630> kind<00:07:45.930> of<00:07:46.020> grind<00:07:46.290> that

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 
and it gives that kind of grind that

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.010 
and it gives that kind of grind that
only<00:07:46.620> germanium<00:07:47.220> can<00:07:47.460> it's<00:07:47.640> really<00:07:47.880> unique

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:48.020 
only germanium can it's really unique
