00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.000
 Once you let the darkness in ... 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.750
 ... no longer goes away. 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.520
 There's a new player we've tracked ... 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.350
 We called it Deathstroke! 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.940
 You can't die 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.360
 Until you have experienced complete despair. 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.360
 You honor the dead by fighting 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.360
 And you're not done fighting. 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.570
 And you'll stop Slade. 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.680
 You helped me become a hero, Slade 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.760
 Thank you 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.520
 A man cannot live with two names. 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.060
 You know what it means ... 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.900
 Your situation, I believe means that it is not happening by chance. 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.100
 Two years ago, the citizens of Starling City thought I was dead. 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.280
 But I'm back. 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.950
 You never thought we would be partners 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.080
 Not the best thing for the company 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.950
 Ray Palmer 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.620
 Nice to meet you, I love your company. 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.040
 I can't have you on the field anymore. 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.830
 Damn, you'd be dead 3 times if it wasn't for me. 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.330
 Some things never die ... 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.130
 You for example 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.370
 Don't make that surprised face 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.510
 I haven't been away this long ... 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.140
 We can't hide under a mask when people don't allow you to wear one. 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.760
 Felicity, would you like to have dinner with me? 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.700
 In the 5 years I've been away, I haven't always been to Lian Yu 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.700
 And where? 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.320
 You should know, that I'll never stop trying to escape 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.370
 And you should know that it is extremely easy to kill someone you think is already dead. 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.510
 YOU BETRAYED THIS CITY' 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.890
