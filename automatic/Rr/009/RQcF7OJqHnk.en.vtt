silver<00:03:12.810> casting<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.650> think<00:03:14.250> there<00:03:14.370> should<00:03:14.400> be<00:03:14.700> a

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730

tail<00:03:42.720> lights<00:03:42.930> are<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.140> little<00:03:43.320> bit<00:03:43.530> lacking<00:03:43.830> in

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
tail lights are a little bit lacking in

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.280 
tail lights are a little bit lacking in
detail<00:03:45.830> there<00:03:46.830> should<00:03:47.280> be<00:03:47.640> a<00:03:48.000> white<00:03:48.660> reverse

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
detail there should be a white reverse

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.509 
detail there should be a white reverse
light<00:03:49.620> in<00:03:49.800> the<00:03:49.890> center<00:03:50.250> I<00:03:50.280> actually<00:03:50.760> added<00:03:51.209> one

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
light in the center I actually added one

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.640 
light in the center I actually added one
with<00:03:53.519> some<00:03:53.880> modeling<00:03:54.570> paint<00:03:54.840> didn't<00:03:55.290> like<00:03:55.440> it

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
with some modeling paint didn't like it

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.100 
with some modeling paint didn't like it
so<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:55.830> took<00:03:55.950> it<00:03:56.160> off<00:03:56.480> but<00:03:57.480> there<00:03:57.630> should<00:03:57.900> be<00:03:57.930> a

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
so I took it off but there should be a

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.410 
so I took it off but there should be a
white<00:03:58.470> light<00:03:59.400> detail<00:03:59.850> right<00:04:00.090> there<00:04:00.300> I<00:04:00.330> think

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
white light detail right there I think

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.199 
white light detail right there I think
you<00:04:00.660> can<00:04:00.840> kind<00:04:01.140> of<00:04:01.200> see<00:04:01.790> where<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:02.880> should<00:04:03.180> be

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
you can kind of see where it should be

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.670 
you can kind of see where it should be
so<00:04:03.980> that's<00:04:04.980> just<00:04:05.130> something<00:04:05.340> they<00:04:05.580> didn't<00:04:05.820> add

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
so that's just something they didn't add

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.320 
so that's just something they didn't add
but<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:08.070> can<00:04:08.190> always<00:04:08.340> add<00:04:08.610> that<00:04:08.850> whether<00:04:09.090> if

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
but you can always add that whether if

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.030 
but you can always add that whether if
you<00:04:09.360> so<00:04:09.690> wish

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
you so wish
