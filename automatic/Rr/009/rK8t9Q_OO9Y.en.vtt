up<00:00:16.350> some<00:00:16.619> with<00:00:16.770> wheels<00:00:17.010> some<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.610> pad<00:00:17.850> of

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
up some with wheels some of the pad of

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.269 
up some with wheels some of the pad of
the<00:00:18.990> new<00:00:19.199> build<00:00:20.810> looking<00:00:21.810> far<00:00:22.320> way<00:00:23.250> more

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
the new build looking far way more

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.689 
the new build looking far way more
impressive<00:00:24.000> than<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.240> was<00:00:24.390> last<00:00:24.420> year<00:00:25.699> but

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
impressive than it was last year but

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.349 
impressive than it was last year but
jumping<00:00:27.630> into<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.619> game<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.250> I've<00:00:29.699> opted<00:00:30.240> for

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
jumping into the game and I've opted for

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.880 
jumping into the game and I've opted for
this<00:00:30.449> little<00:00:30.720> set<00:00:30.869> up<00:00:31.050> there<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.380> screen<00:00:31.710> was

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
this little set up there the screen was

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.490 
this little set up there the screen was
quite<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> long<00:00:32.369> way<00:00:32.550> from<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.940> wheels<00:00:33.440> so<00:00:34.440> I've

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
quite a long way from the wheels so I've

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.930 
quite a long way from the wheels so I've
just<00:00:34.560> sort<00:00:34.830> of<00:00:34.860> zoomed<00:00:35.220> in<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.700> for<00:00:35.850> you

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
just sort of zoomed in on it for you

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.660 
just sort of zoomed in on it for you
guys<00:00:36.320> and<00:00:37.320> what<00:00:37.380> I've<00:00:37.770> dies<00:00:37.950> put<00:00:38.220> these<00:00:38.400> games

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
guys and what I've dies put these games

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.850 
guys and what I've dies put these games
in<00:00:38.850> order<00:00:39.240> so<00:00:39.690> I've<00:00:40.020> not<00:00:40.170> cut<00:00:40.350> anything<00:00:40.560> out

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
in order so I've not cut anything out

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.710 
in order so I've not cut anything out
I've<00:00:41.130> just<00:00:41.190> sort<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.820> shown<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.450> raw

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
I've just sort of shown you the raw

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.520 
I've just sort of shown you the raw
learning<00:00:43.560> and<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.460> means<00:00:44.900> boom<00:00:45.900> that

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
learning and so this means boom that

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.050 
learning and so this means boom that
wasn't<00:00:46.830> too<00:00:46.980> good<00:00:47.160> for<00:00:47.430> me<00:00:47.580> on<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.790> first

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
wasn't too good for me on the first

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.960 
wasn't too good for me on the first
corner<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.650> play<00:00:49.800> racing<00:00:50.070> games<00:00:50.520> honest

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
corner I can play racing games honest

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.050 
corner I can play racing games honest
and<00:00:51.650> so<00:00:52.650> right<00:00:52.950> that<00:00:53.100> didn't<00:00:53.340> work<00:00:53.460> for<00:00:53.520> me<00:00:53.760> now

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
and so right that didn't work for me now

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.210 
and so right that didn't work for me now
never<00:00:54.810> been<00:00:54.990> on<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.170> track<00:00:55.560> never<00:00:56.010> driven

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
never been on this track never driven

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.910 
never been on this track never driven
this<00:00:56.400> car<00:00:56.460> didn't<00:00:57.210> know<00:00:57.270> where<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.450> was<00:00:57.480> going

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
this car didn't know where I was going

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.900 
this car didn't know where I was going
hadn't<00:00:58.920> picked<00:00:59.100> up<00:00:59.220> on<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.490> map<00:00:59.700> in<00:00:59.880> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
hadn't picked up on the map in the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.280 
hadn't picked up on the map in the
bottom<00:01:00.210> corner<00:01:00.240> yet<00:01:00.720> I<00:01:00.750> was<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.050> simply

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
bottom corner yet I was just simply

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.260 
bottom corner yet I was just simply
focusing<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:01.950> the<00:01:02.040> gameplay<00:01:02.490> flat<00:01:03.060> out

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
focusing on the gameplay flat out

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.999 
focusing on the gameplay flat out
through<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.690> corner<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.290> thought<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.830> may<00:01:04.979> as

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
through that corner I thought I may as

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.859 
through that corner I thought I may as
well<00:01:05.250> just<00:01:05.489> put<00:01:05.670> my<00:01:05.820> foot<00:01:06.030> down<00:01:06.060> now<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.540> close

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
well just put my foot down now to close

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.109 
well just put my foot down now to close
up<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.259> these<00:01:07.409> guys<00:01:07.729> just<00:01:08.729> through<00:01:09.000> this

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
up on these guys just through this

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.520 
up on these guys just through this
section<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.930> was<00:01:10.020> getting<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> hang<00:01:10.440> of

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
section and that was getting a hang of

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.680 
section and that was getting a hang of
looking<00:01:11.280> at<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> map<00:01:11.730> I<00:01:11.940> believe<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
looking at the map I believe in just a

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.070 
looking at the map I believe in just a
moment<00:01:13.020> realizing<00:01:13.110> all<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> map<00:01:14.040> there

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
moment realizing all of the map there

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.940 
moment realizing all of the map there
didn't<00:01:16.080> know<00:01:16.170> what<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.380> was<00:01:16.440> for<00:01:16.710> at<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
didn't know what that was for at the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.920 
didn't know what that was for at the
time<00:01:16.980> I<00:01:17.460> thought<00:01:17.700> I'll<00:01:17.910> realize<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.720> just<00:01:18.870> a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
time I thought I'll realize in just a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.210 
time I thought I'll realize in just a
moment<00:01:19.260> you've<00:01:19.410> got<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.620> stay<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> racing

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
moment you've got to stay on the racing

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.540 
moment you've got to stay on the racing
line<00:01:20.250> through<00:01:20.610> those<00:01:20.730> sections<00:01:22.550> just

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
as a wheel assist on here we're using a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.590 
as a wheel assist on here we're using a
semi-automatic<00:01:40.320> gearbox<00:01:40.970> so<00:01:41.970> occasionally

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
semi-automatic gearbox so occasionally

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.230 
semi-automatic gearbox so occasionally
I'm<00:01:42.990> shifting<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.740> want<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.580> break<00:01:44.760> heavily<00:01:45.210> I

I'm shifting I want to break heavily I
can<00:01:45.510> just<00:01:45.690> break<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.350> gears<00:01:46.590> as<00:01:46.830> well<00:01:47.180> not<00:01:48.180> too

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
can just break the gears as well not too

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.480 
can just break the gears as well not too
much<00:01:48.540> at<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> moment<00:01:48.960> things<00:01:49.740> generally<00:01:50.220> just

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
much at the moment things generally just

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.820 
much at the moment things generally just
automatic<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.360> glam<00:01:51.510> of<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.690> flow<00:01:51.900> the

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
automatic and glam of the flow the

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.260 
automatic and glam of the flow the
automatic<00:01:53.310> gears<00:01:53.520> were<00:01:53.640> very<00:01:53.850> efficient

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
automatic gears were very efficient

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.389 
automatic gears were very efficient
and<00:01:55.630> so<00:01:55.899> in<00:01:55.990> terms<00:01:56.170> of<00:01:56.350> handling<00:01:56.619> how's<00:01:57.219> it

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
and so in terms of handling how's it

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:58.620 
and so in terms of handling how's it
moved<00:01:57.579> forward<00:01:57.939> well<00:01:58.119> we're<00:01:58.210> going<00:01:58.329> to<00:01:58.390> assess

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
moved forward well we're going to assess

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.539 
moved forward well we're going to assess
that<00:01:58.810> through<00:01:59.049> each<00:01:59.140> video<00:01:59.530> I'm<00:02:00.130> still<00:02:00.429> at<00:02:00.520> a

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
that through each video I'm still at a

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.510 
that through each video I'm still at a
point<00:02:00.789> here<00:02:01.060> where<00:02:01.210> I'm<00:02:01.329> trying<00:02:01.509> to<00:02:02.520> discover

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
point here where I'm trying to discover

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.310 
point here where I'm trying to discover
how<00:02:03.759> fast<00:02:04.090> I<00:02:04.270> can<00:02:04.329> go<00:02:04.539> through<00:02:04.780> a<00:02:04.840> corner

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
how fast I can go through a corner

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.560 
how fast I can go through a corner
without<00:02:05.469> lifting<00:02:05.890> them<00:02:06.369> with<00:02:07.060> lifting

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
without lifting them with lifting

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.389 
without lifting them with lifting
obviously<00:02:08.170> I<00:02:08.200> wanted<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.530> turn<00:02:08.739> one<00:02:08.979> before

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
obviously I wanted to turn one before

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.699 
obviously I wanted to turn one before
thinking<00:02:10.269> I<00:02:10.360> could<00:02:10.420> go<00:02:10.660> into<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:11.019> faster<00:02:11.530> than

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
thinking I could go into it faster than

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.160 
thinking I could go into it faster than
I<00:02:11.799> actually<00:02:11.860> could<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:13.299> this<00:02:13.599> time<00:02:13.780> I'm<00:02:13.959> going

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
I actually could so this time I'm going

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.559 
I actually could so this time I'm going
to<00:02:14.290> be<00:02:14.590> lifting<00:02:15.190> into<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.519> corner<00:02:15.910> breaking<00:02:16.269> a

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
to be lifting into the corner breaking a

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.830 
to be lifting into the corner breaking a
bit<00:02:16.750> more<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:18.310> AI<00:02:18.400> obviously<00:02:18.819> I<00:02:19.269> closed<00:02:19.510> up<00:02:19.540> on

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
bit more the AI obviously I closed up on

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.390 
bit more the AI obviously I closed up on
them<00:02:19.959> under<00:02:20.170> braking<00:02:20.379> a<00:02:20.680> lot<00:02:20.860> more<00:02:21.040> than<00:02:21.310> I

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
them under braking a lot more than I

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.130 
them under braking a lot more than I
would<00:02:22.060> expect<00:02:22.090> so<00:02:23.160> we<00:02:24.160> managed<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:25.140> counter

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
would expect so we managed to counter

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.990 
would expect so we managed to counter
steer<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.530> car<00:02:26.739> keep<00:02:27.489> it<00:02:27.610> on<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.790> straight

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
steer the car keep it on the straight

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.309 
steer the car keep it on the straight
and<00:02:28.030> narrow<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.569> time<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.019> that<00:02:29.079> worked

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
and narrow that time and that worked

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.229 
and narrow that time and that worked
well<00:02:29.470> with<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.709> wheel<00:02:29.860> so<00:02:30.160> so<00:02:30.670> far<00:02:30.910> how<00:02:31.090> am<00:02:31.180> i

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
well with the wheel so so far how am i

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.670 
well with the wheel so so far how am i
finding<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.690> quite<00:02:31.840> intuitive<00:02:32.140> for<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.560> wheel

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
finding it quite intuitive for the wheel

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.920 
finding it quite intuitive for the wheel
so<00:02:32.920> far<00:02:33.220> first<00:02:33.610> lap<00:02:33.819> down<00:02:34.030> pretty<00:02:34.750> good

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
so far first lap down pretty good

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.530 
so far first lap down pretty good
working<00:02:35.560> well<00:02:36.030> just<00:02:37.030> going<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.209> learn<00:02:37.329> those

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
working well just going to learn those

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.930 
working well just going to learn those

it's<00:02:43.690> very<00:02:43.810> easy<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.110> slide<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.739> car<00:02:45.480> drifted

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
it's very easy to slide the car drifted

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.110 
it's very easy to slide the car drifted
through<00:02:46.510> corners<00:02:47.579> almost<00:02:48.579> like<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.760> car<00:02:48.940> did

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120

through corners almost like the car did
itself<00:02:49.599> this<00:02:50.079> time<00:02:50.290> it's<00:02:50.440> a<00:02:50.560> more<00:02:51.459> challenging

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
itself this time it's a more challenging

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.000

and trying to get the car to drift

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.039 
and trying to get the car to drift
however<00:02:54.879> the<00:02:54.970> overall<00:02:55.299> difficulty<00:02:55.750> it's

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
however the overall difficulty it's

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.350 
however the overall difficulty it's
pretty<00:02:56.230> straightforward<00:02:57.090> keeping<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.180> car

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
pretty straightforward keeping the car

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.020 
pretty straightforward keeping the car
together<00:02:58.510> that's<00:02:58.900> nice<00:02:59.489> it<00:03:00.489> was<00:03:00.639> nice<00:03:00.790> when

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
together that's nice it was nice when

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.160 
together that's nice it was nice when
you<00:03:01.120> can<00:03:01.150> counter<00:03:01.569> steer<00:03:01.840> in<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:01.989> game<00:03:02.139> like

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
you can counter steer in a game like

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.900 
you can counter steer in a game like
this<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.500> know<00:03:02.709> so<00:03:02.889> many<00:03:03.130> get<00:03:03.370> into<00:03:03.579> a<00:03:03.609> kind<00:03:03.790> of

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
this you know so many get into a kind of

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.270 
this you know so many get into a kind of
tank<00:03:04.180> slapper<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.870> then<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:05.650> find<00:03:05.920> yourself

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
tank slapper and then you find yourself

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.520 
tank slapper and then you find yourself
struggling<00:03:06.609> to<00:03:06.970> get<00:03:07.060> out<00:03:07.120> of<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.540> slide<00:03:08.230> or

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
struggling to get out of the slide or

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.140 
struggling to get out of the slide or
backing<00:03:08.799> off<00:03:09.100> at<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.430> power<00:03:09.639> to<00:03:09.910> try<00:03:10.120> and

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
backing off at the power to try and

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.420 
backing off at the power to try and
regain<00:03:10.510> control<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:14.680> there's<00:03:14.889> a<00:03:14.980> level<00:03:15.280> of

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
regain control so there's a level of

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.289 
regain control so there's a level of
