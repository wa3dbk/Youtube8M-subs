00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.070
 about tips for the delineated eyes and 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.839
 I know that many of you have thousands 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.180
 of questions with that but today I want them 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.270
 give 5 basic tips that will help them 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.060
 much at the time of delineating to choose the 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.360
 color and to know how they should do it with 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.980
 a few super easy steps so I hope 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.200
 that you like this video 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.880
 remember to follow personal marketing in 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.129

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.920
 informed more about all the products 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.390
 they have a makeup 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.850
 gorgeous have also fashion clothes 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.370
 accessories the accessories are divine and 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.350
 moss I love them and they fascinate me so 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.120
 I'm going to leave all the links of them in 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.219
 the bottom part and they also have a 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.170
 youtube channel for you to go 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.870
 and subscribe that I'm also going to 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.789
 leave on the bottom so I do not 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.399
 being more let's start with the tips 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.390
 of makeup for the eyes with 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.239
 delineated 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.489
 the tip number 1 that I want to give you is 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.830
 that if you have dark circles 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.050
 under the eyes or have this part 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.820
 from here very dark good those little spots 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.640
 that exist there that are not very nice 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.590
 if you use a brown eyeliner this 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.619
 will make dark circles or the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.050
 spots stand out much more while 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.270
 if they use a totally black pencil or a 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.330
 totally black eyeliner is going to 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.159
 help counteract the appearance of 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.350
 any imperfections that have coffee 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.080
 in the face so girls if you guys 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.840
 they have some spot chau chau chau 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.210
 all coffee eyeliners women 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.000
 who are more adult and do not want the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.550
 look you see them very very strong if 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.550
 can opt for a brown color like this 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.180
 or you can also choose a blue that 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.190
 do not be as dark as black and this 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.650
 will make your look look definite 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.570
 but at the same time it does not look so 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.880
 strong because the factions with the years 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.710
 they are changing then if you are 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.990
 some adult women I recommend them 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.970
 stay with the tones a bit more 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.250
 Of course, there's also black 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.830
 tones that are gray blue or brown and that 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.070
 they will be divine for your look 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.830
 third for you to delineate your eyes 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.270
 the best way to start is always going to 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.850
 be with a pencil because it's the 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.620
 tool easier to handle for the 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.840
 delineated voice then with this one 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.030
 you can do the exact way that you 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.880
 they want in the eyes and from there they can 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.739
 move to delineate the / as echÃ¡rselos with 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.870
 shadows and only want it as well as 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.060
 a gentle outline or if you already want 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.160
 start with a liquid eyeliner or with 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.530
 a gel eyeliner but always 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.000
 start with the pencil to draw the envelope 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.489
 everything while they become more 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.770
 Experts on the subject of the fourth outlined 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.480
 we all want to have a super look 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.280
 great that our eyes look like 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.300
 owl good at least me if I want that 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.010
 look like this 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.650
 and one of the ways to do it is not 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.810
 delineating us the eye inside a 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.970
 dark color rather choose in one color 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.430
 of your same skin tone or these that are 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.590
 like a gold or silver 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.600
 with what I outlined and that is going to 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.970
 make your eyes look much more 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.180
 big because it's going to give the appearance of 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.800
 that the space of the eye takes up a lot 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.470
 much more space and that's going to make them 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.380
 see the super sexy look and I know that they 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.450
 will love to apply this trick another 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.850
 very important thing is that most of 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.460
 women more or less 80% of the 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.670
 women have their eyes closed 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.580
 that means that if we measure our 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.740
 eyes we would not have a third eye of the 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.740
 same size of our eyes obviously 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.020
 between the eyes but we would miss 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.880
 space to fill it there so 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.920
 we have a tendency to see that 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.270
 the eyes look more closed when 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:53.120
 we delineate the eyes of the whole corner 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.220
 external ex internal corner in the part 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.470
 below we will help to close 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.960
 very much the look therefore if 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.020
 it only delineates the top part of the 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.390
 all and only a quarter of that of the 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.280
 bottom part is going to be that your look will 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.590
 see much more clear of the eyes 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.680
 much more open and you will see more 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.180
 harmony on your face and after these 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.670
 tips that I hope have been very 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.040
 useful for you I'll leave you with 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.230
 a mini tutorial of how I delineated myself 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.330
 the eyes applying these principles of 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.030
 those that I just talked to you and also 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.730
 there is an extra tip that is very very very 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.350
 important when it comes to delineating 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.690
 remember again follow marketing 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.130
 personal in all your social networks and 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.260
 all those products that I am using 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.910
 You can also find them in the 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.910
 personal marketing catalogs 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.470
 to delineate the eye then first what 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.270
 Let's do with pencil and the first thing that 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.970
 we're going to do to not stretch our 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.980
 Eyelid is doing it very close to the 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.350
 eyelashes this is a matter of patience 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.330
 but it is the best way to not be 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.010
 stretching the skin of the eyelids that is 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.560
 so sensitive and has so little 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.350
 elasticity is first we do it very 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.570
 very close to the eyelashes and already 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.210
 after we have it there we go to 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.760
 take him out like a tail in the part of 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.590
 out of the eye that is going to be our 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.840
 delineated cat then first what 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.510
 we took out and then we started to join 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.600
 with the outline that we already have and what 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.630
 let's start to put thicker in the 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.180
 as we approach it to the eye 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.550
 until we gave it the thickness and the 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.190
 way that we want and we go back to 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.590
 pass with the pencil this is the type here 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.930
 I'm doing two lines with the 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.120
 black pencil and a hello I'm sealing with 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.210
 shadow that is for you to see the 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.340
 importance of sealing the delineated 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.770
 pencil with shadow to last all the 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.540
 day and so they are not running and 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.240
 look how a finger went 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.940
 and the one who has shade almost does not move and 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.770
 which is only the pencil if it moves and 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.590
 this does not depend on the brand does not depend 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.170
 nothing or to all the pencils happens to them 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:05.440
 exactly the same thing so after 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.930
 give them this tip I will start to seal 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.870
 the outlined with shadow so that we 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.210
 last all day long and then I'll 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:16.150
 finish outlining a quarter of the 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:19.060
 part of the eyes below to give 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.860
 an almond shape to look and now 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.320
 with this seal again with shadow and 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.780
 I hope then that there is 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.120
 served a lot this video I send you a 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.880

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.040
 Tuesday here in makeup by carolina 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.050
 remember also share this video 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.060
 with all your contacts so that all 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.370

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.470
 the products that we already have or those that 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.170
 we need to acquire them I send them a kiss 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.500
