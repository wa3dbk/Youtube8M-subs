a<00:00:24.099> townhall<00:00:24.849> 7<00:00:24.880> farming<00:00:25.660> base<00:00:25.810> layout<00:00:26.109> that

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
a townhall 7 farming base layout that

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.130 
a townhall 7 farming base layout that
was<00:00:26.590> sent<00:00:26.859> in<00:00:27.099> by<00:00:27.130> you<00:00:27.820> the<00:00:27.970> viewer<00:00:28.239> once<00:00:28.869> again

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
was sent in by you the viewer once again

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
thank you so much for sending those in

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.939 
thank you so much for sending those in
now<00:00:31.419> looking<00:00:31.960> at<00:00:32.079> this<00:00:32.230> base<00:00:32.470> in<00:00:32.680> greater

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
now looking at this base in greater

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.160 
now looking at this base in greater
detail<00:00:33.370> one<00:00:34.030> thing<00:00:34.180> that<00:00:34.329> I<00:00:34.390> really<00:00:34.720> like<00:00:34.899> is

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
detail one thing that I really like is

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.590 
detail one thing that I really like is
storage<00:00:35.920> placement<00:00:36.460> now<00:00:36.879> the<00:00:36.940> storages<00:00:37.540> are

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
storage placement now the storages are

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.689 
storage placement now the storages are
on<00:00:38.080> opposite<00:00:38.559> sides<00:00:38.860> and<00:00:39.220> they're

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
on opposite sides and they're

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:41.850 
on opposite sides and they're
alternating<00:00:40.059> gold<00:00:40.570> elixir<00:00:41.019> gold<00:00:41.199> elixir<00:00:41.680> I

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
alternating gold elixir gold elixir I

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.140 
alternating gold elixir gold elixir I
like<00:00:42.250> the<00:00:42.370> base<00:00:42.519> in<00:00:42.699> terms<00:00:42.820> of<00:00:43.030> how

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
like the base in terms of how

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.390 
like the base in terms of how
symmetrical<00:00:43.809> it<00:00:43.960> is<00:00:44.079> as<00:00:44.290> well<00:00:44.650> and<00:00:44.949> I<00:00:45.250> also

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
symmetrical it is as well and I also

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.970 
symmetrical it is as well and I also
like<00:00:45.670> how<00:00:45.879> his<00:00:46.059> most<00:00:46.420> upgraded<00:00:46.720> walls<00:00:47.379> are<00:00:47.739> in

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
like how his most upgraded walls are in

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.340 
like how his most upgraded walls are in
the<00:00:48.280> center<00:00:48.820> now<00:00:49.420> the<00:00:49.480> thing<00:00:49.780> that<00:00:49.930> stands<00:00:50.199> out

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
the center now the thing that stands out

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.650 
the center now the thing that stands out
to<00:00:50.530> me<00:00:50.559> about<00:00:50.650> this<00:00:51.070> base<00:00:51.370> is<00:00:51.610> he<00:00:52.359> really

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
to me about this base is he really

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.500 
to me about this base is he really
centralizes<00:00:53.620> his<00:00:53.980> air<00:00:54.370> defenses<00:00:55.059> and<00:00:55.270> his

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
centralizes his air defenses and his

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.470 
centralizes his air defenses and his
wizard<00:00:55.870> towers<00:00:56.260> and<00:00:56.640> all<00:00:57.640> for<00:00:57.879> the<00:00:57.910> purpose<00:00:58.269> of

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
wizard towers and all for the purpose of

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.630 
wizard towers and all for the purpose of
protecting<00:00:58.809> that<00:00:59.170> dark<00:00:59.440> elixir<00:00:59.680> and<00:01:00.219> I<00:01:00.460> think

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
protecting that dark elixir and I think

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.000 
protecting that dark elixir and I think
the<00:01:00.730> reason<00:01:01.149> why<00:01:01.359> he<00:01:01.960> has<00:01:02.109> his<00:01:02.320> air<00:01:02.469> defenses

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
the reason why he has his air defenses

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.109 
the reason why he has his air defenses
really<00:01:03.399> centralized

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
really centralized

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.850 
really centralized
is<00:01:04.180> because<00:01:04.989> he's<00:01:05.140> afraid<00:01:05.259> of<00:01:05.530> those<00:01:05.649> air

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
is because he's afraid of those air

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.219 
is because he's afraid of those air
attacks<00:01:06.190> Hills<00:01:06.460> all<00:01:06.670> dragon<00:01:07.270> raids<00:01:07.479> now<00:01:08.050> I'll

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
attacks Hills all dragon raids now I'll

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.440 
attacks Hills all dragon raids now I'll
tell<00:01:08.500> you<00:01:08.590> based<00:01:08.860> on<00:01:09.009> experience<00:01:09.640> at<00:01:09.940> townhall

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
tell you based on experience at townhall

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.139 
tell you based on experience at townhall
7<00:01:10.660> if<00:01:11.289> you<00:01:11.740> do<00:01:11.890> get<00:01:12.070> hit<00:01:12.130> by<00:01:12.399> all<00:01:12.610> dragons

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
7 if you do get hit by all dragons

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.630 
7 if you do get hit by all dragons
whether<00:01:13.390> it's<00:01:13.570> level<00:01:14.050> 2<00:01:14.380> dragons<00:01:14.860> or<00:01:15.009> even<00:01:15.250> you

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
whether it's level 2 dragons or even you

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.889 
whether it's level 2 dragons or even you
know<00:01:15.729> it's<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:15.880> little<00:01:16.090> tougher<00:01:16.330> with<00:01:16.450> level<00:01:16.750> 1

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
know it's a little tougher with level 1

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.469 
know it's a little tougher with level 1
dragons<00:01:17.289> but<00:01:17.410> so<00:01:17.590> possible<00:01:18.100> you're<00:01:18.880> gonna<00:01:19.330> get

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
dragons but so possible you're gonna get

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.260 
dragons but so possible you're gonna get
3<00:01:19.750> starred<00:01:20.110> at<00:01:20.320> townhall<00:01:20.950> 7<00:01:20.979> so<00:01:21.850> in<00:01:21.910> that<00:01:22.030> case

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
3 starred at townhall 7 so in that case

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.999 
3 starred at townhall 7 so in that case
it's<00:01:22.539> really<00:01:22.960> tough<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.229> defend<00:01:23.649> against

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
it's really tough to defend against

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.219 
it's really tough to defend against
dragon<00:01:24.400> raids<00:01:24.610> even<00:01:25.090> if<00:01:25.270> your<00:01:25.540> air<00:01:25.750> defenses

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
dragon raids even if your air defenses

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.020 
dragon raids even if your air defenses
are<00:01:26.350> in<00:01:26.439> the<00:01:26.500> middle<00:01:26.770> so<00:01:27.310> if<00:01:27.549> you<00:01:27.670> do<00:01:27.790> have<00:01:27.909> your

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
are in the middle so if you do have your

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.580 
are in the middle so if you do have your
air<00:01:28.150> defenses<00:01:28.659> in<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:28.840> middle<00:01:29.170> you're

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
air defenses in the middle you're

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.710 
air defenses in the middle you're
exposing<00:01:30.130> your<00:01:30.549> mortars<00:01:31.000> that's<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.420> basic

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
exposing your mortars that's the basic

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.050 
exposing your mortars that's the basic
trade<00:01:31.960> off<00:01:32.079> that<00:01:32.110> you're<00:01:32.350> doing<00:01:32.560> but<00:01:33.280> again<00:01:33.850> if

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
trade off that you're doing but again if

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.550 
trade off that you're doing but again if
you're<00:01:34.240> gonna<00:01:34.360> get<00:01:34.509> three-star<00:01:34.990> by<00:01:35.140> dragons

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
you're gonna get three-star by dragons

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.980 
you're gonna get three-star by dragons
anyway<00:01:35.979> what<00:01:36.250> I<00:01:36.280> do<00:01:36.430> propose<00:01:36.939> is<00:01:37.270> why<00:01:37.570> not<00:01:37.750> try

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
anyway what I do propose is why not try

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.530 
anyway what I do propose is why not try
to<00:01:38.020> protect<00:01:38.439> against<00:01:38.740> something<00:01:38.950> you<00:01:39.130> can

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
to protect against something you can

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.179 
to protect against something you can
protect<00:01:40.540> against<00:01:40.869> which<00:01:41.110> is<00:01:41.439> move<00:01:42.040> the

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
protect against which is move the

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.069 
protect against which is move the
mortars<00:01:42.579> more<00:01:42.820> inside<00:01:43.119> a<00:01:43.149> little<00:01:43.509> bit<00:01:43.659> try<00:01:44.020> to

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
mortars more inside a little bit try to

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.020 
mortars more inside a little bit try to
protect<00:01:44.500> against<00:01:44.829> those<00:01:45.040> ground<00:01:45.310> attacks<00:01:45.700> and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
protect against those ground attacks and

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.170 
protect against those ground attacks and
not<00:01:46.840> leave<00:01:47.049> the<00:01:47.200> mortars<00:01:47.560> too<00:01:48.070> exposed<00:01:48.670> so<00:01:49.149> I

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
not leave the mortars too exposed so I

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.359 
not leave the mortars too exposed so I
would<00:01:49.390> maybe<00:01:49.540> move<00:01:49.840> one<00:01:50.200> mortar<00:01:50.500> in<00:01:50.649> or<00:01:50.920> two
