it<00:00:22.890> now<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.310> have<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.609> rubber<00:00:23.880> grip<00:00:24.420> here<00:00:24.689> if

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
it now you have a rubber grip here if

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.710 
it now you have a rubber grip here if
there's<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.529> lot<00:00:25.769> like<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> ballpoint<00:00:26.670> pen<00:00:26.820> I'm

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
there's a lot like a ballpoint pen I'm

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.929

one<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.500> know<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> nicer<00:00:29.099> ones<00:00:29.310> it

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
one of the you know the nicer ones it

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.640 
one of the you know the nicer ones it
comes<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.390> gunmetal<00:00:30.779> which<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.230> what<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.410> have

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
comes in a gunmetal which is what I have

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.410 
comes in a gunmetal which is what I have
here<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.160> can<00:00:32.309> also<00:00:32.430> get<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.940> silver

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
here you can also get it in a silver

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.330 
here you can also get it in a silver
which<00:00:34.140> kind<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.440> matches<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.920> back<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.280> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
which kind of matches the back of a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.840 
which kind of matches the back of a
knife<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.850> pad<00:00:36.410> also<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.710> can<00:00:38.040> get<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.670> a

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
knife I pad also you can get it in a

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.740 
knife I pad also you can get it in a
blue<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.989> red<00:00:40.489> if<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.610> look<00:00:41.760> here<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.570> have

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
blue and a red if you look here you have

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.010 
blue and a red if you look here you have
a<00:00:42.780> nice<00:00:42.989> little<00:00:43.200> screw<00:00:44.040> edge<00:00:44.280> here<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.750> top

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
a nice little screw edge here on the top

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.139 
a nice little screw edge here on the top
part<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.440> pin<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.520> because<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.940> has<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
part of the pin that is because it has a

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.150 
part of the pin that is because it has a
protective<00:00:48.750> cap<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.289> can<00:00:49.440> unscrew<00:00:49.800> off

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
protective cap that you can unscrew off

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.970 
protective cap that you can unscrew off
and<00:00:50.629> you<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.840> screw<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> top<00:00:52.770> so

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
and you can screw it on to the top so

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.979 
and you can screw it on to the top so
you<00:00:53.070> don't<00:00:53.219> lose<00:00:53.489> it

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
you don't lose it

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.540 
you don't lose it
and<00:00:54.989> right<00:00:55.230> here<00:00:55.260> what<00:00:55.739> you're<00:00:55.890> looking<00:00:56.190> at<00:00:56.309> is

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
and right here what you're looking at is

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.510 
and right here what you're looking at is
the<00:00:56.579> precision<00:00:57.210> disc<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.739> allows<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the precision disc this allows you to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.400 
the precision disc this allows you to
see<00:01:00.059> exactly<00:01:00.420> where<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.809> are<00:01:00.870> touching<00:01:01.170> on

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
see exactly where you are touching on

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.280 
see exactly where you are touching on
the<00:01:01.590> touch<00:01:01.800> screen<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:03.180> reality<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:04.049> not

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
the touch screen so in reality it's not

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.370 
the touch screen so in reality it's not
the<00:01:04.470> most<00:01:04.680> accurate<00:01:05.689> stylus<00:01:06.689> out<00:01:06.900> there<00:01:07.140> it

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
the most accurate stylus out there it

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.170 
the most accurate stylus out there it
really<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.700> more<00:01:10.610> easier<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.880> use

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
really is just a more easier to use

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.140 
really is just a more easier to use
stylus<00:01:13.170> that's<00:01:13.380> out<00:01:13.530> there<00:01:13.710> because<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.909> disc

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
stylus that's out there because the disc

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.880 
stylus that's out there because the disc
is<00:01:15.299> clear<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.200> see<00:01:16.500> where<00:01:16.740> you're

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
is clear you can see where you're

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.390 
is clear you can see where you're
writing<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.360> manipulate<00:01:19.400> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
writing and you can manipulate the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.580 
writing and you can manipulate the
stylus<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.909> get<00:01:21.270> exactly<00:01:21.840> where<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.200> want<00:01:22.439> and

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
stylus to get exactly where you want and

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.469 
stylus to get exactly where you want and
it<00:01:23.100> makes<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.970> makes<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.270> really

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
it makes it it's it makes it really

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.550 
it makes it it's it makes it really
really<00:01:24.570> convenient<00:01:25.049> whenever<00:01:25.380> you're

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
really convenient whenever you're

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.649 
really convenient whenever you're
drawing<00:01:25.830> precise<00:01:26.729> edges<00:01:27.180> or<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:27.540> you're

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
drawing precise edges or if you're

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.719 
drawing precise edges or if you're
writing<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.590> if<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.740> see<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.189> at<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.369> very

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
writing so if you see here at the very

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.640 
writing so if you see here at the very
tip<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.659> see<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.439> has<00:01:31.619> a

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
tip of it you can see it has a

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.240 
tip of it you can see it has a
capacitive<00:01:32.400> end<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:33.210> allows<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.220> stylus<00:01:35.220> to

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
capacitive end that allows the stylus to

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.960 
capacitive end that allows the stylus to
connect<00:01:35.670> with<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> screen<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.570> actually<00:01:37.970> you

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
connect with the screen and actually you

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.410 
connect with the screen and actually you
know<00:01:39.090> produce<00:01:39.540> an<00:01:39.780> input<00:01:40.790> like<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.970> said<00:01:42.210> you

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
know produce an input like I said you

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.480 
know produce an input like I said you
have<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> screw<00:01:42.930> here<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.829> cap<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.430> you

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
have a screw here for the cap and you

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.399 
have a screw here for the cap and you
have<00:01:44.790> your<00:01:44.909> rubber<00:01:45.090> grip<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.630> feels<00:01:46.229> really

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
have your rubber grip it feels really

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.710 
have your rubber grip it feels really
nice<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> hand<00:01:47.009> has<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.430> nice<00:01:47.759> nice<00:01:48.390> weight

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
what you're writing very nice

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.150 
what you're writing very nice
as<00:03:51.910> you<00:03:52.150> notice<00:03:52.390> when<00:03:52.510> I<00:03:52.540> was<00:03:52.660> writing<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:53.350> made

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
as you notice when I was writing it made

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.979 
as you notice when I was writing it made
a<00:03:54.190> clicking<00:03:54.700> noise<00:03:54.730> as<00:03:55.150> I<00:03:55.360> touch<00:03:55.600> the<00:03:55.720> screen

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
a clicking noise as I touch the screen

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.840 
a clicking noise as I touch the screen
so<00:03:56.850> and<00:03:57.850> that<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:59.380> is<00:03:59.560> a<00:03:59.760> disadvantage<00:04:00.760> of

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
so and that that is a disadvantage of
