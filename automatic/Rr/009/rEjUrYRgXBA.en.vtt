 the connectivity of the port manzanillo 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.500

 another commitment that the government fulfills 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.840
 the republica is the pack of seven 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.940
 works that were made with a 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.860
 investment of 125 million pesos 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.320

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.710
 of the municipalities of comala coquimatlán 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.680
 Cuauhtémoc ixtlahuacán we have the taste 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.500
 also to leave symbolically 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.270
 inaugurated these two viaducts 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.030
 very important in the port manzanillo 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.640
 who had an investment of 544 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.030
 million pesos in favor of the state of 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.149
 colima the government is investing 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.710
 7,000 million pesos in this 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.780
 basic infrastructure for the stadium 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.850
 colima to which we must add the 4 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.890
 billion resources already 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.080
 they invested in the port to get to 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.780
 a total of 11 billion pesos 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.180
 number I think very important and I'm 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.460
 sure without precedent that the government in 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.700
 the republic invests in the state of 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.700
