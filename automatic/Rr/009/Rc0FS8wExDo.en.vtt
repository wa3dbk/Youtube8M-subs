hi<00:00:01.829> it's<00:00:02.190> mental<00:00:02.550> altitude<00:00:03.090> and<00:00:03.330> today<00:00:03.629> is<00:00:03.689> the

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
hi it's mental altitude and today is the

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.260 
hi it's mental altitude and today is the
perfect<00:00:04.110> day<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.529> test<00:00:04.920> out<00:00:05.100> my<00:00:05.130> epsilon<00:00:05.940> SC

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
perfect day to test out my epsilon SC

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.200 
perfect day to test out my epsilon SC
jacket<00:00:07.080> by<00:00:07.290> Arc'teryx<00:00:07.770> so<00:00:08.550> how<00:00:08.760> am<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:09.000> going<00:00:09.150> to

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
jacket by Arc'teryx so how am I going to

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.990 
jacket by Arc'teryx so how am I going to
do<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:09.570> well<00:00:10.139> I'm<00:00:10.769> gonna<00:00:10.950> look<00:00:11.190> at<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.460> couple

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
do that well I'm gonna look at a couple

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.820 
do that well I'm gonna look at a couple
of<00:00:12.150> criteria<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:12.990> first<00:00:13.320> thing<00:00:13.469> I'm<00:00:13.559> going<00:00:13.740> to

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
of criteria so first thing I'm going to

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.790 
of criteria so first thing I'm going to
look<00:00:14.009> at<00:00:14.190> its<00:00:14.519> resistance<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.800> outside

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
look at its resistance to outside

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.760 
look at its resistance to outside
exterior<00:00:17.310> factors<00:00:17.880> such<00:00:18.210> as<00:00:18.240> rain<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.779> wind

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
exterior factors such as rain and wind

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.310 
exterior factors such as rain and wind
then<00:00:20.220> I'm<00:00:20.400> gonna<00:00:20.550> look<00:00:20.850> at<00:00:21.170> it's<00:00:22.170> a

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
then I'm gonna look at it's a

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.859 
then I'm gonna look at it's a
breathability<00:00:23.100> then<00:00:24.090> we're<00:00:24.359> gonna<00:00:24.449> look<00:00:24.689> at

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
breathability then we're gonna look at

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.720 
breathability then we're gonna look at
its<00:00:25.019> construction<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.830> fit<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.490> finally

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
its construction and fit and finally

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.779 
its construction and fit and finally
we're<00:00:27.000> gonna<00:00:27.060> look<00:00:27.330> at<00:00:27.539> all<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.990> other<00:00:28.789> little

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
we're gonna look at all the other little

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.550 
we're gonna look at all the other little
features<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.390> we<00:00:30.510> have<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.990> also<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.380> work

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
features that we have and also the work

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.250 
features that we have and also the work
so<00:00:32.160> how<00:00:32.399> are<00:00:32.489> we<00:00:32.579> gonna<00:00:32.669> test<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.260> jacket

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
so how are we gonna test this jacket

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.049 
so how are we gonna test this jacket
well<00:00:34.559> we're<00:00:35.040> gonna<00:00:35.130> play<00:00:35.309> some<00:00:35.430> Ultimate

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
well we're gonna play some Ultimate

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:47.389 
well we're gonna play some Ultimate
Frisbee<00:00:45.230> why<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.500> columns<00:00:46.710> made<00:00:47.190> because

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
Frisbee why is it columns made because

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.819 
Frisbee why is it columns made because
we<00:00:47.760> sleep<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.180> rain<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:49.050> they're<00:00:49.350> today

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
we sleep in the rain like they're today

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.130 
we sleep in the rain like they're today
that's<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.309> foot<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.000> fall<00:00:51.239> D<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.750> played<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
that's the foot the fall D we played the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.380 
that's the foot the fall D we played the
spring<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.860> went<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.190> snowmelt<00:00:53.640> who<00:00:54.090> claimed

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
spring just went to snowmelt who claimed

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.619 
spring just went to snowmelt who claimed
in<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.020> winter<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.920> snow<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.480> an

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
in the winter in the snow so it's an

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.139 
in the winter in the snow so it's an
extreme<00:00:58.050> sport<00:00:58.379> super<00:00:59.010> intense<00:00:59.370> sport<00:00:59.609> what's

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
extreme sport super intense sport what's

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.240 
extreme sport super intense sport what's
the<00:01:00.300> goal<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.870> game<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.859> make<00:01:01.890> some

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
the goal of the game is to make some

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.369 
the goal of the game is to make some
pastels<00:01:02.969> between<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.600> end<00:01:03.719> zone<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.080> make<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
pastels between the end zone to make the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.929 
pastels between the end zone to make the
point<00:01:04.619> they're<00:01:04.920> not<00:01:05.040> allowed<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.280> water<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
point they're not allowed to water the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:36.290 
point they're not allowed to water the
disc<00:01:06.180> think<00:01:07.020> dogs<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.560> part

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.670 

so<00:01:37.300> I<00:01:37.330> just<00:01:37.690> played<00:01:37.870> my<00:01:37.990> game<00:01:38.050> and<00:01:38.380> I<00:01:38.470> tested

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
so I just played my game and I tested

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.640 
so I just played my game and I tested
out<00:01:38.890> my<00:01:39.100> Arc'teryx<00:01:39.550> jacket<00:01:40.410> so<00:01:41.410> I'm<00:01:41.500> gonna

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
out my Arc'teryx jacket so I'm gonna

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.290 
out my Arc'teryx jacket so I'm gonna
talk<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:42.010> you<00:01:42.100> about<00:01:42.190> all<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.700> elements<00:01:43.210> that

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
talk to you about all the elements that

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.170 
talk to you about all the elements that
I<00:01:43.360> mentioned<00:01:43.810> before<00:01:43.950> firstly<00:01:45.180> its

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
I mentioned before firstly its

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.470 
I mentioned before firstly its
resistance<00:01:46.870> to<00:01:47.050> the<00:01:47.200> exterior<00:01:47.560> element<00:01:48.250> so<00:01:48.760> it

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
resistance to the exterior element so it

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.290 
resistance to the exterior element so it
has<00:01:49.690> as<00:01:50.020> you<00:01:50.230> can<00:01:50.380> see<00:01:50.590> it's<00:01:51.220> a<00:01:51.520> treated<00:01:52.000> with<00:01:52.270> a

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
has as you can see it's a treated with a

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.750 
has as you can see it's a treated with a
DWR<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.680> you<00:01:53.830> can<00:01:54.100> see<00:01:54.250> that<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.550> water

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
DWR so you can see that the water

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.580 
DWR so you can see that the water
doesn't<00:01:55.030> penetrate<00:01:55.450> inside<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.140> coat<00:01:56.320> so

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
doesn't penetrate inside the coat so

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.270 
doesn't penetrate inside the coat so
that's<00:01:56.770> really<00:01:56.950> great

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
that's really great

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.120 
that's really great
it's<00:01:58.120> really<00:01:58.390> good<00:01:58.630> with<00:01:58.660> abrasions<00:01:59.620> so<00:01:59.860> I<00:01:59.890> did

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
it's really good with abrasions so I did

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.910 
it's really good with abrasions so I did
a<00:02:00.160> bunch<00:02:00.430> of<00:02:00.640> layouts<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.330> I<00:02:01.420> jump<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.170> you

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
a bunch of layouts and I jump and you

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.010 
a bunch of layouts and I jump and you
see<00:02:03.250> that<00:02:03.400> it's<00:02:03.610> like<00:02:03.729> synthetic<00:02:04.240> turf<00:02:04.690> so

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
see that it's like synthetic turf so

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.469 
see that it's like synthetic turf so
it's<00:02:05.170> pretty<00:02:05.350> rough<00:02:05.680> on<00:02:06.040> my<00:02:06.610> jacket<00:02:07.060> but

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
it's pretty rough on my jacket but

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.870 
it's pretty rough on my jacket but
there's<00:02:08.290> no<00:02:08.530> nothing<00:02:08.860> that<00:02:09.160> came<00:02:09.369> out<00:02:09.550> so<00:02:09.729> it's

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
there's no nothing that came out so it's

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.610 
there's no nothing that came out so it's
super<00:02:10.270> resistant<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.899> have<00:02:11.020> reason<00:02:11.350> so<00:02:11.530> that's

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
super resistant to have reason so that's

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.580 
super resistant to have reason so that's
really<00:02:11.830> great<00:02:12.780> one<00:02:13.780> thing<00:02:13.990> though<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.140> it's

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
really great one thing though that it's

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.670 
really great one thing though that it's
not<00:02:14.680> resistant<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:15.790> like<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.420> big<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:17.170> lot<00:02:17.500> of

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
not resistant to like the big a lot of

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.920 
not resistant to like the big a lot of
rain<00:02:17.860> it's<00:02:18.340> not<00:02:18.459> 100%<00:02:19.060> waterproof<00:02:19.570> so<00:02:19.870> I

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
rain it's not 100% waterproof so I

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.410 
rain it's not 100% waterproof so I
wouldn't<00:02:20.260> wear<00:02:20.350> it<00:02:20.410> when<00:02:20.650> it's<00:02:20.830> super<00:02:21.130> easy

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
wouldn't wear it when it's super easy

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.020 
wouldn't wear it when it's super easy
concerns<00:02:22.420> breathability<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.739> breeze<00:02:24.250> super

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
concerns breathability it breeze super

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.000 
concerns breathability it breeze super
well<00:02:25.180> expect<00:02:25.600> especially<00:02:26.500> compared<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:26.980> a

well expect especially compared to a
shelf<00:02:27.400> so<00:02:28.060> that's<00:02:28.959> really<00:02:29.230> great<00:02:29.530> for<00:02:29.860> this

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
shelf so that's really great for this

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.670 
shelf so that's really great for this
coat<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:31.209> it's<00:02:31.390> made<00:02:31.600> in<00:02:31.720> polyester<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:32.350> the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
coat and it's made in polyester so the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.440 
coat and it's made in polyester so the
polyester<00:02:33.070> is<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.489> fiber<00:02:33.820> that<00:02:34.030> repels<00:02:34.390> water

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
polyester is a fiber that repels water

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.290 
polyester is a fiber that repels water
if<00:02:35.380> it's<00:02:35.590> hotter<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.160> humidity<00:02:36.790> will<00:02:37.030> stay

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
if it's hotter the humidity will stay

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.080 
if it's hotter the humidity will stay
inside<00:02:37.690> because<00:02:38.080> it's<00:02:38.860> still<00:02:39.190> at<00:02:39.519> another

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
inside because it's still at another

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.840 
inside because it's still at another
another<00:02:40.930> layer<00:02:41.200> according<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.220> heat<00:02:42.640> of

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
another layer according to that heat of

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.060 
another layer according to that heat of
the<00:02:43.120> coat<00:02:43.420> it's<00:02:43.690> pretty<00:02:44.019> warm<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.470> inside

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
the coat it's pretty warm and inside

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.460 
the coat it's pretty warm and inside
it's<00:02:45.340> made<00:02:45.580> with<00:02:45.850> fleece<00:02:46.269> so<00:02:46.959> you<00:02:47.080> can<00:02:47.260> see

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
it's made with fleece so you can see

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.000 
it's made with fleece so you can see
that<00:02:47.760> inside<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.959> creates<00:02:50.590> like<00:02:50.769> little

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
that inside it creates like little

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.070 
that inside it creates like little
pockets<00:02:51.430> of<00:02:51.519> air<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:51.970> although<00:02:52.390> it's<00:02:52.660> super

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
pockets of air and although it's super

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.070 
pockets of air and although it's super
light<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:53.890> still<00:02:54.250> is<00:02:54.489> pretty<00:02:54.750> pretty<00:02:55.750> warm

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
light and it still is pretty pretty warm

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.710 
light and it still is pretty pretty warm
for<00:02:56.380> a<00:02:56.440> coat<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:56.890> maybe<00:02:57.700> even<00:02:57.940> too<00:02:58.300> warm<00:02:58.600> for

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
for a coat and maybe even too warm for

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.020 
for a coat and maybe even too warm for
ultimate<00:02:59.560> when<00:02:59.860> it's<00:03:00.040> when<00:03:00.519> it's<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.820> little

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
ultimate when it's when it's a little

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.490 
ultimate when it's when it's a little
warm<00:03:01.180> outside<00:03:01.420> what<00:03:01.750> screw<00:03:01.959> tonight<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.410> was

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500

really perfect let me warm its
construction<00:03:04.900> it's<00:03:05.290> me<00:03:05.530> Dad<00:03:05.769> really<00:03:06.340> thought

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
construction it's me Dad really thought

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.670 
construction it's me Dad really thought
this<00:03:06.640> is<00:03:06.790> as<00:03:06.940> small<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.510> it's<00:03:08.140> made<00:03:08.410> with<00:03:08.440> a

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
this is as small and it's made with a

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.250 
this is as small and it's made with a
bunch<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.130> different<00:03:09.820> panels<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:10.840> it's<00:03:11.019> really

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
bunch of different panels so it's really

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.920 
bunch of different panels so it's really
nice<00:03:11.590> like<00:03:11.860> along<00:03:12.370> a<00:03:12.400> body

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.110 

so<00:03:18.230> it's<00:03:18.379> really<00:03:18.590> made<00:03:18.890> well<00:03:19.099> it's<00:03:19.489> it's

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
so it's really made well it's it's

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.920 
so it's really made well it's it's
pretty<00:03:20.620> stretchy<00:03:21.730> but<00:03:22.730> still<00:03:23.269> it's<00:03:23.540> not<00:03:23.719> as

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
pretty stretchy but still it's not as

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.380 
pretty stretchy but still it's not as
comfortable<00:03:24.890> as<00:03:25.069> wearing<00:03:25.549> just<00:03:25.909> a<00:03:26.000> base<00:03:26.180> layer

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
comfortable as wearing just a base layer

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.390 
comfortable as wearing just a base layer
but<00:03:26.719> still<00:03:27.049> it's<00:03:27.290> pretty<00:03:27.530> stretchy<00:03:27.920> for<00:03:28.250> what

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
but still it's pretty stretchy for what

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.660 
but still it's pretty stretchy for what
it<00:03:28.489> is<00:03:28.609> so<00:03:29.359> that's<00:03:30.230> it<00:03:30.500> for<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:30.920> construction

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
it is so that's it for the construction
