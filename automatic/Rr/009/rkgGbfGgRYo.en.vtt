redstone<00:00:36.329> sticky<00:00:37.110> pistons<00:00:37.530> which<00:00:37.770> are<00:00:37.920> made

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
redstone sticky pistons which are made

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.920 
redstone sticky pistons which are made
by<00:00:38.129> slides<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.640> pistons<00:00:39.000> some<00:00:39.690> kind<00:00:39.870> of

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
by slides and pistons some kind of

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.869 
by slides and pistons some kind of
pressure<00:00:40.079> plate<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.680> shovel<00:00:41.550> makes<00:00:41.730> it

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
pressure plate and shovel makes it

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.139 
pressure plate and shovel makes it
easier<00:00:42.559> I'll<00:00:43.559> start<00:00:43.800> off<00:00:43.920> first<00:00:44.610> stool<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.030> set

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
easier I'll start off first stool to set

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.389 
easier I'll start off first stool to set
up<00:00:45.239> your<00:00:45.300> Pistons<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> area<00:00:47.250> we

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
up your Pistons so if on the area we

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.130 
up your Pistons so if on the area we
want<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.670> door<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.879> be<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.360> put<00:00:48.660> your<00:00:48.780> Pistons

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
want the door to be and put your Pistons

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.910 
want the door to be and put your Pistons
down<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.980> suck<00:00:50.899> and<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.230> want<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.440> caliber

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
down like suck and you want a caliber

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.240 
down like suck and you want a caliber
for<00:00:53.210> 24<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.719> then<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> next<00:00:55.100> one<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.850> 4<00:00:57.449> here

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
for 24 and then the next one to a 4 here

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.170 
for 24 and then the next one to a 4 here
you<00:00:59.250> do<00:01:00.590> she<00:01:01.590> would<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.890> space<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.370> four<00:01:02.879> in

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
you do she would have a space of four in

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.620 
you do she would have a space of four in
between<00:01:03.719> where<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.920> want<00:01:05.250> your<00:01:05.850> pistols<00:01:06.450> to

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
between where you want your pistols to

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.780 
between where you want your pistols to
be<00:01:06.950> next<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.700> wire<00:01:08.970> ring<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.640> think<00:01:11.640> it

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
be next the wire ring so I think it

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.920 
be next the wire ring so I think it
easiest<00:01:12.030> way<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> do<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.689> go<00:01:12.869> ahead

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
easiest way to do this is to go ahead

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.899 
easiest way to do this is to go ahead
and<00:01:13.110> set<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.350> up<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.700> go<00:01:14.880> back

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
and set it up like this so you go back

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.160 
and set it up like this so you go back
to<00:01:15.409> one<00:01:17.360> this<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.630> your<00:01:18.750> building<00:01:19.049> eight

to one this is of your building eight

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.510 
to one this is of your building eight
from<00:01:19.619> scratch<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:21.049> that<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:23.280> want<00:01:23.460> to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
the way I like to do it so then you need

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.940 
the way I like to do it so then you need
to<00:02:12.100> put<00:02:12.340> redstone<00:02:12.630> going<00:02:13.630> back<00:02:14.020> all<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.800> way

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
to put redstone going back all the way

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:24.260 
to put redstone going back all the way
to<00:02:14.980> both<00:02:15.820> sides<00:02:16.710> here<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.860> there<00:02:21.820> is<00:02:22.150> a

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
to both sides here so that there is a

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.540 
to both sides here so that there is a
space<00:02:25.270> I<00:02:25.690> make<00:02:26.650> sure<00:02:26.800> you<00:02:26.860> actually<00:02:26.980> able<00:02:27.280> to

alright so right and this part c heavy
redstone<00:03:31.510> all<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.470> way<00:03:32.560> around<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:34.540> want<00:03:34.720> to

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
redstone all the way around you want to

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.750 
redstone all the way around you want to
put<00:03:35.080> you<00:03:35.769> have<00:03:35.920> a<00:03:35.950> little<00:03:36.220> block<00:03:36.430> right<00:03:36.730> there

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
torches on both sides next is the more

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.790 
torches on both sides next is the more
redstone<00:03:45.940> you<00:03:46.630> put<00:03:46.810> redstone<00:03:46.989> here<00:03:47.410> which<00:03:47.650> is

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
redstone you put redstone here which is

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.809 
redstone you put redstone here which is
power<00:03:48.100> from<00:03:48.310> that<00:03:48.340> here<00:03:49.209> and

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.259 

which<00:03:53.480> powers<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.870> middle<00:03:54.379> and<00:03:54.590> top<00:03:54.739> block

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
which powers the middle and top block

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.770 
which powers the middle and top block
same<00:03:56.269> thing<00:03:56.540> on<00:03:56.749> the<00:03:56.900> other<00:03:56.930> side<00:03:57.909> here<00:03:58.909> here

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
same thing on the other side here here

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.199 
same thing on the other side here here
in<00:03:59.989> here<00:04:00.230> it<00:04:00.769> might<00:04:00.980> be<00:04:01.099> wondering<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.730> bottom

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
in here it might be wondering the bottom

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.879 
in here it might be wondering the bottom
blocks<00:04:02.420> are<00:04:02.629> getting<00:04:02.870> power<00:04:03.049> so<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.650> best<00:04:03.769> way

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
blocks are getting power so the best way

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:05.770 
blocks are getting power so the best way
to<00:04:03.950> fix<00:04:04.189> this<00:04:04.400> so<00:04:04.639> they'll<00:04:05.150> say<00:04:05.389> you<00:04:05.450> put<00:04:05.659> it

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
to fix this so they'll say you put it

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.899 
to fix this so they'll say you put it
here<00:04:06.049> to<00:04:06.200> power<00:04:06.439> it<00:04:06.650> but<00:04:07.310> when<00:04:07.639> you<00:04:07.730> actually

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
here to power it but when you actually

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:09.940 
here to power it but when you actually
go<00:04:08.359> back<00:04:08.659> to<00:04:09.079> target<00:04:09.379> I<00:04:09.409> want<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:09.620> try<00:04:09.709> it<00:04:09.739> off

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
go back to target I want to try it off

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.940 
go back to target I want to try it off
you<00:04:10.069> want<00:04:10.219> power<00:04:10.400> so<00:04:10.849> just<00:04:11.420> put<00:04:11.540> a<00:04:11.569> line<00:04:11.950> like

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
you want power so just put a line like

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.120 
you want power so just put a line like
so<00:04:13.959> that's<00:04:14.959> pretty<00:04:15.109> much<00:04:15.170> how<00:04:15.409> you<00:04:15.769> have<00:04:16.070> to

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
so that's pretty much how you have to

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.080 
so that's pretty much how you have to
leave<00:04:16.280> it<00:04:16.400> like<00:04:16.489> this<00:04:16.519> and<00:04:16.699> he'll<00:04:16.910> stay

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
leave it like this and he'll stay

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.390 
leave it like this and he'll stay
powered<00:04:17.269> so<00:04:18.259> go<00:04:18.919> ahead<00:04:18.979> and<00:04:19.130> cover<00:04:19.340> this<00:04:19.579> up

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
powered so go ahead and cover this up

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.439 
powered so go ahead and cover this up
dirts<00:04:24.490> make<00:04:25.490> sure<00:04:25.639> you<00:04:25.729> remember<00:04:26.060> where<00:04:26.240> your

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
dirts make sure you remember where your

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.200 
dirts make sure you remember where your
pressure<00:04:26.870> plates<00:04:27.169> have<00:04:27.320> to<00:04:27.470> go<00:04:27.699> so<00:04:28.699> next<00:04:28.910> you

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
pressure plates have to go so next you

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.969 
pressure plates have to go so next you
put<00:04:29.240> down<00:04:29.479> your<00:04:29.630> pressure<00:04:29.810> plates<00:04:30.139> right<00:04:30.680> here

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
put down your pressure plates right here

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.409 
put down your pressure plates right here
so<00:04:31.430> we've<00:04:31.550> step<00:04:31.820> on<00:04:32.030> it<00:04:32.150> it<00:04:32.720> will<00:04:32.960> uncover<00:04:33.440> it

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
so we've step on it it will uncover it

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.270 
so we've step on it it will uncover it
so<00:04:35.419> yeah<00:04:35.570> I<00:04:35.599> got<00:04:35.960> a<00:04:35.990> slight<00:04:36.289> second<00:04:36.740> time

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
so yeah I got a slight second time

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.430 
so yeah I got a slight second time
before<00:04:39.880> you<00:04:40.880> can<00:04:41.000> do<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.330> ok<00:04:41.599> walk<00:04:41.780> through<00:04:41.810> to

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
before you can do it ok walk through to

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.900 
before you can do it ok walk through to
when<00:04:42.800> you<00:04:42.889> walk<00:04:43.070> on<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.250> press<00:04:43.430> place<00:04:43.639> when<00:04:43.789> I

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
when you walk on a press place when I

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.490 
when you walk on a press place when I
walk<00:04:44.090> through<00:04:44.330> it<00:04:44.900> can<00:04:45.110> move<00:04:45.169> the<00:04:45.289> pressure

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
walk through it can move the pressure

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:53.740 
walk through it can move the pressure
plates<00:04:45.770> up<00:04:46.009> oh<00:04:46.430> you<00:04:46.970> want<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:49.300> so<00:04:52.479> so<00:04:53.479> make<00:04:53.720> sure

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
plates up oh you want to so so make sure

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.300 
plates up oh you want to so so make sure
it's<00:04:54.110> also<00:04:54.229> pressure<00:04:54.560> plates<00:04:54.830> are<00:04:54.949> under<00:04:55.160> the

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
it's also pressure plates are under the

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.370 
it's also pressure plates are under the
redstone<00:04:55.789> wiring<00:04:56.090> and<00:04:56.630> within<00:04:57.080> these<00:04:57.320> two

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
redstone wiring and within these two

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.330 
redstone wiring and within these two
blocks<00:04:57.800> or<00:04:57.949> radius<00:04:58.250> it<00:04:58.610> will<00:04:58.849> work<00:05:00.099> so<00:05:01.099> that<00:05:01.250> is

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
blocks or radius it will work so that is

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.480 
blocks or radius it will work so that is
just<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.639> you<00:05:02.599> know<00:05:02.630> pretty<00:05:03.280> simple<00:05:04.280> wiring

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
just the you know pretty simple wiring

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.040 
just the you know pretty simple wiring
you<00:05:04.849> can<00:05:05.030> just<00:05:05.150> cover<00:05:05.330> this<00:05:05.509> up<00:05:05.720> you<00:05:05.900> know<00:05:05.960> you

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
you can just cover this up you know you

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.790 
you can just cover this up you know you
can<00:05:06.199> put<00:05:06.349> down<00:05:06.530> here<00:05:07.180> oops<00:05:08.349> right<00:05:09.349> there<00:05:09.560> is

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
can put down here oops right there is

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.439 
can put down here oops right there is
put<00:05:10.190> down<00:05:10.220> like<00:05:10.520> a<00:05:10.550> wall<00:05:10.669> or<00:05:10.849> something<00:05:11.060> around

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
put down like a wall or something around

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.570 
put down like a wall or something around
it<00:05:11.840> like<00:05:12.020> so<00:05:14.409> so<00:05:15.409> people<00:05:15.590> don't<00:05:15.889> actually<00:05:16.039> see

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
it like so so people don't actually see

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.490 
it like so so people don't actually see
the<00:05:17.949> wiring<00:05:19.180> or<00:05:20.180> you<00:05:20.509> want<00:05:20.659> to<00:05:20.720> look<00:05:20.930> nice<00:05:21.139> or

it up like this is my castle wall and I

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.760 
it up like this is my castle wall and I
have<00:05:38.389> it<00:05:38.570> in<00:05:38.750> by<00:05:39.020> having<00:05:39.349> the<00:05:39.409> two<00:05:39.530> pressure

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
have it in by having the two pressure

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.560 
have it in by having the two pressure
play<00:05:39.949> spaces<00:05:40.250> because<00:05:40.880> I<00:05:41.150> like<00:05:41.300> it<00:05:41.419> like<00:05:41.509> this

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570
