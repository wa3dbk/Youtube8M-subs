00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.760
 hey i'm roland for mobile geeks and 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.830
 that we have here is that mister p6000 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.599
 and the name says it is 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.699
 while a six inch tablet that 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.169
 device is so very big offers 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.460
 but also a lot and probably 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.689
 be relatively cheap if it is in 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.429
 Germany on the market is something on 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.710
 every case is considered because one said 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.390
 me that I raise the european prices 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.819
 I would find the press right now 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.130
 gotten 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:34.340
 The thing has a resolution of 1920x 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.180
 1080 pixels is a full hd display 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.590
 made quite a good impression, the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.809
 Viewing angles are also alright if he is 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.250
 Looks like this would have to see you that it 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.670
 offers very good views 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.770
 is based on the mediathek mtk 65 89 and 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.170
 at least that's the old one 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.960
 quad-core relative to what you are like 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.090
 an arm cortex a7 with 1 5 gigahertz and 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.690
 should therefore still offer performance 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.820
 also around the relatively large screen 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.070
 to serve as you can see then 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.619
 relative vanilla android on it unfortunately 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.360
 of course with such a strange one again 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.979
 dpi attitude that you can see that 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.810
 display barely used 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:17.200
 we see here android 4 2 2 can you 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.200
 read up 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.190
 seems to be quite high quality I have to say 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.400
 so has a metal case so everything 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.720
 nicely done well actually two 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.230
 gigabyte of working memory on board 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.900
 plus 16 8 16 or 32 gigabytes of flash 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.850
 memory even more and on the front 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.260
 was a 5 megapixel camera and 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.110
 on the back there are also still 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.080
 a pretty thick 3 10 megapixel 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.670
 camera with lightning is reasonably 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.130
 The frame around the 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.950
 display is also relatively narrow I say 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.050
 Now times made a very good impression 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.280
 and weighs exactly 200 grams 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:57.369
 is 82 mm thick and therefore pleasantly green 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.470
 and should have a battery life of 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.190
 twelve hours offer in continuous operation and 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.080
 under full load 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.490
 how big the battery can do exactly that now 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.479
 I just do not tell you but we 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.490
 look around very quickly 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.009
 we start up here we have like 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.390
 said the 5 megapixel camera then the 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.250
 speakers of course and minute 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.550
 Creation led quite handy if you 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.959
 wants to be informed about calls then 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.350
 as I said the 6 inch display with full 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.870
 hd resolution in ips panel what we can 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.030
 take a quick look 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.500
 how the brightness looks like this is 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.510
 just not even the full one 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.430
 brightness 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.379
 that is again just go in here and 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.260
 find the brightness and then put it 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.450
 we put the thing on full load and yes so 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.220
 I have to say it gets pretty pretty 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.930
 bright 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.030
 of course, this is mine again 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.200
 Video lamp very bright you can now 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.909
 just bad guess 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.650
 anyway, we have the below 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.980
 capacitive touch buttons so none 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.030
 animation that the place open display 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.400
 kindly not wasted 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.109
 at the lower end you see here because the 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.940
 safety pressure or because the 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.670
 micro usb port that goes in then just 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.920
 a little one of the little hole for 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.900
 microphone on the left side it goes 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.670
 then continue with whom I would say 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.900
 The SIM card slot looks like one 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.730
 micro sim 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.470
 upper end of the headphone jack 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.780
 of course, three and a half millimeters pawl 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.829
 and on the right side you will see 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.659
 up here 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.310
 this is probably the second sim card slot 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.540
 be because the device has july to 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.040
 actually a very support 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.470
 handy thing just when you have one 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.390
 sim to talk on the phone and to surf 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.250
 or work and private wants to separate 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.439
 next we have the volume 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.329
 of course, and the on and off 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:32.250
 Ausschalter which sits relatively far down 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.019
 so that you get it when you put it in the 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.269
 hand has a handy here and 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:40.170
 can turn off works at the 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.819
 Things are going well 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.349
 he'll see if I'm short 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.349
 turn the committee on and off 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.290
 so it's you see 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.120
 pretty bright is a pretty good display 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.740
 I think and do pretty nice 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.200
 impression on the back we have 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.410
 then as mentioned the 1 the 13 megapixel 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.510
 Camera with lightning and bottom still sits 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.040
 a single speaker acts 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.600
 Here one of the pre-series device how to 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.880
 down there because there is no id 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.290
 it should soon be in 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.310
 germany be available to the circle 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.050
 as I said maybe in the 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.400
 description look the crash kid have 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.300
 since companies form themselves 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.300
 according to ciao
