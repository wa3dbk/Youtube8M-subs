00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
exercises I like to use more sets and

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.460 
exercises I like to use more sets and
lower<00:03:35.549> reps<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:36.090> can<00:03:36.420> be<00:03:36.510> very<00:03:36.900> exercise

hairy ugly dude tells you and just

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.309 
hairy ugly dude tells you and just
maximize<00:03:59.370> every<00:03:59.700> set<00:03:59.910> pushing<00:04:00.750> that<00:04:00.840> set<00:04:01.140> for

maximize every set pushing that set for

as many reps as possible stopping it

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.039 
as many reps as possible stopping it
when<00:04:03.000> your<00:04:03.120> form<00:04:03.299> breaks<00:04:03.569> down<00:04:03.720> or<00:04:03.900> if<00:04:03.989> you

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
when your form breaks down or if you

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.210 
when your form breaks down or if you
feel<00:04:04.200> like<00:04:04.380> you<00:04:04.500> might<00:04:04.650> fail<00:04:04.859> on<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.069> right

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
feel like you might fail on the right

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.979 
feel like you might fail on the right
next<00:04:05.880> rep<00:04:06.420> etc<00:04:07.140> so<00:04:08.130> a<00:04:08.370> set<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:09.390> rep<00:04:09.569> scheme<00:04:09.720> by

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
next rep etc so a set and rep scheme by

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.809 
next rep etc so a set and rep scheme by
itself<00:04:10.380> is<00:04:10.560> rather<00:04:10.769> useless<00:04:11.370> there's<00:04:11.579> many

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
itself is rather useless there's many

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.809 
itself is rather useless there's many
ways<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:12.060> can<00:04:12.359> work<00:04:12.600> it<00:04:12.780> intensity<00:04:13.410> wise<00:04:13.819> et

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
ways you can work it intensity wise et

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.629 
ways you can work it intensity wise et
Cie<00:04:15.209> so<00:04:15.930> you<00:04:16.560> factor<00:04:16.979> that<00:04:17.010> in<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.430> equation

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
Cie so you factor that in the equation

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.460 
Cie so you factor that in the equation
and<00:04:18.090> that<00:04:18.209> just<00:04:18.419> further<00:04:18.690> complicates<00:04:19.320> the

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
and that just further complicates the

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.009 
and that just further complicates the
thing<00:04:19.680> so<00:04:20.239> setting<00:04:21.239> reps<00:04:21.450> can<00:04:21.630> be<00:04:21.780> very

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
thing so setting reps can be very

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.409 
thing so setting reps can be very
personal<00:04:22.320> specific<00:04:23.220> they<00:04:23.520> can<00:04:23.669> be<00:04:23.760> exercised

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
personal specific they can be exercised

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.480 
personal specific they can be exercised
specific<00:04:24.960> they<00:04:25.080> can<00:04:25.229> be<00:04:25.349> exercised<00:04:25.890> variation

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.560

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.450

plus<00:04:27.720> they<00:04:27.990> don't<00:04:28.200> tell<00:04:28.500> you<00:04:28.680> what<00:04:28.920> intensity

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
plus they don't tell you what intensity

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.770 
plus they don't tell you what intensity
to<00:04:29.730> use<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.920> even<00:04:31.920> if<00:04:32.150> one<00:04:33.150> set<00:04:33.510> and<00:04:33.630> rep
