00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.330
 attention here we are his partner Boris 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.980
 gathered such a device here 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:23.009
 Well, it will be a simple look, here I have not 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.380
 this daewoo vacuum cleaner 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:30.310
 home he shakes very well means 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:34.210
 we opened the first chamber of the case see 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:37.210
 electrical tape here I'll show you all mean 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.579
 here they opened and made a double kettle 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.190
 well double layer 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:46.789
 pounded the first camera here we closed 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.980
 then put the cap out 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.649
 emulsion decks so that we donâ€™t 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.909
 interfered with why we shot it 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:58.729
 we remove one more argument of that dollar in that 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:02.780
 what can not the guys in 2k in one camera 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:03.530
 bending spray why because this 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.539
 spray 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.409
 on the full openings of the first chamber 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:11.000
 works as an iconostasis and constantly in 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.750
 all the time you drive 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.090
 let's say there on on the first cell 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.640
 then water on two cameras then you 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.009
 be sure to constantly expire 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.819
 fuel from the sprayer chamber 1 and here 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:31.789
 then we will put it in staff 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:35.049
 sprayer here it is regular then 2 here it is 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:39.470
 then this one 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:42.560
 an elephant who enters the second chamber 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.560
 will be a pneumatic brake 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.079
 for 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.299
 the expiration of the first chamber you understand he is not 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:54.009
 will that we are with you now 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.009
 Let's demonstrate the Boris plug 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.490
 I 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.700
 also 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.960
 ten 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.410
 want to 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.410
 is unique 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:28.260
 now we put the sprayer standard 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
 go 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.510
 forward 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.049
 you live site mustafina 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.049
 it is better 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.060
 I 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.090
 I didnâ€™t come up with this idea 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.160
 prompted oksana hawk moths and him again 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.170
 advertised very clever person 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:16.740
 he lives in the provincial town 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.320
 Ukraine is generally clever 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:23.200
 well-read intellectual and generally knows 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.830
 motors and generally knows the physics of processes 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.350
 that's what he offered me great and here I am 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.270
 I also want to add that this is nâ€™t 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.380
 which gives us a vacuum cleaner 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:38.709
 comrades and the engine gives much more 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.310
 dilution than this simple vacuuming 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.310
 here he is
