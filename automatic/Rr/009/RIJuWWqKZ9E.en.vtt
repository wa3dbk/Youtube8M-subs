00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:17.079
 next we have big finale 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:19.000
 Now the beef fillet is being prepared as 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.550
 that's why I now think of two classics 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.309
 somehow put yourself in the head 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.290
 that I wanted it that way I am 

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:28.779
 curious how that reacts now so we 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:32.039
 have a fillet of beef with classic 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.149
 made a pepper sauce 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.289
 at home relatively often, I think 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.730
 Just cook if someone likes to 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:39.399
 piece of beef fillet is there to do that 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.960
 is a pepper sauce and I wanted 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.020
 Just show them now 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.390
 pepper sauce not pepper sauce is so 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.460
 I have two things now 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.290
 we have prepared the one here 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.120
 very strong variant of the 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.600
 and beef tenderloin with board would 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.020
 reduced support and cooked 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.440
 Yes, there is always sweetness too 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.570
 certain strengths are also created 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.460
 I always wanted one now 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.649
 that I have now from finca la paz yes 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.899
 we are in portugal with the sauce though 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:14.709
 I went to spain now 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:18.520
 taken from the year 2005 from one 

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:20.469
 jubilarian alicante there you go from 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.280
 Alicante about 100 kilometers into 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:26.950
 interior 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:29.590
 then are in the winegrowing area and 2005 was 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.829
 really a very good year and is 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.590
 now 70 percent month's Trapani as well 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.789
 us their year each about to 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.509
 share same 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:42.490
 mona strell the main trebs place the one 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.920
 I talk a lot too sun too 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.609
 tolerate because they have a strong 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.869
 fruity also really opulent 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:52.119
 red wine and I'm thinking right now 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.669
 beef fillet then made strong too 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.189
 with a cooked sauce with with 

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:58.749
 portrait with sweet certainly very 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.109
 interesting ballot as second 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:01.109
 try 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.510
 this also behind many with the white 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.480
 I tried one pepper 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.540
 to find another season of spice 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.610
 has indeed that he has pepper 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.330
 but not too strong Israel 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.250
 but this wise also the winged 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.260
 but not too lush and there I have 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.360
 now what's taken from really too 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.370
 on a kiesweiher good winegrower 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.260
 also from my home course again 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.500
 that must be, and that is from Horichon 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:44.450
 from Burgenland a Blaufr채nkisch high 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:47.930
 hacker is a big hochegger with the 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.680
 Grape varietal Blaufr채nkisch the synonym in 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.630
 Germany is left-leaning are effects 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.180
 itself varietal only stop in Austria 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.890
 as the Blaufr채nkisch and Blaufr채nkisch 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.540
 is also a grape variety is known 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.640
 for his spices for fruit too 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.130
 happy times in wood now expanded in the 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.360
 meaning not simply to accompany the 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.620
 and not too vigorous to become them 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.640
 will look at the color of it 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.850
 now a bit lighter from the 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.190
 color has the spice in the hoard fruit flavors 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.500
 make characters but not to 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.239
 strong so you see 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.130
 They have twice beef fillet with one 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.220
 pepper sauce only once do you have something 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.290
 elegant without wood with is included 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.350
 bit fruit also accessible and then 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.410
 Do you have behind Philipp for attempts 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.600
 with a hefty hedonistic full 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:42.440
 power wine that also has deadlines so 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:46.540
 really right action in it is even 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.540
 better that way was now again seems 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.120
 that perfect 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.920
 that fits perfectly there are so right 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.310
 the depfa the spice out but so 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.310
 enjoyable 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.930
 and the wine is just not too strong 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.930
 is very important 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.080
 there it makes bright white sauces white 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:39.290
 We'll have to be revised again 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.980
 light sauces of beef fillet to fit 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.980
 wonderful nation
