00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
you can use something else other than a

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.179 
you can use something else other than a
red<00:00:27.480> dot<00:00:27.630> sight<00:00:27.869> but<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.230> use<00:00:28.560> red<00:00:28.769> dot<00:00:28.949> and

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
red dot sight but I use red dot and

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.429 
red dot sight but I use red dot and
silencer<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.939> that's<00:00:30.689> because<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.289> iron

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
silencer and that's because the iron

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.200 
silencer and that's because the iron
sights<00:00:31.710> most<00:00:32.250> people<00:00:32.520> don't<00:00:32.730> like<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> iron

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
sights most people don't like the iron

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.600 
sights most people don't like the iron
sights<00:00:33.360> rather<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.960> g36<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.920> personally

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
sights rather on the g36 I personally

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.520 
sights rather on the g36 I personally
don't<00:00:35.730> mind<00:00:35.969> them<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:37.050> just<00:00:37.200> makes<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.440> a

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
don't mind them but it just makes it a

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.260 
don't mind them but it just makes it a
little<00:00:37.649> bit<00:00:37.770> easier<00:00:37.950> if<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.460> use<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.790> red

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
little bit easier if you use the red

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.319 
little bit easier if you use the red
dots<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.780> use<00:00:39.960> red<00:00:40.140> dot<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.469> silencer

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
dots so I use red dot and silencer

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.290 
dots so I use red dot and silencer
that's<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.800> also<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.579> easiest<00:00:44.969> way<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> get

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
that's that also the easiest way to get

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.990 
that's that also the easiest way to get

well as a ravine so it's best to have a
and<00:01:32.430> smoothly<00:01:33.180> be<00:01:34.079> most<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.680> time<00:01:34.939> but

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
and smoothly be most of the time but

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.940 
and smoothly be most of the time but
sometimes<00:01:36.000> not<00:01:36.509> be<00:01:36.720> because<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.740> way

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
sometimes not be because that way

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.219 
sometimes not be because that way
they're<00:01:38.939> not<00:01:39.090> trying<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.360> take<00:01:39.540> be<00:01:39.720> rather

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
they're not trying to take be rather

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.440 
they're not trying to take be rather
they're<00:01:40.530> running<00:01:41.130> away<00:01:41.189> from<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.939> ravine<00:01:42.240> and

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
they're running away from the ravine and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.170 
they're running away from the ravine and
see<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:44.130> get<00:01:44.250> more<00:01:44.399> traffic<00:01:44.670> sometimes

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
see so you get more traffic sometimes

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.480 
see so you get more traffic sometimes
that<00:01:45.360> way<00:01:45.479> but<00:01:45.890> if<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.070> want<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.280> win<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> game

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
that way but if you want to win the game

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.120 
that way but if you want to win the game
obviously<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.119> want<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.450> B<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.380> that's

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
obviously you want a and B so that's

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.370 
obviously you want a and B so that's
that<00:01:50.340> but<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.180> wanted<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.600> talk<00:01:51.720> about<00:01:51.869> III<00:01:52.290> as

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
that but I wanted to talk about III as

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.280 
that but I wanted to talk about III as
well<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.740> what<00:01:52.829> we<00:01:52.890> saw<00:01:53.040> at<00:01:53.729> e3<00:01:54.659> about<00:01:55.110> black

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
well and what we saw at e3 about black

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.730 
well and what we saw at e3 about black
ops<00:01:55.439> 2<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.030> so<00:01:57.030> just<00:01:57.750> two<00:01:58.200> things<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.500> wanted<00:01:58.680> to

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
ops 2 and so just two things I wanted to

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.030 
ops 2 and so just two things I wanted to
note<00:01:58.920> our<00:01:59.130> note<00:01:59.490> about<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.710> sniping<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
note our note about it is sniping the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.800 
note our note about it is sniping the
sniping<00:02:02.399> gameplay<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.850> they<00:02:02.969> showed<00:02:03.210> showed

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
sniping gameplay that they showed showed

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.510 
sniping gameplay that they showed showed
something<00:02:04.229> similar<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.070> like<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> team

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
something similar to like a team

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.160 
something similar to like a team
fortress<00:02:05.880> 2<00:02:06.060> type<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.360> thing<00:02:06.540> or<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.020> have<00:02:07.140> a

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
fortress 2 type of thing or you have a

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.779 
fortress 2 type of thing or you have a
charge<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.920> bring<00:02:08.129> up<00:02:08.220> your<00:02:08.280> scope<00:02:08.580> and

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
charge so you bring up your scope and

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.540 
charge so you bring up your scope and
then<00:02:09.270> there's<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.479> charge<00:02:09.780> on<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:11.340> lock

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
then there's a charge on it and you lock

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.680 
then there's a charge on it and you lock
the<00:02:11.730> longer<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.030> let<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.180> charge<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.540> guess

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
the longer you let it charge I guess

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.640 
the longer you let it charge I guess
there's<00:02:12.930> more<00:02:13.080> penetration

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
there's more penetration

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.410 
there's more penetration
now<00:02:14.189> in<00:02:14.370> Team<00:02:14.519> Fortress<00:02:14.549> 2<00:02:14.849> obviously<00:02:15.360> you

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
now in Team Fortress 2 obviously you

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.940 
now in Team Fortress 2 obviously you
just<00:02:15.569> get<00:02:15.689> more<00:02:15.780> damage<00:02:16.170> which<00:02:16.560> could<00:02:16.739> also<00:02:16.829> be

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
just get more damage which could also be

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.069 
just get more damage which could also be
the<00:02:17.099> case<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.459> this<00:02:17.640> but<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.209> seems<00:02:18.510> like<00:02:18.659> the

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
the case in this but it seems like the

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:20.119 
the case in this but it seems like the
longer<00:02:19.349> you<00:02:19.439> let<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.620> charge<00:02:19.890> more

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
longer you let it charge more

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.500 
longer you let it charge more
penetration<00:02:20.519> through<00:02:20.819> walls<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.150> things<00:02:21.239> it

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
penetration through walls and things it

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.500 
penetration through walls and things it
has<00:02:21.629> so<00:02:22.470> that's<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:23.010> bonus<00:02:23.159> and<00:02:23.610> obviously<00:02:24.360> you

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
has so that's a bonus and obviously you

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.259 
has so that's a bonus and obviously you
can<00:02:24.659> see<00:02:24.810> things<00:02:25.019> through<00:02:25.290> walls<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:26.129> uh<00:02:26.269> wall

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
can see things through walls so uh wall

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.440 
can see things through walls so uh wall
banging<00:02:27.689> and<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.950> think<00:02:29.549> this<00:02:29.849> may<00:02:30.120> be<00:02:30.150> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
banging and I think this may be the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.170 
banging and I think this may be the
campers<00:02:30.840> demise<00:02:31.200> in<00:02:31.530> black<00:02:32.310> ops<00:02:32.489> 2<00:02:32.609> i'm<00:02:32.909> sure

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
campers demise in black ops 2 i'm sure

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.490 
campers demise in black ops 2 i'm sure
there'll<00:02:33.359> be<00:02:33.450> something<00:02:33.780> probably<00:02:34.200> to

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
there'll be something probably to

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.080 
there'll be something probably to
counter<00:02:34.829> it<00:02:34.859> whether<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.549> just<00:02:35.790> be<00:02:35.879> like<00:02:36.060> a

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
counter it whether that just be like a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.349 
counter it whether that just be like a
scrambler<00:02:36.750> or<00:02:36.989> i<00:02:37.680> don't<00:02:38.579> i<00:02:38.849> hope<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.180> not<00:02:39.269> a

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
scrambler or i don't i hope it's not a

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.569 
scrambler or i don't i hope it's not a
perk<00:02:39.629> but<00:02:40.140> if<00:02:40.230> it's<00:02:40.349> a<00:02:40.470> scrambler<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.159> they

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
perk but if it's a scrambler and they

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.069 
perk but if it's a scrambler and they
can<00:02:41.909> just<00:02:42.120> kind<00:02:42.299> of<00:02:42.359> like<00:02:42.540> place<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.930> but<00:02:43.019> they

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
can just kind of like place it but they

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.839 
can just kind of like place it but they
can't<00:02:43.260> go<00:02:43.379> out<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.680> radius<00:02:44.099> that<00:02:44.670> would

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
can't go out of that radius that would

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.940 
can't go out of that radius that would
be<00:02:44.939> really<00:02:45.090> cool<00:02:45.329> or<00:02:45.629> maybe<00:02:46.230> they<00:02:46.470> just<00:02:46.500> become

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
be really cool or maybe they just become

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.729 
be really cool or maybe they just become
less<00:02:47.280> visible<00:02:47.819> as<00:02:48.629> they<00:02:49.019> go<00:02:49.170> away<00:02:49.290> from<00:02:49.620> the

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
less visible as they go away from the

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.220 
less visible as they go away from the
scrambler<00:02:50.220> or<00:02:50.370> whatever<00:02:50.639> or<00:02:51.209> more<00:02:51.870> visible<00:02:52.170> I

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
scrambler or whatever or more visible I

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.839 
scrambler or whatever or more visible I
mean<00:02:52.409> sorry<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.889> less<00:02:53.250> visible<00:02:53.579> as<00:02:53.700> they're

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
mean sorry and less visible as they're

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.180 
mean sorry and less visible as they're
closer<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.329> it<00:02:54.480> but<00:02:55.019> you<00:02:55.230> never<00:02:55.379> know<00:02:55.530> so<00:02:55.859> I'm

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
closer to it but you never know so I'm

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.860 
closer to it but you never know so I'm
not<00:02:56.609> too<00:02:56.790> sure<00:02:56.970> about<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.329> but<00:02:57.389> I'm<00:02:57.720> sure

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
not too sure about that but I'm sure

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.440 
not too sure about that but I'm sure
we'll<00:02:58.019> see<00:02:58.049> it<00:02:58.260> but<00:02:58.620> as<00:02:58.799> we've<00:02:59.639> seen<00:02:59.670> now<00:03:00.060> from

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
we'll see it but as we've seen now from

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.690 
we'll see it but as we've seen now from
that<00:03:00.629> game<00:03:00.810> play<00:03:01.049> there<00:03:01.739> will<00:03:01.980> be<00:03:02.010> some<00:03:02.400> kind

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
that game play there will be some kind

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.690 
that game play there will be some kind
of<00:03:03.260> attachment<00:03:04.260> whether<00:03:05.099> it's<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.340> top<00:03:05.549> to

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
of attachment whether it's the top to

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.119 
of attachment whether it's the top to
your<00:03:05.790> attachment<00:03:06.269> or<00:03:06.389> a<00:03:06.840> kill<00:03:07.590> streak<00:03:07.709> that

your attachment or a kill streak that

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.970
