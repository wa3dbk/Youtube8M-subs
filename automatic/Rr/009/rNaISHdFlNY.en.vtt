165<00:00:09.269> guitar<00:00:09.929> amplifier<00:00:10.820> now<00:00:11.820> we<00:00:11.880> have<00:00:12.420> the

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
165 guitar amplifier now we have the

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.990 
165 guitar amplifier now we have the
back<00:00:13.170> view<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.769> amplifier<00:00:14.190> right<00:00:14.580> now<00:00:14.790> I

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
back view of this amplifier right now I

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.240 
back view of this amplifier right now I
want<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.809> point<00:00:15.960> out<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:16.680> amplifier

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
want to point out that this amplifier

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.359 
want to point out that this amplifier
has<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.760> original<00:00:18.289> electric<00:00:19.289> voice<00:00:19.439> model

amplifier you'll also note that we have

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.740 
amplifier you'll also note that we have
had<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.260> tubes<00:00:31.590> replaced<00:00:32.399> by<00:00:33.239> our<00:00:33.420> guitar

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
had the tubes replaced by our guitar

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.260

don't<00:00:47.489> think<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.940> see<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.239> very<00:00:48.390> well<00:00:48.629> but

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
don't think you can see it very well but

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.310 
don't think you can see it very well but
it's<00:00:49.050> right<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.350> there<00:00:49.530> that's<00:00:49.829> an<00:00:49.980> original<00:00:50.160> -

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
it's right in there that's an original -

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.779 
it's right in there that's an original -
now<00:00:52.320> these<00:00:52.530> amplifiers<00:00:52.890> weren't<00:00:53.370> made<00:00:53.520> for<00:00:53.550> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
now these amplifiers weren't made for a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.889 
now these amplifiers weren't made for a
very<00:00:53.850> long<00:00:54.239> time<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:55.070> these<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
very long time and these have the

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.260 
very long time and these have the
signature<00:00:57.899> walnut<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.739> oak<00:00:59.070> cabinet<00:01:00.030> style

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
signature walnut and oak cabinet style

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.970 
signature walnut and oak cabinet style
and<00:01:00.809> I'm<00:01:00.870> going<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.079> turn<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.379> around<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:01.920> you

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and I'm going to turn it around for you

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.520 
and I'm going to turn it around for you
so<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.789> can<00:01:02.940> see<00:01:03.270> what<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.870> looks<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:04.229> from

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
so you can see what that looks like from

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.060 
so you can see what that looks like from
the<00:01:04.710> side<00:01:05.900> it<00:01:06.900> almost<00:01:07.110> reminds<00:01:07.500> me<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.950> old

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the side it almost reminds me of the old

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.789 
the side it almost reminds me of the old
Mesa<00:01:08.430> Boogie<00:01:09.000> amplifiers<00:01:09.659> from<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.530> same

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
Mesa Boogie amplifiers from that same

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.480 
Mesa Boogie amplifiers from that same
time<00:01:11.070> period<00:01:11.460> now<00:01:12.710> let's<00:01:13.710> take<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> look<00:01:14.220> at<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
time period now let's take a look at the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.160 
time period now let's take a look at the

beefed up the sound probably would want

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.309 
beefed up the sound probably would want
to<00:03:48.700> add<00:03:48.849> some<00:03:49.120> trouble<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.629> that<00:03:49.780> too<00:03:50.019> if<00:03:50.200> you

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
to add some trouble to that too if you

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.920 
to add some trouble to that too if you

here go over to our EQ slider section of

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.920 
here go over to our EQ slider section of
these<00:04:05.950> these<00:04:06.430> sliders<00:04:06.760> work<00:04:07.120> very<00:04:07.450> well<00:04:07.540> very

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
these these sliders work very well very

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.949 
these these sliders work very well very
active<00:04:08.439> type<00:04:08.620> of<00:04:08.769> an<00:04:08.889> EQ<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:10.450> want<00:04:10.599> to<00:04:10.689> cut<00:04:10.840> out

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
active type of an EQ you want to cut out

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.179 
active type of an EQ you want to cut out
all<00:04:11.139> the<00:04:11.260> bass<00:04:13.349> really<00:04:14.349> thin<00:04:14.650> off<00:04:14.769> the<00:04:14.950> sound

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:15.189 
all the bass really thin off the sound

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.979 
all the bass really thin off the sound
and<00:04:15.609> these<00:04:16.359> these<00:04:16.570> really<00:04:16.630> do<00:04:16.989> make<00:04:17.169> a

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
and these these really do make a

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.909 
and these these really do make a
significant<00:04:19.989> difference<00:04:20.109> as<00:04:20.500> you're<00:04:20.709> using

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
significant difference as you're using

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.189 
significant difference as you're using
them<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:21.849> now<00:04:22.180> let's<00:04:22.419> take<00:04:22.630> a<00:04:22.690> listen<00:04:23.020> to

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
them so now let's take a listen to

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:27.240 
them so now let's take a listen to
channel<00:04:24.160> 2<00:04:24.370> now<00:04:25.120> we<00:04:25.180> have<00:04:25.509> the<00:04:25.690> ability<00:04:25.810> to<00:04:26.410> use

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
channel 2 now we have the ability to use

00:04:27.250 --> 00:05:00.629 
channel 2 now we have the ability to use
some<00:04:27.580> overdrive<00:04:28.180> sound<00:04:28.479> here

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.890 

so<00:05:01.639> as<00:05:01.729> you<00:05:01.819> can<00:05:01.909> see<00:05:02.060> it's<00:05:02.210> got<00:05:02.360> a<00:05:02.389> vintage

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
so as you can see it's got a vintage

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.369 
so as you can see it's got a vintage
overdrive<00:05:03.770> character<00:05:04.310> to<00:05:04.490> it<00:05:04.690> almost<00:05:05.690> towards

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:06.379 
overdrive character to it almost towards

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:24.660 
overdrive character to it almost towards
the<00:05:06.500> foot<00:05:06.710> side<00:05:06.979> as<00:05:07.190> you<00:05:07.340> turn<00:05:07.550> all<00:05:07.729> the

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.810 

so<00:05:25.670> there<00:05:25.880> we<00:05:25.970> have<00:05:26.120> it<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:27.080> 1980<00:05:28.070> acoustic

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
so there we have it the 1980 acoustic

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.770 
so there we have it the 1980 acoustic
model<00:05:29.210> 165<00:05:30.050> guitar<00:05:30.590> amp
