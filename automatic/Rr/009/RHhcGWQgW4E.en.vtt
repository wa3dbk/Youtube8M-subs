00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
reason why i use that is is that it

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.679 
reason why i use that is is that it
allows<00:01:06.000> my<00:01:06.390> bait<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:07.680> fish<00:01:08.119> it<00:01:09.119> just<00:01:09.299> allows<00:01:09.479> my

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
allows my bait to fish it just allows my

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.130 
allows my bait to fish it just allows my
bait<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.990> fish<00:01:10.110> around<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.650> not<00:01:11.720> if<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.990> was

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
bait to fish around and not if it was

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.350 
bait to fish around and not if it was
just<00:01:13.170> stuck<00:01:13.590> there<00:01:13.830> it'd<00:01:14.610> be<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:14.820> sit<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.330> one

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
just stuck there it'd be just sit in one

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.570 
just stuck there it'd be just sit in one
spot<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:16.200> here<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:17.250> bait<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.780> go<00:01:18.780> up<00:01:19.369> it<00:01:20.369> can

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
spot but here that bait can go up it can

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.090 
spot but here that bait can go up it can
come<00:01:20.790> back<00:01:20.970> down<00:01:21.650> so<00:01:22.650> i<00:01:22.680> would<00:01:22.979> highly

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100
