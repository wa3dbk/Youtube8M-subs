00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
stopped the rotation before it was able

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.840 
stopped the rotation before it was able
to<00:02:54.850> fully<00:02:55.300> get<00:02:55.630> around<00:02:55.989> so<00:02:56.890> one<00:02:57.250> thing<00:02:57.520> that<00:02:57.820> I

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
to fully get around so one thing that I

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.020 
to fully get around so one thing that I
always<00:02:58.030> like<00:02:58.239> to<00:02:58.680> point<00:02:59.680> out<00:03:00.010> or<00:03:00.370> make<00:03:00.850> it

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
always like to point out or make it

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.690 
always like to point out or make it
known<00:03:01.270> to<00:03:01.570> you<00:03:01.720> is<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.680> those<00:03:03.070> previous

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
known to you is that those previous

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.729 
known to you is that those previous
tricks<00:03:04.000> are<00:03:04.180> really<00:03:04.209> really<00:03:04.959> really<00:03:05.170> really

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
tricks are really really really really

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.290 
tricks are really really really really
important<00:03:06.220> especially<00:03:06.400> when<00:03:07.150> you're

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
important especially when you're

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.870 
important especially when you're
combining<00:03:07.570> two<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:08.200> them<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:09.130> basically<00:03:09.340> this

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
combining two of them so basically this

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.880 
combining two of them so basically this
trick<00:03:10.239> is<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:10.420> combination<00:03:11.080> of<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.290> pop<00:03:11.530> shuvit

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
trick is a combination of a pop shuvit

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.820 
trick is a combination of a pop shuvit
and<00:03:12.190> a<00:03:12.519> kickflip<00:03:13.000> so<00:03:13.720> if<00:03:14.110> you<00:03:14.260> don't<00:03:14.440> have<00:03:14.650> your

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
and a kickflip so if you don't have your

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.070 
and a kickflip so if you don't have your
pop<00:03:15.070> shove-its<00:03:15.459> down<00:03:15.640> really<00:03:16.090> really<00:03:16.269> really

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
pop shove-its down really really really

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.910 
pop shove-its down really really really
well

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
well

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.920 
well
then<00:03:18.070> it's<00:03:18.250> gonna<00:03:18.400> be<00:03:18.489> super<00:03:19.000> hard<00:03:19.480> because

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
then it's gonna be super hard because

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.660 
then it's gonna be super hard because
you're<00:03:20.080> adding<00:03:20.410> a<00:03:20.500> kickflip<00:03:20.920> into<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.459> pop

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
you're adding a kickflip into the pop

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.610 
you're adding a kickflip into the pop
shuvit<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.299> it's<00:03:22.780> just<00:03:22.959> gonna<00:03:23.049> get<00:03:23.290> away<00:03:23.560> from

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
shuvit and it's just gonna get away from

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.710 
shuvit and it's just gonna get away from
you<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:23.980> it's<00:03:24.130> gonna<00:03:24.250> be<00:03:24.430> really<00:03:24.640> hard<00:03:25.030> so

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
you and it's gonna be really hard so

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.750 
you and it's gonna be really hard so
when<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.320> did<00:03:26.500> your<00:03:26.650> pop<00:03:26.860> shuvit<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.489> board

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
when you did your pop shuvit the board

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.479 
when you did your pop shuvit the board
did<00:03:28.360> get<00:03:28.690> away<00:03:28.810> from<00:03:28.989> you<00:03:29.380> so<00:03:29.920> what<00:03:30.100> I<00:03:30.130> want<00:03:30.370> you

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
did get away from you so what I want you

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.190 
did get away from you so what I want you
to<00:03:30.610> do<00:03:30.730> is<00:03:30.880> actually<00:03:31.060> go<00:03:31.420> back<00:03:31.750> to<00:03:31.780> that

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
to do is actually go back to that

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.050 
to do is actually go back to that
previous<00:03:32.470> steps<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.250> get<00:03:33.370> better<00:03:33.610> at<00:03:33.910> your

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
previous steps and get better at your

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.009 
previous steps and get better at your
pop<00:03:34.360> shove-its

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
pop shove-its

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.350 
pop shove-its
so<00:03:35.560> really<00:03:36.100> really<00:03:36.459> really<00:03:36.700> get<00:03:37.000> your<00:03:37.120> pop

so really really really get your pop
shove-its<00:03:37.750> down<00:03:37.900> super<00:03:38.470> well<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:39.040> usually<00:03:39.549> set

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
shove-its down super well I usually set

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.050 
shove-its down super well I usually set
just<00:03:40.390> like<00:03:40.480> a<00:03:40.600> goal<00:03:41.019> like<00:03:41.470> I<00:03:41.829> would<00:03:42.489> say<00:03:42.700> do

five in a row and then everyday you
skate<00:03:47.320> do<00:03:47.709> pop<00:03:48.519> shove-its<00:03:49.000> like<00:03:49.269> literally

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
skate do pop shove-its like literally

basic tricks every day cuz just that's

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.850 
basic tricks every day cuz just that's
gonna<00:03:58.600> build<00:03:58.870> up<00:03:58.989> your<00:03:59.110> board<00:03:59.380> control<00:03:59.739> and

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
it's gonna make it far easier so then

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.470 
it's gonna make it far easier so then
once<00:04:03.400> you've<00:04:03.549> done<00:04:03.610> that<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.120> you've<00:04:04.239> got

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
once you've done that and you've got

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.789 
once you've done that and you've got
your<00:04:04.600> pop<00:04:04.780> shove-its<00:04:05.140> really<00:04:05.380> down<00:04:05.530> you're

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
your pop shove-its really down you're

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.620 
your pop shove-its really down you're
ready<00:04:05.920> to<00:04:06.190> go<00:04:06.340> back<00:04:06.579> into<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:07.060> very<00:04:07.269> old<00:04:07.420> kick

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
flips you should do the practice step of

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.819 
flips you should do the practice step of
stepping<00:04:10.480> off<00:04:10.630> with<00:04:10.840> your<00:04:10.989> back<00:04:11.260> foot<00:04:11.560> and

there to catch it so I actually don't
care<00:04:35.229> if<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:36.249> board<00:04:36.520> gets<00:04:36.759> away<00:04:36.999> from<00:04:37.029> you

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
care if the board gets away from you

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.089 
care if the board gets away from you
really<00:04:37.599> far<00:04:38.080> because<00:04:38.650> you're<00:04:38.889> just

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
really far because you're just

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.580 
really far because you're just
practicing<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.969> flick<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.629> making<00:04:41.499> the

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
practicing the flick and making the

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.739 
practicing the flick and making the
board<00:04:41.800> spin<00:04:42.159> and<00:04:42.400> then<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.610> catch<00:04:42.849> and<00:04:43.240> once

00:04:43.739 --> 00:04:43.749 
board spin and then the catch and once

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:45.600 
board spin and then the catch and once
you<00:04:43.900> have<00:04:44.080> that<00:04:44.110> step<00:04:44.650> down<00:04:44.860> then<00:04:45.249> you<00:04:45.400> can

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
you have that step down then you can

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.219 
you have that step down then you can
work<00:04:45.819> on<00:04:45.969> just<00:04:46.240> putting<00:04:46.449> the<00:04:46.629> board<00:04:46.840> closer

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
work on just putting the board closer
