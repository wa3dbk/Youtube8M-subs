we've attached a strike plate with
3-inch<00:01:50.750> screws<00:01:51.140> they'll<00:01:52.100> actually<00:01:52.280> go

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
3-inch screws they'll actually go

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.819 
3-inch screws they'll actually go
through<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.030> frame<00:01:53.240> work<00:01:53.450> into<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:53.990> 2x4

if it works out well this door will be

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.289 
if it works out well this door will be
dramatically<00:02:01.130> stronger<00:02:01.430> than<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.909> previous

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
dramatically stronger than the previous

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:17.600 
dramatically stronger than the previous
door<00:02:02.740> let's<00:02:03.740> try<00:02:03.920> it<00:02:04.040> out

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:25.050 

right<00:02:18.390> over<00:02:18.570> there

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.100 

all<00:02:26.060> right<00:02:27.640> well<00:02:28.640> this<00:02:29.540> door<00:02:29.780> was<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:29.960> bit

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
all right well this door was a bit

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.250 
all right well this door was a bit
weaker<00:02:30.350> than<00:02:30.380> we<00:02:30.620> expected<00:02:31.870> but<00:02:32.870> our<00:02:33.020> work

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
weaker than we expected but our work

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.570 
weaker than we expected but our work
held<00:02:34.570> free<00:02:35.570> and<00:02:35.690> screws<00:02:36.190> as<00:02:37.190> long<00:02:37.460> as<00:02:37.520> you

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
held free and screws as long as you

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.270 
held free and screws as long as you
don't<00:02:37.700> have<00:02:37.880> an<00:02:37.970> extremely<00:02:38.480> weak<00:02:38.600> door<00:02:39.280> this

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
don't have an extremely weak door this

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.160 
don't have an extremely weak door this
may<00:02:40.550> be<00:02:40.610> all<00:02:40.850> it<00:02:41.000> takes<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:42.650> course

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
may be all it takes of course

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.360 
may be all it takes of course
even<00:02:45.170> with<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.380> door<00:02:45.560> this<00:02:45.680> week<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.130> does

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
even with the door this week it does

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.460 
even with the door this week it does
increase<00:02:46.940> your<00:02:47.210> reaction<00:02:47.660> time<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.350> we

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
increase your reaction time and we

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.680 
increase your reaction time and we
discovered<00:02:48.890> that<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.130> weakest<00:02:49.460> link<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:50.630> our

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
discovered that the weakest link and our

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.570 
discovered that the weakest link and our
security<00:02:51.260> chain<00:02:51.470> so<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:51.740> speak<00:02:52.040> was<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.370> door

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
security chain so to speak was the door

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.050 
security chain so to speak was the door
itself<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:54.320> hardware<00:02:54.740> on<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.820> frame

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
itself the hardware on the frame

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.080 
itself the hardware on the frame
actually<00:02:56.600> held<00:02:56.810> well<00:02:57.770> now<00:02:58.400> we've<00:02:58.640> got<00:02:58.790> another

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
actually held well now we've got another

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.530 
actually held well now we've got another
door<00:02:59.330> this<00:03:00.170> is<00:03:00.320> your<00:03:00.500> standard<00:03:01.240> house<00:03:02.240> door

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
this is a metal clad door so it's gonna

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.110 
this is a metal clad door so it's gonna
be<00:03:03.980> a<00:03:04.010> lot<00:03:04.100> stronger<00:03:04.400> than<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.790> one<00:03:04.940> we<00:03:05.090> just

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
be a lot stronger than the one we just

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.360 
be a lot stronger than the one we just
demonstrated<00:03:05.900> on<00:03:06.020> once<00:03:06.710> again<00:03:06.950> we've<00:03:07.130> removed

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
demonstrated on once again we've removed

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.700 
demonstrated on once again we've removed
small<00:03:07.700> screws<00:03:08.000> from<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.210> strike<00:03:08.510> plates<00:03:08.780> and

small screws from the strike plates and

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.080 
small screws from the strike plates and
replace<00:03:10.040> them<00:03:10.190> with<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.400> three<00:03:10.580> inch<00:03:10.760> screws

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
replace them with the three inch screws

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.080 
replace them with the three inch screws
now<00:03:12.190> we're<00:03:13.190> gonna<00:03:13.280> do<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.460> demonstration<00:03:13.880> on

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
now we're gonna do a demonstration on

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:35.530 
now we're gonna do a demonstration on
this<00:03:14.240> one<00:03:14.390> see<00:03:14.570> what<00:03:14.690> happens

rescrew still in there doing these
experiments<00:04:10.110> is<00:04:10.260> actually<00:04:10.560> quite

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
experiments is actually quite

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.050 
experiments is actually quite
interesting<00:04:11.220> we<00:04:11.340> always<00:04:11.610> recommend<00:04:11.910> the

interesting we always recommend the
three<00:04:12.329> inch<00:04:12.450> screws<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:13.310> you<00:04:14.310> can<00:04:14.489> see<00:04:15.109> they

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
three inch screws and you can see they

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.779 
three inch screws and you can see they
held<00:04:16.609> in<00:04:17.609> this<00:04:17.850> case<00:04:18.090> however<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:19.609> door<00:04:20.609> is

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
held in this case however the door is

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.390 
held in this case however the door is
still<00:04:21.000> attached<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.600> frame<00:04:22.010> the<00:04:23.010> frame<00:04:23.220> is

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
still attached to the frame the frame is

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.189 
still attached to the frame the frame is
just<00:04:23.430> no<00:04:23.699> longer<00:04:23.910> attached<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.660> stud<00:04:24.930> here

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199
