00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:06.560
 apparently it will improve in the 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.120
 people and maybe maybe because 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.120
 now I imagine the weather 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.230
 you have ambitions he would have in 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.230
 made them put forward has finally done 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.350
 complicated still against Germany but 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.420
 it's good 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.969
 no this kind of match that we acquire 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.969
 of remaining experience does not happen to you 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.539
 you 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.030
 apply a little bit what I got 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.100
 of delay with the train so autumn 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.690
 automatically everything is shifted so the 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.180
 places the training is done in a 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.950
 frame so the players then have 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.369
 hurried to take their landlords 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.369
 amenities 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.650
 it's just the best way to 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.060
 prepare an international meeting 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.200
 when there is five centimeters of snow 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.579
 hard and 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.890
 and when the terrain is impassable 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.530
 so we can always prepare peugeot 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.960
 football tomorrow for all and month the 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.189
 context a and not too bad that you 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.750
 dead surface and his rich lady not a 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.310
 problem we do not have that either 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.890
 take too much energy swam less 2 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.650
 before the match so 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.190
 you're going to have to dose to find the 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.190
 best balance possible 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.230
 with our we have opportunity for hope 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.200
 must adapt to all conditions 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.330
 because that's the case today when 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.660
 we have equipment problems when he 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.510
 there is bad weather is fine here for a 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.100
 can go up the pulse 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.650
 Here it is cool because another 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.270
 practical and it's nice it's fun 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.270
 and it feels good from time to time 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.390
 of the game in waves with sequences of 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.520
 30 seconds 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.880
 the boss in prison is for 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.880
 to work 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.629
 underneath you 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.120
 to play 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.580
 and 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.890
 what is it worth 30 seconds in 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.900
 made early strikes turbines 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.879
 I was so we could play five 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.709
 seconds and then we play 30 seconds is 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.390
 the first team that marks the air and 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.830
 the other 10000 we take this with the 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.250
 smile but we try workers 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.250
 even thales 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.890
 it 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:14.560
 we had felt deceived his fault in tvq 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.560
 you would not put his site here 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.150
 the ball 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:59.420
 to have fun so it changes 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:05:01.870
 of usual and breathes and others 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.100
 sensations but when we go to Strasbourg 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.160
 we are more likely to come across a 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.900
 snow storm on sand internet 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.850
 but fantastic home 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.340
 in half an hour they found us 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.760
 a room for us to work 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.750
 there are 2 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.520
 the field '' the pontificate is nice 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.240
 who are going to prove the myth tomorrow and 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:27.470
 reindeer caen a fantastic welcome the 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.470
