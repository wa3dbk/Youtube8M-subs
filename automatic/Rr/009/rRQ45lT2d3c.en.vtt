hey guys I just want to show you a
really<00:00:09.750> quick<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.170> easy<00:00:10.380> way<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.710> test<00:00:11.160> your

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
really quick and easy way to test your

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.190 
really quick and easy way to test your
coils<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:11.940> becomes<00:00:12.330> really<00:00:12.540> frustrating<00:00:13.170> when

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
coils it becomes really frustrating when

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.980 
coils it becomes really frustrating when
you<00:00:13.620> have<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> no<00:00:14.009> spark<00:00:14.370> problem<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.030> it

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
you have a no spark problem and it

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.230 
you have a no spark problem and it
becomes<00:00:16.590> even<00:00:16.920> harder<00:00:17.160> when<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:17.850> just<00:00:18.029> start

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
becomes even harder when you just start

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.550 
becomes even harder when you just start
from<00:00:18.449> when<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.720> hit<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.900> bike<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.289> still

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
from when you hit the bike and you still

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.500 
from when you hit the bike and you still
can't<00:00:19.800> figure<00:00:19.980> out<00:00:20.039> what's<00:00:20.279> wrong<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.150> want

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
can't figure out what's wrong so I want

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
an old bike we went ahead and took the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.810 
an old bike we went ahead and took the
tank<00:00:36.870> off<00:00:37.020> our<00:00:37.200> bike<00:00:37.380> most<00:00:38.250> cases<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.670> guys

tank off our bike most cases you guys
don't<00:00:39.059> have<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:39.870> snake

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
don't have to do that you can just snake

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.500 
don't have to do that you can just snake
the<00:00:40.350> wires<00:00:40.379> right<00:00:40.829> out<00:00:41.010> from<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.219> coil<00:00:41.520> we're

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the wires right out from the coil we're

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.670 
the wires right out from the coil we're
going<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> start<00:00:42.870> off<00:00:42.930> by<00:00:42.960> checking<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
going to start off by checking the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.220 
going to start off by checking the
primary<00:00:44.100> side<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.520> coil<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:45.780> range<00:00:45.989> on

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
primary side of the coil the range on

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.020 
primary side of the coil the range on
the<00:00:46.410> primary<00:00:46.770> side<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> coil<00:00:47.520> we're

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
the primary side of the coil we're

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.700 
the primary side of the coil we're
looking<00:00:48.239> for<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.629> roughly<00:00:48.930> three<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.530> five

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
looking for is roughly three to five

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.740 
looking for is roughly three to five
ohms<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.789> you're<00:00:51.059> gonna<00:00:51.180> go<00:00:51.329> ahead<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.600> shake

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
ohms so you're gonna go ahead and shake

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.470 
ohms so you're gonna go ahead and shake
your<00:00:51.840> take<00:00:52.559> your<00:00:52.739> multimeter<00:00:53.550> switch<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.449> to

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
your take your multimeter switch it to

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.869 
your take your multimeter switch it to
the<00:00:54.600> home<00:00:54.809> setting<00:00:55.140> we're<00:00:55.980> using<00:00:56.129> 200<00:00:56.730> here

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the home setting we're using 200 here

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.490 
the home setting we're using 200 here
that's<00:00:57.180> probably<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.719> lowest<00:00:58.050> setting<00:00:58.230> on

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
that's probably the lowest setting on

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.299 
that's probably the lowest setting on
most<00:00:58.859> your<00:00:59.329> multimeters<00:01:00.329> up<00:01:00.570> there<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.890> we're

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
most your multimeters up there so we're

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.709 
most your multimeters up there so we're
gonna<00:01:02.399> go<00:01:02.550> ahead<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.760> find<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> pigtail<00:01:03.480> and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
gonna go ahead and find the pigtail and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.440 
gonna go ahead and find the pigtail and
disconnect<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.040> your<00:01:05.970> pigtail<00:01:06.270> should

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
disconnect it and your pigtail should

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.600 
disconnect it and your pigtail should
have<00:01:06.540> two<00:01:06.750> wires<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:07.260> run<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.590> coil<00:01:07.920> we

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
have two wires we run to the coil we

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.550 
have two wires we run to the coil we
want<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.939> side<00:01:09.150> going<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> coil<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.380> we're

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
want the side going to the coil so we're

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.660 
want the side going to the coil so we're

three to five by Japanese bike you're

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.780 
three to five by Japanese bike you're
usually<00:01:28.439> pretty<00:01:28.860> good<00:01:29.040> but<00:01:29.310> definitely<00:01:29.520> check

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
usually pretty good but definitely check

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.520 
right now this says it's a good coil so
we're<00:01:38.820> not<00:01:38.970> done<00:01:39.270> there<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:40.049> way<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.200> checked

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
we're not done there the way I checked

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.859 
we're not done there the way I checked
the<00:01:40.740> secondary<00:01:41.280> side<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.270> check<00:01:42.720> your

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the secondary side so to check your

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.899 
the secondary side so to check your
secondary<00:01:43.350> side<00:01:43.680> go<00:01:44.040> ahead<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.340> take<00:01:44.520> one<00:01:44.790> of

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
secondary side go ahead and take one of

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.240 
secondary side go ahead and take one of
the<00:01:45.000> leads<00:01:45.210> out<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:46.140> pigtail<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:46.770> you

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the leads out of the pigtail here you

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.679 
the leads out of the pigtail here you
can<00:01:47.399> leave<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> other<00:01:47.729> one<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.149> neither<00:01:48.420> side

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
can leave the other one in neither side

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.569 
can leave the other one in neither side
doesn't<00:01:48.960> matter<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:50.189> you're<00:01:50.399> going<00:01:50.520> to

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
doesn't matter and you're going to

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.450 
doesn't matter and you're going to
switch<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:50.759> multimeter<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.540> 20k<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.500> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
switch your multimeter to 20k and the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.280 
switch your multimeter to 20k and the
reason<00:01:53.759> we're<00:01:53.880> going<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.149> 20k<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.140> we're

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
reason we're going to 20k is that we're

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.520 
reason we're going to 20k is that we're
looking<00:01:55.439> for<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.829> number<00:01:56.009> right<00:01:56.520> around<00:01:56.759> 10k<00:01:57.530> I

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
looking for a number right around 10k I

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.440 
looking for a number right around 10k I
guess<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.070> had<00:01:59.219> same<00:01:59.430> thing<00:01:59.670> give<00:01:59.880> or<00:02:00.000> take<00:02:00.180> so

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
guess I had same thing give or take so

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.999 
guess I had same thing give or take so
check<00:02:00.810> your<00:02:00.930> manual<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.380> find<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.770> exact

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
check your manual to find the exact

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.240 
check your manual to find the exact
specifications<00:02:02.899> but<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.409> want<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.619> take<00:02:04.799> your

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
specifications but you want to take your

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.089 
specifications but you want to take your
plug<00:02:06.240> wire<00:02:06.450> here<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.200> stick<00:02:07.500> your<00:02:07.619> other<00:02:07.829> lead

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
plug wire here and stick your other lead

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.010 
plug wire here and stick your other lead
in<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:09.950> as<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.220> see<00:02:11.400> we<00:02:11.790> have<00:02:12.030> nothing<00:02:12.480> so

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
in it and as you see we have nothing so

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.280 
in it and as you see we have nothing so
this

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
this

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.929 
this
probably<00:02:13.829> means<00:02:14.069> there's<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.430> break<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:14.819> our

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
probably means there's a break in our

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.720 
probably means there's a break in our
secondary<00:02:15.540> oil<00:02:15.930> somewhere<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:17.459> we

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
secondary oil somewhere and that we

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.550 
secondary oil somewhere and that we
definitely<00:02:18.030> need<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.480> replace<00:02:18.629> it<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.319> this

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
definitely need to replace it so this

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.410 
definitely need to replace it so this
definitely<00:02:19.859> explains<00:02:20.310> why<00:02:20.519> we<00:02:20.670> have<00:02:20.819> no<00:02:21.060> spark

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
definitely explains why we have no spark

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.809 
definitely explains why we have no spark
on<00:02:21.569> this<00:02:21.750> bike<00:02:22.099> all<00:02:23.099> right<00:02:23.219> you<00:02:23.310> guys<00:02:23.459> see<00:02:23.670> what

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
on this bike all right you guys see what

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.940 
on this bike all right you guys see what
a<00:02:23.849> bad<00:02:24.000> coil<00:02:24.329> looks<00:02:24.569> like<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.079> I<00:02:25.469> just<00:02:25.739> want<00:02:25.890> to

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
a bad coil looks like so I just want to

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.709 
a bad coil looks like so I just want to
show<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.099> good<00:02:26.430> coil<00:02:26.670> looks<00:02:26.909> like<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.569> on

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
show a good coil looks like this is on

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.170 
show a good coil looks like this is on
our<00:02:27.870> CL<00:02:28.439> 360<00:02:29.159> and<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.459> bike<00:02:29.609> runs<00:02:29.879> really<00:02:30.090> well

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
our CL 360 and the bike runs really well

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.050 
our CL 360 and the bike runs really well
so<00:02:30.629> we<00:02:30.810> know<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.109> coil<00:02:31.319> is<00:02:31.439> in<00:02:31.530> good<00:02:31.650> shape<00:02:32.060> I'm

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
so we know the coil is in good shape I'm

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.280 
so we know the coil is in good shape I'm
going<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.299> go<00:02:33.390> ahead<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.629> check<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.870> primary

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
going to go ahead and check the primary

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.220 
going to go ahead and check the primary
windings<00:02:34.739> which<00:02:35.099> are<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.579> coil<00:02:36.109> sorry<00:02:37.109> the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
windings which are the coil sorry the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.660 
windings which are the coil sorry the
primary<00:02:37.530> wire<00:02:37.650> which<00:02:37.829> is<00:02:37.859> the<00:02:38.099> pigtail<00:02:38.459> that

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
primary wire which is the pigtail that

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.149 
primary wire which is the pigtail that
goes<00:02:38.790> straight<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.420> coil<00:02:39.629> and<00:02:40.159> you'll

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
goes straight to the coil and you'll

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.789 
goes straight to the coil and you'll
switch<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.549> to<00:02:41.639> 200<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.900> we<00:02:43.379> should<00:02:43.590> see<00:02:43.769> a

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
switch it to 200 and we should see a

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.660 
switch it to 200 and we should see a
number<00:02:44.069> between<00:02:44.430> 3<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:45.000> 5<00:02:45.269> ohms<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:46.670> right

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
number between 3 to 5 ohms and right

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.360 
number between 3 to 5 ohms and right
there<00:02:48.030> for<00:02:48.540> 546<00:02:49.439> ohms<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.010> we're<00:02:50.250> definitely

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
there for 546 ohms so we're definitely

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.849 
there for 546 ohms so we're definitely
within<00:02:50.730> range<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.989> second<00:02:52.590> thing<00:02:52.739> we're

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
within range the second thing we're

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.879 
within range the second thing we're
gonna<00:02:52.980> check<00:02:53.189> is<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.879> secondary<00:02:54.510> coil<00:02:54.889> which

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
gonna check is the secondary coil which

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.110 
gonna check is the secondary coil which
we're<00:02:56.159> gonna<00:02:56.220> go<00:02:56.430> ahead<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:56.579> leave<00:02:56.730> our<00:02:56.939> one

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
we're gonna go ahead and leave our one

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.699 
we're gonna go ahead and leave our one
lead<00:02:57.299> from<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.599> multimeter<00:02:58.079> connected

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709

go and stick right in the spark plug
wire<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:05.720> you<00:03:06.720> see<00:03:06.930> we're<00:03:07.319> right<00:03:07.500> there<00:03:07.769> at<00:03:08.010> 14

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
wire and you see we're right there at 14

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.729 
wire and you see we're right there at 14
thousand<00:03:08.909> ohms<00:03:09.060> roughly<00:03:09.629> which<00:03:10.139> is<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.290> good

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
thousand ohms roughly which is a good

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.460 
thousand ohms roughly which is a good
reading<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:11.939> is<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.120> good<00:03:12.239> coil<00:03:12.540> hopefully

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
reading so this is a good coil hopefully

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.509 
reading so this is a good coil hopefully
this<00:03:13.560> was<00:03:13.680> important<00:03:14.099> enough<00:03:14.159> for<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:14.489> guys
