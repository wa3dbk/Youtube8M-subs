00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello my name is ellen lohr and me 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.720
 I have been a pro in motorsport for 25 years 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.730
 and today is a special one for me 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.559
 day because I'm allowed to spend a whole day 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.570
 with the new only very slightly 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.710
 camouflaged m-class of mercedes-benz im 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.710
 go to the terrain 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:27.440
 of course that's what it looks like inside 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:31.369
 all very in love out but I may 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.620
 he will look and discover it everywhere 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.820
 many new features like very excited 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.820
 because make out everywhere 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.970
 and in off-road terrain you want 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.180
 Of course, try out what the 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.590
 new m-class on it just has on 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.300
 every case at first glance 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.800
 are various off-road programs and 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.129
 here I am looking for me bringing a 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:59.070
 the steepest slopes out of that are 60 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.300
 65 percent offroad program 2 das 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.000
 means that I have some parameters 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.580
 change and theoretically do the car 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.180
 everything for me 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.590
 by itself and it is as well 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.530
 incredibly unbelievable what that 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.870
 electronics provide in the terrain 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:23.130
 that's really fascinating without one 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.060
 problem climbs you just have to 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.650
 steer a bit by yourself 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.650
 everything else does auto by itself 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:40.009
 so now the whole downhill with the dsl 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.009
 speed regulation is irish holes 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:50.560
 in the car hands feet trust everything from 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.330
 Steering wheel you can adjust with wifi 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.250
 km / h you want to go downhill 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.939
 that was five now you can choose 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:03.789
 between 2 to 18 km h with 18 km h the 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:05.799
 Of course, then is pretty quick on 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.420
 in any case, the system takes everything 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.229
 if you want because you can of course 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.229
 even without driving 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.750
 that was a nice one 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.090
 challenge, however, not so 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.250
 really for the new driving programs in 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.390
 the new m-class 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.959
 Now we are looking for something else 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.190
 for example, now asphalt that is not 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.260
 bad because that's really one 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.340
 everyday situation and does not drive 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.230
 every case against forest but such a 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.310
 slope on asphalt asphalt wet asphalt 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.130
 happens more often 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.239
 Then introduce yourself now that times 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.350
 automatic program because I know 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.890
 not really what was behind me 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.880
 expected 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.880
 just take a look 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.260
 make the car even more alone 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.680
 not to be expected at all 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.680
 problem 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.349
 among them 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.720
 the terrain on which we are today 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.830
 is of course great because that offers 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.610
 everything your heart desires 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.560
 Accordingly, I have the time now 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.250
 leveling all the way up 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.170
 hazards 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.150
 because I do not know what to expect 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.680
 I only saw a lot of water and you 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.920
 already up and down and entanglements 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.819
 everything for exactly the wrong reason 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.819
 the car all the way up 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.970
 That's where it starts with one 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.870
 Quite water passage one excited 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.870
 if there are no rubber boots 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.850
 that's pretty much 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:07.240
 that's pretty cool my goodness cool 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.020
 There are no problems with the feet 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.790
 stay dry that's another one 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.830
 more pleasant and you to the racing car 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:22.580
 because you definitely have it now 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:24.560
 wet fireproof like everything easily 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.330
 but it is still over in the 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.950
 water to drive in if you do not 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.480
 really knows how deep it is now 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.480
 of course offroad terrain 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.190
 that would fit otherwise you would 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.230
 maybe before with you 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.480
 the rubber boots go see if it 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:43.550
 at all possible is what water to 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:46.940
 driving through at the highest level 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:51.580
 total of this leveling regulation 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:54.020
 It's three inches higher than 8 cm 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.040
 normal so the level you on the 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.680
 street would choose 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.300
 is the problem everywhere in it as 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.400
 eight centimeters is of course already one 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.410
 whole lot 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:08.430
 That's right off-road trial 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:12.020
 drive so you actually stretch 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.020
 only takes if you want to have fun 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.560
 if you do not know what to you 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.930
 Of course you all take too 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.600
 technical tools that go in the 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.840
 case, that means really full offroad 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.840
 package 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:32.710
 the downhill speed regulation and 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.860
 of course the reduction for 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:38.979
 shorter gears but then is not yet 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.620
 everything completely without problems and if something 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:44.280
 then you can completely without any problems 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.280
 really fun 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.330
 an off-road day with the m class is on the way 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.590
 the end was a lot of fun 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:59.110
 all tasks done but now goes 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.600
 It's back to normal on the country road 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.640
 there too i have to say everything is perfect 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.200
 feels good 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.200
 so it was a nice one
