my first step is probably a wheel
bearing<00:01:18.110> but<00:01:19.110> um<00:01:19.610> hopefully<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.030> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420

know<00:01:21.540> hopefully<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:21.960> not<00:01:22.020> nothing<00:01:22.410> crazy<00:01:22.740> like

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
know hopefully is not nothing crazy like

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.770 
know hopefully is not nothing crazy like
a<00:01:23.040> transmission<00:01:23.640> bearing<00:01:24.150> or<00:01:24.270> nothing<00:01:24.600> but
