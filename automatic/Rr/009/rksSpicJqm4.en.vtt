00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:05.180
 well this is what he asked me 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.620
 and let's see 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.740
 coast has done 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.679
 a cube of rubik inside 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.679
 a third subject 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.309
 small damages from other expeditions 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.060
 Look 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.060
 I really had too good 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:26.039
 as it only happens to investigate with this 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.039
 good thing about their one day and I can not stand 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.840
 and it seemed to me to avoid the losses 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.240
 great resource or little active 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.240
 so 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.070
 remove a piece 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.400
 although later we discovered that there is one of the pieces 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.600
 that has a screw 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.600
 by the warehouse conjugate that the world is world 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.200
 d for it is not like that 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.200
 one piece 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.620
 you do not have to wake up 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.180
 which days 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.210
 maybe for lack 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.210
 miramax 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.220
 savior is broken you do not have to be like that 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.220
 the soft screws 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.290
 it's worth counting the piece 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.600
 we have brought skin type 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.950
 this piece was in the afternoon 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.940
 the murderers 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.600
 and they are formed 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.950
 a little pachuca and cougars 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.140
 good we won 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.560
 the corners 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.560
 They are all the same 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.740
 shakira models 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.280
 and must about the day dt also 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.890
 smiling 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.729
 cha 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:56.610
 of the heras 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.340
 pesic 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.930
 as well as various 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.930
 there's like a kind of circus title 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.010
 which allows to aspire 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.010
 crow and that is based on three essential axes 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.609
 flowers what if we are pulling 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:18.879
 how to get it out 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.259
 we believe that we arrived 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:25.259
 one thing is that you love 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:28.839
 the zucchini 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:30.899
 about what we saw world 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:33.899
 a cube of rubik 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:37.169
 about it nuanced 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:39.659
 well, our mind 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.659
 on which then it had to be traced 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:46.559
 a screw would already mount a whole plan well 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.229
 from that he allowed us 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:55.229
 from the heap a cube of rubik out of fear 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:02.849
 to promote riding it but ashton collazo and would not accept that includes 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.209
 video posted on youtube 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.519
 as a documentary they were 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.009
 so I was wearing 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:10.879
 If there is someone or not 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.139
 Seeing how a poor rubik cube is 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.139
 Sheput loves wine 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:19.230
 they all speak
