00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:07.620
 Hello 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.170
 Today I'm going to teach how to make makeup. 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.950
 for daytime events especially for 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.440
 weddings and celebration parties to 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.170
 Makeup for the day should not be too much 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.050
 Dark is good that does not contain much 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.289
 glitter or glow but highlight and 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.480
 highlight look I chose a make-up 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.480
 with shades of brown and a bit of 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.000
 golden shimmering eyelashes 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.309
 eyelashes and eyeliner 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.200
 if you only go for an event one 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.640
 child party is not necessary 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.399
 put on false eyelash 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.770
 but if it's a marriage I think 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.289
 cool idea 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:51.149
 I already have the skin ready I 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.550
 I used a primer and koi concealer 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.309
 blush also I took to give a 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.789
 contour and lighten the face 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.039
 I always start with my makeup 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:08.909
 using an opaque brown shadow on the 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:11.070
 concave and wiis smoke it well and this 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.439
 makes it easier to join others 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.439
 shadows on the most beautiful finish 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.290
 The second step is to use a shadow 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.619
 that illuminates 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:32.159
 I opted for this sparkling brown but 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:35.369
 you can use one the pact also with 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.530
 the shadow brush I 'll apply on 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.770
 moving eyelid and yields eyelashes 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.770
 inferior 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.119
 now I come back with the brown shadow and 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.130
 apply a little on the concave in the corner 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.369
 only to reinforce a little 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.369
 more 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.690
 to light up a little more I will use a 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.769
 about eyebrow arching 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.769
 and in the inner corner of the eyes 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.239
 To finish the makeup, I'm going 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.620
 apply to the false eyelashes 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.620
 eyeliner and mascara 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.629
 and so a make-up is made for 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.629
 urn events
