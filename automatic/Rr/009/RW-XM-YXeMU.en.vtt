been entirely digital it's been using
computer<00:00:19.980> graphics<00:00:20.090> game<00:00:21.090> engines<00:00:21.539> and

computer graphics game engines and

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.660 
computer graphics game engines and
things<00:00:21.930> like<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.140> but<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.890> began<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.460> think

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
things like that but I began to think

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.060 
things like that but I began to think
what<00:00:24.119> would<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.420> take<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:25.170> do<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.619> kind<00:00:25.980> of

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
what would it take to do this kind of

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.040 
what would it take to do this kind of
thing<00:00:26.310> for<00:00:26.550> real<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:27.060> an<00:00:27.150> actual<00:00:27.660> camera

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
thing for real with an actual camera

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.230 
thing for real with an actual camera
well<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.890> turns<00:00:29.099> out<00:00:29.310> there's<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.670> group<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.000> San

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
well it turns out there's a group in San

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.459 
on his shirt a space VR have an awesome
plan<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.239> why<00:00:45.870> don't<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.140> tell<00:00:46.289> us<00:00:46.350> about

plan and why don't you tell us about
your<00:00:46.680> awesome<00:00:47.039> plan<00:00:47.219> our<00:00:47.760> plan<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.629> want

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
your awesome plan our plan is we want

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.380 
your awesome plan our plan is we want
everyone<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.219> all<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.180> be<00:00:51.300> able

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
everyone you and all of you to be able

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.779 
everyone you and all of you to be able
to<00:00:51.510> be<00:00:51.690> astronauts

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
to be astronauts

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.090 
to be astronauts
so<00:00:53.789> not<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.600> internet<00:00:55.020> astronauts<00:00:55.559> or<00:00:55.770> what

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
so not just internet astronauts or what

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.799 
so not just internet astronauts or what
because<00:00:56.430> going<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.760> space<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.270> very<00:00:57.360> expensive

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
because going to space is very expensive

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.020 
because going to space is very expensive
true<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.800> we<00:00:59.250> unfortunately<00:00:59.550> can't

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
true so we unfortunately can't

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.880 
true so we unfortunately can't
physically<00:01:00.390> send<00:01:00.750> everyone<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.109> space<00:01:01.469> so

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
physically send everyone to space so

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.139 
physically send everyone to space so
what<00:01:02.039> we're<00:01:02.190> doing<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.640> we're<00:01:02.850> putting<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
what we're doing is we're putting a

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.390 
what we're doing is we're putting a
virtual<00:01:03.600> reality<00:01:04.110> camera<00:01:04.320> instead<00:01:04.799> that

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
virtual reality camera instead that

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.520 
virtual reality camera instead that
would<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.640> our<00:01:05.790> surrogate<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.510> space<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.439> it

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
would be our surrogate in space and it

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.960 
would be our surrogate in space and it
will<00:01:07.619> allow<00:01:07.770> us<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.070> experience<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:08.820> if

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
will allow us to experience that as if

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.149 
will allow us to experience that as if
we<00:01:09.210> were<00:01:09.390> there<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:10.229> can<00:01:10.380> all<00:01:10.560> look<00:01:10.830> around

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
we were there so we can all look around

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.300 
we were there so we can all look around
and<00:01:11.610> lay<00:01:12.330> back<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.720> admire<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.650> world<00:01:13.860> as<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
and lay back and admire the world as the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.490 
and lay back and admire the world as the
astronaut<00:01:14.729> sees<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.210> that's<00:01:15.570> exactly<00:01:16.140> just

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500

bit<00:01:44.190> of<00:01:44.280> inspirational<00:01:44.940> into<00:01:45.270> our<00:01:45.450> astronaut

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
bit of inspirational into our astronaut

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.330 
bit of inspirational into our astronaut
oh<00:01:46.229> yeah<00:01:46.680> we'd<00:01:47.610> love<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.850> refer<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.390> him<00:01:48.659> as

oh yeah we'd love to refer to him as

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.730 
oh yeah we'd love to refer to him as
well<00:01:50.340> Stanley<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.940> think<00:01:51.300> that<00:01:51.690> I<00:01:52.259> have<00:01:52.560> noticed

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
well Stanley I think that I have noticed

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.919 
well Stanley I think that I have noticed
the<00:01:53.100> Babylon<00:01:53.640> 5<00:01:53.670> logo<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.539> it's<00:01:54.720> true<00:01:54.899> I

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
the Babylon 5 logo on it it's true I

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:56.120 
the Babylon 5 logo on it it's true I
mean<00:01:55.170> we're<00:01:55.289> all<00:01:55.350> really<00:01:55.560> passionate<00:01:56.070> about

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
mean we're all really passionate about

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.419 
mean we're all really passionate about
space<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:56.610> bit<00:01:57.360> nerdy<00:01:58.050> ourselves<00:01:58.740> yes<00:01:59.100> but

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
really we all believe that we should be

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.240 
really we all believe that we should be
in<00:02:01.020> there<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.380> our<00:02:01.410> passion<00:02:01.890> from<00:02:02.009> their

in there so our passion from their
presence<00:02:03.000> over<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.479> next<00:02:03.780> thing<00:02:03.929> which<00:02:04.350> is

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
presence over to the next thing which is

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.980 
presence over to the next thing which is
put<00:02:05.190> it<00:02:05.310> together<00:02:05.429> the<00:02:05.700> device<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.179> spoon<00:02:06.360> now

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
put it together the device the spoon now

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.290 
put it together the device the spoon now
we<00:02:07.410> are<00:02:07.770> going<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.070> be<00:02:08.220> 3d<00:02:08.580> printing<00:02:09.030> aboard

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
we are going to be 3d printing aboard

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.880 
we are going to be 3d printing aboard
the<00:02:09.390> International<00:02:09.840> Space<00:02:09.869> Station<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.649> for

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
the International Space Station and for

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.500 
the International Space Station and for
that<00:02:11.039> we<00:02:11.489> went<00:02:11.790> through<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.000> whole<00:02:12.180> bunch<00:02:12.209> of

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
that we went through a whole bunch of

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.030 
that we went through a whole bunch of
different<00:02:12.780> designs<00:02:12.870> some<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:13.950> were

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
different designs some that were

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
different designs some that were
successful<00:02:14.700> some<00:02:15.570> not<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:16.260> successful<00:02:17.060> but

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
successful some not so successful but

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.390 
successful some not so successful but
all<00:02:18.300> of<00:02:18.450> them<00:02:18.630> were<00:02:18.840> meant<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.400> eventually

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
all of them were meant to eventually

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.229 
all of them were meant to eventually
build<00:02:20.640> up<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.620> overview<00:02:22.950> one<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
build up to the overview one so the

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.660 
build up to the overview one so the
overview<00:02:24.510> one<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:25.110> 12<00:02:25.440> cameras<00:02:25.980> set<00:02:26.400> up<00:02:26.430> a

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
overview one is 12 cameras set up a

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.460 
overview one is 12 cameras set up a
stereo<00:02:27.060> pairs<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:28.019> will<00:02:28.140> be<00:02:28.230> able<00:02:28.350> to

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
stereo pairs that will be able to

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.259 
stereo pairs that will be able to
capture<00:02:28.709> in<00:02:29.010> high<00:02:29.160> resolution<00:02:29.430> what<00:02:30.150> it's

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
capture in high resolution what it's

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.940 
capture in high resolution what it's
like<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.600> be<00:02:30.630> in<00:02:30.780> space<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.560> send<00:02:31.739> it<00:02:31.829> back

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
like to be in space and send it back

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.250 
like to be in space and send it back
down<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:32.549> it's<00:02:32.640> basically<00:02:33.030> six<00:02:33.510> pairs<00:02:33.840> that's

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
down so it's basically six pairs that's

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.650 
down so it's basically six pairs that's
ours<00:02:34.620> working<00:02:34.860> in<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.250> cube<00:02:35.549> and<00:02:35.790> then<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.450> get

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
ours working in a cube and then you get

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.270 
ours working in a cube and then you get
all<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.049> imagery<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.769> you<00:02:37.829> stitch<00:02:38.250> it

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
all that imagery and you stitch it

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.860 
all that imagery and you stitch it
together<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:39.000> magically<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:39.660> have<00:02:39.840> a

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
together and magically you have a

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.720 
together and magically you have a
spherical<00:02:40.230> image<00:02:40.470> which<00:02:40.769> is<00:02:40.799> useful<00:02:41.489> for

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
spherical image which is useful for

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.470 
spherical image which is useful for
virtual<00:02:42.299> reality<00:02:42.329> right<00:02:46.190> ok<00:02:47.190> so<00:02:47.220> that's<00:02:47.970> 4

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
virtual reality right ok so that's 4

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.150 
virtual reality right ok so that's 4
megapixels<00:02:49.320> per<00:02:49.470> camera<00:02:49.680> because<00:02:49.890> those<00:02:50.010> are

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
megapixels per camera because those are

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.360 
megapixels per camera because those are
GoPros<00:02:50.519> right<00:02:50.820> yes<00:02:51.470> 4<00:02:52.470> megapixels<00:02:53.010> per<00:02:53.130> camera

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
GoPros right yes 4 megapixels per camera

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.640 
GoPros right yes 4 megapixels per camera
times<00:02:53.820> 12<00:02:54.209> that's<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.750> lot<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:54.900> megapixels<00:02:55.230> no

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
times 12 that's a lot of megapixels no

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.770 
times 12 that's a lot of megapixels no
it's<00:02:55.829> just<00:02:55.920> sorry<00:02:56.130> it's<00:02:56.310> no<00:02:56.400> 4<00:02:56.640> megapixels<00:02:57.239> 4k

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
it's just sorry it's no 4 megapixels 4k

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.300 
resolution that's 8 megapixel right
generates<00:03:01.049> about<00:03:01.680> seven-and-a-half

make it easier we have taken a little

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.110 
make it easier we have taken a little
liberty<00:03:30.840> with<00:03:30.960> our<00:03:31.140> GoPros<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:32.580> we<00:03:32.760> completely

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
liberty with our GoPros so we completely

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.730 
liberty with our GoPros so we completely
took<00:03:33.330> it<00:03:33.480> apart<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.110> make<00:03:34.260> it's<00:03:34.440> pretty

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
took it apart and to make it's pretty

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.080 
took it apart and to make it's pretty

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
certified it to make us that they all

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.940 
certified it to make us that they all
work<00:03:36.270> well<00:03:36.540> together<00:03:36.720> we're<00:03:37.560> getting<00:03:37.830> all<00:03:37.920> of

matter the CCD onboard electronics and
data<00:03:45.750> storage<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:46.950> we<00:03:47.130> are<00:03:47.250> repackaging<00:03:48.180> it

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
data storage and we are repackaging it

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.750 
data storage and we are repackaging it
so<00:03:49.200> in<00:03:49.350> a<00:03:49.440> one<00:03:49.650> unified<00:03:50.070> system<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.580> can<00:03:50.700> be

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
so in a one unified system that can be

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.520 
so in a one unified system that can be
controlled<00:03:51.209> from<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.600> ground<00:03:51.630> is<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.470> the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
controlled from the ground is that the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.170 
controlled from the ground is that the
astronaut<00:03:52.980> just<00:03:53.190> has<00:03:53.310> to<00:03:53.430> push<00:03:53.580> a<00:03:53.610> button<00:03:53.880> and

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
astronaut just has to push a button and

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.390 
astronaut just has to push a button and
it<00:03:54.330> starts<00:03:54.540> recording<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:55.739> then<00:03:55.830> onboard<00:03:56.280> the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
it starts recording and then onboard the

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.140 
it starts recording and then onboard the
space<00:03:56.640> station

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
space station

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.870 
space station
etc<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.720> little<00:03:57.989> CubeSat<00:03:58.890> back<00:03:59.190> we'll<00:03:59.850> be

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
etc a little CubeSat back we'll be

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.250 
etc a little CubeSat back we'll be
running<00:04:00.120> some<00:04:00.390> software<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:00.870> do<00:04:01.110> some

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
running some software to do some

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.380 
running some software to do some
stitching<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:01.770> compression<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.790> reduce<00:04:02.940> the

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
stitching and compression to reduce the

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.940 
stitching and compression to reduce the
data<00:04:03.600> that<00:04:03.750> comes<00:04:03.989> down<00:04:04.170> so<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:04.560> instead<00:04:04.860> of

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
data that comes down so that instead of

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.979 
data that comes down so that instead of
seven<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.340> send<00:04:06.050> 624<00:04:07.050> gigabytes

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
seven to send 624 gigabytes

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.199 
seven to send 624 gigabytes
also<00:04:09.989> okay<00:04:10.380> so<00:04:10.440> even<00:04:11.010> then<00:04:11.400> that's<00:04:11.610> quite<00:04:12.090> an

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
also okay so even then that's quite an

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.940 
also okay so even then that's quite an
amazing<00:04:12.660> journey<00:04:12.870> home<00:04:13.290> to<00:04:13.320> get<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.769> data

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
amazing journey home to get the data

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.770 
amazing journey home to get the data
back<00:04:14.160> from<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.640> space<00:04:14.910> station<00:04:15.360> is<00:04:15.480> still

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
back from the space station is still

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.729 
back from the space station is still
quite<00:04:16.739> a<00:04:17.299> complex<00:04:18.299> they<00:04:18.870> a<00:04:18.900> system<00:04:19.380> right<00:04:19.560> to

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
quite a complex they a system right to

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.680 
quite a complex they a system right to
get<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:19.919> data<00:04:20.100> back<00:04:20.280> I<00:04:20.609> mean<00:04:20.760> it<00:04:21.180> is<00:04:21.330> rocket

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
get the data back I mean it is rocket

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:22.280 
get the data back I mean it is rocket
science

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
science

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.190 
science
for<00:04:22.650> sure<00:04:23.120> but<00:04:24.120> if<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.419> think<00:04:24.540> of<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:24.810> really

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
for sure but if you think of it really

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.200 
for sure but if you think of it really
simply<00:04:25.800> -<00:04:26.010> so<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.340> space<00:04:26.460> station<00:04:27.000> has<00:04:27.180> a

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
simply - so the space station has a

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.390 
simply - so the space station has a
network<00:04:28.020> system<00:04:28.350> why<00:04:28.800> five<00:04:29.100> things<00:04:29.340> that

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
network system why five things that

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.219 
network system why five things that
we're<00:04:29.550> familiar<00:04:29.669> with<00:04:29.940> but<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.960> space

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
we're familiar with but the space

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.870 
we're familiar with but the space
station<00:04:31.620> is<00:04:31.710> connected<00:04:31.890> directly<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.669> a

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
station is connected directly to a

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.420 
station is connected directly to a
geostationary<00:04:33.810> satellite<00:04:34.290> constellation

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
geostationary satellite constellation

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.490 
geostationary satellite constellation
teachers<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.600> so<00:04:36.750> teachers<00:04:37.230> sends

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
teachers and so teachers sends

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.530 
teachers and so teachers sends
information<00:04:37.650> back<00:04:38.190> down<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:38.610> earth<00:04:38.760> which

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
information back down to earth which

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.240 
information back down to earth which
means<00:04:39.570> that<00:04:40.080> there's<00:04:40.260> inherently<00:04:40.860> a<00:04:40.920> couple

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
means that there's inherently a couple

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.770 
means that there's inherently a couple
of<00:04:41.340> delays<00:04:41.580> because<00:04:41.880> of<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.300> speed<00:04:42.510> of<00:04:42.540> light

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
of delays because of the speed of light

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.230 
of delays because of the speed of light
and<00:04:43.470> so<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.860> most<00:04:44.070> real<00:04:44.370> time<00:04:44.580> we<00:04:44.730> can<00:04:44.880> get<00:04:45.030> is

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
and so the most real time we can get is

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.600 
and so the most real time we can get is
at<00:04:45.390> least<00:04:45.570> 300<00:04:45.900> milliseconds<00:04:46.290> well<00:04:47.250> we<00:04:47.370> should

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
at least 300 milliseconds well we should

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.920 
at least 300 milliseconds well we should
be<00:04:47.760> able<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:47.970> provide<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.420> real-time

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
be able to provide a real-time

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.480 
be able to provide a real-time
experience<00:04:49.320> between<00:04:49.770> one<00:04:49.980> and<00:04:50.010> a<00:04:50.100> half<00:04:50.280> and

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
experience between one and a half and

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.040 
experience between one and a half and
anything<00:04:50.880> that's<00:04:51.420> pretty<00:04:51.600> awesome<00:04:51.930> I<00:04:52.020> mean

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
anything that's pretty awesome I mean

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.420 
anything that's pretty awesome I mean
the<00:04:52.290> whole<00:04:52.440> thing<00:04:52.470> is<00:04:52.710> you<00:04:53.040> know<00:04:53.160> you're<00:04:53.310> gonna

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
the whole thing is you know you're gonna

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.850 
the whole thing is you know you're gonna
be<00:04:53.520> putting<00:04:54.090> this<00:04:54.150> camera<00:04:54.390> inside<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.590> space

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
be putting this camera inside the space

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.340 
be putting this camera inside the space
station<00:04:56.310> and<00:04:56.880> you<00:04:57.780> actually<00:04:57.960> have<00:04:58.260> the

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
station and you actually have the

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.290 
station and you actually have the
Kickstarter<00:04:58.950> up<00:04:59.070> here<00:04:59.370> so<00:04:59.820> you're<00:05:00.000> trying<00:05:00.240> to

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
Kickstarter up here so you're trying to

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.250 
Kickstarter up here so you're trying to
raise<00:05:00.480> half<00:05:00.990> a<00:05:01.080> million<00:05:01.260> dollars<00:05:02.780> so<00:05:03.780> and<00:05:03.960> the

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
raise half a million dollars so and the

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.170 
raise half a million dollars so and the
ultimate<00:05:04.920> goal<00:05:04.950> will<00:05:05.310> be<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.460> put<00:05:05.730> the<00:05:05.850> camera

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
ultimate goal will be to put the camera

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.730 
ultimate goal will be to put the camera
as<00:05:06.330> you<00:05:06.360> photoshopped<00:05:07.230> in<00:05:07.440> here<00:05:07.650> obviously

as you photoshopped in here obviously

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.350 
as you photoshopped in here obviously
because<00:05:08.190> you<00:05:08.310> don't<00:05:08.460> sneak<00:05:08.760> one<00:05:08.940> up<00:05:09.120> right

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
because you don't sneak one up right

able to have before so there's a there's
been<00:05:37.710> about<00:05:37.860> 540<00:05:38.640> people<00:05:38.940> have<00:05:39.030> ever

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
been about 540 people have ever

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.820 
been about 540 people have ever
experienced<00:05:39.660> space<00:05:39.840> now<00:05:40.530> with<00:05:40.680> this

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
experienced space now with this

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.130 
experienced space now with this
technology<00:05:41.190> the<00:05:41.670> other<00:05:41.790> 7<00:05:42.300> billion<00:05:42.660> of<00:05:42.750> us<00:05:42.900> are

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
technology the other 7 billion of us are

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.600 
technology the other 7 billion of us are
finally<00:05:43.590> gonna<00:05:43.710> get<00:05:43.890> to<00:05:43.950> get<00:05:44.100> a<00:05:44.160> shot<00:05:44.400> at<00:05:44.580> it

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
finally gonna get to get a shot at it

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.330 
finally gonna get to get a shot at it
and<00:05:45.330> so<00:05:45.480> with<00:05:45.630> our<00:05:45.660> Kickstarter<00:05:46.290> the<00:05:46.410> $500,000

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
and so with our Kickstarter the $500,000

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.430 
and so with our Kickstarter the $500,000
will<00:05:47.940> cover<00:05:48.180> our<00:05:48.360> first<00:05:48.630> year<00:05:48.810> of<00:05:48.840> operations

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
will cover our first year of operations

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.500 
will cover our first year of operations
of<00:05:49.560> our<00:05:49.680> launch<00:05:49.860> cost<00:05:50.160> so<00:05:50.880> as<00:05:50.970> soon<00:05:51.150> as<00:05:51.240> we<00:05:51.360> get

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
of our launch cost so as soon as we get

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.630 
of our launch cost so as soon as we get
this<00:05:51.750> we're<00:05:52.260> taking<00:05:52.590> everyone<00:05:52.800> space<00:05:53.130> right

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
this we're taking everyone space right

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.160 
this we're taking everyone space right
and<00:05:53.760> so<00:05:54.000> these<00:05:54.300> cameras<00:05:54.780> you<00:05:54.900> know<00:05:54.930> you've

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.170 
and so these cameras you know you've

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.810 
and so these cameras you know you've
disassembled<00:05:55.800> them<00:05:55.890> you've<00:05:56.010> torn<00:05:56.310> them<00:05:56.490> apart

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
disassembled them you've torn them apart

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.990 
disassembled them you've torn them apart
to<00:05:57.060> make<00:05:57.090> them<00:05:57.420> space<00:05:57.840> viable<00:05:58.380> and<00:05:58.560> I<00:05:59.370> presume

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
to make them space viable and I presume

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.210 
to make them space viable and I presume
they're<00:06:00.240> also<00:06:00.390> vacuum<00:06:01.020> capable<00:06:01.500> as<00:06:01.620> well<00:06:01.830> they

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
they're also vacuum capable as well they

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:08.720 
they're also vacuum capable as well they
are<00:06:06.080> so<00:06:07.080> we'll<00:06:07.200> be<00:06:07.350> able<00:06:07.440> to<00:06:07.590> have<00:06:07.920> a<00:06:07.950> new<00:06:08.400> view

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.730 
are so we'll be able to have a new view

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.580 
are so we'll be able to have a new view
flying<00:06:09.240> along<00:06:09.570> next<00:06:09.840> to<00:06:10.080> the<00:06:10.170> space<00:06:10.440> station

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
flying along next to the space station

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.730 
flying along next to the space station
with<00:06:11.130> the<00:06:11.280> earth<00:06:11.430> below<00:06:11.850> us<00:06:12.060> and<00:06:12.480> nothing<00:06:12.930> but

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
with the earth below us and nothing but

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.740 
with the earth below us and nothing but
this<00:06:13.920> is<00:06:14.130> nothing<00:06:14.610> but<00:06:14.640> space<00:06:15.000> around<00:06:15.330> us<00:06:15.540> and

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
this is nothing but space around us and

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.850 
this is nothing but space around us and
I<00:06:15.810> think<00:06:15.990> that's<00:06:16.140> face<00:06:16.350> the<00:06:16.680> earth<00:06:17.600> I<00:06:18.600> am<00:06:19.200> so

00:06:53.929 --> 00:06:53.939 
was my visits to space VR I believe are

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:55.279 
was my visits to space VR I believe are
not<00:06:54.089> there<00:06:54.300> just<00:06:54.330> like<00:06:54.599> a<00:06:54.659> couple<00:06:55.020> of<00:06:55.080> blocks

00:06:57.619 --> 00:06:57.629 
from my office anyway you know one of

00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:59.389 
from my office anyway you know one of
the<00:06:57.809> really<00:06:58.020> cool<00:06:58.349> things<00:06:58.649> about<00:06:58.770> this<00:06:59.069> is<00:06:59.279> it

00:06:59.389 --> 00:06:59.399 
the really cool things about this is it

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:01.939 
the really cool things about this is it
isn't<00:06:59.550> just<00:06:59.699> a<00:06:59.999> plan<00:07:00.270> to<00:07:00.689> fly<00:07:00.930> a<00:07:01.199> camera<00:07:01.770> in

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:01.949 
isn't just a plan to fly a camera in

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:04.309 
isn't just a plan to fly a camera in
space<00:07:02.279> that<00:07:02.550> does<00:07:02.669> 360<00:07:03.389> they<00:07:03.539> want<00:07:03.809> to<00:07:03.960> get<00:07:04.110> the

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 
space that does 360 they want to get the

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:06.499 
space that does 360 they want to get the
data<00:07:04.559> back<00:07:04.800> in<00:07:05.099> real<00:07:05.339> time<00:07:05.699> and<00:07:05.969> stream<00:07:06.360> it

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:06.509 
data back in real time and stream it

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:08.179 
data back in real time and stream it
back<00:07:06.689> to<00:07:06.899> the<00:07:07.020> earth<00:07:07.169> and<00:07:07.409> that's<00:07:07.800> something

00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:08.189 
back to the earth and that's something
