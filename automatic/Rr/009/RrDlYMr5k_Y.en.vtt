 and 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.670

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.020
 rope 4 there we'll start with the riff 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.880
 main thing that is this 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.880
 and the same of all with the pen 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.190
 and 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:11.250
 then we are what is in 37 and 39 after 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.640
 37 rope 5 x 39 rope 4 the riff that already 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.640

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.000
 and then we go down to the bottom 10 and 12 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.410
 we upload it to fret 5 and 7 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.690
 and we put it to the bottom 35 twice 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.229

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.229

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.420
 and what we have is the same thing that was 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.420
 of the fret 35 we lower it to the 5 and 7 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.190
 to 79 and there we played it twice 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.480

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.510
 times 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.510

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.400
 account 3 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.450
 it would be like that 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.060
 and 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.850
