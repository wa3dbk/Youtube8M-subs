00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:11.290
 10 - ea sang ok sing today I come to bring you 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.520
 the cover the tablet cover good I'm 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.830
 sure that all those that you have 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.750
 nvidia hill as a tablet to laugh 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.480
 have it protected that you do not spoil 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.100
 and of course also the power to have it 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.199
 standing is very important to be able to 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.539
 play in a comfortable way so that I have 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.429
 bought the envy seal cover because it is 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.990
 the official and I think it will be the best 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.410
 adapt so let's open it and 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.660
 let's try it 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.250
 As you can see in the back, it indicates 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.350
 how to put it on the tablet and 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.850
 also the way to place them then for 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.500
 put it to play and the various 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.059
 degrees of inclination that we can put 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.570
 the tablet so we're not going to take it out 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.570
 from your box 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.300
 and as you can see is a kind of smart 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.489
 cover is folded to fit well with the 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.500
 tablet and then you have these 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.180
 hooks here that would be put in 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.160
 This side of the tablet fixes that 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.710
 has a couple of holes here the 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.210
 invite sil so that we place the cover 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.379
 the hitch the magnetic bullets and that 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.830
 only approaching the Notice how 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.110
 automatically adheres to one's own 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.880
 tablet and there it is pretty well subject 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.770
 despite having the magnetic coupling 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.760
 perfectly supports the weight of the 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.740
 tablet 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.330
 It is a frame case to see so I 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.950
 when I open it automatically 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.870
 the tablet's screen turns on and it 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.030
 unlock exactly the same if I 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.300
 I close the cover because the screen 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.300
 turns off 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.030
 What is so special about this case? 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.400
 that if we bend it in this way fixes 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.450
 simply so automatically 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.880
 we can leave the tablet standing 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.700
 supported here and in this way 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.900
 we can play much more comfortable without having 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.370
 than to leave it subject anywhere and 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.960
 supported on either side of course 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.160
 it's also pretty stable to fix that 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.410
 although your touch has been a bit 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.720
 tablet does not fall is pretty good and 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.960
 quite sure another way that has 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.300
 placing it is like this now that a 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.710
 little lying rather like that we will be by 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.910
 example as sitting working on this 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.350
 table with the computer whatever and 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.479
 we have here the tablet within our reach 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.640
 to manage it to have here twitter or 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.920
 whatever or even to use the 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.450
 pen and be able to draw in a comfortable way 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.050
 I do not think the inclination is perfect 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.050
 for this for example 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.480
 so if you want to play with yours 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.980
 tablet comfortably and also because 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.690
 take it well protected I recommend you 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.690
 strongly its official cover 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.500
 removing the case is as simple as 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.850
 pull hard you see that it comes out and also if 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.959
 it is a bit fixed that it is 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.959
 place again very easily 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.329
 On the other hand, if you prefer to take 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:42.920
 tablet without cover fixed that I bought 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.200
 also this in Amazon that costs 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.790
 only six euros and it's just a 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.650
 little brochure that we put for example in 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.359
 this position we can already place here 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.890
 our tablet and even we also 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.269
 ok for our smartphone because it 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.609
 fits in size is worth fixes that I 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.290
 I can here make it bigger for 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.159
 10-inch tablet for 8 tablets 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.230
 of 7 of any dimension 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.780
 practically even then you can 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.430
 obviously lift this up and 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.379
 make the tablet for example lean 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.909
 vertically you can see how to put it 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.220
 placed vertically to read the mail 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.260
 for example to enter on twitter or in 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.920
 any application in a way 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.920
 simple and comfortable 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.660
 of course the links to buy 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.160
 both the scabbard and the chick explodes 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.569
 mazon basics then I leave it in the 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.310
 description of the video 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.230
 I have to say that even though I do not 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.030
 I'm a fan of the covers for tablets 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.769
 yes it is true that it is 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.269
 quite practical because it seems very 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.920
 important in the case of envy sil 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.810
 that the afternoon is still standing 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.980
 can play mostly to see some 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.840
 movie what is problem about everything 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.430
 to play the fact of buying it official 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.230
 I think it's a good idea because of the practice 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.569
 that being magnetic that does not take up much 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.310
 that is the frame to see that it is quite 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.959
 resistant that I already tell you adhere very 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.269
 well it has a magnetic part and os 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.829
 I assure that it adheres very well and very 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.480
 stable it does not look like it's going to 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.299
 to fall and stick the way in the 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.500
 that the one that sticks and is very difficult is 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.769
 it becomes very stable very difficult to be 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.719
 fall badly fixed that pretty stable 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.219
 therefore totally recommended that yes 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:09.040
 its price a bit high to make a 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:10.689
 funda costs 30 euros but well i think 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.099
 it's worth it in this case so 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:15.599
 nothing this has been all for today 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.599
 greetings all and until next time
