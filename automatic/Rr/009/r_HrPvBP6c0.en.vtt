00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.580
 we have the butter at temperature 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.380
 environment and we will add the 150 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.240
 grams of black sugar now we add 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.660
 three quarters of a cup of sugar 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.660
 white 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.019
 we add the two eggs 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.310
 Now we will try to incorporate all 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.690
 the ingredients until we have one 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.180
 homogeneous pasta 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.690
 we have a cup of common flour I'm going 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.690
 to add here 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.550
 I add a teaspoon of baking 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.750
 let's regulate so that it is a coal 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.510
 for my half teaspoon of salt 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:25.500
 and a half more cup of flour as flour 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.500
 like a noble or dante 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.750
 and now we are going to incorporate it into our 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.470
 preparation 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.880
 well let's incorporate our flour 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.880
 we incorporated a little 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.830
 so we have to give little balls 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.230
 you know that the recipe written the 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.090
 I leave on the blog that will be down on 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.560
 the information box and in my 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.940
 facebook that I will also leave you in 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.000
 the information box on facebook 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.300
 so they can go through there and look 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.730
 the recipe 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.500
 If you have any questions, ask me 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.080
 they leave it in comments that I am 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.690
 answering 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.060
 and how was it done please subscribe 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.360
 they like me because they help me 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.810
 I can not do more videos 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.160
 incentive in what to want to be in 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.680
 this world of youtube 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.630
 well I will continue to incorporate the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:28.290
 flour as you see 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.290
 incorporate quite a bit more 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.829
 the consistency that will remain of 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.620
 the mass is this is not a mass that 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.870
 you will be able to handle with your hand 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.700
 but they will simply leave it to 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.730
 meat in the bowl and then they will 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.769
 help two spoons or if they have what 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.840
 which it is to get ice cream also will 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.349
 It serves me what I'm going to do is add 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.349
 the chocolate chips 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.610
 and mix them I'll be some for 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.120
 put them up when I'm going to 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.519
 put in the oven 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.840
 once they have mixed the mixture 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.060
 with the chocolate chips are going to 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.610
 help as I told them of two spoons in 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.920
 a floury dish already there in more 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.769
 decade like this one that I have here 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.020
 grabbing a little ball like that and they're going to 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.480
 help with the other spoon 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.210
 to put the ball does not matter if not 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.450
 they are perfect because then they leave 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.450
 molding 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.990
 the measure leaves space because this is 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.530
 it's going to be down 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.290
 what happens 21 going out is going to be towards 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.040
 down and they're going 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.290
 make the shape of the cookie 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.879
 so do not give test the form because 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.879
 if I'm not going to stay chat and if more 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.329
 now that they have it in the account 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.909
 what I 'm going to do is add some 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:50.220
 little sparkles above that I like as of 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.230
 boy but if you can not leave it like this 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.720
 more you what I recommend is that 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.870
 you put it if they have a paper 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.680
 butter put the cookies there 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:05.489
 you do not already know what it says keep a 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.849
 source in put flour as it is like 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:12.120
 says here but if they have a lot in their house 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.680
 butter paper using so this goes 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.420
 baked for 15 minutes they're going 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.130
 controlling because this is super 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.810
 Quick 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.200
 let's see how they are 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.300
 very rich girls and boys we do not talk 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.100
 so they give when they take it out of the oven I 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.170
 what I did wrong was what 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.510
 I thought they were going to expand us so much 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.400
 so I put them together, come here and 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.440
 there but good anyway you cut them 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.110
 cuts is already when a and comes pulling 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.910
 the oven sorry for like the camera 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.969
 when they take it out of the fungus as soon as 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:48.629
 consistency is a bit bland 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:50.669
 that is, do not take it out of the mold and wait 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:52.529
 a little while to cool down a bit to 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.449
 take them out and I can assure you that 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:56.849
 This is very rich, so do not look at the 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.129
 it looks like they do not always have the 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:01.919
 pint is what matters or is it a 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:04.589
 very rich thing in this case mine does not 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.979
 I was preheated like that badly wrong for me 

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:08.309
 so it took 20 minutes 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.119
 approximately 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:13.679
 they do not have to be hard because if not 

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:15.779
 they leave it longer and you say nothing 

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:17.399
 and still a little bit missing, they are not 

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:20.099
 it's going to get very hard when they get cold 

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:24.149
 then it is that they leave it in this with 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:26.819
 this texture yes they are hard yes 

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:29.729
 but not so much see that second a little 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:31.199
 there not so hard so I hope that they 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.149
 have liked the video that serves them 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:36.089

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:37.589
