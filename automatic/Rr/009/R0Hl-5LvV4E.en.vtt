I'm not gonna write a review for this

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.740 
I'm not gonna write a review for this
game<00:00:17.520> I've<00:00:17.820> had<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.060> for<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> little<00:00:18.330> while<00:00:18.450> now

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
game I've had it for a little while now

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.820 
game I've had it for a little while now
and<00:00:18.930> I'm<00:00:18.990> played<00:00:19.170> around<00:00:19.320> with<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.560> for<00:00:19.620> a<00:00:19.800> bit

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
and I'm played around with it for a bit

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.400 
and I'm played around with it for a bit
I<00:00:20.190> don't<00:00:20.940> think<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.210> really<00:00:21.330> warrants<00:00:21.870> a<00:00:22.050> a

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
I don't think it really warrants a a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.710 
I don't think it really warrants a a
review<00:00:22.830> like<00:00:23.670> we<00:00:23.790> might<00:00:23.940> write<00:00:24.300> for<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.540> site

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
review like we might write for the site

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.510 
review like we might write for the site
for<00:00:24.930> other<00:00:25.020> games<00:00:25.290> it's<00:00:25.620> not<00:00:25.800> really<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> game

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
for other games it's not really a game

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.210 
for other games it's not really a game
it's<00:00:26.760> more<00:00:26.940> of<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.120> more<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.600> teaching<00:00:27.780> tool

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
it's more of a more of a teaching tool

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.350 
it's more of a more of a teaching tool
but<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.430> thought<00:00:29.700> you<00:00:29.910> might<00:00:30.030> want<00:00:30.180> to<00:00:30.210> take<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
but I thought you might want to take a

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.880 
but I thought you might want to take a
look<00:00:30.510> at<00:00:30.600> the<00:00:30.720> cool<00:00:31.140> little<00:00:31.290> peripheral<00:00:31.710> that

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890

look at the cool little peripheral that
came<00:00:32.340> with<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.520> thing<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.149> I'll<00:00:33.329> record<00:00:33.660> some

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
came with the thing so I'll record some

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.119 
came with the thing so I'll record some
video<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.079> me<00:00:34.290> playing<00:00:34.649> around<00:00:34.800> with<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.980> game

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.540 
here goes with a DS Lite pretty
perfectly<00:00:43.499> although<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.010> does<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.249> a<00:00:44.309> little

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
perfectly although it does have a little

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.849 
perfectly although it does have a little
slider<00:00:44.820> bar<00:00:45.089> to<00:00:45.780> go<00:00:45.899> with<00:00:46.019> the<00:00:46.109> DS<00:00:46.289> phat<00:00:46.620> if

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 
slider bar to go with the DS phat if

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.979 
slider bar to go with the DS phat if
that's<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.249> des<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.609> your<00:00:47.730> choice<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.749> I'll<00:00:48.839> go

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
that's the des of your choice so I'll go

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.139 
that's the des of your choice so I'll go
ahead<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.440> attach<00:00:49.829> these<00:00:50.100> two<00:00:50.339> so<00:00:50.909> you<00:00:50.969> can<00:00:51.059> do

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
ahead and attach these two so you can do

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.989 
ahead and attach these two so you can do
it<00:00:51.239> one-handed<00:00:53.780> so<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:54.870> basically<00:00:55.050> got<00:00:55.260> about

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:55.999 
it one-handed so we basically got about

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:58.639 
it one-handed so we basically got about
three<00:00:56.999> different<00:00:57.569> modes<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:58.019> look<00:00:58.229> at<00:00:58.379> here

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
three different modes to look at here

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.669 
three different modes to look at here
we've<00:00:58.859> got<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.569> teaching<00:01:00.569> tool<00:01:00.749> mode<00:01:01.079> we've<00:01:01.440> got

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
we've got a teaching tool mode we've got

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.700 
we've got a teaching tool mode we've got
a<00:01:02.839> composition<00:01:03.839> mode<00:01:04.050> and<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.379> mode<00:01:04.559> that

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
a composition mode and the mode that

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.310 
a composition mode and the mode that
kind<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.159> looks<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.519> Guitar<00:01:05.970> Hero<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:07.170> I'm

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
kind of looks like Guitar Hero so I'm

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.420 
kind of looks like Guitar Hero so I'm

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:13.829 
I haven't played around with that too

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:16.310 
I haven't played around with that too
much<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.219> about<00:01:15.090> as<00:01:15.240> exciting<00:01:15.719> as<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.930> sounds

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
much it's about as exciting as it sounds

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.899 
much it's about as exciting as it sounds
but<00:01:16.469> let's<00:01:16.950> go<00:01:17.070> ahead<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.369> start<00:01:17.549> off<00:01:17.670> and

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
but let's go ahead and start off and

but let's go ahead and start off and
I'll<00:01:18.420> show<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.600> what<00:01:18.810> there<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.049> go<00:01:19.289> with

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:19.469 
I'll show you what there is to go with

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:20.840 
I'll show you what there is to go with
now<00:01:19.680> we<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.130> art<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.399> is<00:01:20.520> our<00:01:20.640> main

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
now we have this is art this is our main

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.539 
now we have this is art this is our main
menu<00:01:21.180> screen<00:01:21.299> right<00:01:21.570> here<00:01:21.619> it's<00:01:22.619> sort<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.950> an

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
menu screen right here it's sort of an

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.399 
menu screen right here it's sort of an
interactive<00:01:23.969> studio<00:01:24.539> here<00:01:24.899> but<00:01:25.170> let's<00:01:25.320> look

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
interactive studio here but let's look

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.749 
interactive studio here but let's look
at<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.590> Guitar<00:01:25.860> Hero<00:01:25.890> game<00:01:26.219> first<00:01:26.549> because

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
at the Guitar Hero game first because

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:27.830 
at the Guitar Hero game first because
it's<00:01:26.850> probably<00:01:26.969> the<00:01:27.240> worst<00:01:27.479> thing<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
it's probably the worst thing in the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.770 
it's probably the worst thing in the
game<00:01:30.200> okay<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.409> now<00:01:32.149> well<00:01:33.149> basically<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:33.570> using

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
game okay so now well basically be using

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.249 
game okay so now well basically be using
the<00:01:33.869> keyboard<00:01:34.079> down<00:01:34.409> here<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:36.140> correspond<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the keyboard down here to correspond the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.690 
the keyboard down here to correspond the
notes<00:01:37.469> up<00:01:37.680> here<00:01:37.710> they<00:01:38.039> don't<00:01:38.189> really<00:01:38.369> match<00:01:38.670> up

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
notes up here they don't really match up

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.480 
notes up here they don't really match up
particularly<00:01:39.450> well<00:01:40.100> but<00:01:41.100> let's<00:01:41.250> give<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.460> a

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
particularly well but let's give it a

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.859 
particularly well but let's give it a
shot<00:01:41.670> here<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.390> see<00:01:42.539> if<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.750> had

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
shot here and you can see if I had

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.990 
shot here and you can see if I had
different<00:01:43.109> outfits<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.649> could<00:01:43.920> put<00:01:44.820> her<00:01:44.880> in

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
different outfits for I could put her in

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.310 
different outfits for I could put her in
a<00:01:45.060> different<00:01:45.180> outfit<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:45.810> I've<00:01:45.899> only<00:01:45.960> got<00:01:46.109> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
a different outfit but I've only got the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:02:11.940 
a different outfit but I've only got the
one<00:01:46.439> for<00:01:46.710> so

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.520 

kinda<00:02:12.950> hard<00:02:13.100> kind<00:02:13.190> of<00:02:13.280> hard<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.490> play<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:14.530> have

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
kinda hard kind of hard to play and have

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.080 
kinda hard kind of hard to play and have
a<00:02:15.560> single<00:02:15.860> at<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.130> same<00:02:16.280> time<00:02:16.550> but<00:02:16.820> you<00:02:16.940> can

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
a single at the same time but you can

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.240 
a single at the same time but you can
see<00:02:17.209> basically<00:02:17.360> I'm<00:02:17.690> just<00:02:17.830> hitting<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.010> keys

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
see basically I'm just hitting the keys

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.940 
see basically I'm just hitting the keys
and<00:02:19.700> rhythm<00:02:20.000> with<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.450> song<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:21.440> songs<00:02:21.709> are

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
and rhythm with the song the songs are

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.310 
and rhythm with the song the songs are
pretty<00:02:22.310> poor<00:02:22.970> MIDI<00:02:23.390> interpretations<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.200> the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
pretty poor MIDI interpretations of the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.280 
pretty poor MIDI interpretations of the
actual<00:02:24.620> music<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:26.720> game<00:02:26.870> doesn't<00:02:27.170> really

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
actual music the game doesn't really

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.800 
actual music the game doesn't really
seem<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.500> care<00:02:28.000> how<00:02:29.000> close<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:29.630> are<00:02:29.690> to

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
seem to care how close you are to

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.360 
seem to care how close you are to
actually<00:02:30.320> hitting<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:31.390> timing<00:02:32.390> on<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:33.370> on

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
actually hitting the timing on the on

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.250 
actually hitting the timing on the on
the<00:02:35.150> on<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.450> note<00:02:35.660> which<00:02:35.870> is<00:02:35.900> kind<00:02:36.230> of

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
the on the note which is kind of

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.280 
the on the note which is kind of
unfortunate<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.810> next<00:02:38.959> thing<00:02:39.080> we'll<00:02:39.170> take

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
unfortunate so the next thing we'll take

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.770 
unfortunate so the next thing we'll take
a<00:02:39.320> look<00:02:39.530> at<00:02:39.709> is<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.130> composition<00:02:40.550> tool<00:02:40.940> it's

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
a look at is the composition tool it's

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.540 
a look at is the composition tool it's
down<00:02:41.930> here<00:02:42.110> in<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.290> corner<00:02:42.650> on<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.100> little<00:02:43.310> on

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
down here in the corner on the little on

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.550 
down here in the corner on the little on
a<00:02:43.610> little<00:02:43.880> pillow<00:02:44.709> go<00:02:45.709> ahead<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:45.920> click<00:02:46.070> that

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
a little pillow go ahead and click that

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.220 
a little pillow go ahead and click that
now<00:02:48.560> this<00:02:48.709> game<00:02:48.830> lets<00:02:48.980> you<00:02:49.070> drag<00:02:49.370> around<00:02:50.230> notes

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
now this game lets you drag around notes

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.510 
now this game lets you drag around notes
if<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:51.470> like<00:02:51.739> I've<00:02:51.890> made<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.070> brief

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
if you like I've made a brief

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.650 
if you like I've made a brief
composition<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:53.150> don't<00:02:53.270> think<00:02:53.420> there's<00:02:53.540> much

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
composition I don't think there's much

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.090 
composition I don't think there's much
to<00:02:53.900> it<00:02:54.050> I<00:02:54.170> think<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:54.410> think<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:54.650> just<00:02:54.770> might<00:02:55.040> be

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
to it I think I think it just might be

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:11.440 
to it I think I think it just might be
random<00:02:55.580> notes<00:02:55.820> but<00:02:56.090> let's<00:02:56.750> play<00:02:56.959> it<00:03:10.180> it's<00:03:11.180> kind

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
random notes but let's play it it's kind

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.940 
random notes but let's play it it's kind
of<00:03:11.510> really<00:03:11.690> cool<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:12.140> this<00:03:12.230> thing<00:03:12.440> can<00:03:12.650> keep

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
of really cool that this thing can keep

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.500 
of really cool that this thing can keep
track<00:03:13.160> of<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.459> rhythm<00:03:13.700> as<00:03:13.850> you<00:03:14.030> play<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.390> and

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
track of the rhythm as you play it and

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.479 
track of the rhythm as you play it and
place<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:14.840> notes<00:03:15.019> appropriately<00:03:15.650> I<00:03:15.830> think

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
place the notes appropriately I think

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.509 
place the notes appropriately I think
that's<00:03:16.640> pretty<00:03:17.450> cool<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.130> if<00:03:19.130> you<00:03:19.250> go<00:03:19.370> back

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
that's pretty cool and if you go back

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:20.979 
that's pretty cool and if you go back
you<00:03:19.730> can<00:03:19.850> see<00:03:19.880> it's<00:03:20.090> gonna<00:03:20.180> play<00:03:20.420> it<00:03:20.510> again<00:03:20.720> it

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
you can see it's gonna play it again it

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.509 
you can see it's gonna play it again it
keeps<00:03:21.110> track<00:03:21.320> of<00:03:21.350> everything<00:03:21.829> you<00:03:21.950> played<00:03:22.280> if

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
keeps track of everything you played if

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.610 
keeps track of everything you played if
you<00:03:23.060> were<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.180> composer<00:03:23.630> and<00:03:23.959> you<00:03:24.019> wanted<00:03:24.590> to

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
you were a composer and you wanted to

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.509 
you were a composer and you wanted to
use<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.829> keyboard<00:03:25.130> to<00:03:26.860> jot<00:03:27.860> a<00:03:27.890> quick<00:03:28.160> melody

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
use a keyboard to jot a quick melody

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:29.650 
use a keyboard to jot a quick melody
down<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:28.880> see<00:03:29.000> what<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.209> would<00:03:29.269> sound<00:03:29.480> like

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
down and see what it would sound like

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.960 
down and see what it would sound like
you<00:03:30.470> know<00:03:30.590> we<00:03:31.010> sing<00:03:31.160> along<00:03:31.400> to<00:03:31.579> it<00:03:31.610> or<00:03:31.790> play

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
you know we sing along to it or play

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.009 
you know we sing along to it or play
another<00:03:32.120> instrument<00:03:32.209> to<00:03:32.720> it

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
another instrument to it

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.050 
another instrument to it
on<00:03:33.260> top<00:03:33.590> of<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.860> this<00:03:34.340> would<00:03:34.489> be<00:03:34.579> a<00:03:34.610> really<00:03:34.910> cool

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
on top of it this would be a really cool

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.300 
on top of it this would be a really cool
tool<00:03:35.329> for<00:03:35.630> you<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.750> be<00:03:35.870> able<00:03:35.989> to<00:03:36.140> jot<00:03:37.100> down<00:03:37.130> a

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
melody and have it you know stored on

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.229 
melody and have it you know stored on
your<00:03:39.320> DS<00:03:39.650> now<00:03:40.400> I<00:03:40.430> know<00:03:40.549> that<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.850> piano

or<00:03:53.480> something<00:03:53.600> this<00:03:53.930> would<00:03:54.049> be<00:03:54.140> a<00:03:54.170> kind<00:03:54.470> of<00:03:54.500> a

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
or something this would be a kind of a

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.970 
or something this would be a kind of a
kind<00:03:55.220> of<00:03:55.280> a<00:03:55.340> cool<00:03:55.519> little<00:03:55.670> option<00:03:56.060> I<00:03:56.980> printed

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
kind of a cool little option I printed

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.559 
kind of a cool little option I printed
onto<00:03:58.100> advanced<00:03:58.700> mode<00:03:58.880> here<00:03:59.150> and<00:03:59.269> you<00:03:59.329> can<00:03:59.450> see

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
onto advanced mode here and you can see

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:00.790 
onto advanced mode here and you can see
that<00:03:59.690> now<00:03:59.840> we're<00:04:00.020> actually<00:04:00.170> getting<00:04:00.440> closer

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
that now we're actually getting closer

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.860 
that now we're actually getting closer
to<00:04:01.010> being<00:04:01.220> real<00:04:01.879> sheet<00:04:02.209> music<00:04:02.510> go<00:04:02.599> ahead<00:04:02.629> and

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
to being real sheet music go ahead and

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.869 
to being real sheet music go ahead and
play<00:04:02.959> that<00:04:03.080> again<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:04.280> can<00:04:04.340> see<00:04:04.580> that<00:04:04.760> it

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
play that again you can see that it

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:05.410 
play that again you can see that it
keeps<00:04:05.000> track

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
keeps track

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.820 
keeps track
the<00:04:05.510> notes<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.020> rests<00:04:06.380> and<00:04:06.560> seems<00:04:06.770> to

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
the notes and the rests and seems to

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.130 
the notes and the rests and seems to
have<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:07.010> pretty<00:04:07.160> good<00:04:07.340> idea<00:04:07.580> of<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:08.630> rhythm<00:04:08.959> I

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
have a pretty good idea of the rhythm I

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.559 
have a pretty good idea of the rhythm I
meant<00:04:09.410> when<00:04:09.590> I<00:04:09.700> played<00:04:10.700> my<00:04:10.730> song<00:04:10.970> earlier

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
meant when I played my song earlier

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.930 
meant when I played my song earlier
that's<00:04:12.349> actually<00:04:12.800> really<00:04:13.130> pretty<00:04:13.340> pretty

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
that's actually really pretty pretty

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.309 
that's actually really pretty pretty
decent<00:04:14.390> programming<00:04:14.900> to<00:04:14.959> be<00:04:15.050> able<00:04:15.140> to

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
decent programming to be able to

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.780 
decent programming to be able to
interpret<00:04:15.560> that<00:04:15.830> I<00:04:15.890> don't<00:04:16.130> know<00:04:16.220> how<00:04:16.340> accurate

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
interpret that I don't know how accurate

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:17.920 
interpret that I don't know how accurate
it<00:04:16.880> is<00:04:16.970> because<00:04:17.239> I've<00:04:17.329> never<00:04:17.510> used<00:04:17.690> it<00:04:17.780> for

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
it is because I've never used it for

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.280 
it is because I've never used it for
anything<00:04:18.079> practical<00:04:18.590> but<00:04:19.870> of<00:04:20.870> course<00:04:21.079> you<00:04:21.169> can

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
anything practical but of course you can

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.280 
anything practical but of course you can
use<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.910> on-screen<00:04:22.910> keyboard<00:04:23.480> too<00:04:23.900> if<00:04:24.080> so<00:04:24.200> if

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
use the on-screen keyboard too if so if

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.560 
use the on-screen keyboard too if so if
you're<00:04:24.410> a<00:04:24.440> DSi<00:04:24.830> owner<00:04:25.270> you're<00:04:26.270> not<00:04:26.389> out<00:04:26.540> of

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
you're a DSi owner you're not out of

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.970 
you're a DSi owner you're not out of
luck<00:04:26.870> if<00:04:27.110> you<00:04:27.290> can't<00:04:27.470> use<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.740> keyboard

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
luck if you can't use the keyboard

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.040 
luck if you can't use the keyboard
peripheral<00:04:28.430> but<00:04:29.389> as<00:04:29.480> far<00:04:29.630> as<00:04:29.660> I'm<00:04:29.750> concerned

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
peripheral but as far as I'm concerned

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.120 
peripheral but as far as I'm concerned
the<00:04:30.110> keyboard<00:04:30.380> peripheral<00:04:30.740> is<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:30.889> coolest

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
the keyboard peripheral is the coolest

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.790 
the keyboard peripheral is the coolest
thing<00:04:31.220> about<00:04:31.310> this<00:04:31.580> game<00:04:32.230> now<00:04:33.230> probably<00:04:33.470> the

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
thing about this game now probably the

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.040 
thing about this game now probably the
least<00:04:34.160> compelling<00:04:34.970> thing<00:04:35.120> about<00:04:35.300> easy<00:04:35.570> piano

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
least compelling thing about easy piano

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.409 
least compelling thing about easy piano
is<00:04:36.200> their<00:04:36.410> music

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
is their music

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.730 
is their music

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.810 
to play the piano let's take a look at
some<00:04:43.700> of<00:04:43.729> the<00:04:43.820> lessons<00:04:44.000> they<00:04:44.240> offer<00:04:45.729> so<00:04:46.729> these

some of the lessons they offer so these

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.250 
some of the lessons they offer so these
are<00:04:46.940> all<00:04:47.030> the<00:04:47.120> lessons<00:04:47.419> they<00:04:47.510> have<00:04:47.540> the<00:04:47.900> staven

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
are all the lessons they have the staven

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.260 
are all the lessons they have the staven
bar<00:04:48.440> clef<00:04:48.919> notes<00:04:49.840> chords<00:04:51.639> some<00:04:52.639> of<00:04:52.760> these<00:04:52.850> are

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
bar clef notes chords some of these are

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.390 
bar clef notes chords some of these are
interesting<00:04:54.050> and<00:04:54.350> useful<00:04:54.620> some<00:04:55.010> of<00:04:55.100> them<00:04:55.220> are

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
interesting and useful some of them are

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.250 
interesting and useful some of them are
really<00:04:55.610> not<00:04:55.820> let's<00:04:56.479> take<00:04:56.510> a<00:04:56.630> look<00:04:56.870> at<00:04:57.080> what

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
really not let's take a look at what

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.390 
really not let's take a look at what
they<00:04:57.440> want<00:04:57.620> us<00:04:57.710> to<00:04:57.800> do<00:04:57.889> with<00:04:58.040> the<00:04:58.130> stave<00:04:58.370> and

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
they want us to do with the stave and

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.409 
they want us to do with the stave and
bars<00:04:59.470> so<00:05:00.470> I<00:05:00.530> begin<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.860> lesson<00:05:01.010> and<00:05:01.520> really

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
bars so I begin the lesson and really

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.840 
bars so I begin the lesson and really
the<00:05:02.510> lesson<00:05:02.840> just<00:05:02.960> consists<00:05:03.470> of<00:05:03.620> a<00:05:03.919> couple<00:05:04.700> of

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
the lesson just consists of a couple of

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.730 
the lesson just consists of a couple of
screens<00:05:05.389> that<00:05:05.570> tell<00:05:05.840> you<00:05:06.020> what<00:05:06.320> things<00:05:06.560> are

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
screens that tell you what things are

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.200 
screens that tell you what things are
what<00:05:07.190> things<00:05:07.400> are<00:05:07.550> which<00:05:07.729> and<00:05:07.850> they<00:05:07.970> ask<00:05:08.090> you

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
what things are which and they ask you

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.390 
what things are which and they ask you
to<00:05:08.330> you<00:05:08.419> know<00:05:08.510> play<00:05:08.750> along<00:05:09.050> so<00:05:09.340> you<00:05:10.340> know

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
to you know play along so you know

to you know play along so you know
here's<00:05:10.580> my<00:05:10.640> bar<00:05:10.880> lines<00:05:11.800> here's<00:05:12.800> my<00:05:12.950> lines

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
here's my bar lines here's my lines

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.450 
here's my bar lines here's my lines
that's<00:05:15.050> my<00:05:15.200> spaces<00:05:15.770> you<00:05:15.919> can't<00:05:16.070> really<00:05:16.250> see<00:05:16.400> it

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
that's my spaces you can't really see it

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.420 
that's my spaces you can't really see it
on<00:05:16.520> the<00:05:16.640> screen<00:05:16.910> and<00:05:17.210> then<00:05:17.750> in<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:18.020> bar<00:05:18.430> so

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
on the screen and then in the bar so

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.150 
on the screen and then in the bar so
it's<00:05:19.580> somewhat<00:05:19.910> interactive<00:05:20.860> but<00:05:21.860> now<00:05:21.919> I<00:05:21.950> come

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
it's somewhat interactive but now I come

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.130 
it's somewhat interactive but now I come
to<00:05:22.190> the<00:05:22.310> the<00:05:22.850> mini-game<00:05:23.390> to<00:05:23.690> complete<00:05:24.020> the

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
to the the mini-game to complete the

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.190 
to the the mini-game to complete the
lesson<00:05:24.530> and<00:05:24.770> really<00:05:25.039> this<00:05:25.190> is<00:05:25.370> has<00:05:25.940> so<00:05:26.900> little

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
lesson and really this is has so little

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.690 
lesson and really this is has so little
to<00:05:27.440> do<00:05:27.560> with<00:05:27.590> anything

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
to do with anything

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.460 
to do with anything
notes<00:05:29.180> will<00:05:29.419> cross<00:05:29.600> the<00:05:29.780> screen<00:05:30.080> and<00:05:30.289> it's<00:05:30.380> up

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
notes will cross the screen and it's up

what<00:05:56.860> they<00:05:57.010> are<00:05:57.040> and<00:05:57.460> you<00:05:58.150> can<00:05:58.180> catch<00:05:58.420> any<00:05:58.570> of

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
what they are and you can catch any of

them<00:05:58.810> to<00:05:58.930> play<00:05:59.050> them<00:05:59.260> that's<00:05:59.410> kind<00:05:59.470> of<00:05:59.620> neat

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
them to play them that's kind of neat

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.380 
them to play them that's kind of neat
but<00:06:00.520> it<00:06:00.610> doesn't<00:06:00.790> really<00:06:00.910> tell<00:06:01.000> you<00:06:01.360> much

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390

but it doesn't really tell you much
about<00:06:01.570> them<00:06:02.020> or<00:06:02.200> how<00:06:02.290> they're<00:06:02.440> constructed<00:06:02.620> or

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
about them or how they're constructed or

why they are the notes that they are or

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.780 
why they are the notes that they are or
even<00:06:05.440> what<00:06:05.560> the<00:06:05.620> purposes

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
even what the purposes

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.120 
even what the purposes
it<00:06:07.030> just<00:06:07.240> says<00:06:07.420> these<00:06:08.290> are<00:06:08.350> chords<00:06:08.770> and<00:06:08.920> now<00:06:09.010> it

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
it just says these are chords and now it

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.120 
it just says these are chords and now it
wants<00:06:09.310> you<00:06:09.370> to<00:06:09.430> actually<00:06:09.640> write<00:06:09.910> chords

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
that's kind of tricky to do even with

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.060 
that's kind of tricky to do even with
make<00:06:13.570> music<00:06:13.870> theory<00:06:14.050> lessons<00:06:14.470> like<00:06:14.680> you<00:06:14.920> don't
