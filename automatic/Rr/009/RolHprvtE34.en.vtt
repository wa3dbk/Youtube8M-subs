 garlic and chili pepper 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.640

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:26.710

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:30.880

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.470
 I 'll put the pot on a strong fire all 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.030
 fry these vegetables in olive oil 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:44.290
 pre- time water caliphs 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:49.630

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.750
 canned sweet corn 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.610
 and after i added corn i 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.680
 so that I have it properly plowed 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.560
 add 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.240
 I will give a small amount of ordinary water 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.710
 a little boil too 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.619
 and at the place all tastes will soften 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.420
 literally two or three minutes 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.540
 I will simmer on maximum fire 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.159
