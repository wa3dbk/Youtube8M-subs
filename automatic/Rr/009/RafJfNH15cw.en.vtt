the<00:00:38.059> learning<00:00:38.420> is<00:00:38.540> a<00:00:38.630> lesson<00:00:39.020> a<00:00:39.110> little<00:00:39.260> bit

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
the learning is a lesson a little bit

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.590 
the learning is a lesson a little bit
more<00:00:39.739> in<00:00:39.980> their<00:00:40.190> control<00:00:40.640> they<00:00:41.210> can<00:00:41.270> choose

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
more in their control they can choose

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.180 
more in their control they can choose
when<00:00:41.840> they<00:00:41.870> wanted<00:00:42.290> to<00:00:42.440> do<00:00:42.589> it<00:00:42.739> but<00:00:42.920> they<00:00:43.010> could

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
when they wanted to do it but they could

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.099 
when they wanted to do it but they could
pause<00:00:43.489> it<00:00:43.730> if<00:00:43.879> they<00:00:44.179> wanted<00:00:44.510> to<00:00:44.629> take<00:00:44.780> breaks

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:45.109 
pause it if they wanted to take breaks

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.169 
pause it if they wanted to take breaks
they<00:00:45.379> could<00:00:45.559> stop<00:00:45.829> and<00:00:45.980> go<00:00:46.100> back<00:00:46.309> and<00:00:46.609> watch

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179 
they could stop and go back and watch

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.900 
they could stop and go back and watch
pieces<00:00:47.600> again<00:00:47.899> they<00:00:48.620> could<00:00:48.859> just<00:00:49.399> pause<00:00:49.579> it<00:00:49.789> to

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
pieces again they could just pause it to

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.270 
pieces again they could just pause it to
think<00:00:50.179> and<00:00:50.390> then<00:00:50.690> continue<00:00:51.230> one<00:00:52.039> of<00:00:52.160> the

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
think and then continue one of the

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.979 
think and then continue one of the
motivations<00:00:52.730> for<00:00:53.179> taking<00:00:53.539> on<00:00:53.660> the<00:00:53.780> project

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
motivations for taking on the project

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.979 
motivations for taking on the project
was<00:00:54.499> so<00:00:54.739> that<00:00:54.890> I<00:00:55.039> could<00:00:55.070> spend<00:00:55.519> more<00:00:55.730> time

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
was so that I could spend more time

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.090 
was so that I could spend more time
interacting<00:00:56.989> with<00:00:57.019> the<00:00:57.289> students<00:00:57.710> directly

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
particular questions that they have I

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.590 
particular questions that they have I
think<00:01:10.220> it's<00:01:10.550> really<00:01:10.729> creative<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.420> different

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
think it's really creative and different

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.080 
think it's really creative and different
but<00:01:11.990> it's<00:01:12.200> really<00:01:12.440> helpful<00:01:13.010> for<00:01:13.040> me<00:01:13.340> because<00:01:13.880> I

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
but it's really helpful for me because I

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.810 
but it's really helpful for me because I
can<00:01:14.330> learn<00:01:14.510> the<00:01:14.570> lessons<00:01:15.110> at<00:01:15.260> home<00:01:15.290> and<00:01:15.920> I<00:01:16.430> come

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
can learn the lessons at home and I come

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.360 
can learn the lessons at home and I come
to<00:01:16.850> classes<00:01:17.240> actually<00:01:17.600> more<00:01:17.960> questions<00:01:18.470> so<00:01:19.310> I

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
to classes actually more questions so I

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.040 
to classes actually more questions so I
learned<00:01:19.880> more<00:01:20.090> in<00:01:20.150> class<00:01:20.480> because<00:01:20.870> I'm

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
learned more in class because I'm

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.410 
learned more in class because I'm
stressing<00:01:21.740> working<00:01:22.040> with<00:01:22.190> the<00:01:22.280> teacher<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:22.940> I

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
stressing working with the teacher and I

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.060 
stressing working with the teacher and I
think<00:01:23.630> learning<00:01:24.080> lesson<00:01:24.470> isn't<00:01:24.800> really<00:01:24.980> the

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
think learning lesson isn't really the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.430 
think learning lesson isn't really the
hard<00:01:25.280> part<00:01:25.340> it's<00:01:25.700> applying<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:26.330> concepts<00:01:26.810> so

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
hard part it's applying the concepts so

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.620 
hard part it's applying the concepts so
when<00:01:27.710> I<00:01:27.740> get<00:01:27.890> stuff<00:01:28.280> in<00:01:28.400> a<00:01:28.490> problem<00:01:28.760> like<00:01:29.000> when

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
when I get stuff in a problem like when

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.000 
when I get stuff in a problem like when
I<00:01:29.660> would<00:01:29.840> do<00:01:29.960> to<00:01:30.110> be<00:01:30.140> at<00:01:30.320> home<00:01:30.500> working<00:01:30.680> on<00:01:30.890> it

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
I would do to be at home working on it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.770 
I would do to be at home working on it
by<00:01:31.100> myself<00:01:31.250> I<00:01:31.640> can<00:01:31.790> just<00:01:32.000> have<00:01:32.150> him<00:01:32.330> right<00:01:32.510> next

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
problem I like the system because when

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.610 
problem I like the system because when
you<00:01:38.060> do<00:01:38.210> your<00:01:38.330> homework<00:01:38.540> in<00:01:38.750> class<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.440> have

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.240 
just goes smoothly when I started doing
this<00:01:47.270> I<00:01:47.570> was<00:01:47.900> pretty<00:01:48.200> happy<00:01:48.470> with<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.860> videos

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
this I was pretty happy with the videos

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.400 
this I was pretty happy with the videos
I<00:01:49.490> was<00:01:49.670> making<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.390> feedback<00:01:50.870> immediately

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
I was making the feedback immediately

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.230 
I was making the feedback immediately
that<00:01:52.100> I<00:01:52.130> got<00:01:52.340> from<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:52.670> students<00:01:53.000> was<00:01:53.210> that

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
that I got from the students was that

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.120 
that I got from the students was that
they<00:01:53.480> could<00:01:53.660> learn<00:01:53.810> from<00:01:53.870> them<00:01:54.350> even<00:01:54.860> if<00:01:55.010> the

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
they could learn from them even if the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.350 
they could learn from them even if the
students<00:01:55.490> weren't<00:01:55.670> thrilled<00:01:55.880> about<00:01:56.090> the

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
students weren't thrilled about the

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.060 
students weren't thrilled about the
format<00:01:56.750> they<00:01:56.930> said<00:01:57.170> yes<00:01:57.410> we<00:01:57.590> can<00:01:57.620> learn<00:01:57.920> from

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
format they said yes we can learn from

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.100 
format they said yes we can learn from
the<00:01:58.220> videos<00:01:58.580> I<00:01:58.910> actually<00:01:59.360> really<00:01:59.870> like<00:02:00.080> it

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
the videos I actually really like it

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.860 
the videos I actually really like it
because<00:02:00.860> instead<00:02:01.760> of<00:02:01.910> trying<00:02:02.300> to<00:02:02.360> rush<00:02:02.600> the

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
because instead of trying to rush the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.820 
because instead of trying to rush the
lessons<00:02:03.260> in<00:02:03.440> class<00:02:03.680> like<00:02:04.220> how<00:02:04.670> it<00:02:04.850> is<00:02:04.970> in<00:02:05.210> some

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
lessons in class like how it is in some

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.770 
lessons in class like how it is in some
we<00:02:06.490> can<00:02:06.640> take<00:02:06.790> our<00:02:06.910> time<00:02:06.940> and<00:02:07.150> watch<00:02:07.570> the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
we can take our time and watch the

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.290 
we can take our time and watch the
videos<00:02:08.080> and<00:02:08.560> if<00:02:09.280> we<00:02:09.400> need<00:02:09.520> to<00:02:09.610> go<00:02:09.700> back<00:02:09.910> we<00:02:10.090> can

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
videos and if we need to go back we can

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.630 
videos and if we need to go back we can
instead<00:02:10.840> of<00:02:10.930> like<00:02:11.110> asking<00:02:11.470> over<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:12.370> over

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
instead of like asking over and over

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.220 
instead of like asking over and over
like<00:02:13.030> I<00:02:13.300> don't<00:02:13.630> get<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:13.900> or<00:02:13.990> something<00:02:14.200> like

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
like I don't get it or something like

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.960 
like I don't get it or something like
that<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.740> then<00:02:15.160> when<00:02:15.280> we<00:02:15.370> come<00:02:15.490> into<00:02:15.640> cost

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
that and then when we come into cost

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.970 
that and then when we come into cost
it's<00:02:16.240> easy<00:02:16.420> because<00:02:16.900> we<00:02:17.200> do<00:02:17.350> homework<00:02:17.710> animals

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
it's easy because we do homework animals

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.340 
it's easy because we do homework animals
we<00:02:18.070> need<00:02:18.190> help<00:02:18.400> we<00:02:18.490> can<00:02:18.640> ask<00:02:18.670> for<00:02:18.850> service<00:02:19.350> so

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
we need help we can ask for service so

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.110 
we need help we can ask for service so
if<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.680> were<00:02:20.800> teaching<00:02:21.160> this<00:02:21.280> class<00:02:21.430> again<00:02:21.730> next

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
if I were teaching this class again next

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.720 
if I were teaching this class again next
year<00:02:22.480> I<00:02:22.630> would<00:02:22.990> continue<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.740> explore<00:02:24.250> how<00:02:24.700> to

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
year I would continue to explore how to

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.050 
year I would continue to explore how to
best<00:02:25.420> use<00:02:25.870> classroom<00:02:26.320> time<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:27.250> think<00:02:27.910> that

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
best use classroom time I think that

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.880 
best use classroom time I think that
there's<00:02:28.240> probably<00:02:28.660> more<00:02:28.990> you<00:02:29.230> can<00:02:29.410> do<00:02:29.560> in<00:02:29.830> a

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
there's probably more you can do in a

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.140 
there's probably more you can do in a
classroom<00:02:30.160> there<00:02:30.610> could<00:02:30.760> be<00:02:30.790> more

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
classroom there could be more

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.420 
classroom there could be more
interactive<00:02:31.830> discussion<00:02:32.830> of<00:02:32.980> things<00:02:33.190> there

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
interactive discussion of things there

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.300 
interactive discussion of things there
could<00:02:33.610> be<00:02:33.640> more<00:02:33.940> activities<00:02:34.510> part<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.740> good

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
could be more activities part of good

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.180 
could be more activities part of good
teaching<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:37.320> continuing<00:02:38.320> to<00:02:38.350> explore<00:02:38.890> and

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
teaching is continuing to explore and

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.940 
teaching is continuing to explore and
try<00:02:39.940> new<00:02:40.180> things<00:02:40.210> I<00:02:40.750> think<00:02:40.990> that<00:02:41.350> it's<00:02:41.500> made<00:02:41.770> me

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
try new things I think that it's made me

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.850 
try new things I think that it's made me
a<00:02:41.980> more<00:02:42.360> engaged<00:02:43.360> teacher<00:02:43.750> this<00:02:44.080> year<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.710> be

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
a more engaged teacher this year to be

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.700 
a more engaged teacher this year to be
trying<00:02:45.190> something<00:02:45.520> different
