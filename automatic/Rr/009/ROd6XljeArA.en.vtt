00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
they can be but also expand the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.729 
they can be but also expand the
possibilities<00:00:38.790> because<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:39.960> never<00:00:40.110> know<00:00:40.260> how

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
possibilities because we never know how
