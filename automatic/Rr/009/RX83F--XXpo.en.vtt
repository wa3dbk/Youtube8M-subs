00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:09.880
 hello everyone guys are mister s beef 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.299
 and today I am here to offer you a 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.580
 very interesting commentaries to parer 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.570
 mine that in which I will speak to you a moment 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.210
 of the mod 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.340
 and in this brand new game and I can 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.850
 also to say beautiful game or 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.439
 module offers is however first I want a 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.840
 moment to introduce myself as an engine 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.330
 obviously you won't know me then 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.000
 I'm a mister s eat but you can 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.140
 great to call me beef and I am 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.969
 17 years old boy from Florence 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.480
 in fact, most likely you enter it 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:46.960
 from the accent a little of the cia aspirata 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.850
 let's say though I think it's a choice 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.239
 that pretty funny indeed everyone 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.640
 in the video they envy him sad accent 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.980
 Tuscan Florentine are born, however, oh well 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.250
 come on but see the general characters 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.870
 who am I or 17 years old say 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.659
 simone why I wanted to know but 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.689
 this does not matter because today we are 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.450
 to talk about love because it's one thing 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.729
 is a topic that runs on many mouths 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.850
 because especially when I'm online 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.790
 with the enemies many ask me what 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.890
 both as if learning that 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.810
 effects does that effect we say that 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.119
 these things here that I'm going to 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.880
 explain to you in this video 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.220
 then first of all the moab can also 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.479
 being called a nuclear charge was 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.700
 let's say this name was stolen 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.229
 that is , I took the nuclear charge for 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.570
 do to tell you practically in a few 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.360
 words what it is because practically 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.120
 equal to a nuclear charge and there were 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.790
 of the two pits though if 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.990
 that is, there are some differences both for 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.460
 how to take it or sum of 0 2 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.860
 to take a nuclear charge indeed 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.100
 the most used waste paper was to use 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.230
 air support ac 130 and then 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.530
 resume the nuclear charge at 25 years 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:09.290
 row while here on form for three 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.820
 the thing one thing is it really makes it 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:15.050
 very difficult to take one 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:17.600
 reward is that these too 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.940
 killings for the series precisely for 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.800
 get to 25 kills must be 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.040
 all made with his own weapon or that 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.560
 I know with the knife with the stunners with 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.900
 grenades or brought wines from the launch 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.500
 in short, that they are weapons that are not there 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.200
 that they are killings that do not derive from 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.209
 kill that I know the rewards 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.280
 of sony one could have do one 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.650
 example a mister hef editor I know 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.570
 the helicopter 20 the helicopter years 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.850
 he kills two though in the series of 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.890
 killings to get to the mob not 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.470
 counts for nothing when these two killers 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.019
 in fact, this is not the first 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.600
 difference there is from the point between the 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:00.019
 nuclear charge fashion 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.640
 other difference I found 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.459
 just seeing this video that to me 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.269
 my friend passed that I thank 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.310
 much another difference is that when 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.980
 gets up dakar the nuclear sure the mob 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.540
 sorry when you pull moab while the 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.480
 game does not end 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.330
 the effect of fashion and kent celli 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.860
 the visual effect of the networks in the 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.370
 screen is identical that the charge 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.269
 nuclear 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.100
 the only difference that just does not 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.900
 the game ends ie you don't win the 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.670
 fourth, call it the nuclear charge but 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.590
 the game continues there is always the 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.030
 9 second countdown now me 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.970
 they seem to remember well and anyway 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.670
 so it does not finish the game and continue 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.799
 to play and of course the team that 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.420
 now wins the min dominia you sing 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.850
 teani more flags but it depends on 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.610
 point from the pro mode you are 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.049
 playing and what are some characters 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.280
 general what is love 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.410
 another thing always of a general nature 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.680
 that I wanted to say mobs from what I have 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:07.310
 understood should derive from m stands for 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:11.090
 mother osta for of let's say to stands for all 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.070
 and b.com facts would be mother or bomb but 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.250
 this is something that I thought and I have 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.230
 heard so don't mind us and 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.169
 you do n't even go mine 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.060
 pronunciation because it surely sucks 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.680
 however ok, however now I will speak to you a 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.440
 attimino advice you could soon 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.990
 give to take precisely this mob 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.000
 then this in this game of 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.370
 this guy is using 95 and a 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.080
 assault rifle all nose name is one 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.020
 of the Armenians we say it can be 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.510
 hard enough to take it because 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.040
 definitely need a weapon that is that 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.630
 have enough shots from the charger and 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.310
 that has enough shots in general 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.530
 how beautiful it could be 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.440
 assault rifle not scar.l I know one 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.060
 ak47 a maple stuff like that and that 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.570
 however it is quite easy to use 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.580
 and quite responsive and fast though 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.930
 another very important thing according to 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.730
 me is also this series of killings 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.290
 facts if you pay attention to take the 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.150
 mobile series of kills they do 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.919
 kill who kill they say how 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.350
 it would be the helicopter you don't need 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.300
 so the most important thing is me a 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.460
 use excused exit series 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.110
 the series of killings 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.370
 specialist or those driving bonuses 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.590
 in fact he was using 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:23.060
 it seems to me a killer magic trick 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:25.550
 to other kill shield armor and hattrick 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.240
 what I don't remember now but this 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.009
 it doesn't matter anyway 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.860
 naturally the bonds on a choice of the 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:33.930
 player who, in short, chooses bonuses 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.030
 which therefore definitely prefers this 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.800
 it's another thing I can recommend 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.599
 another thing another thing is a lot 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.979
 important to say is that to take 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.599
 a mob in this game by you but not 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:46.770
 all done without reward in a few 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:48.330
 words le kill should not risk 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.860
 always go around in the middle of the 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.300
 melee to get killed 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.340
 in fact this boy has always been 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.780
 around this ski flag in between 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.000
 motor home quotes have even if not 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.160
 he never stood still as he turned and 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.190
 he controlled this area and I think it is 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.159
 the best thing to do for let's say 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.080
 take this then how are you 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:10.710
 seeing now is about to launch it 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.210
 in fact I think I hope this 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.840
 comment you enjoyed and that there is 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:18.860

 see for yourself to register because I will do it

 many others comment there not only of 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.400
 this but in general form 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:30.960
 fairtrade of call of duty 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.490
