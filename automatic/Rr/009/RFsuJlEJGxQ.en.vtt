00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
don't really have a whole lot of time to

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.470 
don't really have a whole lot of time to
go<00:03:16.709> into<00:03:16.860> depth<00:03:17.069> on<00:03:17.220> because<00:03:17.519> they<00:03:17.640> are<00:03:17.819> you

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
go into depth on because they are you

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.819 
go into depth on because they are you
know<00:03:18.540> they<00:03:18.780> can<00:03:19.019> get<00:03:19.230> kind<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.500> complex

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
know they can get kind of complex

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.770 
know they can get kind of complex
basically<00:03:20.459> it's<00:03:20.639> your<00:03:20.790> turn<00:03:20.940> then<00:03:21.299> their<00:03:21.540> turn

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780

basically it's your turn then their turn
your<00:03:22.170> turn<00:03:22.319> than<00:03:22.560> their<00:03:22.739> turn<00:03:23.239> something<00:03:24.239> like

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
your turn than their turn something like

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.520 
your turn than their turn something like
that<00:03:25.310> so<00:03:26.310> here<00:03:26.910> we<00:03:27.030> can<00:03:27.060> also<00:03:27.329> guard<00:03:27.959> princess

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
that so here we can also guard princess
