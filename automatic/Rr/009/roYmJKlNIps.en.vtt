I'm<00:00:05.529> just<00:00:05.740> going<00:00:05.920> to<00:00:05.980> do<00:00:06.130> a<00:00:06.160> really<00:00:06.609> quick

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:06.759 
I'm just going to do a really quick

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:08.789 
I'm just going to do a really quick
demonstration<00:00:07.359> on<00:00:07.930> how<00:00:07.990> to<00:00:08.139> draw<00:00:08.410> a<00:00:08.440> mitered

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:08.799 
demonstration on how to draw a mitered

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:11.670 
demonstration on how to draw a mitered
corners<00:00:09.219> I've<00:00:10.030> drawn<00:00:10.420> a<00:00:10.690> corner<00:00:11.260> here<00:00:11.559> and

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:11.680 
corners I've drawn a corner here and

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.080 
corners I've drawn a corner here and
this<00:00:12.190> is<00:00:12.460> going<00:00:12.639> to<00:00:12.849> be<00:00:12.969> my<00:00:13.299> actual<00:00:13.870> patterns

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
this is going to be my actual patterns

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.560 
this is going to be my actual patterns
and<00:00:16.410> decide<00:00:17.410> how<00:00:17.680> wide<00:00:17.950> you<00:00:18.189> want<00:00:18.220> your

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
and decide how wide you want your

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.269 
and decide how wide you want your
facings<00:00:19.570> to<00:00:19.750> be<00:00:19.840> folded<00:00:20.259> so<00:00:20.619> I'm<00:00:20.860> going<00:00:21.070> to<00:00:21.160> do

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
facings to be folded so I'm going to do

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.999 
facings to be folded so I'm going to do
4<00:00:21.550> centimetres<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.800> 4<00:00:24.070> centimetres<00:00:26.009> draw

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
4 centimetres and 4 centimetres draw

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.190 
4 centimetres and 4 centimetres draw
these<00:00:27.189> parallel<00:00:27.700> outside<00:00:28.300> of<00:00:28.599> your<00:00:28.840> pattern

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
these parallel outside of your pattern

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.090 
these parallel outside of your pattern
and<00:00:29.969> then<00:00:30.969> I'm<00:00:31.180> going<00:00:31.390> to<00:00:31.540> measure<00:00:31.750> about<00:00:32.649> 5

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
and then I'm going to measure about 5

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.130 
and then I'm going to measure about 5
centimeters<00:00:33.790> up<00:00:33.969> from<00:00:34.180> this<00:00:34.329> point<00:00:34.570> and<00:00:34.780> 5

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
centimeters up from this point and 5

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.000 
centimeters up from this point and 5
centimeters<00:00:35.530> across<00:00:36.129> from<00:00:36.550> this<00:00:36.730> point<00:00:38.010> I've

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
centimeters across from this point I've

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.950 
centimeters across from this point I've
already<00:00:39.370> marked<00:00:39.579> slightly<00:00:40.359> here<00:00:40.629> and<00:00:40.839> then

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
already marked slightly here and then

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.819 
already marked slightly here and then
when<00:00:41.079> you<00:00:41.199> marked<00:00:41.940> these<00:00:42.940> two<00:00:43.269> points<00:00:44.170> join

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
when you marked these two points join

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.180 
when you marked these two points join
the<00:00:44.980> line<00:00:45.160> just<00:00:45.969> very<00:00:46.149> lightly<00:00:46.420> and<00:00:47.320> measure

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
the line just very lightly and measure

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.860 
the line just very lightly and measure
it<00:00:48.809> my<00:00:49.809> measure<00:00:50.079> sent<00:00:50.409> seven<00:00:50.769> centimeters<00:00:51.339> and

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
it my measure sent seven centimeters and

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.419 
it my measure sent seven centimeters and
I<00:00:52.870> need<00:00:53.019> to<00:00:53.109> draw<00:00:53.320> a<00:00:53.350> dot<00:00:53.649> in<00:00:53.769> the<00:00:53.859> middle<00:00:54.159> so

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
I need to draw a dot in the middle so

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.069 
I need to draw a dot in the middle so
three<00:00:54.850> and<00:00:54.969> a<00:00:54.999> half<00:00:55.179> and<00:00:55.420> three<00:00:55.780> and<00:00:55.870> a<00:00:55.899> half

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
three and a half and three and a half

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.270 
three and a half and three and a half
and<00:00:56.260> either<00:00:56.440> side<00:00:56.710> this<00:00:57.579> is<00:00:57.699> my<00:00:57.850> center<00:00:58.179> point

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
and either side this is my center point

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.829 
and either side this is my center point
now<00:01:00.280> join<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.670> center<00:01:00.969> point<00:01:01.210> to<00:01:01.329> your<00:01:01.420> corner

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
now join the center point to your corner

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.560 
now join the center point to your corner
off<00:01:02.019> your<00:01:02.260> garment<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:05.110> you<00:01:05.590> get<00:01:05.710> this<00:01:05.860> shape

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
off your garment and you get this shape

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.790 
off your garment and you get this shape
now<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:07.630> mitered<00:01:08.020> corners<00:01:08.380> are<00:01:08.500> going<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.710> be

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
now the mitered corners are going to be

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.920 
now the mitered corners are going to be
these<00:01:08.920> two<00:01:09.130> pieces<00:01:09.310> of<00:01:09.490> facing<00:01:09.910> folded<00:01:10.300> in<00:01:10.420> and

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
these two pieces of facing folded in and

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.660 
these two pieces of facing folded in and
it's<00:01:11.140> going<00:01:11.320> to<00:01:11.410> finish<00:01:11.650> on<00:01:11.890> this<00:01:12.160> line<00:01:12.370> so

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
it's going to finish on this line so

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.670 
it's going to finish on this line so
what's<00:01:13.570> important<00:01:13.990> is<00:01:14.110> that<00:01:14.140> you<00:01:14.350> mirrored

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
what's important is that you mirrored

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.400 
what's important is that you mirrored
this<00:01:14.830> shape<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:16.180> there<00:01:16.330> with<00:01:16.870> this<00:01:17.020> mark<00:01:19.410> so

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
this shape to there with this mark so

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.230 
this shape to there with this mark so
I'm<00:01:20.470> going<00:01:20.740> to<00:01:20.800> measure<00:01:21.040> from<00:01:21.790> this<00:01:22.000> mirror

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
I'm going to measure from this mirror

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.320 
I'm going to measure from this mirror
line<00:01:22.480> across<00:01:23.230> to<00:01:23.530> this<00:01:23.740> diagonal<00:01:24.130> line

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
line across to this diagonal line

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.210 
line across to this diagonal line
anywhere<00:01:25.330> along<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:25.870> line<00:01:26.050> is<00:01:26.200> fine<00:01:26.440> so<00:01:26.920> any

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
anywhere along the line is fine so any

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.780 
anywhere along the line is fine so any
where<00:01:28.200> here<00:01:29.200> so<00:01:29.590> I'm<00:01:29.740> going<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.100> mark<00:01:30.340> two

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
where here so I'm going to mark two

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.240 
where here so I'm going to mark two
centimetres<00:01:31.510> from<00:01:31.780> this<00:01:32.020> line<00:01:32.230> across<00:01:32.620> to<00:01:32.860> my

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
centimetres from this line across to my

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.670 
centimetres from this line across to my
diagonal<00:01:33.850> line<00:01:34.000> and<00:01:34.240> I'm<00:01:35.140> going<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.410> make<00:01:35.590> the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
diagonal line and I'm going to make the

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.770 
diagonal line and I'm going to make the
same<00:01:35.860> mark<00:01:36.100> two<00:01:36.400> centimetres<00:01:37.000> on<00:01:37.150> this<00:01:37.540> side

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
same mark two centimetres on this side

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.010 
same mark two centimetres on this side
of<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.800> mirror<00:01:38.950> line<00:01:40.290> now<00:01:41.290> join<00:01:41.620> this<00:01:41.920> mark<00:01:43.020> to

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
of the mirror line now join this mark to

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.250 
of the mirror line now join this mark to
the<00:01:44.140> corner<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.520> do<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.180> same<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.110> bottom

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
the corner and do the same to the bottom

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.640 
the corner and do the same to the bottom
half<00:01:50.590> of<00:01:50.830> your<00:01:50.920> facing<00:01:51.490> so<00:01:52.270> again<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:53.320> edge<00:01:53.500> of

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
half of your facing so again the edge of

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.680 
half of your facing so again the edge of
your<00:01:53.800> pattern<00:01:54.100> will<00:01:54.250> be<00:01:54.370> your<00:01:54.490> mirror<00:01:54.640> line<00:01:54.880> so

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
your pattern will be your mirror line so

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.170 
your pattern will be your mirror line so
I<00:01:55.720> need<00:01:56.020> to<00:01:56.140> mirror<00:01:56.320> this<00:01:56.860> diagonal<00:01:57.430> line<00:01:57.460> onto

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
I need to mirror this diagonal line onto

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.790 
I need to mirror this diagonal line onto
this<00:01:58.300> part<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.960> don't<00:02:02.170> have<00:02:02.290> to<00:02:02.410> do<00:02:02.500> two

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
this part you don't have to do two

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.550 
this part you don't have to do two
centimetres<00:02:03.400> like<00:02:03.550> I<00:02:03.700> did<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:04.060> can<00:02:04.240> do<00:02:04.560> three

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
centimetres like I did you can do three

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.720 
centimetres like I did you can do three
anywhere<00:02:06.130> is<00:02:06.310> fine

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
anywhere is fine

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.119 
anywhere is fine
so<00:02:07.150> I've<00:02:07.420> measuring<00:02:08.019> I'm<00:02:08.200> measuring<00:02:08.440> three

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
so I've measuring I'm measuring three

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.729 
so I've measuring I'm measuring three
centimeters<00:02:09.789> from<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.750> mirror<00:02:11.019> line<00:02:11.200> up<00:02:11.470> to

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
centimeters from the mirror line up to

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.830 
centimeters from the mirror line up to
my<00:02:11.860> diagonal<00:02:12.310> line<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:13.329> now<00:02:13.480> I'm<00:02:13.540> going<00:02:13.780> to

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
my diagonal line and now I'm going to

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.670 
my diagonal line and now I'm going to
measure<00:02:14.079> three<00:02:14.379> centimeters<00:02:15.099> from<00:02:15.579> my<00:02:16.439> the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
measure three centimeters from my the

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.490 
measure three centimeters from my the
down<00:02:18.129> to<00:02:18.370> my<00:02:18.400> facing<00:02:19.060> line<00:02:19.209> so<00:02:19.870> that's<00:02:20.079> there

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
down to my facing line so that's there

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.420 
down to my facing line so that's there
and<00:02:21.310> now<00:02:22.030> I'm<00:02:22.180> going<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.569> mark<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.950> corner<00:02:24.340> of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
and now I'm going to mark the corner of

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.619 
and now I'm going to mark the corner of
my<00:02:24.579> pattern<00:02:25.030> right<00:02:25.989> across<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:26.500> dot<00:02:27.629> and

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
my pattern right across that dot and

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:35.069 
my pattern right across that dot and
that<00:02:28.780> is<00:02:28.900> your<00:02:29.049> mitered<00:02:29.349> corner<00:02:33.750> I'm<00:02:34.750> going<00:02:34.959> to

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
that is your mitered corner I'm going to

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.440 
that is your mitered corner I'm going to
cut<00:02:35.319> across<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:36.519> edge<00:02:36.549> of<00:02:36.849> the<00:02:36.939> pattern<00:02:37.150> so

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
cut across the edge of the pattern so

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.080 
cut across the edge of the pattern so
you<00:02:37.510> can<00:02:37.720> see<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:38.019> it<00:02:38.140> does<00:02:38.319> fall<00:02:38.849> into<00:02:39.849> a

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
you can see that it does fall into a

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.199 
you can see that it does fall into a
mitered<00:02:40.750> corner<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:42.099> I<00:02:42.310> didn't<00:02:42.670> need<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.849> fold

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
mitered corner and I didn't need to fold

00:02:43.209 --> 00:03:13.319 
mitered corner and I didn't need to fold
my<00:02:43.450> paper<00:02:43.750> pattern<00:02:44.500> at<00:02:44.680> all<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:13.000> that's<00:03:13.180> how

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
my paper pattern at all and that's how

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.330 
my paper pattern at all and that's how
you<00:03:13.389> draw<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.959> mitered<00:03:14.769> corner<00:03:15.129> without

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
you draw a mitered corner without

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.270 
you draw a mitered corner without
folding<00:03:15.549> your<00:03:15.790> paper<00:03:15.849> or<00:03:16.569> your<00:03:16.629> packing<00:03:17.280> and

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
folding your paper or your packing and

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.039 
folding your paper or your packing and
that<00:03:18.549> also<00:03:18.790> works<00:03:19.269> if<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.409> have<00:03:20.439> a<00:03:22.049> shape

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
that also works if you have a shape

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.780 
that also works if you have a shape
that's<00:03:23.349> not<00:03:23.819> too<00:03:24.819> 90<00:03:25.180> degrees<00:03:25.449> in<00:03:25.599> the<00:03:25.690> corner

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
that's not too 90 degrees in the corner

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.339 
that's not too 90 degrees in the corner
so<00:03:27.790> do<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.060> same<00:03:28.299> thing<00:03:30.510> mark<00:03:31.510> a<00:03:31.660> spot<00:03:31.930> from

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
so do the same thing mark a spot from

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.530 
so do the same thing mark a spot from
the<00:03:32.500> corner<00:03:32.859> this<00:03:33.699> time<00:03:33.940> I'm<00:03:34.090> going<00:03:34.239> to<00:03:34.329> do<00:03:34.510> a

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
the corner this time I'm going to do a

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.330 
the corner this time I'm going to do a
different<00:03:34.930> measurement<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.500> 5<00:03:35.680> centimeters

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
different measurement to 5 centimeters

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.159 
different measurement to 5 centimeters
so<00:03:36.489> you<00:03:36.549> know<00:03:36.730> that<00:03:36.940> it<00:03:37.060> it<00:03:37.419> works<00:03:37.690> with<00:03:37.959> any

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
so you know that it it works with any

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.610 
so you know that it it works with any
measurement<00:03:38.560> I'm<00:03:38.680> just<00:03:38.859> going<00:03:39.010> to<00:03:39.099> do<00:03:39.220> four

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
measurement I'm just going to do four

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.720 
measurement I'm just going to do four
and<00:03:41.620> four<00:03:43.349> again<00:03:44.349> join<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.769> two<00:03:44.980> line<00:03:45.190> two

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
and four again join the two line two

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.750 
and four again join the two line two
dots<00:03:45.970> together<00:03:46.209> in<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.870> line<00:03:47.519> measure<00:03:48.519> this

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
dots together in the line measure this

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.039 
dots together in the line measure this
line<00:03:49.620> mine<00:03:50.620> is<00:03:50.799> about<00:03:51.569> six<00:03:52.569> point<00:03:52.959> four<00:03:55.049> so

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
line mine is about six point four so

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.899 
line mine is about six point four so
that<00:03:56.199> will<00:03:56.319> be<00:03:56.440> three<00:03:56.739> point<00:03:57.040> two<00:03:57.370> another

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
that will be three point two another

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.460 
that will be three point two another
thing<00:03:58.180> is<00:03:58.359> if<00:03:58.540> you<00:03:58.659> do<00:03:58.810> have<00:03:58.989> a<00:03:59.019> packmaster

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
thing is if you do have a packmaster

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.740 
thing is if you do have a packmaster
like<00:03:59.799> I<00:03:59.979> do<00:04:00.040> all<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:00.940> have<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.209> do<00:04:01.329> is<00:04:01.510> line

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
like I do all you have to do is line

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.449 
like I do all you have to do is line
this<00:04:01.989> line<00:04:03.659> to<00:04:04.659> the<00:04:04.780> corner<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.319> make<00:04:06.250> sure

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
this line to the corner and make sure

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.849 
this line to the corner and make sure
the<00:04:06.669> measurement<00:04:07.120> on<00:04:07.239> either<00:04:07.599> side<00:04:07.930> matches

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
the measurement on either side matches

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.979 
the measurement on either side matches
where<00:04:09.129> it<00:04:09.250> crosses<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:11.010> fold<00:04:12.010> lines<00:04:12.250> so<00:04:12.989> I'm

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
where it crosses the fold lines so I'm

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.000 
where it crosses the fold lines so I'm
going<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.379> do<00:04:14.530> about<00:04:14.620> three<00:04:15.040> point<00:04:15.340> two<00:04:17.010> mark

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
going to do about three point two mark

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.660 
going to do about three point two mark
the<00:04:18.190> center<00:04:18.579> spot

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.000 

-<00:04:23.670> up<00:04:23.880> with<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.180> corner<00:04:27.320> so<00:04:28.320> now<00:04:28.500> I'm<00:04:28.650> going<00:04:28.890> to

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
- up with a corner so now I'm going to

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.090 
- up with a corner so now I'm going to
draw<00:04:29.750> my<00:04:30.750> facing<00:04:31.320> and<00:04:31.500> this<00:04:31.650> time<00:04:31.860> I'm<00:04:32.070> just

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
draw my facing and this time I'm just

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.280 
draw my facing and this time I'm just
going<00:04:32.490> to<00:04:32.580> do<00:04:32.790> three<00:04:33.150> centimeter<00:04:33.780> facing

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
going to do three centimeter facing

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.290 
going to do three centimeter facing
instead<00:04:35.100> of<00:04:35.220> four<00:04:35.460> it<00:04:35.700> works<00:04:35.910> for<00:04:36.120> any

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
instead of four it works for any

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:44.870 
instead of four it works for any
measurement<00:04:42.980> and<00:04:43.980> again<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.400> edge<00:04:44.550> of<00:04:44.730> your

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
measurement and again the edge of your

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.050 
measurement and again the edge of your
pattern<00:04:45.210> is<00:04:45.360> your<00:04:45.510> mirror<00:04:45.690> line<00:04:46.940> so<00:04:47.940> I'm

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
pattern is your mirror line so I'm

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.510 
pattern is your mirror line so I'm
narrowing<00:04:48.420> the<00:04:49.230> diagonal<00:04:49.740> line<00:04:49.920> onto<00:04:50.190> my

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
narrowing the diagonal line onto my

00:04:50.520 --> 00:05:22.710 
narrowing the diagonal line onto my
facing<00:04:54.620> window<00:04:55.620> measure<00:04:55.800> three<00:04:56.190> centimeters

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.790 

this<00:05:23.720> is<00:05:23.870> my<00:05:24.050> mitered<00:05:24.410> corner<00:05:26.380> also<00:05:27.380> if<00:05:27.680> you

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
this is my mitered corner also if you

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.460 
this is my mitered corner also if you
want<00:05:27.980> the<00:05:28.070> facing<00:05:28.669> that<00:05:29.630> is<00:05:29.750> wider<00:05:29.990> on<00:05:30.260> one

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
want the facing that is wider on one

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.960 
want the facing that is wider on one
side<00:05:30.740> and<00:05:31.430> narrower

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
side and narrower

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.510 
side and narrower
on<00:05:32.120> one<00:05:32.300> side<00:05:32.540> this<00:05:33.020> also<00:05:33.260> works<00:05:33.650> just

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
on one side this also works just

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.690 
on one side this also works just
sketching<00:05:35.030> your<00:05:35.240> line<00:05:35.480> first<00:05:35.810> so<00:05:35.960> if<00:05:36.139> I<00:05:36.290> do<00:05:36.700> 5

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
sketching your line first so if I do 5

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.129 
sketching your line first so if I do 5
centimeters<00:05:38.510> on<00:05:38.750> one<00:05:39.080> side<00:05:40.389> and<00:05:41.389> I<00:05:41.540> want<00:05:41.780> to<00:05:41.930> do

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
centimeters on one side and I want to do

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.110 
centimeters on one side and I want to do
just<00:05:42.470> 2<00:05:43.430> centimeters<00:05:44.230> on<00:05:45.230> the<00:05:45.290> other<00:05:45.680> edge

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
just 2 centimeters on the other edge

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.260 
just 2 centimeters on the other edge
draw<00:05:47.120> in<00:05:47.390> where<00:05:47.720> you<00:05:47.900> want<00:05:48.080> the<00:05:48.320> facing<00:05:49.270> to

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
draw in where you want the facing to

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.390 
draw in where you want the facing to
finish<00:05:52.780> rather<00:05:53.780> than<00:05:54.110> the<00:05:54.260> actual<00:05:54.410> facing<00:05:55.190> so

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
finish rather than the actual facing so

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.980 
finish rather than the actual facing so
this<00:05:55.550> is<00:05:55.700> just<00:05:55.850> a<00:05:56.030> marker<00:05:56.480> of<00:05:56.540> where<00:05:56.810> you'd

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
this is just a marker of where you'd

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.540 
this is just a marker of where you'd
want<00:05:57.260> it<00:05:57.410> to<00:05:57.590> finish<00:05:57.740> make<00:05:58.190> sure<00:05:58.340> these<00:05:58.490> two

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
want it to finish make sure these two

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.980 
want it to finish make sure these two
points<00:05:59.090> match<00:05:59.650> and<00:06:00.650> then<00:06:01.240> line<00:06:02.240> up<00:06:02.270> the<00:06:02.840> two

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
points match and then line up the two

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.890 
points match and then line up the two
corners<00:06:03.470> together<00:06:06.370> so<00:06:07.370> you<00:06:07.760> want<00:06:07.940> this<00:06:08.180> to<00:06:08.780> be

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
corners together so you want this to be

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.040 
corners together so you want this to be
the<00:06:08.930> finishing<00:06:09.290> product<00:06:10.630> now<00:06:11.630> I'm<00:06:11.750> going<00:06:11.960> to

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
the finishing product now I'm going to

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.440 
the finishing product now I'm going to
draw<00:06:12.200> the<00:06:12.260> actual<00:06:12.470> facing<00:06:13.160> so<00:06:13.490> 5<00:06:13.790> centimeters

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
draw the actual facing so 5 centimeters

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:22.110 
draw the actual facing so 5 centimeters
on<00:06:14.690> this<00:06:14.870> side<00:06:17.860> 2<00:06:18.860> centimeters<00:06:19.580> on<00:06:19.820> this<00:06:20.000> side

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
on this side 2 centimeters on this side

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.210 
on this side 2 centimeters on this side
and<00:06:23.120> I<00:06:23.630> want<00:06:23.810> to<00:06:23.900> know<00:06:24.050> if<00:06:24.169> that<00:06:24.200> mark<00:06:24.770> because

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
and I want to know if that mark because

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:31.440 
and I want to know if that mark because
that<00:06:25.370> is<00:06:25.460> the<00:06:25.580> corner<00:06:26.000> off<00:06:26.600> this<00:06:26.870> side<00:06:27.140> to<00:06:27.800> here

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.450 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.420 

so<00:06:32.450> I'm<00:06:32.539> making<00:06:32.720> sure<00:06:33.020> that<00:06:33.260> this<00:06:33.380> is<00:06:33.560> level<00:06:33.890> so

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
so I'm making sure that this is level so

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.370 
so I'm making sure that this is level so
from<00:06:34.760> a<00:06:34.880> mirror<00:06:35.090> line<00:06:35.300> to<00:06:35.720> the<00:06:35.810> point<00:06:36.050> is<00:06:36.200> 5

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
from a mirror line to the point is 5

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.680 
from a mirror line to the point is 5
centimeters<00:06:37.070> so<00:06:37.850> I<00:06:37.880> need<00:06:38.120> to<00:06:38.210> mirror<00:06:38.360> that<00:06:38.570> on

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
centimeters so I need to mirror that on

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.870 
centimeters so I need to mirror that on
the<00:06:38.780> mirror<00:06:38.930> line<00:06:39.169> to<00:06:39.470> that<00:06:39.620> aside<00:06:39.890> it's<00:06:40.580> also

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 
the mirror line to that aside it's also

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.840 
the mirror line to that aside it's also
5<00:06:41.060> centimeters<00:06:41.630> just<00:06:43.000> need<00:06:44.000> to<00:06:44.120> join<00:06:45.850> these

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:46.850 
5 centimeters just need to join these

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:54.670 
5 centimeters just need to join these
two<00:06:47.919> and<00:06:48.919> do<00:06:49.100> the<00:06:49.190> same<00:06:49.400> here

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:05.600 

just<00:06:55.680> to<00:06:55.830> marry<00:06:56.010> that<00:06:56.280> dot<00:06:56.660> come<00:06:57.660> in<00:06:57.780> here<00:07:04.610> so

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:05.610 
just to marry that dot come in here so

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.330 
just to marry that dot come in here so
ignore<00:07:05.940> these<00:07:06.060> lines<00:07:06.360> now<00:07:06.860> these<00:07:07.860> are<00:07:08.160> your

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 
ignore these lines now these are your

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.820 
ignore these lines now these are your
facings<00:07:08.820> that<00:07:09.240> is<00:07:09.330> your<00:07:09.480> fold<00:07:09.660> line<00:07:09.870> also<00:07:10.440> the

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:10.830 
facings that is your fold line also the

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.650 
facings that is your fold line also the
edge<00:07:10.950> of<00:07:11.130> your<00:07:11.280> original<00:07:11.400> pattern<00:07:11.940> and<00:07:12.270> these

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 
edge of your original pattern and these

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.010 
edge of your original pattern and these
will<00:07:12.780> be<00:07:12.810> folded<00:07:13.200> into<00:07:13.350> much<00:07:13.560> perfecting<00:07:15.020> it

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020 
will be folded into much perfecting it

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.550 
will be folded into much perfecting it
also<00:07:16.170> works<00:07:16.530> if<00:07:16.740> your<00:07:16.890> pattern<00:07:17.160> is<00:07:18.560> narrower

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 
also works if your pattern is narrower

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.680 
also works if your pattern is narrower
than<00:07:19.890> a<00:07:20.010> 90<00:07:20.310> degrees<00:07:20.610> so<00:07:21.180> I<00:07:21.210> did<00:07:21.420> the<00:07:21.510> same

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:21.690 
than a 90 degrees so I did the same

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.530 
than a 90 degrees so I did the same
thing<00:07:21.750> here<00:07:22.230> drew<00:07:22.830> a<00:07:22.860> line<00:07:23.040> down<00:07:23.100> the<00:07:23.340> middle

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:23.540 
thing here drew a line down the middle

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.290 
thing here drew a line down the middle
married<00:07:24.540> that<00:07:24.720> to<00:07:25.440> here<00:07:25.680> and<00:07:26.250> mirror<00:07:26.670> that<00:07:26.820> to

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 
married that to here and mirror that to

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.500 
married that to here and mirror that to
here<00:07:28.340> and<00:07:29.340> that's<00:07:29.490> how<00:07:29.640> you<00:07:29.730> draw<00:07:30.000> a<00:07:30.180> mitered

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:30.510 
here and that's how you draw a mitered

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:38.820 
here and that's how you draw a mitered
corner

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:38.830 

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.890
