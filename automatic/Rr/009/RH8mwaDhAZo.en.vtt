a full layer you should click on the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.170 
a full layer you should click on the
layer<00:01:06.830> like<00:01:07.830> let's<00:01:08.100> say<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.310> want<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.729> very<00:01:08.909> big

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
layer like let's say you want a very big

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.789 
layer like let's say you want a very big
one<00:01:10.070> makes<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.159> very<00:01:11.340> big<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.650> also

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
one makes it very big and I can also

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.969 
one makes it very big and I can also
edit<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:15.240> pressure<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.979> deliberate

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
edit the pressure so it is deliberate

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.520 
edit the pressure so it is deliberate
restaurant<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.689> for<00:01:21.960> example<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.470> could

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
restaurant and for example I could

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.030 
restaurant and for example I could
choose<00:01:23.600> this<00:01:24.600> swatch<00:01:24.990> make<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> little<00:01:25.920> bit

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
choose this swatch make it a little bit

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.240 
choose this swatch make it a little bit
bigger<00:01:27.170> tray<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.590> choose<00:01:28.770> another<00:01:28.920> brush

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
bigger tray and choose another brush

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.830 
bigger tray and choose another brush
like<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.939> airbrush<00:01:30.560> then<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:32.509> draw<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.570> top

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
like the airbrush then just draw on top

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.340 
like the airbrush then just draw on top
of<00:01:33.960> everything<00:01:34.460> in<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.579> new<00:01:35.729> layer<00:01:36.200> then<00:01:37.200> in

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
of everything in the new layer then in

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.550 
of everything in the new layer then in
layers<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.920> could<00:01:38.280> set<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.329> like<00:01:40.110> 50

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
layers I could set this one to like 50

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.230 
layers I could set this one to like 50
so<00:01:41.189> it's<00:01:41.780> it's<00:01:42.780> 50%<00:01:43.380> person's<00:01:44.340> transparent

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
so it's it's 50% person's transparent

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.039 
so it's it's 50% person's transparent
then<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.890> kind<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.570> colors<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.840> all

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
then you get this kind of colors and all

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.139 
then you get this kind of colors and all
these<00:01:49.259> things<00:01:49.649> you've<00:01:49.799> just<00:01:50.009> drawn<00:01:50.280> little

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
these things you've just drawn little

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.480 
these things you've just drawn little
bridge<00:01:51.299> projected<00:01:51.930> into<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> material<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:53.369> when

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
bridge projected into a material so when

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.389 
bridge projected into a material so when
you<00:01:53.610> go<00:01:53.790> back<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.299> standard<00:01:55.049> ground<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:56.159> see

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
you go back to standard ground you see
