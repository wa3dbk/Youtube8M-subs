00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.760
 yeah 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.190
 okay 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.210
 m 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.960
 yeah 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.280
 the next day our hunters had 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.100
 right to great shows worthy 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.020
 an unforgettable hunting experience 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.360
 at dawn the Russian seemed to be 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.860
 finally trigger with a weather most 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.500
 propitious of a match the shoulders guide 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.080
 were chasing a good 6 since 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.120
 in the early morning they tried to 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.370
 attract him with the calls but he was 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.700
 busy courting a goat and 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.860
 their artifices did not make the weight 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.910
 once the goat disappeared it was necessary 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.910
 try one last time the skin 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.640
 behind nothing 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.130
 as the broker does not react he does not 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.130
 remains more than the close 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.830
 first of all Paul must go along the edge 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.290
 while keeping an eye constantly 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.180
 on the brocade his camouflage is of a 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.340
 great utility but it must nevertheless 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.930
 stop in a split second 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.930
 as soon as his game raises his head 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.310
 the hay bales falls perfectly and paul 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.310
 puts them to his benefit 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.110
 it is perfectly concealed and ready to 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.319
 stand up to lean on the ball of 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.319
 hay 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.560
 the goat is back and her 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.829
 behavior leaves no doubt 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.390
 brocard however this is never the 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.390
 brocard who decide the choice of his 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.489
 partner during their huts the 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.170
 goats are very active and do not hesitate 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.030
 not to select the parent among 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.010
 several males present in a radius 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.840
 several kilometers 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.849
 in fact the heat only lasts two 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.849
 days and that's where everything has to play 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.930
 the scene is of rare beauty but paul 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.620
 is in hunting action and does not want 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.620
 give it a chance 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.950
 he hires his steicher he is ready 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.930
 the opinion of those brocade ended with 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.420
 a jump of exceptional height 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.320
 equally exceptional and the approach 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.240
 started in the first light of the day 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.240
 by paul and his guide lady h 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.110
 brocade is also beautiful loans 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.500
 that they had been in the binoculars 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.500
 in 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.910
 by his side 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:42.509
 Have a good time for a juno 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:50.039

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:51.620

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:06.710
 I know that 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.749
 the animals were not far away 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:16.889
 and Paul had no trouble 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:16.889
 place your ball in the shoulder 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:41.659
 hunting every moment can you 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.909

 he can not control his curiosity 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.060
 where does this noise come from? 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.950
 push such a cry 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:08.520
 maybe a meal in anticipation but where 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.520
 was it so maybe here 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.380
