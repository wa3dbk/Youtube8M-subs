me<00:02:05.340> then<00:02:06.340> they<00:02:06.460> make<00:02:06.610> kids<00:02:06.820> take<00:02:07.060> geometry

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
me then they make kids take geometry

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.180 
me then they make kids take geometry
they<00:02:07.780> still<00:02:07.990> take<00:02:08.170> that<00:02:08.350> sophomore<00:02:08.679> your<00:02:08.979> 10th

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
they still take that sophomore your 10th

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.030 
they still take that sophomore your 10th
grade<00:02:09.429> geometry<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:10.270> need<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.920> just

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
grade geometry you need that it's just

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.140 
grade geometry you need that it's just

probably a triangle in the run carrying
theorem<00:02:16.630> which<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:16.900> thought<00:02:17.080> was<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.260> coughs

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
theorem which I thought was a coughs

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.759 
theorem which I thought was a coughs
here<00:02:17.770> for<00:02:21.570> using<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.690> protractor<00:02:23.410> as<00:02:23.500> opposed

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
here for using the protractor as opposed

here for using the protractor as opposed
to<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.920> amateur<00:02:24.340> tracker<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.730> found

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
to the amateur tracker I found

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.440 
to the amateur tracker I found
everyone<00:02:27.490> a<00:02:27.520> teacher<00:02:27.790> would<00:02:27.940> calling<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.360> and

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
everyone a teacher would calling you and

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.850 
everyone a teacher would calling you and
he<00:02:28.510> had<00:02:28.600> absolutely<00:02:28.990> no<00:02:29.230> clue

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
he had absolutely no clue

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.220 
he had absolutely no clue
Oh<00:02:30.210> Tim<00:02:31.210> would<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.510> like<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.780> tell<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.050> class

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
Oh Tim would you like to tell the class
