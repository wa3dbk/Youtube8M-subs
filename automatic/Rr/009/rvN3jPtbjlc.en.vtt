now<00:03:12.489> let's<00:03:12.670> have<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.880> closer<00:03:13.150> look<00:03:13.450> at<00:03:13.630> it<00:03:13.720> I

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
now let's have a closer look at it I

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.140 
now let's have a closer look at it I
think<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.230> overall<00:03:14.620> styling<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:15.670> design<00:03:16.000> on

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
think the overall styling and design on

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.210 
think the overall styling and design on
this<00:03:16.269> is<00:03:16.420> quite<00:03:16.750> nice<00:03:16.930> it's<00:03:17.290> simple<00:03:17.860> but<00:03:18.160> I

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
this is quite nice it's simple but I

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.090 
this is quite nice it's simple but I
like<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.970> look<00:03:19.180> as<00:03:19.390> well<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:20.350> has<00:03:20.590> this<00:03:20.799> kind

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
like the look as well it has this kind

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.789 
like the look as well it has this kind
of<00:03:21.190> combination<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.720> matte<00:03:23.140> as<00:03:23.470> well<00:03:23.680> as<00:03:23.769> a

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
of combination of a matte as well as a

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.910 
of combination of a matte as well as a
glossy<00:03:24.190> finish<00:03:24.370> that<00:03:25.090> works<00:03:25.329> pretty<00:03:25.750> well

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
glossy finish that works pretty well

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.350 
glossy finish that works pretty well
although<00:03:26.920> in<00:03:27.220> most<00:03:27.400> cases<00:03:27.760> you'll<00:03:28.120> probably

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
although in most cases you'll probably

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.170 
although in most cases you'll probably
grabbing<00:03:29.049> this<00:03:29.260> from<00:03:29.829> the<00:03:30.040> center<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:30.549> this

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
grabbing this from the center and this

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.000 
grabbing this from the center and this
is<00:03:31.329> glossy<00:03:31.570> so<00:03:32.200> it's<00:03:32.410> really<00:03:32.650> going<00:03:32.860> to

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
is glossy so it's really going to

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.610 
is glossy so it's really going to
attract<00:03:33.400> fingerprints<00:03:34.299> and<00:03:34.420> dust<00:03:34.989> really

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
attract fingerprints and dust really

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.130 
attract fingerprints and dust really
easily<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:36.459> of<00:03:36.610> course<00:03:36.850> this<00:03:37.180> is<00:03:37.450> all<00:03:37.720> plastic
