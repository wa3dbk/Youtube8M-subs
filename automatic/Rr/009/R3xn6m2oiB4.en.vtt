fighter<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.310> would<00:03:33.549> actually<00:03:33.670> say<00:03:34.060> is<00:03:34.329> a<00:03:34.810> much

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
fighter I would actually say is a much

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.190 
fighter I would actually say is a much
better<00:03:35.470> bike<00:03:35.799> than<00:03:36.220> their<00:03:36.459> 1098<00:03:37.299> or<00:03:37.480> 1198

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
better bike than their 1098 or 1198

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.589 
better bike than their 1098 or 1198
Superbike<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:39.370> olan<00:03:39.670> suspension<00:03:40.269> is<00:03:40.359> nice

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
Superbike the olan suspension is nice

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.660 
Superbike the olan suspension is nice
and<00:03:40.840> supple<00:03:41.049> so<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:41.709> really<00:03:41.889> does<00:03:42.099> soak<00:03:42.370> up<00:03:42.579> our

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
and supple so it really does soak up our

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.879 
and supple so it really does soak up our
lumps<00:03:42.909> and<00:03:43.060> bumps<00:03:43.120> but<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.049> power<00:03:44.439> from<00:03:44.739> that

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
lumps and bumps but the power from that

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.550 
lumps and bumps but the power from that
motor<00:03:45.189> is<00:03:45.549> just<00:03:46.000> so<00:03:46.209> much<00:03:46.359> more<00:03:46.569> usable<00:03:47.109> from

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
motor is just so much more usable from

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.490 
motor is just so much more usable from
4000<00:03:48.250> rpm<00:03:48.639> there's<00:03:48.939> just<00:03:49.269> heaps<00:03:49.720> there<00:03:50.109> and<00:03:50.349> as

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
4000 rpm there's just heaps there and as

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.140 
4000 rpm there's just heaps there and as
I<00:03:50.620> say<00:03:50.799> it<00:03:50.980> really<00:03:51.250> will<00:03:51.400> just<00:03:51.430> wheelie<00:03:51.879> from

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
I say it really will just wheelie from

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.179 
I say it really will just wheelie from
corner<00:03:52.480> to<00:03:52.510> corner<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:53.680> riding<00:03:54.069> position

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:54.189 
corner to corner the riding position

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:56.550 
corner to corner the riding position
isn't<00:03:54.730> so<00:03:55.209> as<00:03:55.329> radical<00:03:55.810> as<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.139> Superbike

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
isn't so as radical as the Superbike

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.349 
isn't so as radical as the Superbike
either<00:03:56.829> so<00:03:57.310> you<00:03:57.370> don't<00:03:57.609> have<00:03:57.819> all<00:03:57.939> that<00:03:57.970> weight

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
either so you don't have all that weight

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.720 
either so you don't have all that weight
on<00:03:58.389> your<00:03:58.689> wrists<00:03:59.079> but<00:03:59.620> also<00:03:59.769> you<00:04:00.010> have<00:04:00.400> got<00:04:00.609> the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
on your wrists but also you have got the

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.490 
on your wrists but also you have got the
added<00:04:01.030> bonus<00:04:01.239> of<00:04:01.629> having<00:04:01.930> those<00:04:02.019> Brembo

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
added bonus of having those Brembo

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.710 
added bonus of having those Brembo
monobloc<00:04:02.530> calipers<00:04:02.980> so<00:04:03.939> it<00:04:04.239> really<00:04:04.540> is<00:04:04.689> just

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
monobloc calipers so it really is just

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.740 
monobloc calipers so it really is just
like<00:04:05.169> a<00:04:05.319> Superbike<00:04:05.829> front<00:04:06.099> end<00:04:06.340> not<00:04:06.939> the<00:04:07.060> 1098

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
like a Superbike front end not the 1098

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.710 
like a Superbike front end not the 1098
or<00:04:07.930> more<00:04:08.349> recently<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.889> 1198<00:04:09.730> Superbike<00:04:10.269> are

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
or more recently the 1198 Superbike are

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.729

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
that's for sure but if you like me I

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.170 
that's for sure but if you like me I
spend<00:04:14.439> 90%<00:04:14.590> of<00:04:15.099> my<00:04:15.159> time<00:04:15.459> on<00:04:15.489> the<00:04:15.669> road<00:04:15.730> I'm
