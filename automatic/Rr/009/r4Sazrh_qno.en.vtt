00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.900
Since The '64 I've been in love with Smash Bros.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:09.880
Video game sound: GO!

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.240
I know every item,Stage, And trophy too!

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.060
I even leveled up a set of sweet Amiibo

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.660
To play against when i play Smash Bros. U!

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.360
When i play smash i only play for glory!

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.300
I tend to favor melee, Yes, It's true

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.500
But since I typically stick to stock,

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.100
And the GameCube gamepads rock,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.400
I'm getting super hyped for Smash Bros. U!

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.160
Because we love to smash our friends at Super Smash Bros!

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.080
Though I think Master Hand is better than Tabuu...

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.200
Wait, Who?

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.660
Whether it's beating a team of hacks.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.480
.Or maybe spamming some cheap attacks!

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.760
We can agree that we love Smash Bros. U!

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.400
I was best of all the players in my high school!

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.660
I'm invincible as Fox or Pikachu!

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.860
Oh, And i also know a hundred million combos!

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.640
And I can wavedash.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.460
-Argh! NO!

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.860
$#*(@ YOU!

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.220
I don't know how to play;

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.640
I'm pushing buttons.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.120
I don't recall precisely what they do...

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.060
I guess I'll stick with Down and B.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.040
.I only play this at parties...

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.520
I'm pretty horrible at Smash Bros. U!

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.180
And yet we're totally addicted to Smash Brothers!

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.500
We may have a small obsession.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.180
.Or tatto! (SO COOL)

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.760
And even though I may be worst,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.840
And I would NORMALLY get first,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.680
No game's the same as playing Smash Bros. U!

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.140
Nobody ever gives up their controller...

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.180
I'd love to join a Smash Bros. round or two.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:01.400
But I'm eternally that guy nobody wants to give a try...

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.380
Dude!

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.100
Wanna play Smash Bros Now updated to eight players!

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.860
Really?!

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.980
That mode's exclusively for Smash Bros. U!

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.260
Now we all can play together at Smash Brothers!

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.120
I can kill my friends until my thumbs are black and blue!

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.200
This blue lady!

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.180
Little Mac!

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.700
Guys, Mewtwo's coming back!

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.780
It's clear we all adore Smash Brothers.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.040
4 U!

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.480
Video game: TIME!

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.300
