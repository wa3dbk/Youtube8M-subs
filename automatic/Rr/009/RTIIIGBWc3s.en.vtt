00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.039 
morning we'll really focus more right
now<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.460> interior

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.249 

we<00:02:02.710> look<00:02:02.859> out<00:02:03.009> next<00:02:03.369> to<00:02:03.520> us<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:03.880> we<00:02:04.780> see<00:02:04.960> the

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
we look out next to us and we see the

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.349 
we look out next to us and we see the
plane<00:02:05.799> and<00:02:06.039> the<00:02:06.100> gate<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:06.640> know<00:02:06.759> right<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.240> our

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
plane and the gate you know right to our

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:09.900 
plane and the gate you know right to our
left<00:02:07.719> just<00:02:08.019> immediately<00:02:08.410> slides<00:02:08.860> about<00:02:09.099> 15<00:02:09.700> or

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
left just immediately slides about 15 or

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.180 
left just immediately slides about 15 or
20<00:02:09.940> yards<00:02:10.569> away<00:02:10.690> from<00:02:11.019> the<00:02:11.140> gate<00:02:11.319> at<00:02:11.950> that

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
20 yards away from the gate at that

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.009 
20 yards away from the gate at that
point<00:02:12.489> everyone<00:02:13.030> on<00:02:13.180> our<00:02:13.269> plane<00:02:13.629> just

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
point everyone on our plane just

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.570 
point everyone on our plane just
immediately<00:02:14.800> started<00:02:15.099> streaming<00:02:15.280> for<00:02:15.519> the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
immediately started streaming for the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.250 
immediately started streaming for the
exit<00:02:15.910> luckily<00:02:16.269> we<00:02:16.420> were<00:02:16.540> still<00:02:16.780> connected<00:02:17.050> to

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
exit luckily we were still connected to

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.930 
exit luckily we were still connected to
the<00:02:17.349> gate<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:17.650> we<00:02:17.920> were<00:02:18.010> able<00:02:18.099> to<00:02:18.220> run<00:02:18.430> off<00:02:18.670> and

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
the gate so we were able to run off and

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.940 
the gate so we were able to run off and
by<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.780> time<00:02:19.989> you<00:02:20.080> get<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.410> terminal<00:02:20.620> mean

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
by the time you get to the terminal mean

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.320 
by the time you get to the terminal mean
we<00:02:21.040> got<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.370> terminal<00:02:21.790> lights<00:02:22.030> were<00:02:22.269> out

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
we got to the terminal lights were out

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.809 
we got to the terminal lights were out
there<00:02:22.660> was<00:02:22.810> glass<00:02:23.170> everywhere<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:24.129> just<00:02:24.340> open

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
there was glass everywhere is just open

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.220 
there was glass everywhere is just open
there<00:02:24.940> was<00:02:25.060> blood<00:02:25.360> everywhere<00:02:25.660> from<00:02:26.019> where

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
there was blood everywhere from where

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.160 
there was blood everywhere from where
people<00:02:26.530> have<00:02:26.739> been<00:02:26.769> cut
