do you do a year roughly fifty thousand
roughly<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:03.460> sort<00:03:03.640> of<00:03:03.700> average<00:03:04.000> is<00:03:04.150> it

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
roughly is that sort of average is it

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
roughly is that sort of average is it
its<00:03:04.570> average<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:06.250> can<00:03:06.790> push<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:07.240> out<00:03:07.330> I'm<00:03:08.080> not

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
its average you can push it out I'm not

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.200 
its average you can push it out I'm not
really<00:03:08.500> works<00:03:08.830> out<00:03:09.100> the<00:03:09.280> last<00:03:09.430> two<00:03:09.670> years<00:03:10.000> but

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
really works out the last two years but

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.910 
really works out the last two years but
I've<00:03:10.420> done<00:03:10.570> about<00:03:10.750> fifty<00:03:11.230> thousand<00:03:11.710> that's<00:03:11.800> a

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
I've done about fifty thousand that's a

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.500 
I've done about fifty thousand that's a
lot<00:03:12.100> of<00:03:12.130> miles<00:03:12.370> so<00:03:12.580> you<00:03:12.670> can<00:03:12.940> do<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.090> thousand

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
lot of miles so you can do a thousand

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.480 
lot of miles so you can do a thousand
miles<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:13.750> week<00:03:13.870> quite<00:03:14.110> easily<00:03:14.290> easily<00:03:14.740> but<00:03:15.370> it

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
miles a week quite easily easily but it

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.240 
miles a week quite easily easily but it
can't<00:03:15.700> be<00:03:15.850> easy<00:03:16.000> in<00:03:16.180> this<00:03:16.270> weather<00:03:17.070> it's<00:03:18.070> one

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
can't be easy in this weather it's one

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.430 
can't be easy in this weather it's one
of<00:03:18.370> those<00:03:18.459> you<00:03:18.730> get<00:03:18.880> your<00:03:19.450> theorem<00:03:19.900> set<00:03:20.290> your

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
of those you get your theorem set your

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.010 
of those you get your theorem set your
mind<00:03:20.650> to<00:03:20.770> getting<00:03:21.670> out<00:03:21.790> of<00:03:21.940> bed<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.360> looking
