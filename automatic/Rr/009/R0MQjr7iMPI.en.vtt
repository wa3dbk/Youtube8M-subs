00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.599
 take a piece of paper from the 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.129
 color of a rose preferably this 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.260
 piece of paper should do roughly 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.740
 one-third of a sheet of A4 format in 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.609
 the length that is slow of a first 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.609
 times in length 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.970
 and again in two in the same 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:38.000
 meaning then that there is once in 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.379
 two in the width use of 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.510
 scissors to cut one-third of the 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:46.250
 leaf keep the biggest pieces 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.879
 and then and in two in width 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.879
 like this 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.410
 do not forget it completely kept 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.670
 the right one with your hand and with the tool 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:04.150
 used a pair of scissors to cut 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:08.850
 like this one has to get pretty much 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.850
 this form finalized well the outlines 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.229
 now you have four pieces of 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.720
 the same shape take the little piece of 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.460
 paper and does the same thing you have to 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.580
 foot twice in the direction of the 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.580
 length 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.439
 the shape is less precise than the 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.369
 first and the water does not look like a 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.820
 heart so you get eight little ones 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.820
 pieces of paper 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.830
 take a stick and use 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.220
 leftover papers cut to make the 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.020
 center of the rose like these 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.759
 wanted to bend on the end of the stick and 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.909
 then you have to use string 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.840
 to bind the whole the coupe especially not 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.840
 the piece of string 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.900
 now take a small petals 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.850
 of roses 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.480
 and then and the like this to give him 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.480
 good form 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:33.070
 put the on the rod is fixed with it 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:36.300
 string rotating about putting 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.300
 a second like this 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.910
 continue with four or five others 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.910
 small petals like this 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.890
 surrounded the string well with each 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.890
 time 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.580
 then use the big petals 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.860
 once you have the shape of the 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.480
 pink you want to make a knot 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.480
 with the string for the support 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.530
 then if you want to finalize it 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.810
 take a small piece of green paper 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.650
 if possible you fold three times 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.650
 in length 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.750
 then cut diagonally 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.140
 by leaflet you have to get this 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.000
 form 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.000
 put glue on the green paper 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.810
 and surrounded the bottom of the rose like 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.810
 this 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.630
 we 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.530
 with a very fine piece of green paper 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.630
 you can surrounded the entire stem in 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.620
 putting glue in the end for good 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.620
 finalize your rose
