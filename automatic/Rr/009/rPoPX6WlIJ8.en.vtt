 that the most I joined as soon as 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.520
 first clip we of course

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.670
 any level and you could leave it's 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.010

 mix is ​​credited in this team get 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.130
 follow you into a global idea of 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.330
 what we want to play on a clip 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.830
 and especially the upcoming games that are going 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.930
 well it's for sale adds away 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.489
 a person for the stop of his 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.350
 next clip is that there we all 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.550
 possess an identity through which 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.590
 prophet on a recovery 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.030
 the clip that will come for which kate and 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.440
 house of live for the next music videos 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.360
 there is always this little thing that makes 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.880
 we feel there is the key lloris tarot 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.180
 with bruce lee is wise but it's great 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.180
 interesting 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.680
 it's my cousin jean baptiste calm 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.230
 had come into contact with soap 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.580
 for basically he had me 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.950
 asked to work with him for a 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.350
 capture and the shows that was doing 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.540
 etc I think he works him 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.650
 probably liked it's actually it's me 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.840
 recommended to for the realization and its 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.300
 clip is a little part of the thought 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.369
 meet me they sent me first 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.520
 sent an email with that I would be 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.470
 interested in making a clip situation 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.350
 professional and she sent me 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.509
 since he had some images that 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.970
 rain these are the jumps too he 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.820
 had done and I see 18 years 1 but 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.509
 which alas full of energy music6 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.580
 level I appreciate a lot and of 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:14.760
 blow I tell you bah will count so 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.980
 the character yesterday on the first clip 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.860
 onassis fly I received no tons of 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.140
 messages, but messages there 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.570
 said that there is something that 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.130
 did they think about mclain I 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.530
 had thought and it is by going to 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.430
 ninon the beatmaker of these two of his 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.370
 pieces there he started doing a little 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.269
 the life of the monks to the savior instrument 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.799
 so I start rapping over because 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.180
 that they knew the lyrics there are 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.200
 had the idea that came to record a 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.290
 piece we started recording 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.400
 the piece at home puts mac emma and 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.200
 then he played what happens is the 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.840
 same day and heard the piece not 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.120
 finished but we'll say the piece a little 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.500
 the mouths of the piece he did he did 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.100
 easily make a clip on it 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.620
 would be huge 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.400
 and suddenly this part of it 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.400
 often like that 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.990
 scenario it's really gone in 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:10.250
 clips codes teeth and culture 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:16.850
 american in fact these are the big ones 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:19.010
 evenings a lot of slow motion yes here it is 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.490
 but we are good we enter codes 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.830
 clips where you can afford to 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.230
 release is said here while selling themselves 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.970
 let go of trying to copy a little bit all 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.740
 these American clip codes on which 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.290
 we can really say we're going 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.910
 make a party 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.940
 try to delve around topics there 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:44.690
 and with a sound that is pretty punchy and 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:46.190
 with a clip that needed a place that 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.320
 is big enough to have a 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.740
 slightly behind the world there was 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.300
 constraint whatsoever click on three 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.560
 four o'clock our evenings 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.550
 it must be evening 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.959
 So no time to install light 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.610
 specific for each plan and that's 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.060
 so we went on a mood 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.370
 overall 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.080
 on him we put a light that 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.239
 could correspond a little bit on 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.760
 each plan and that will be worked after 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.160
 a little differently about passion on the 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.720
 case so this frame enemy game against 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.720
 day or not etc 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.920
 will just have the piece before in the studio 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.370
 then we do we prepare the pile by 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.510
 logic 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.340
 then I laugh my movie it was a movie 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.130
 and then there is the piece that goes into 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.040
 loop and after that and she with the 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.930
 music already know we will blow in 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.270
 are witnesses waiting for me I will not be 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.090
 a slacker on witnesses 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.520
 that's going to be 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.340
 the filming is behind but the 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.180
 true version that recorded mixed 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:05:02.699
 to do that, that's what's clean 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:04.860
 is not a little moment album 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:09.120
 class and increase the popularity at 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.780
 level of the internet scenes do not need 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.870
 things in order 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.479
 so we're talking about your 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.860
 boosting and maximally across 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.729
 internet through youtube through 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.650
 facebook across all networks 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.030
 social is the priority 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.190
 yes to projects and projects of 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.490
 click projects from Seine and lots of 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.490
 things like that 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.590
 is rotated with a Sony has made May 7 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.450
 so this is a camera that is taken for 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.650
 which this camera besides it is a 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.870
 camera that make it possible to 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.750
 slowed down to 240 frames per second 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:45.230
 in full hd which is quite sensitive too 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.330
 so here's one shoulders configuration in 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:51.230
 terms of light we have the spot 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:56.230
 the show is to say the light 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.230
 do not like or have a lot of 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:06.780
 on suffered nine who intervene in the 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:08.370
 cube to montage 3 4 in four days 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.720
 because I also know the rocks 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.350
 it's me who you are on your age 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.199
 American 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.150
 I also had the realization I know 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.710
 already in fact I already have all the work 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.350
 of the assembly which is already pre- assembled in 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:22.760
 delay so it's time saving it's 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:26.260
 interesting enough 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.260
 canac and heineken 

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:51.799
 Dwan 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.020
 or not 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.770
 look 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.250
 and 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.250
 the weekend
