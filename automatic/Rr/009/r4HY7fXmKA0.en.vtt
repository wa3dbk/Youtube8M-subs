00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
I think has to do with Claudio being

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.290 
I think has to do with Claudio being
such<00:01:43.549> a<00:01:44.320> such<00:01:45.320> ed<00:01:45.560> ease<00:01:45.800> with<00:01:46.250> her<00:01:46.460> who<00:01:47.030> was<00:01:47.149> one

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
such a such ed ease with her who was one

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.850 
such a such ed ease with her who was one
of<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.420> probably<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.899> few<00:01:48.259> people<00:01:48.470> who<00:01:48.710> was

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
of the probably the few people who was

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.980 
of the probably the few people who was
at<00:01:49.250> ease<00:01:49.490> with<00:01:49.670> her<00:01:49.909> because<00:01:50.210> he's<00:01:50.450> known<00:01:50.780> her

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
at ease with her because he's known her
