00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.080 
day in May and that's when all kids but
mostly<00:01:54.710> boys<00:01:54.920> are<00:01:55.280> celebrated<00:01:55.759> during<00:01:55.850> that

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
mostly boys are celebrated during that

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.359 
mostly boys are celebrated during that
time<00:01:56.329> so<00:01:56.689> it's<00:01:57.320> just<00:01:57.439> a<00:01:57.530> really<00:01:57.650> common<00:01:57.979> image

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
time so it's just a really common image

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.550 
time so it's just a really common image
and<00:01:58.670> I<00:01:58.729> thought<00:01:58.909> what<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.540> heck<00:01:59.720> we<00:01:59.900> should<00:02:00.079> do

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
and I thought what the heck we should do

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.740 
and I thought what the heck we should do
this<00:02:00.740> while<00:02:01.040> we<00:02:01.130> have<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.250> chance<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.850> kind<00:02:02.689> of

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
this while we have a chance and kind of

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.890 
this while we have a chance and kind of
celebrate<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.320> a<00:02:03.380> little<00:02:03.560> bit<00:02:03.770> so<00:02:04.280> I<00:02:04.640> just<00:02:05.630> used

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
celebrate it a little bit so I just used

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.080 
celebrate it a little bit so I just used
that<00:02:06.140> really<00:02:06.650> nice<00:02:06.829> red<00:02:07.250> which<00:02:07.729> is<00:02:07.880> really

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
that really nice red which is really

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.930 
that really nice red which is really
good<00:02:08.329> celebratory<00:02:09.079> image<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:09.860> then<00:02:10.340> I<00:02:10.700> had

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
good celebratory image and then I had

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.680 
good celebratory image and then I had
some<00:02:11.329> really<00:02:11.540> pretty<00:02:11.900> paper<00:02:12.350> that<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:13.540> had<00:02:14.540> gone

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
some really pretty paper that I had gone

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
actually it's kind of random but it it

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
silver in it and i think i've done an

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.790 
silver in it and i think i've done an
unboxing<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:38.090> this<00:02:38.240> before<00:02:38.660> but<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:39.440> comes<00:02:39.680> in

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
unboxing of this before but it comes in

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.170 
unboxing of this before but it comes in
lots<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:40.070> colors<00:02:40.220> there's<00:02:40.640> this<00:02:40.730> pale<00:02:40.970> blue

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
lots of colors there's this pale blue

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.300 
lots of colors there's this pale blue
yellow<00:02:41.780> pink<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.440> green<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:42.920> then<00:02:43.130> at<00:02:43.250> the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
yellow pink and green and then at the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.760 
yellow pink and green and then at the
very<00:02:43.340> end<00:02:43.550> is<00:02:43.730> white<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.240> i<00:02:45.050> just<00:02:45.560> thought

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
very end is white and i just thought

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.190 
very end is white and i just thought
with<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.160> white<00:02:46.400> bits<00:02:47.090> of<00:02:47.390> color<00:02:47.630> in<00:02:48.050> the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
with the white bits of color in the

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.380 
with the white bits of color in the
background<00:02:48.230> of<00:02:48.770> this<00:02:48.920> paper<00:02:49.190> making<00:02:50.120> the

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
background of this paper making the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.840 
background of this paper making the
white<00:02:50.540> cranes<00:02:50.930> would<00:02:51.110> look<00:02:51.230> really<00:02:51.380> pretty

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
white cranes would look really pretty

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.710 
white cranes would look really pretty
and<00:02:52.850> then<00:02:52.940> i'm<00:02:53.000> going<00:02:53.090> to<00:02:53.150> make<00:02:53.270> this<00:02:53.420> kind<00:02:53.630> of

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
and then i'm going to make this kind of

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.080 
and then i'm going to make this kind of
3d<00:02:54.050> where<00:02:54.320> I<00:02:54.350> just<00:02:54.620> sort<00:02:54.890> of<00:02:54.950> glue<00:02:55.310> down<00:02:55.520> just

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
3d where I just sort of glue down just

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.450 
3d where I just sort of glue down just
the<00:02:56.240> top<00:02:56.450> most<00:02:56.900> wing<00:02:57.320> and<00:02:58.040> you<00:02:58.190> get<00:02:58.370> your

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
the top most wing and you get your

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.880 
the top most wing and you get your
finished<00:02:58.910> crane<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.690> normally<00:03:00.380> you'd<00:03:00.650> you

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
finished crane and normally you'd you

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.270 
finished crane and normally you'd you
know<00:03:00.920> poof<00:03:01.250> things<00:03:01.550> out<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:03.500> know<00:03:03.650> curl

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
know poof things out and you know curl

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.650 
know poof things out and you know curl
the<00:03:04.580> wings<00:03:04.790> down<00:03:05.060> but<00:03:05.300> I'm<00:03:05.360> just<00:03:05.450> going<00:03:05.630> to

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
the wings down but I'm just going to

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.170 
the wings down but I'm just going to
keep<00:03:05.780> things<00:03:06.080> kind<00:03:06.350> of<00:03:06.410> geometric<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.250> keep

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
keep things kind of geometric and keep

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.690 
keep things kind of geometric and keep
things<00:03:08.540> like<00:03:09.320> this<00:03:09.560> where<00:03:09.800> I<00:03:09.830> can<00:03:10.100> kind<00:03:10.640> of

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
things like this where I can kind of

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.940 
things like this where I can kind of
have<00:03:10.880> a<00:03:10.940> tap<00:03:11.360> a<00:03:11.750> little<00:03:12.230> place<00:03:12.350> I<00:03:12.530> can<00:03:12.680> tack

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
have a tap a little place I can tack

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.560 
have a tap a little place I can tack
this<00:03:13.190> down<00:03:13.459> and<00:03:14.230> keep<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.709> three<00:03:16.070> birds<00:03:16.940> now

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
this down and keep the three birds now

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.120 
this down and keep the three birds now
the<00:03:17.630> paper<00:03:17.900> itself<00:03:18.260> start<00:03:18.709> off<00:03:18.830> being<00:03:18.950> about

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
the paper itself start off being about

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.980 
the paper itself start off being about
12<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.459> a<00:03:19.550> half<00:03:19.580> by<00:03:19.850> 12<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.240> a<00:03:20.270> half<00:03:20.300> and<00:03:20.690> i

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
12 and a half by 12 and a half and i

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.170 
12 and a half by 12 and a half and i
just<00:03:21.260> made<00:03:21.530> three<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.520> were<00:03:22.640> slightly

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
just made three that were slightly

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.580 
just made three that were slightly
different<00:03:23.630> in<00:03:23.690> size<00:03:23.870> this<00:03:24.230> one's<00:03:24.380> this

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
different in size this one's this

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.260 
different in size this one's this
straight<00:03:25.190> up<00:03:25.220> 12<00:03:25.550> and<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:25.700> half<00:03:25.730> by<00:03:25.940> 12<00:03:26.150> and<00:03:26.240> a

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
straight up 12 and a half by 12 and a

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.420 
straight up 12 and a half by 12 and a
half<00:03:26.300> and<00:03:26.600> this<00:03:26.720> one's<00:03:26.959> about<00:03:27.440> 12<00:03:27.860> by<00:03:28.010> 12<00:03:28.220> and

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
half and this one's about 12 by 12 and

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.220 
half and this one's about 12 by 12 and
then<00:03:28.580> this<00:03:28.760> is<00:03:28.940> 11<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.510> half<00:03:29.540> by<00:03:29.840> eleven<00:03:30.170> and

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
then this is 11 and a half by eleven and

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.050 
then this is 11 and a half by eleven and
a<00:03:30.290> half<00:03:30.320> so<00:03:31.040> you<00:03:31.190> kind<00:03:31.489> of<00:03:31.519> get<00:03:31.640> like<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:31.820> little

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
a half so you kind of get like a little

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.449 
a half so you kind of get like a little
family<00:03:32.269> of<00:03:32.750> birds<00:03:33.019> here<00:03:33.440> and<00:03:33.739> this<00:03:34.160> could<00:03:34.310> be<00:03:34.430> a

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
family of birds here and this could be a

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.070 
family of birds here and this could be a
