00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.890 
flasher relay underneath the ECU box
this<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.210> done<00:01:12.360> by<00:01:13.220> just<00:01:14.220> prying<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.060> away<00:01:15.299> and

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
this is done by just prying it away and

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.880 
this is done by just prying it away and
it's<00:01:16.380> right<00:01:16.530> there<00:01:17.090> okay<00:01:18.320> it<00:01:19.320> sits<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.710> this

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
it's right there okay it sits on this

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.060 
it's right there okay it sits on this
rubber<00:01:20.400> keeper<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.110> we<00:01:22.110> can<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.439> extract

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
rubber keeper that we can just extract

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.890 
rubber keeper that we can just extract
along<00:01:23.970> with<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.270> relay<00:01:24.590> like<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:26.900> unlock

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
along with the relay like this unlock

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.030 
along with the relay like this unlock
the<00:01:28.020> relay<00:01:28.320> by<00:01:29.130> prying<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.640> down<00:01:29.850> and

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
the relay by prying this down and

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.499 
the relay by prying this down and
unplugging<00:01:32.040> from<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.460> OEM<00:01:32.759> plug<00:01:35.509> same

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
unplugging from the OEM plug same

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.670 
unplugging from the OEM plug same
packaging<00:01:37.310> plug-and-play<00:01:39.110> okay<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.170> now<00:01:40.619> we

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
packaging plug-and-play okay so now we

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.130 
packaging plug-and-play okay so now we
want<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.159> take<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> rubber<00:01:41.700> keeper<00:01:42.150> off<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
want to take the rubber keeper off the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.530 
want to take the rubber keeper off the
OEM<00:01:43.530> unit<00:01:44.810> and<00:01:46.310> install<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.430> on<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.909> TST

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
OEM unit and install it on the TST

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.670 
OEM unit and install it on the TST
flasher<00:01:49.500> relay

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.440 

so

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.179 

now<00:01:59.049> we<00:01:59.110> can<00:01:59.290> plug<00:01:59.470> this<00:01:59.619> back<00:01:59.830> into<00:02:00.100> the

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
now we can plug this back into the

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:07.469 
now we can plug this back into the
harness<00:02:04.290> install<00:02:05.290> it<00:02:05.470> into<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.369> OEM<00:02:06.880> location

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
harness install it into the OEM location

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.830 
harness install it into the OEM location
with<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.470> rubber<00:02:08.770> keeper<00:02:09.160> and<00:02:09.910> we<00:02:10.539> can<00:02:10.690> now

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
with the rubber keeper and we can now

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.660 
with the rubber keeper and we can now
replace<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.650> ECU<00:02:12.069> box<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.700> proceed<00:02:12.910> to

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
replace the ECU box and proceed to

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.710 
replace the ECU box and proceed to
reinstall<00:02:15.670> everything<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.420> reverse

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
reinstall everything in the reverse

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.400 
reinstall everything in the reverse
