00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 so cool kid today check out 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.790
 new mod and known try to pull 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:17.850
 on it of course I would like this game 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:21.900
 surely I donâ€™t know can win pooja 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.420
 take or can templark templark 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:30.179
 let's take this the most optimal 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:32.880
 the option is now peeping our opponent hero 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.730
 who will play and actually 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:42.540
 let's see where all this will lead 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.090
 certainly no doubt this mod Well, how would 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.980
 and funny one-on-one 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.190
 you can really play there is one 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.129
 bug on leshrak 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:58.289
 I learned it also knew about it a long time ago 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.770
 and yet it is more accurate on this 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:07.710
 leshrac that he came across to me and 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:12.600
 showed us not well in general then 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:18.560
 In general, then in general, then disappointed 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:27.259
 I have because I ate everything outside the tower 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:27.259
 so what do we buy since heroes are a cunning 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:38.150
 so here we take and let's go 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:41.860
 madam and naturally now we will see 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:48.220
 it is possible to build what we can 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.220
 offers the author and darts solomid then 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:02.120
 ie skillbild is the law of such 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.390
 I have a slightly different course for a cube 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:11.270
 Well, the principle is fine instead of slippers you can 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:13.459
 there was an assembly for agility that in kenshi well 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.890
 okay basically i think this is quite 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.110
 that's why it's enough with the principle 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.820
 using a trap but maybe politeru there 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.970
 you can buy battles can not 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:29.810
 it was possible to buy a boat 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:32.000
 having saved money she see principle i 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.239
 I do not think that you can not somehow 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.600
 beat it all possible principle everything 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:41.900
 maybe if we give in to it 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.920
 naturally i'm honestly i'm solomid not 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.709
 I play very much 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:51.260
 I was carried out by players like that 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:55.160
 seemingly helpless character 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.239
 therefore, everything is possible in principle but all 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.239
 if again we can 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.739
 and quietly given 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.590
 Dad, well, pay me something not 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.390
 aggressor 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:24.739
 although what is his purchase 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.510
 he has nothing supernatural 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.540
 because i think he's in his pocket 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:35.359
 maybe some feature with 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.359
 which zhahnet me 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:58.819
 Well, here we earn ourselves know two 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.819
 times it will merge the wall and all of it as it was not 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.269
 no, too, i am grateful to you and that you 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.570
 throwing back 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.750
 my mobs but dude thanks me they don't 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.750
 are needed 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:51.260
 I give her bad given bad very bad 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.260
 even the worst let's say so 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:07.940
 let's do it for now so much 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.940
 for the time of this purchase 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.820
 even say that templar as he appeared 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:32.169
 but because he even hung this one 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.870
 Well , this one seems to have slept a salon 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:43.919
 removed 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:43.919
 level like so him aruna 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.080
 still want to eat the theme of this will not be 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.080
 dude 

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:10.799

00:06:10.799 --> 00:06:16.469
 it was a new mod that's the principle of truth 

00:06:14.489 --> 00:06:18.779
 wide feature told there is nothing 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:23.610
 special that is you go on a poplar on 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:24.899
 bottom and buy the fog naturally here 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.199
 such clarity 

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:31.499
 two or three pieces and just stop 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:35.339
 near the woods from the second he sang he just 

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:37.619
 skip this tower decreases hp and so 

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:40.079
 the image of poplar naissance is carried by all 

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:42.229
