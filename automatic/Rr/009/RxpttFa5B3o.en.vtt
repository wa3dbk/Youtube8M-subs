vehicle<00:00:26.130> mode<00:00:26.210> now<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.570> like<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.289> vehicle

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
vehicle mode now I like this vehicle

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.900 
vehicle mode now I like this vehicle
mode<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.609> not<00:00:29.880> perfect<00:00:30.510> but<00:00:31.080> at<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:32.489> scale

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
mode it's not perfect but at this scale

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.440 
mode it's not perfect but at this scale
in<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.750> blocky<00:00:34.260> Lego<00:00:34.680> form<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.670> think<00:00:36.300> it

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
in this blocky Lego form I think it

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.040 
in this blocky Lego form I think it
captures<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.989> decent<00:00:37.860> enough<00:00:38.540> here<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
captures it decent enough here is the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.819 
captures it decent enough here is the
actual<00:00:40.530> car<00:00:41.390> for<00:00:42.390> reference<00:00:45.050> now<00:00:46.050> there<00:00:46.620> are<00:00:46.770> a

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
actual car for reference now there are a

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.209 
actual car for reference now there are a
few<00:00:48.140> differences<00:00:49.140> with<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.129> few

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
few differences with this a few

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.299 
few differences with this a few
inaccuracies<00:00:51.079> first<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.680> only<00:00:52.860> has<00:00:53.129> two

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
inaccuracies first it only has two

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.580 
inaccuracies first it only has two
exhaust<00:00:53.640> pipes<00:00:53.910> rather<00:00:54.420> than<00:00:54.690> four<00:00:55.199> at<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
exhaust pipes rather than four at the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.880 
exhaust pipes rather than four at the
back<00:00:56.120> second<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> does<00:00:57.420> not<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.590> spoiler

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
back second it does not have the spoiler

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.170 
back second it does not have the spoiler
every<00:01:01.890> rendition<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.609> spoiler<00:01:03.030> I

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
every rendition of the spoiler I

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.210 
every rendition of the spoiler I
attempted<00:01:03.989> either<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.799> looked<00:01:05.010> out<00:01:05.159> of

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
attempted either just looked out of

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.050 
attempted either just looked out of
place<00:01:05.430> or<00:01:06.090> was<00:01:06.510> way<00:01:06.810> too<00:01:06.869> big<00:01:07.700> it<00:01:08.700> doesn't<00:01:08.760> have

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
place or was way too big it doesn't have

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.210 
place or was way too big it doesn't have
the<00:01:09.180> seats<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:09.750> those<00:01:09.960> are<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.140> they're<00:01:10.560> not

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
the seats but those are just they're not

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.440 
the seats but those are just they're not
there<00:01:11.549> rather<00:01:12.080> because<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.110> space<00:01:13.650> issues<00:01:15.229> and

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
there rather because of space issues and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.390 
there rather because of space issues and
really<00:01:18.450> that's<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:20.119> um<00:01:21.920> again<00:01:22.920> it's<00:01:23.159> it's<00:01:23.310> a

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
really that's it um again it's it's a

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.310 
really that's it um again it's it's a
lot<00:01:23.520> more<00:01:23.670> chunky<00:01:24.240> because<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.049> blocky

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
lot more chunky because of the blocky

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.219 
lot more chunky because of the blocky
nature<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.729> think<00:01:27.030> that's<00:01:27.210> fine<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:28.049> got

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
nature but I think that's fine it's got

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.950 
nature but I think that's fine it's got
some<00:01:28.439> rear<00:01:28.920> view<00:01:29.130> mirrors<00:01:29.490> here<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.299> vents<00:01:30.780> on

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
some rear view mirrors here the vents on

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.160 
some rear view mirrors here the vents on
the<00:01:31.079> front<00:01:31.380> kind<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:31.979> shape<00:01:32.930> for<00:01:33.930> wheels

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
the front kind of this shape for wheels

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.910 
the front kind of this shape for wheels
obviously<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:36.170> this<00:01:37.170> nice<00:01:37.380> shape<00:01:37.680> at<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
obviously and this nice shape at the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.390 
obviously and this nice shape at the
back

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
back

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.149 
back
I<00:01:38.430> like<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.540> vehicle<00:01:39.960> mode<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.409> by<00:01:40.979> all

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
I like this vehicle mode it's by all

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.530 
I like this vehicle mode it's by all
means<00:01:41.549> not<00:01:41.880> perfect<00:01:42.570> whatsoever<00:01:43.290> but<00:01:44.540> again

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
means not perfect whatsoever but again

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.840 
means not perfect whatsoever but again
for<00:01:45.780> what<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.049> worth<00:01:46.110> it's<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:47.130> nice<00:01:47.280> attempt

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
for what it's worth it's a nice attempt

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.480 
for what it's worth it's a nice attempt
so<00:01:49.220> let's<00:01:50.220> transform<00:01:50.610> him<00:01:51.979> so<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.040> start<00:01:53.310> off

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
so let's transform him so to start off

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.630 
so let's transform him so to start off
sideswipes<00:01:54.530> transformation<00:01:55.530> which<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.399> going

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
sideswipes transformation which is going

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.690 
sideswipes transformation which is going
to<00:01:56.820> do<00:01:57.979> is<00:01:58.979> take<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.460> wheels<00:01:59.700> here<00:02:01.189> and<00:02:02.189> bring

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
to do is take the wheels here and bring

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.869 
to do is take the wheels here and bring
them<00:02:03.149> forward<00:02:03.979> like<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:06.890> next<00:02:07.890> going<00:02:08.819> to

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
them forward like this next going to

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.670 
them forward like this next going to
take<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.239> arms

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.330 

bring<00:02:12.680> them<00:02:12.920> down<00:02:14.260> then<00:02:15.260> take<00:02:15.500> these<00:02:15.739> sections

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
bring them down then take these sections

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:25.479 
bring them down then take these sections
and<00:02:18.099> bring<00:02:19.099> them<00:02:19.870> up<00:02:22.689> this<00:02:23.689> comes<00:02:24.680> down<00:02:25.040> just<00:02:25.250> a

and bring them up this comes down just a

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:32.410 
and bring them up this comes down just a
bit<00:02:25.519> and<00:02:27.069> then<00:02:28.069> this<00:02:29.650> comes<00:02:30.790> in<00:02:31.790> like<00:02:32.150> this<00:02:32.359> and

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
kind of collapses you can then take

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:45.599 
kind of collapses you can then take
these<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.980> bring<00:02:36.980> them<00:02:37.430> through<00:02:41.650> like<00:02:42.650> this

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.190 

that<00:02:57.580> has<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.790> tendency<00:02:58.270> of<00:02:58.300> breaking<00:02:58.930> but

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
that has a tendency of breaking but

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.540 
that has a tendency of breaking but
nevertheless<00:02:59.530> you're<00:02:59.980> going<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.220> bring<00:03:00.400> this

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
nevertheless you're going to bring this

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.980 
nevertheless you're going to bring this
back<00:03:01.200> take<00:03:02.200> this<00:03:02.350> whole<00:03:02.530> section<00:03:02.920> bring<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:03.550> up

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
back take this whole section bring it up

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.860 
back take this whole section bring it up
this<00:03:04.990> part<00:03:05.410> here<00:03:05.819> will<00:03:06.819> come<00:03:07.090> through<00:03:07.569> and

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
this part here will come through and

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.990 
this part here will come through and
become<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.830> head<00:03:11.370> these<00:03:12.370> will<00:03:12.730> become<00:03:12.880> the

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
become the head these will become the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.660 
become the head these will become the
legs<00:03:13.120> obviously<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:14.470> just<00:03:14.650> collapse<00:03:15.400> those

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
legs obviously you just collapse those

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:29.880 
legs obviously you just collapse those
in<00:03:18.330> then<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:23.380> arms<00:03:25.050> come<00:03:26.050> out<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:28.650> this<00:03:29.650> whole

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
in then the arms come out and this whole

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:38.820 
in then the arms come out and this whole
section<00:03:32.010> collapses<00:03:33.010> in<00:03:33.190> on<00:03:33.400> itself

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.960 

and<00:03:38.920> there<00:03:39.610> you<00:03:39.760> have<00:03:39.790> sideswipe<00:03:41.190> in<00:03:42.190> his

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
and there you have sideswipe in his

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.530 
and there you have sideswipe in his
robot<00:03:43.390> mode<00:03:44.520> so<00:03:45.520> here<00:03:45.730> we<00:03:45.850> have<00:03:46.030> dark<00:03:46.330> of<00:03:46.480> the

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
robot mode so here we have dark of the

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.610 
robot mode so here we have dark of the
Moon<00:03:46.660> sideswipes<00:03:47.430> robot<00:03:48.430> mode<00:03:49.140> now<00:03:50.140> the<00:03:50.200> first

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
Moon sideswipes robot mode now the first

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.070 
Moon sideswipes robot mode now the first
thing<00:03:50.830> you'll<00:03:51.070> notice<00:03:51.250> is<00:03:51.700> that<00:03:51.790> he's<00:03:52.690> got<00:03:52.930> a

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
thing you'll notice is that he's got a

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.960 
thing you'll notice is that he's got a
lack<00:03:53.440> of<00:03:53.710> swords<00:03:55.440> his<00:03:56.440> swords<00:03:56.830> have<00:03:57.700> to<00:03:57.850> be

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
lack of swords his swords have to be

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.370 
lack of swords his swords have to be
removed<00:03:58.300> for<00:03:58.480> transformation

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
removed for transformation

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.940 
removed for transformation
but<00:03:59.680> being<00:04:00.190> weapons<00:04:00.730> they<00:04:00.970> are<00:04:01.090> accessories

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
but being weapons they are accessories

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.190 
but being weapons they are accessories
so<00:04:02.950> in<00:04:03.220> my<00:04:03.340> eyes<00:04:03.490> that's<00:04:03.760> really<00:04:04.390> not<00:04:04.720> too<00:04:05.170> much

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
so in my eyes that's really not too much

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.450 
so in my eyes that's really not too much
of<00:04:05.590> a<00:04:05.680> problem<00:04:06.720> anyway<00:04:07.920> besides<00:04:08.920> they're<00:04:09.340> only

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
of a problem anyway besides they're only

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.770 
of a problem anyway besides they're only
one<00:04:10.090> piece<00:04:10.480> so<00:04:11.260> that<00:04:12.250> also<00:04:12.460> adds<00:04:12.760> to<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.420> fact

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
one piece so that also adds to the fact

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.370 
one piece so that also adds to the fact
that<00:04:13.900> I<00:04:14.020> don't<00:04:14.140> care<00:04:14.440> too<00:04:14.950> much<00:04:15.600> now<00:04:16.600> this<00:04:16.750> is<00:04:16.959> a

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
that I don't care too much now this is a

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.140 
that I don't care too much now this is a
piece<00:04:18.100> that's<00:04:18.280> getting<00:04:18.580> on<00:04:18.670> the<00:04:18.760> older<00:04:19.120> side

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
piece that's getting on the older side

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.640 
piece that's getting on the older side
it<00:04:19.720> might<00:04:19.959> be<00:04:20.109> a<00:04:20.140> little<00:04:20.290> hard<00:04:20.560> to<00:04:20.680> find<00:04:20.980> but<00:04:22.650> it

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
it might be a little hard to find but it

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.220 
it might be a little hard to find but it
fits<00:04:24.490> right<00:04:24.880> into<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.270> back<00:04:25.480> of<00:04:25.510> this<00:04:25.900> piece

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
fits right into the back of this piece

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.180 
fits right into the back of this piece
here<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:28.090> makes<00:04:28.330> a<00:04:28.510> pretty<00:04:28.840> nice<00:04:29.050> sword<00:04:29.830> on

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
here and makes a pretty nice sword on

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.130 
here and makes a pretty nice sword on
the<00:04:30.400> back<00:04:30.640> of<00:04:30.820> his<00:04:30.970> arm<00:04:33.420> so<00:04:34.420> yeah<00:04:34.660> that<00:04:34.900> doesn't

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
the back of his arm so yeah that doesn't

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.330 
the back of his arm so yeah that doesn't
look<00:04:35.290> too<00:04:35.530> bad<00:04:37.080> anyway<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.260> really<00:04:39.010> like<00:04:39.190> this

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
look too bad anyway I really like this

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.630 
look too bad anyway I really like this
robot<00:04:39.700> mode<00:04:39.910> um<00:04:40.410> it's<00:04:41.410> got<00:04:41.620> some<00:04:41.950> huge

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
robot mode um it's got some huge

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.540 
robot mode um it's got some huge
inaccuracies<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:44.290> backpack<00:04:44.919> here<00:04:45.130> is<00:04:45.340> pretty

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
inaccuracies the backpack here is pretty

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.480 
inaccuracies the backpack here is pretty
much<00:04:45.640> the<00:04:45.820> entire<00:04:46.090> front<00:04:46.390> of<00:04:46.419> the<00:04:46.510> car<00:04:46.720> and

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
much the entire front of the car and

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.440 
much the entire front of the car and
obviously<00:04:48.490> these<00:04:48.700> wheels<00:04:48.970> are<00:04:49.180> supposed<00:04:49.419> to

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
obviously these wheels are supposed to

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.030 
obviously these wheels are supposed to
be<00:04:49.570> on<00:04:49.660> his<00:04:49.810> arms<00:04:50.290> I<00:04:51.720> kind<00:04:52.720> of<00:04:52.780> see<00:04:52.990> them<00:04:53.230> as<00:04:53.410> his

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
be on his arms I kind of see them as his

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.570 
be on his arms I kind of see them as his
door<00:04:54.910> wings<00:04:55.210> they<00:04:56.169> they<00:04:56.410> vaguely<00:04:56.800> resemble

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
door wings they they vaguely resemble

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.930 
door wings they they vaguely resemble
wings<00:04:57.850> in<00:04:58.240> a<00:04:58.419> way<00:04:59.130> but<00:05:00.130> obviously<00:05:00.280> that's<00:05:00.790> just

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
wings in a way but obviously that's just

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.020 
wings in a way but obviously that's just
an<00:05:01.210> excuse<00:05:01.720> and<00:05:02.020> it's<00:05:02.320> a<00:05:02.530> blank<00:05:03.160> blatant

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
an excuse and it's a blank blatant

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:11.360 
an excuse and it's a blank blatant
inaccuracy<00:05:04.919> unfortunately<00:05:06.030> but<00:05:09.780> he's<00:05:10.780> got

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
inaccuracy unfortunately but he's got

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.030 
inaccuracy unfortunately but he's got

his wheel feet these knee joints are

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.159 
his wheel feet these knee joints are
just<00:05:15.460> two<00:05:15.910> Clips<00:05:16.270> connected<00:05:16.750> with<00:05:16.870> a<00:05:16.900> bit<00:05:17.140> of
