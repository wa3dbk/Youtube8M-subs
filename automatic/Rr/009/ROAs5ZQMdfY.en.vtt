00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.079
 rather versatile but 0 good weather 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.969
 well the rays aop objective 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.020
 local besides related to this and 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.700
 from the drawings that there is kyle 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.189
 smg but very versatile level of 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.360
 smg lap clear objectives 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.020

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.170
 jealous of assets and we invest 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.840
