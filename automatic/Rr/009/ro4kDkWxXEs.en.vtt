00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
didn't really Ernie okay i did a good

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.850 
didn't really Ernie okay i did a good
race<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:15.960> that's<00:01:16.080> not<00:01:16.170> where<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.380> finished<00:01:16.770> I

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
race but that's not where I finished I

finish 12 or 13 so it's hard for me to
accept<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.860> where<00:01:20.850> I'm<00:01:20.970> finishing<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.479> don't

factory Honda so now we have really the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.160 
factory Honda so now we have really the
opportunity<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.090> make<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.450> I've<00:01:39.540> got<00:01:39.570> two<00:01:39.930> year

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170

opportunity to make it I've got two year
deal<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:41.009> think<00:01:41.729> that's<00:01:41.909> my<00:01:42.090> biggest

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
deal and I think that's my biggest

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.270 
deal and I think that's my biggest
opportunity<00:01:43.079> I've<00:01:43.110> ever<00:01:43.259> had<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.649> my<00:01:43.680> life<00:01:43.799> you

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.859 
opportunity I've ever had in my life you
know<00:01:44.310> with<00:01:44.579> motu<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.030> had<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.420> option<00:01:45.600> I

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
know with motu I had that option I

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.539 
know with motu I had that option I
showed<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.439> could<00:01:46.649> do<00:01:46.770> okay<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.130> didn't<00:01:47.340> win<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
showed I could do okay we didn't win the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.280 
showed I could do okay we didn't win the
championship<00:01:48.060> but<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.329> shoulder<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.840> had<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
championship but I shoulder I had the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.889 
championship but I shoulder I had the
possibility<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.820> think<00:01:51.479> if<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.689> can

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
possibility to do and I think if I can

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.899 
possibility to do and I think if I can
do<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.320> MotoGP<00:01:52.890> would<00:01:53.070> be<00:01:53.220> amazing<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:53.790> we

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
do it in MotoGP would be amazing but we

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.580 
do it in MotoGP would be amazing but we
need<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.119> do<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.329> right<00:01:54.540> steps<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.140> work<00:01:55.259> hard

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
need to do the right steps and work hard

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.020 
need to do the right steps and work hard
and<00:01:55.829> slowly<00:01:56.130> build<00:01:56.399> ourselves

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
and slowly build ourselves

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.060 
and slowly build ourselves
and<00:01:57.570> two<00:01:57.840> years<00:01:58.080> it<00:01:58.380> takes<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.680> crash<00:01:58.890> or

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
and two years it takes a crash or

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.200 
and two years it takes a crash or
doesn't<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.430> because<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.790> first<00:02:00.000> year<00:02:00.180> you

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
doesn't it because the first year you

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.850 
doesn't it because the first year you
don't<00:02:00.390> have<00:02:00.510> to<00:02:00.600> go<00:02:00.720> up<00:02:00.780> there<00:02:00.960> obviously<00:02:01.470> want

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
don't have to go up there obviously want

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.560 
don't have to go up there obviously want
to<00:02:01.920> try<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.159> when<00:02:02.369> poachers<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.030> he<00:02:03.420> knew

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
to try it when poachers but he knew

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.330 
to try it when poachers but he knew
we've<00:02:03.750> got<00:02:03.869> another<00:02:04.049> year<00:02:04.229> behind<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.220> do

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
we've got another year behind you to do

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.310 
we've got another year behind you to do
to<00:02:05.970> make<00:02:06.150> it<00:02:06.180> development<00:02:06.720> with<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.110> bike

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
to make it development with this bike

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.320 
to make it development with this bike
yeah<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.830> mean<00:02:08.130> it<00:02:08.250> depends<00:02:08.610> because<00:02:08.759> Marcus

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
yeah I mean it depends because Marcus

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.910 
yeah I mean it depends because Marcus
came<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.899> he<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:10.170> set<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.440> bar<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:10.679> high

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
came in and he just set the bar so high

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.370 
came in and he just set the bar so high
so<00:02:11.400> now<00:02:11.580> it's<00:02:11.790> kind<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.120> like<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.990> don't<00:02:13.200> have

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
so now it's kind of like you don't have

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.260 
so now it's kind of like you don't have
that<00:02:13.530> one<00:02:13.590> year<00:02:13.950> leeway<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.520> had<00:02:14.640> my<00:02:14.670> one<00:02:15.060> year

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
that one year leeway I had my one year

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.030 
that one year leeway I had my one year
this<00:02:15.510> year<00:02:15.569> but<00:02:15.959> people<00:02:16.709> aren't<00:02:16.860> going<00:02:16.980> to

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690

asking<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.959> lot<00:02:28.110> but<00:02:28.170> that's<00:02:28.560> what<00:02:28.709> i<00:02:28.739> believe

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
asking a lot but that's what i believe

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.540 
but I can do would you say that you were
free<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.709> pressure<00:02:31.950> then<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.280> all<00:02:32.400> eyes

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
free in the pressure then that all eyes

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.520 
free in the pressure then that all eyes
will<00:02:32.790> be<00:02:32.850> on<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.060> going<00:02:33.360> what<00:02:34.080> it's<00:02:34.260> got<00:02:34.410> red

and what can you do what can you do on

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.060 
and what can you do what can you do on
this<00:02:36.060> factory<00:02:36.540> Honda<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:37.080> mean<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.680> pressure

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
this factory Honda I mean it is pressure

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.420 
this factory Honda I mean it is pressure
but<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.610> look<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.450> more<00:02:39.840> like<00:02:40.800> confidence

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
but I look it's more like confidence

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.820 
but I look it's more like confidence
that<00:02:41.610> people<00:02:41.970> think<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.630> can<00:02:42.870> do<00:02:43.019> it<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.350> don't

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
that people think I can do it I don't

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.590 
that people think I can do it I don't
take<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.160> negative<00:02:44.580> like<00:02:44.790> ask<00:02:44.970> pressure<00:02:45.300> what

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
take it negative like ask pressure what

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.210 
take it negative like ask pressure what
can<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:45.870> do<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.140> can<00:02:46.260> do<00:02:46.410> for<00:02:46.860> me<00:02:46.890> as<00:02:47.130> the
