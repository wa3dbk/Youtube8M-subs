that's kind of a proportionate I'll

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.619 
that's kind of a proportionate I'll
usually<00:03:23.400> use<00:03:23.849> when<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.030> make<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:24.359> you<00:03:24.480> know<00:03:24.510> if

you want to kind of adjust it and play
that<00:03:26.129> you<00:03:26.220> can<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:27.480> think<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:27.989> order<00:03:28.230> is<00:03:28.290> really

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
that you can I think the order is really

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.629 
that you can I think the order is really
crucial<00:03:28.650> here<00:03:28.980> just<00:03:29.160> because<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.430> kind<00:03:29.579> of

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
crucial here just because it kind of

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.059 
crucial here just because it kind of
gives<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:29.879> that<00:03:30.260> sweet<00:03:31.260> citrus<00:03:31.680> note<00:03:31.859> that

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
gives it that sweet citrus note that

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.789 
gives it that sweet citrus note that
like<00:03:32.160> lemon<00:03:32.549> would<00:03:32.730> be<00:03:32.879> more<00:03:33.180> exert<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:34.049> more

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
like lemon would be more exert in more

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:35.960 
like lemon would be more exert in more
citrusy<00:03:35.250> whereas<00:03:35.489> this<00:03:35.579> kind<00:03:35.760> of<00:03:35.790> gives<00:03:35.940> a

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
citrusy whereas this kind of gives a

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.300 
citrusy whereas this kind of gives a
little<00:03:36.090> bit<00:03:36.180> sweetness<00:03:36.599> to<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:37.010> now<00:03:38.010> listens

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
little bit sweetness to it now listens

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.819
