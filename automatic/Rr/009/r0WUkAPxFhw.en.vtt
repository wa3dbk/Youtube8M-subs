00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.400
 Yes, I think not only for me 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.960
 wrinkles around the eyes 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.690
 Why is this a painful topic for me? 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.369
 tell a little bit share with you my 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.779
 history 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.900
 I got wrinkles very early 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.150
 somewhere in 22 23 years and you understand 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.269
 that this is absolutely not yet age 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.099
 there was a young girl and looking at herself 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.630
 in the mirror i was horrified i only 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.160
 I saw these wrinkles I am very 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.260
 I was upset and very worried at 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.219
 applying makeup situation only 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.290
 worsened wrinkles and in general 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:46.350
 turned into a harmonica at the imposition 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.960
 powder or foundation and the situation 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.610
 turned out not to be catastrophic then I 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.949
 very worried and not looking of course 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.260
 a means of solving your problem at that 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.730
 time lived in Belarus and of course 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.359
 took advantage of the whole arsenal 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.479
 Belarusian cosmetics is Belita-vitax 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.380
 as I remember it were chamomile cream 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:14.430
 sea ​​buckthorn and many others but they are not 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.350
 brought the expected result I don't want 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.369
 say that Belarusian cosmetics are bad 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.790
 just the same and I don’t think so much 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.119
 worthy products of those creams which i 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.000
 enjoyed they moisturized they attached 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.700
 skin elasticity and tone and more healthy 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.310
 the kind of results were but they did not struggle with 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.680
 my main problem is wrinkles in 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.020
 at the age of 23 I came to america and 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.460
 Of course, the choice of care products for 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.979
 skin around the eyes 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.409
 It has expanded this to me 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.930
 period until i live here it's three years i 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.450
 I think that the lion's share of all 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.570
 presented cosmetic products i 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.829
 put on her face and in particular on 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.689
 eye area 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.090
 but it did not bring any result 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.890
 there were such moments when it seemed to me 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.630
 that the situation is only getting worse and 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.700
 what I just did not try it 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.190
 or organic and inorganic creams 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.120
 it was all kinds of butter it was 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.300
 Mass market cream to dust expensive but not 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.519
 nothing yielded results i'm at all 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.500
 was even desperate 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.870
 interesting situation when at work i 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.849
 you went out to buy a cup of coffee 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.349
 back to my workplace and me 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.910
 joins my friend 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.050
 and we walk along the corridors 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.700
 tells me some funny 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.080
 history of course at this time and 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.540
 smiled laugh 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.400
 and my wrinkles are becoming more visible 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.360
 then he turns to me and says 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.310
 Katya 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.810

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:46.080

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.930

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.630

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:44.100
 songs of praise is a wonderful tool 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.079
 it is a tool that gives results and 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.200
 noticeable result the result of which 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.359
 visible not only to me but also to others 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.480
 here 50 milliliters 50 milliliters to me 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.430
 enough for about five months and 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.040
 I did not put money at all 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.139
 sorry and i was waiting for the result i wanted to 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.790
 I got it for sure and I put a huge 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.230
 amount of funds first first 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.040
 turn on the area around the eyes and then 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.099
 already on all face 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.599
 although the consultant at the store told 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.319
 that's just enough for me 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.079
 droplets 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:16.709
 to cover the whole face and no longer 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:18.359
 It is required here and despite the fact that it is 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.359
 serum which is after itself 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.190
 involves the application of moisturizer 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.560
 night cream moisturizing night cream 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.470
 I don't need it because I am absolutely 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.789
 happy with the result that does it 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.139
 agent is serum 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:36.270
 that is, despite the fact that this means 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.639
 not cheap so let's say you can 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.949
 save on moisturizing night cream 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.500
 for face 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:46.080
 this is no advertising of this 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.330
 means i make this video to 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.849
 share with girls girls 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:55.889
 women find in my decision 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:58.320
 problems i think that so many 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.180
 women are now looking for the perfect 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.000
 facilities 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.190
 look at this serum if you 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.380
 know the author's beauty pedi or bible 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.229
 beauty as it is also called runner paulo 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.530
 then in her review of this remedy she 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:15.960
 gave him an estimate of the year that the transfer 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:19.970
 means well also she has a rating 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:23.250
 dps what do you mean the best means 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.830
 but why does she give him an estimate 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.060
 good she explains it there in her 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.270
 review 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.639
 and explain the reasons for this decision but I 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.680
 I think that the reasons she is there 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:39.990
 indicates insignificant it does not 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:42.090
 spoils the quality of this product so i 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.020
 I am sure that this product works I see 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.020
 results and 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.560

 so far but simply they have become less 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.420
 visible and skin gained elasticity and 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:11.390
 elasticity she became more hydrated 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:14.720
 she is in good shape I see results and 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:16.910
