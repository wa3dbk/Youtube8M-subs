now this displaying right here it's not

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.240 
now this displaying right here it's not
an<00:00:06.629> actual<00:00:06.779> game<00:00:07.109> like<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.500> said<00:00:07.740> it's<00:00:07.919> just<00:00:08.010> a

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
an actual game like I said it's just a

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.610 
an actual game like I said it's just a
pokedex<00:00:08.670> but<00:00:09.300> it<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.570> developed<00:00:10.080> officially

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
pokedex but it is developed officially

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.560 
pokedex but it is developed officially
by<00:00:10.800> Nintendo<00:00:11.400> which<00:00:11.670> means<00:00:11.940> they<00:00:12.179> might<00:00:12.360> have

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
by Nintendo which means they might have

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.870 
by Nintendo which means they might have
plans<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:13.200> release<00:00:13.320> games<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.340> future<00:00:14.519> so

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
plans to release games in the future so

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.460 
plans to release games in the future so
that's<00:00:14.969> definitely<00:00:15.179> really<00:00:15.509> cool<00:00:15.809> one

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
that's definitely really cool one

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.769 
that's definitely really cool one
another<00:00:17.010> downside<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:18.090> it's<00:00:18.660> only

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
another downside is that it's only

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.200 
another downside is that it's only
available<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.410> Japan<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:20.130> if<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:21.000> actually

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
available in Japan so if you actually

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.250 
available in Japan so if you actually
want<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.510> get<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.750> you're<00:00:21.900> gonna<00:00:22.020> have<00:00:22.170> to

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
want to get this you're gonna have to

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.109 
want to get this you're gonna have to
give<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.529> Japanese<00:00:23.340> gift<00:00:23.609> card<00:00:23.850> buy<00:00:24.060> it

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
give that Japanese gift card buy it

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.420 
give that Japanese gift card buy it
online<00:00:24.330> make<00:00:25.230> an<00:00:25.350> account<00:00:25.590> do<00:00:25.920> all<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.189> stuff

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
online make an account do all the stuff

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.890 
online make an account do all the stuff
it's<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.789> lot<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.150> effort<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.689> wouldn't

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
it's a lot of effort so I wouldn't

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.929 
it's a lot of effort so I wouldn't
really<00:00:28.050> recommend<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.740> unless<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.550> already

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
really recommend it unless you already

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.260 
really recommend it unless you already
live<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.420> Japan<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.050> here<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.380> can<00:00:31.529> see<00:00:32.270> you

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.370 
can view all the Pokemon in 3d it

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
actually is pretty cool to detail and

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.369 
actually is pretty cool to detail and
you<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:38.070> know<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.460> zoom<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:39.020> spin<00:00:40.020> around

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
you can know you can zoom in spin around

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.040 
you can know you can zoom in spin around
and<00:00:41.070> everything<00:00:41.969> like<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.840> start

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
and everything like that and you start

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.990 
and everything like that and you start
with<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.320> few<00:00:43.469> Pokemon<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> actual

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
with a few Pokemon so the actual

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.810 
with a few Pokemon so the actual
application<00:00:45.600> costs<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.590> 170<00:00:47.430> yen<00:00:47.550> which<00:00:47.789> is

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
application costs you 170 yen which is

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.680 
application costs you 170 yen which is
around<00:00:48.149> $2<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.110> an<00:00:49.530> additional<00:00:50.070> $6<00:00:50.850> USD<00:00:51.360> I

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
around $2 and an additional $6 USD I

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.069 
around $2 and an additional $6 USD I
believe<00:00:52.289> 500<00:00:53.010> yen<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.640> all<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.600> packs<00:00:54.840> and

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
believe 500 yen for all the packs and

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.040 
believe 500 yen for all the packs and
the<00:00:55.140> packs<00:00:55.350> include<00:00:56.449> basically<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> regions

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the packs include basically the regions

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.869 
the packs include basically the regions
of<00:00:58.199> Pokemon<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.770> only<00:00:58.890> start<00:00:59.160> out<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.820> a

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
of Pokemon so you only start out with a

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.900 
of Pokemon so you only start out with a
few<00:01:00.329> select<00:01:00.750> right<00:01:00.989> here<00:01:01.020> now<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:01.829> can<00:01:02.190> switch

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
few select right here now we can switch

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.600 
few select right here now we can switch
it<00:01:03.030> off<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.480> can<00:01:03.660> see<00:01:03.899> some<00:01:04.830> cool<00:01:05.040> views<00:01:05.280> of

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
it off so you can see some cool views of

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.929 
it off so you can see some cool views of
some<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.310> defaults<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.610> get<00:01:08.820> right

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
some of the defaults that you get right

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.109 
some of the defaults that you get right

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.270 
here definitely a lot cooler the iPad
experience<00:01:12.360> opposed<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.920> iPhone

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
experience opposed to the iPhone

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.870 
experience opposed to the iPhone
experience<00:01:14.540> which<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:16.049> briefly<00:01:16.470> show<00:01:16.830> you

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.590 
that I have on my iphone right here you
can<00:01:19.770> see<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.159> basically<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> smaller<00:01:21.390> version

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
can see just basically a smaller version

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.140 
can see just basically a smaller version
but<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.049> I've<00:01:22.140> had<00:01:22.640> that<00:01:23.640> pet<00:01:23.850> version

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
but the I've had that pet version

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.300 
but the I've had that pet version
definitely<00:01:24.450> looks<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.630> lot<00:01:24.780> cooler<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.470> if<00:01:26.130> you
