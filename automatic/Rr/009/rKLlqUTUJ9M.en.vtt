cage the roof of it brought it down

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.320 
cage the roof of it brought it down
tight<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.920> banana<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.789> was<00:00:29.939> high<00:00:30.119> enough

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
tight a banana on it it was high enough

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.569 
tight a banana on it it was high enough
so<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.830> none<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.009> monkeys<00:00:32.340> could

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
so that none of the monkeys could

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.560 
so that none of the monkeys could
actually<00:00:33.200> reach<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.500> banana<00:00:35.300> then<00:00:36.300> he<00:00:36.420> took

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
actually reach this banana then he took

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.840 
actually reach this banana then he took
a<00:00:36.630> pair<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.899> stairs<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.559> slit<00:00:38.460> him<00:00:38.579> underneath

a pair of stairs and slit him underneath

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.430 
a pair of stairs and slit him underneath
the<00:00:38.969> banana<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.600> give<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.840> monkeys<00:00:40.200> easy

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
the banana to give the monkeys easy

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.260 
the banana to give the monkeys easy
access<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:43.129> then<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.550> third<00:00:44.730> thing<00:00:44.789> he<00:00:45.059> did

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
was he put a sprinkler system all around

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.600 
was he put a sprinkler system all around
the<00:00:48.420> roof<00:00:48.860> so<00:00:49.860> he<00:00:50.010> could<00:00:50.160> spray<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> entire

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the roof so he could spray the entire

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.979 
the roof so he could spray the entire
cage<00:00:51.180> with<00:00:51.690> ice-cold<00:00:52.170> water<00:00:53.780> so<00:00:54.780> when

cage with ice-cold water so when

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.600 
cage with ice-cold water so when
everything<00:00:55.320> was<00:00:55.410> ready<00:00:55.680> he<00:00:56.100> took<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.430> five

everything was ready he took the five
monkeys<00:00:57.030> put<00:00:57.719> him<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.989> cage<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.530> sure

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
monkeys put him in the cage and sure

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.970 
monkeys put him in the cage and sure
enough<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.910> wasn't<00:01:00.090> very<00:01:00.270> long<00:01:00.390> before<00:01:00.980> some

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
enough it wasn't very long before some

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.250 
enough it wasn't very long before some

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
of them were going up two steps to get

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.940 
of them were going up two steps to get
the<00:01:04.409> banana<00:01:04.739> as<00:01:05.189> soon<00:01:05.549> as<00:01:05.640> they<00:01:05.790> hit<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.030> steps

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
the banana as soon as they hit the steps

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.060 
the banana as soon as they hit the steps
ice-cold<00:01:07.950> water<00:01:08.070> sprayed<00:01:08.640> all<00:01:08.820> five<00:01:09.030> monkeys

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
ice-cold water sprayed all five monkeys

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.450 
ice-cold water sprayed all five monkeys
well<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.159> was<00:01:11.250> quite<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> calamity<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:13.460> it

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
didn't take very long for the monkeys to

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.899 
didn't take very long for the monkeys to
learn<00:01:16.229> any<00:01:16.530> time<00:01:16.830> they<00:01:17.009> hit<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.369> step<00:01:17.640> they

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
learn any time they hit that step they

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.039 
learn any time they hit that step they
were<00:01:17.970> going<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.150> get<00:01:18.299> sprayed<00:01:18.479> with<00:01:18.750> ice-cold

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
this monkey and they do it again and

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.470 
this monkey and they do it again and
again<00:02:05.500> until<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:06.100> monkey<00:02:06.430> learns<00:02:06.640> that<00:02:07.300> you

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
again until the monkey learns that you

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.550 
again until the monkey learns that you
don't<00:02:07.660> go<00:02:07.810> near<00:02:08.020> those<00:02:08.170> steps<00:02:09.930> now<00:02:10.930> he<00:02:11.380> did

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
don't go near those steps now he did

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.130 
don't go near those steps now he did
that<00:02:11.910> with<00:02:12.910> another<00:02:13.180> monkey<00:02:13.540> he<00:02:13.630> took<00:02:13.810> one<00:02:13.960> out

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
that with another monkey he took one out

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.110 
that with another monkey he took one out
that<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:14.980> experienced<00:02:15.460> the<00:02:15.520> water<00:02:15.730> but

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
that it experienced the water but

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.370 
that it experienced the water but
another<00:02:16.360> monkey<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:16.990> had<00:02:17.140> never

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
another monkey and that had never

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.510 
another monkey and that had never
experienced<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.040> water<00:02:19.620> sure<00:02:20.620> enough<00:02:20.890> none

experienced the water sure enough none
of<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.700> monkeys<00:02:22.030> went<00:02:22.330> near<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.690> steps

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
of the monkeys went near the steps

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.320 
of the monkeys went near the steps
except<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.710> new<00:02:23.860> one<00:02:24.040> as<00:02:24.640> soon<00:02:24.940> as<00:02:25.030> he<00:02:25.150> hit<00:02:25.300> the

except the new one as soon as he hit the

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.660 
except the new one as soon as he hit the
steps<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.840> weapon<00:02:26.110> get<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.350> banana<00:02:26.680> all<00:02:26.890> four

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
steps to weapon get the banana all four

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.030 
steps to weapon get the banana all four
monkeys<00:02:28.090> again<00:02:28.450> jumped<00:02:29.200> on<00:02:29.320> this<00:02:29.500> new<00:02:29.680> monkey

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
monkeys again jumped on this new monkey

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.750 
monkeys again jumped on this new monkey
and<00:02:30.220> beat<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.790> crap<00:02:30.910> out<00:02:31.210> of<00:02:31.240> him<00:02:32.580> now<00:02:33.580> he's

and beat the crap out of him now he's

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.760 
and beat the crap out of him now he's
kind<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.090> reeling<00:02:34.480> thinking<00:02:35.050> what<00:02:35.260> is<00:02:35.440> going

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
kind of reeling thinking what is going

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.460 
kind of reeling thinking what is going
on<00:02:35.890> because<00:02:36.580> he<00:02:36.790> doesn't<00:02:37.180> get<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.600> nobody's

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
on because he doesn't get it nobody's

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.080 
on because he doesn't get it nobody's
going<00:02:38.650> for<00:02:38.860> this<00:02:38.950> banana<00:02:39.370> it's<00:02:39.700> right<00:02:40.030> there

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
going for this banana it's right there

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.130 
going for this banana it's right there
and<00:02:41.520> Harry<00:02:42.520> repeated<00:02:43.209> this<00:02:43.390> till<00:02:43.660> all<00:02:43.900> five

we're out of the cage and he introduced
another<00:02:50.890> monkey<00:02:52.770> now<00:02:53.770> that<00:02:54.459> monkey<00:02:54.910> was<00:02:55.090> the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
another monkey now that monkey was the

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.300 
another monkey now that monkey was the
only<00:02:55.660> one<00:02:55.959> who<00:02:56.530> when<00:02:56.680> he<00:02:56.739> saw<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:56.980> step

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
only one who when he saw the step

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.729 
only one who when he saw the step
started<00:02:57.760> up<00:02:57.910> it<00:02:58.120> all<00:02:58.300> four<00:02:59.020> monkeys<00:02:59.470> even

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
started up it all four monkeys even

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.260 
started up it all four monkeys even
though<00:02:59.860> had<00:03:00.070> they<00:03:00.220> had<00:03:00.250> never<00:03:00.580> experienced

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
though had they had never experienced

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.040 
though had they had never experienced
the<00:03:01.360> water<00:03:02.310> attacked<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:04.120> one<00:03:04.420> monkey<00:03:04.870> and

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
the water attacked that one monkey and

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.680 
the water attacked that one monkey and
beat<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.739> holy<00:03:05.890> crap<00:03:06.250> out<00:03:06.430> of<00:03:06.489> him<00:03:06.700> again<00:03:07.420> and

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
beat the holy crap out of him again and

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.190 
beat the holy crap out of him again and
again<00:03:07.989> until<00:03:08.260> he<00:03:08.590> stopped<00:03:09.480> now<00:03:10.480> never<00:03:10.810> having

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
again until he stopped now never having

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.620 
again until he stopped now never having
experienced<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:11.950> water<00:03:12.340> why<00:03:13.239> were<00:03:13.480> they

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
experienced the water why were they

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
experienced the water why were they
behaving<00:03:14.050> that<00:03:14.230> way<00:03:15.390> because<00:03:16.390> that's<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.500> way

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
behaving that way because that's the way

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.699 
behaving that way because that's the way
it<00:03:17.800> is<00:03:17.830> in<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.280> cage<00:03:18.840> they<00:03:19.840> had<00:03:20.080> learned<00:03:20.380> a

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
it is in that cage they had learned a

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.479 
it is in that cage they had learned a
pattern<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.610> we're<00:03:21.940> repeating<00:03:22.300> that<00:03:22.600> pattern

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
pattern and we're repeating that pattern

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.340 
pattern and we're repeating that pattern
over<00:03:24.489> and<00:03:24.519> over<00:03:24.760> again<00:03:25.239> and<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:26.230> would

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
over and over again and it would

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.270 
over and over again and it would
continue<00:03:26.739> on<00:03:27.100> forever<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:28.980> they<00:03:29.980> don't<00:03:30.130> know

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
continue on forever and they don't know

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.979 
continue on forever and they don't know
why<00:03:30.610> they're<00:03:30.640> doing<00:03:30.910> it<00:03:31.239> they<00:03:31.600> just<00:03:31.810> know<00:03:31.959> that

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
why they're doing it they just know that

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.140 
why they're doing it they just know that
they're<00:03:32.350> doing<00:03:32.680> it

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
they're doing it

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.630 
they're doing it
well<00:03:34.079> a<00:03:34.110> lot<00:03:34.409> happens<00:03:34.860> in<00:03:34.980> life<00:03:35.189> the<00:03:35.370> same<00:03:35.610> way

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640
