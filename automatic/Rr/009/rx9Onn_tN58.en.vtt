00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello my loves welcome to a moment 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.000
 with yumilka here in your morning and how to 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.740
 I said I have my Pandora's box and that is 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.990
 today we are going to work a little bit what 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.120
 it's the romantic part of the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.210
 Tenderness of what many call out there 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.220
 what would I think 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.920
 definitely feeds the relationship to 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.140
 me to say corny but what they 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.439
 I bring today you will surprise gross 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.660
 bunnymen today I am in the note of the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.790
 balloons and is that look what I have for 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.180
 here what we are going to need for this 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.890
 we need transparent balloons 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.020
 now they see them half white but 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.170
 when the inflates are going to be transparent 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.719
 I want them to use whatever they want as 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.379
 the imagination is of in this case I'm going 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.199
 to use chocolatito can use 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.930
 rose petals that are super cute and 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.410
 super romantics and over there until a 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.020
 Teddy 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:04.559
 we grabbed our fingers little by little 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.400
 we open and look what we have open not 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:13.260
 let's go ok and grab the chocolatito 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.260
 we put it see you here we let go 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.630
 we see it the flower petals what 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.630
 we introduce and cared for 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.680
 I have everything saved I saved it to 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.300
 wait when I'm going to use it 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.460
 I can prepare a long time before 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.550
 use it but remember that not much 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.920
 for the theme of roses up to 30 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:46.309
 from pandora all 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:46.309
 [Music] 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:55.850
 Y 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.850
 look at what tenderness for bouquets 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.720
 the idea is that they remain on the bed 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.870
 look though you already know there are 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.600
 here but here you do not know what there is 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.520
 Well here we will discover together 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.050
 admitted that inside if you put what 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.050
 you want surprise 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.110
 one 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.180
 and not 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.710
 [Music] 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.440
 and we are totally ready with the 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.810
 dim light waiting to receive the 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.920
 person that we love so much for that 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.200
 we put a candle for good lights and 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.870
 we have it and we have to give it something 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.460
 so you can exploit Lobitos 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.460
 they look very pretty and everything but the idea 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.150
 it did not work and I'm going 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.710
 is that she plays with her they can eat cloth 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.790
 chocolatito photo better as they give 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.480
 a needle does not 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.190
