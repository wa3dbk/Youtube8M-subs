terrible<00:01:57.000> that's<00:01:57.149> another<00:01:57.390> mapson<00:01:57.899> and

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
terrible that's another mapson and

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.590 
terrible that's another mapson and
graphics<00:01:58.799> are<00:01:58.950> two<00:01:59.130> separate<00:01:59.520> things<00:01:59.580> but<00:02:00.570> I

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
graphics are two separate things but I

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.210 
graphics are two separate things but I
even<00:02:00.780> mentioned<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.440> guys<00:02:01.590> over<00:02:01.890> Twitter

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
even mentioned to the guys over Twitter

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.090 
even mentioned to the guys over Twitter
that<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.670> might<00:02:03.299> have<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.560> gripes<00:02:04.560> with<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.890> maps

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
that I might have a gripes with the maps

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.889 
that I might have a gripes with the maps
in<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.369> game<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.479> wish<00:02:06.630> they<00:02:06.750> were<00:02:06.869> a

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
in this game and I wish they were a

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.040 
in this game and I wish they were a
little<00:02:06.960> bit<00:02:07.229> better<00:02:07.380> um<00:02:08.270> my<00:02:09.270> gripes<00:02:09.539> actually

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
little bit better um my gripes actually

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.430 
little bit better um my gripes actually
were<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.709> lack<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.209> flanking<00:02:12.209> routes<00:02:12.440> because

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
were the lack of flanking routes because

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.070 
were the lack of flanking routes because
you<00:02:14.040> got<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.250> remember<00:02:14.340> him<00:02:15.060> in<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.840> game<00:02:16.019> where

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
you got to remember him in a game where

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.309 
you got to remember him in a game where
everybody<00:02:16.739> can<00:02:16.890> see<00:02:16.950> through<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.370> map<00:02:18.319> the

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
everybody can see through the map the

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.160 
everybody can see through the map the
problem<00:02:19.739> with<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.690> with<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.810> map<00:02:21.989> design

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
problem with that is with the map design

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.860 
problem with that is with the map design
you<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.709> have<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.060> figure<00:02:24.060> out<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.299> way<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.569> have

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
you you have to figure out a way to have

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.449 
you you have to figure out a way to have
multiple<00:02:25.380> um<00:02:26.810> pass<00:02:27.980> passageways<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.160> get<00:02:29.310> to

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
multiple um pass passageways to get to

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.660 
multiple um pass passageways to get to
an<00:02:29.549> area<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.150> not<00:02:30.810> just<00:02:31.049> one<00:02:31.290> because<00:02:31.769> I<00:02:32.010> even

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
an area and not just one because I even

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.670 
an area and not just one because I even
to<00:02:32.850> because<00:02:33.750> if<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.930> guy<00:02:34.080> looks<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.410> his<00:02:34.470> visor

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
to because if a guy looks to his visor

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.170 
to because if a guy looks to his visor
see<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.040> guys<00:02:35.250> coming<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.760> it's<00:02:35.880> only<00:02:36.000> one

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
see the guys coming and it's only one

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.640 
see the guys coming and it's only one
way<00:02:36.330> in<00:02:36.360> all<00:02:36.750> he<00:02:36.870> has<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.019> do<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.230> wait<00:02:37.410> there

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
way in all he has to do is wait there

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.600 
way in all he has to do is wait there
because<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:38.010> know<00:02:38.130> there's<00:02:38.310> no<00:02:38.400> other<00:02:38.489> way

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
because you know there's no other way

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.550 
because you know there's no other way
you<00:02:38.670> can<00:02:38.819> flank<00:02:39.030> them<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.930> they<00:02:40.110> need<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.380> add

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
you can flank them so they need to add

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.699 
you can flank them so they need to add
in<00:02:40.890> my<00:02:41.040> opinion<00:02:41.370> maps<00:02:42.180> with<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.319> little<00:02:43.590> bit

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
in my opinion maps with a little bit

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.490 
in my opinion maps with a little bit
more<00:02:43.890> ways<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.640> flank<00:02:45.030> around<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.390> map<00:02:45.569> or<00:02:46.350> did

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
more ways to flank around the map or did

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.199 
more ways to flank around the map or did
you<00:02:46.560> get<00:02:46.739> just<00:02:47.130> different<00:02:47.610> ways<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.730> get<00:02:48.030> to

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
you get just different ways to get to

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.660 
you get just different ways to get to
areas<00:02:48.660> whether<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.380> be<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:50.160> know<00:02:50.280> having

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
areas whether it be you know having

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.580 
areas whether it be you know having
multiple<00:02:51.359> levels<00:02:51.720> up<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.109> down<00:02:52.260> where<00:02:52.530> you

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
multiple levels up and down where you

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.170 
multiple levels up and down where you
could<00:02:52.709> go<00:02:52.769> through<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.010> basement<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.579> top<00:02:53.820> or

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
could go through the basement the top or

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.599 
could go through the basement the top or
maybe<00:02:54.930> like<00:02:55.230> some<00:02:55.560> stairs<00:02:55.859> or<00:02:56.190> like<00:02:56.400> even

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
maybe like some stairs or like even

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.699 
maybe like some stairs or like even
little<00:02:57.060> portal<00:02:57.480> jumps<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.109> that<00:02:58.260> sounds<00:02:58.560> kind

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
little portal jumps and that sounds kind

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.560 
little portal jumps and that sounds kind
of<00:02:58.769> corny<00:02:58.920> but<00:02:59.280> something<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.209> know<00:03:00.329> or<00:03:00.540> even

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
of corny but something you know or even

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.930 
of corny but something you know or even
little<00:03:00.959> teleports<00:03:01.500> like<00:03:01.650> halo<00:03:01.980> had<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:02.850> know

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
little teleports like halo had you know

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.610 
little teleports like halo had you know
certain<00:03:03.269> maps<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:03.570> halo<00:03:03.600> they<00:03:04.019> had<00:03:04.140> them<00:03:04.290> TP

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
certain maps in halo they had them TP

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.370 
certain maps in halo they had them TP
spot<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.130> you<00:03:05.220> could<00:03:05.340> go<00:03:05.459> across<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.820> map<00:03:06.380> you

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
spot so you could go across the map you

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.509 
spot so you could go across the map you
know<00:03:07.470> even<00:03:07.620> something<00:03:07.950> like<00:03:08.070> that<00:03:08.340> maybe

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
know even something like that maybe

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.610 
know even something like that maybe
possibly<00:03:09.120> if<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.930> don't<00:03:10.109> want<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.320> if<00:03:10.500> you

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
possibly if you don't want to if you

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.960 
possibly if you don't want to if you
want<00:03:10.799> to<00:03:10.859> keep<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.070> same<00:03:11.250> map<00:03:11.459> design<00:03:11.670> but

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
want to keep the same map design but

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.280 
want to keep the same map design but
just<00:03:12.120> offer<00:03:12.269> people<00:03:12.540> different<00:03:12.930> ways<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.079> get

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
just offer people different ways to get

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.880 
just offer people different ways to get
around<00:03:13.910> but<00:03:14.910> um<00:03:15.140> but<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:16.170> think<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:16.500> would<00:03:16.739> be

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
around but um but I think that would be

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.289 
around but um but I think that would be
cool<00:03:17.130> you<00:03:17.489> know<00:03:17.579> what<00:03:17.730> actually<00:03:17.850> might<00:03:18.180> be

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
cool you know what actually might be

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.509 
cool you know what actually might be
cool<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.570> that<00:03:19.019> I<00:03:19.049> just<00:03:19.320> thought<00:03:19.470> about<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:20.459> I

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
cool to that I just thought about that I

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.849 
cool to that I just thought about that I
don't<00:03:20.760> think<00:03:20.940> any<00:03:21.060> other<00:03:21.150> game<00:03:21.450> has<00:03:21.690> two<00:03:22.650> piece

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
don't think any other game has two piece

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.330 
don't think any other game has two piece
uh<00:03:22.890> I<00:03:23.370> was<00:03:23.609> playing<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:23.970> lot<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.269> them<00:03:25.040> diablo<00:03:26.040> 3

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
uh I was playing a lot of them diablo 3

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.759 
uh I was playing a lot of them diablo 3
and<00:03:26.600> one<00:03:27.600> of<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.750> skills<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.170> guy<00:03:28.290> has<00:03:28.530> is

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
and one of the skills the guy has is

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.039 
and one of the skills the guy has is
like<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:28.920> blank<00:03:29.250> or<00:03:29.459> a<00:03:29.519> flash<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.690> it's<00:03:30.989> the

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
like a blank or a flash and it's the

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.660 
like a blank or a flash and it's the
same<00:03:31.079> thing<00:03:31.290> like<00:03:31.680> in<00:03:31.890> League<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.280> Legends

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
same thing like in League of Legends

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.099 
same thing like in League of Legends
they<00:03:32.819> have<00:03:32.940> flashing<00:03:33.420> League<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.660> Legends<00:03:33.989> and

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
they have flashing League of Legends and

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.559 
they have flashing League of Legends and
dota<00:03:34.350> 2<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.739> have<00:03:34.859> a<00:03:34.890> blink<00:03:35.190> dagger<00:03:35.340> I<00:03:35.730> wonder

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
dota 2 to have a blink dagger I wonder

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.360 
dota 2 to have a blink dagger I wonder
if<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.900> first-person<00:03:37.500> shooter<00:03:38.010> would<00:03:38.160> be<00:03:38.280> able

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
if a first-person shooter would be able

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.960 
if a first-person shooter would be able
to<00:03:38.519> implement<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:39.180> blink<00:03:39.450> feature<00:03:40.160> or<00:03:41.160> if<00:03:41.819> that

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
to implement a blink feature or if that

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.539 
to implement a blink feature or if that
would<00:03:42.090> make<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.480> broken<00:03:43.310> depending<00:03:44.310> on<00:03:44.310> how

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
would make it broken depending on how

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.430 
would make it broken depending on how
how<00:03:44.880> long<00:03:45.090> i<00:03:45.209> guess<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.450> cooldown<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:45.870> if

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
how long i guess the cooldown is if

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.349 
how long i guess the cooldown is if
you're<00:03:47.069> shooting<00:03:47.220> at<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.459> guy<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:48.090> know<00:03:48.209> he

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
you're shooting at a guy and you know he

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.120 
you're shooting at a guy and you know he
could<00:03:48.480> blink<00:03:48.660> away<00:03:48.840> but<00:03:49.650> actually<00:03:49.859> i<00:03:50.100> think

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
could blink away but actually i think

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.340 
could blink away but actually i think
that's<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.519> very<00:03:50.670> good<00:03:50.819> idea

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
that's a very good idea

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.530 
that's a very good idea
Pat<00:03:53.350> myself<00:03:53.500> on<00:03:53.860> the<00:03:53.920> back<00:03:54.010> but<00:03:54.420> what<00:03:55.420> do<00:03:55.510> you

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
Pat myself on the back but what do you

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.020 
Pat myself on the back but what do you
guys<00:03:55.720> think<00:03:55.780> if<00:03:56.200> they<00:03:56.470> added<00:03:56.770> a<00:03:56.890> um<00:03:57.100> like<00:03:58.000> a

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
guys think if they added a um like a

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.600 
guys think if they added a um like a
blank<00:03:58.390> feature<00:03:58.660> I<00:03:59.080> hope<00:03:59.920> you<00:04:00.040> guys<00:04:00.190> understand

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
blank feature I hope you guys understand

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.750 
blank feature I hope you guys understand
what<00:04:00.700> I'm<00:04:00.790> saying<00:04:00.970> if<00:04:01.090> you<00:04:01.180> don't<00:04:02.760> it's

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
what I'm saying if you don't it's

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.730 
what I'm saying if you don't it's
basically<00:04:04.180> like<00:04:04.360> a<00:04:04.420> little<00:04:04.750> short<00:04:05.230> distance

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
basically like a little short distance

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.270 
basically like a little short distance
like<00:04:07.170> instant<00:04:08.170> blink<00:04:08.530> well<00:04:08.770> blink<00:04:09.100> was

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
like instant blink well blink was

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.070 
like instant blink well blink was
different<00:04:09.760> I<00:04:09.940> don't<00:04:10.420> want<00:04:10.540> to<00:04:10.600> get<00:04:10.660> into<00:04:10.840> slyke

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
different I don't want to get into slyke

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.180 
different I don't want to get into slyke
to<00:04:11.110> specific<00:04:11.590> because<00:04:11.709> it's<00:04:11.890> just<00:04:12.069> an<00:04:12.130> idea

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
to specific because it's just an idea

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.150 
to specific because it's just an idea
but<00:04:12.580> a<00:04:12.900> blink<00:04:13.900> is<00:04:14.080> different<00:04:14.560> a<00:04:14.590> blink<00:04:14.830> is<00:04:15.010> like

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
but a blink is different a blink is like

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.740 
but a blink is different a blink is like
a<00:04:15.190> TP<00:04:15.670> where<00:04:15.880> you<00:04:15.970> up<00:04:16.120> here<00:04:16.299> in<00:04:16.359> a<00:04:16.450> different

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
a TP where you up here in a different

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.240 
a TP where you up here in a different
area<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.500> then<00:04:17.650> they<00:04:17.739> have<00:04:17.889> something<00:04:18.130> called

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
area and then they have something called

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.030 
area and then they have something called
a<00:04:18.430> for<00:04:18.669> staff<00:04:18.940> that<00:04:19.239> pushes<00:04:19.840> you<00:04:19.989> rapidly<00:04:20.769> to

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
a for staff that pushes you rapidly to

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.890 
a for staff that pushes you rapidly to
another<00:04:21.280> area<00:04:21.459> so<00:04:22.120> it's<00:04:22.240> not<00:04:22.330> a<00:04:22.389> blink<00:04:22.690> where

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
another area so it's not a blink where

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.950 
another area so it's not a blink where
you<00:04:22.990> just<00:04:23.200> appear<00:04:23.620> and<00:04:23.650> disappear<00:04:24.720> for<00:04:25.720> staff

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
you just appear and disappear for staff

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.930 
you just appear and disappear for staff
is<00:04:26.080> more<00:04:26.260> like<00:04:26.380> a<00:04:26.410> push<00:04:26.770> so<00:04:27.400> even<00:04:27.610> if<00:04:27.700> you<00:04:27.790> gave

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
is more like a push so even if you gave

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.820 
is more like a push so even if you gave
somebody<00:04:28.180> a<00:04:28.360> push<00:04:28.690> like<00:04:29.020> a<00:04:29.050> for<00:04:29.350> staff<00:04:29.590> like<00:04:29.800> a

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
somebody a push like a for staff like a

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.010 
somebody a push like a for staff like a
thruster<00:04:30.520> pack<00:04:30.730> that<00:04:31.240> just<00:04:31.510> thrust<00:04:31.780> shoot

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
thruster pack that just thrust shoot

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.680 
thruster pack that just thrust shoot
throat<00:04:32.440> but<00:04:32.710> that<00:04:33.100> just<00:04:33.130> thrust<00:04:33.580> you<00:04:33.850> and<00:04:34.180> like

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
throat but that just thrust you and like

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.720 
throat but that just thrust you and like
whatever<00:04:34.990> direction<00:04:35.169> you're<00:04:35.530> facing<00:04:35.730> even

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
whatever direction you're facing even

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.730 
whatever direction you're facing even
that<00:04:36.880> might<00:04:37.060> work<00:04:37.270> three<00:04:37.630> piece<00:04:37.870> even<00:04:38.500> that

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
that might work three piece even that

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.370 
that might work three piece even that
might<00:04:38.890> work<00:04:39.180> because<00:04:40.180> then<00:04:40.450> at<00:04:40.570> least<00:04:40.720> even<00:04:41.320> if

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
might work because then at least even if

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.010 
might work because then at least even if
they<00:04:41.500> see<00:04:41.560> on<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:41.919> map<00:04:42.150> you<00:04:43.150> can<00:04:43.330> like<00:04:43.479> rapidly

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
they see on the map you can like rapidly

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.860 
they see on the map you can like rapidly
move<00:04:44.260> position<00:04:44.890> you<00:04:45.580> know<00:04:45.700> in<00:04:45.940> separate<00:04:46.570> space

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
move position you know in separate space

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.280 
move position you know in separate space
so<00:04:47.680> you're<00:04:47.830> not<00:04:47.950> too<00:04:48.250> predictable<00:04:48.880> you<00:04:49.060> know

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
so you're not too predictable you know

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.659 
so you're not too predictable you know
anyway<00:04:50.290> that's<00:04:50.470> just<00:04:50.680> a<00:04:50.860> random<00:04:51.370> thought<00:04:51.460> that

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
anyway that's just a random thought that

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.180 
anyway that's just a random thought that
popped<00:04:51.850> up<00:04:52.000> while<00:04:52.720> talking<00:04:52.960> about<00:04:53.229> that<00:04:53.440> but

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
popped up while talking about that but

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.740 
popped up while talking about that but
I'm<00:04:54.310> blacklights<00:04:54.760> very<00:04:55.000> good<00:04:55.210> man<00:04:55.389> it's<00:04:55.660> a
