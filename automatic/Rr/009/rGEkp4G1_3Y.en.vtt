hey<00:00:00.599> guys<00:00:00.750> the<00:00:00.900> media<00:00:01.110> occupier<00:00:01.410> here<00:00:01.650> just

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
hey guys the media occupier here just

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.070 
hey guys the media occupier here just
want<00:00:02.100> to<00:00:02.190> share<00:00:02.310> a<00:00:02.550> really<00:00:03.090> difficult<00:00:03.480> lesson

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
want to share a really difficult lesson

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.269 
want to share a really difficult lesson
I<00:00:04.200> learned

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
I learned

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.070 
I learned
and<00:00:05.640> that's<00:00:05.850> drilling<00:00:06.420> through<00:00:06.600> hardened

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
and that's drilling through hardened

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.490 
and that's drilling through hardened
steel<00:00:07.379> I<00:00:07.760> these<00:00:08.760> two<00:00:09.030> knives<00:00:09.240> here<00:00:09.630> we're<00:00:10.230> kind

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
steel I these two knives here we're kind

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.169 
steel I these two knives here we're kind
of<00:00:10.530> hastily<00:00:10.920> made<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.280> my<00:00:11.400> last<00:00:11.580> batch<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:11.910> oh

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
of hastily made in my last batch that oh

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.770 
of hastily made in my last batch that oh
one<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:13.759> got<00:00:14.759> them<00:00:14.940> heat<00:00:15.059> treated<00:00:15.360> before<00:00:15.540> I

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
one and I got them heat treated before I

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.510 
one and I got them heat treated before I
drilled<00:00:16.139> holes<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:16.529> them<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.859> just<00:00:17.220> didn't<00:00:17.430> have

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
drilled holes in them I just didn't have

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.330 
drilled holes in them I just didn't have
time<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.850> do<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:19.160> I've<00:00:20.160> been

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
time to do that so I've been

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.740 
time to do that so I've been
experimenting<00:00:21.060> trying<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.390> find<00:00:21.539> ways<00:00:21.720> to

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
experimenting trying to find ways to

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.080 
experimenting trying to find ways to
make<00:00:22.170> holes<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:22.680> these<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.189> pretty<00:00:24.000> much

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
make holes in these and pretty much

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.019 
make holes in these and pretty much
everything<00:00:24.359> has<00:00:24.570> failed<00:00:24.840> from<00:00:25.199> carbide

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
everything has failed from carbide

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.609 
everything has failed from carbide
deburring<00:00:27.029> bits<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.570> drill<00:00:27.599> bits<00:00:28.050> carbide

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
deburring bits to drill bits carbide

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.209 
deburring bits to drill bits carbide
bits<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.099> hardened<00:00:29.400> steel<00:00:29.580> everything<00:00:30.150> so

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
bits to hardened steel everything so

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.380 
bits to hardened steel everything so
weather<00:00:32.219> today<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.669> picked<00:00:33.030> up<00:00:33.149> some<00:00:33.300> of

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
weather today and picked up some of

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.250 
weather today and picked up some of
these<00:00:33.480> guys<00:00:33.750> are<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:35.210> metal<00:00:36.210> bits<00:00:36.630> these

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
these guys are to metal bits these

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.869 
these guys are to metal bits these
things<00:00:37.469> actually<00:00:37.649> have<00:00:37.860> carbide<00:00:38.219> tips<00:00:38.550> and

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
things actually have carbide tips and

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.090 
things actually have carbide tips and
initially<00:00:39.450> I've<00:00:39.899> caught<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.350> tried<00:00:40.649> using<00:00:40.829> one

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
initially I've caught I tried using one

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.160 
initially I've caught I tried using one
a<00:00:41.129> little<00:00:41.430> bit<00:00:41.550> back<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.570> carbide<00:00:42.960> head

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
a little bit back and the carbide head

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.540 
a little bit back and the carbide head
actually<00:00:43.350> broke<00:00:43.710> off<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.070> think<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.340> got<00:00:44.520> a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
actually broke off I think I got a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.060 
actually broke off I think I got a
faulty<00:00:44.820> one<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:45.750> these<00:00:46.200> two<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:47.039> been

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
faulty one but these two have been

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.180 
faulty one but these two have been
working<00:00:47.610> out<00:00:47.760> great<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.750> far<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.469> did<00:00:49.739> these<00:00:49.980> two

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
working out great so far I did these two

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.100 
working out great so far I did these two
holes<00:00:50.430> here<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.539> enough<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.960> can

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
holes here and it's just enough so I can

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.200 
holes here and it's just enough so I can
attach<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.649> handle<00:00:52.800> scale<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.460> don't<00:00:53.820> know<00:00:54.090> if

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
attach a handle scale I don't know if

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.430 
attach a handle scale I don't know if
I'm<00:00:54.300> going<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.480> make<00:00:54.690> another<00:00:54.960> one<00:00:55.050> here<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
I'm going to make another one here to

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.410 
I'm going to make another one here to
lighten<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.739> up<00:00:55.890> because<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.940> little<00:00:57.270> bit

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
lighten it up because it's a little bit

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.279 
lighten it up because it's a little bit
of<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.570> hassle<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.680> pretty<00:00:59.190> much<00:01:00.020> every<00:01:01.020> Center

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
of a hassle but pretty much every Center

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.170 
of a hassle but pretty much every Center
punch<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.070> hardened<00:01:02.520> steel<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.059> it

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
punch I have is hardened steel so it

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.359 
punch I have is hardened steel so it
doesn't<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:04.320> make<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> dent<00:01:04.830> here<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.339> I

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
doesn't you make a dent here so I

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.240 
doesn't you make a dent here so I
actually<00:01:05.549> had<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.909> go<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.330> use<00:01:07.040> one<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.130> my

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
actually had to go and use one of my

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.090 
actually had to go and use one of my
little<00:01:08.580> carbide<00:01:09.240> deburring<00:01:09.840> bit<00:01:10.080> cones<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.890> I

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
little carbide deburring bit cones and I

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.440 
little carbide deburring bit cones and I
actually<00:01:11.189> went<00:01:11.490> where<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.670> wanted<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.330> just

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
actually went where I wanted to and just

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.359 
actually went where I wanted to and just
to<00:01:12.630> make<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> machine<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> little<00:01:13.590> bit<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.040> little

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
to make a machine a little bit a little

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.820 
to make a machine a little bit a little
dent<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.790> there<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.290> my<00:01:16.560> bit

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
dent in there so that the my bit

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.590 
dent in there so that the my bit
wouldn't<00:01:17.130> wander<00:01:17.340> around<00:01:17.549> at<00:01:18.030> least<00:01:18.270> for<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
wouldn't wander around at least for the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.770 
wouldn't wander around at least for the
eighth<00:01:19.500> inch<00:01:19.799> bit<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.430> did<00:01:20.700> start<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.450> wander

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
eighth inch bit it did start to wander

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.210 
eighth inch bit it did start to wander
around<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.409> needs<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> little<00:01:22.740> point<00:01:23.100> to

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
around and just needs a little point to

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.399 
around and just needs a little point to
start<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.840> want<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.110> show<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.290> guys

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
start in so just want to show you guys

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.789 
start in so just want to show you guys
how<00:01:25.970> well<00:01:26.970> these<00:01:27.150> bits<00:01:27.479> work<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:28.500> actually

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
how well these bits work it's actually

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.440 
how well these bits work it's actually
quite<00:01:28.979> amazing<00:01:29.540> so<00:01:30.680> find<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.799> center<00:01:32.130> here

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
quite amazing so find the center here

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.660 
quite amazing so find the center here
spin<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.630> backwards

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
spin that backwards

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.859 
spin that backwards
it's<00:01:35.670> clamp<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.030> down<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.420> get<00:01:36.540> going<00:01:38.869> so

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
it's clamp this down and get going so

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.940 
it's clamp this down and get going so
I'm<00:01:39.960> doing<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.259> super<00:01:40.439> high<00:01:40.710> speed<00:01:41.070> about<00:01:41.729> a

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
I'm doing a super high speed about a

00:01:42.950 --> 00:02:06.789 
I'm doing a super high speed about a
3100<00:01:43.950> rpm

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.400 

and<00:02:07.799> there<00:02:08.729> we<00:02:08.849> go

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
and there we go

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.290 
and there we go
tools<00:02:10.410> drilled<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:10.950> my<00:02:11.160> handle<00:02:11.519> they<00:02:12.090> need<00:02:12.269> a

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
tools drilled in my handle they need a

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.880 
tools drilled in my handle they need a
little<00:02:12.630> bit<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.900> deburring<00:02:13.260> that's<00:02:13.739> where

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
little bit of deburring that's where

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.009 
little bit of deburring that's where
those<00:02:14.010> carbide<00:02:14.459> e<00:02:14.489> burning<00:02:14.940> bits<00:02:15.150> come<00:02:15.390> in<00:02:15.540> but

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
those carbide e burning bits come in but

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.720 
those carbide e burning bits come in but
absolutely<00:02:16.620> awesome<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:17.130> have<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.550> option

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
absolutely awesome to have that option

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.420 
absolutely awesome to have that option
to<00:02:17.970> uh<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.840> case<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.500> need<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.680> drill<00:02:20.280> some

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
to uh in case you need to drill some

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.920 
to uh in case you need to drill some
hardened<00:02:20.730> steel<00:02:20.940> or<00:02:21.150> something<00:02:21.360> like<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.720> I

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
hardened steel or something like that I

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.350 
hardened steel or something like that I
have<00:02:22.920> not<00:02:23.160> really<00:02:23.459> use<00:02:23.670> these<00:02:23.819> on<00:02:24.000> titanium

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
have not really use these on titanium

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.150 
have not really use these on titanium
yet<00:02:24.750> but<00:02:25.019> I<00:02:25.049> really<00:02:25.290> think<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.799> they<00:02:26.010> will

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
yet but I really think that they will

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.039 
yet but I really think that they will
work<00:02:26.400> quite<00:02:26.790> well<00:02:27.350> since<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.410> carbide<00:02:28.860> bit

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
work quite well since that carbide bit

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.809 
work quite well since that carbide bit
went<00:02:31.049> through<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.410> this<00:02:31.950> oh<00:02:32.130> one<00:02:32.370> which<00:02:32.580> is<00:02:32.700> at

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
went through the this oh one which is at

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.140 
went through the this oh one which is at
about<00:02:32.910> sixty<00:02:33.480> one<00:02:33.690> sixty<00:02:34.470> two<00:02:34.890> Rockwell<00:02:35.459> it

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
about sixty one sixty two Rockwell it

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.360 
about sixty one sixty two Rockwell it
had<00:02:36.330> no<00:02:36.510> problem<00:02:36.930> with<00:02:37.019> that<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:38.069> see<00:02:38.250> how

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
had no problem with that so you see how

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.729 
had no problem with that so you see how
fast<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.730> went<00:02:38.880> through<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.470> really<00:02:40.470> really

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
fast that went through I really really

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.339 
fast that went through I really really
think<00:02:40.950> these<00:02:41.069> bits<00:02:41.340> are<00:02:41.549> have<00:02:42.170> are<00:02:43.170> going<00:02:43.290> to

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
think these bits are have are going to

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.220 
think these bits are have are going to
be<00:02:43.470> really<00:02:43.799> well<00:02:44.299> work<00:02:45.299> really<00:02:45.569> well<00:02:45.750> for<00:02:45.810> just

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
be really well work really well for just

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.559 
be really well work really well for just
general<00:02:46.620> multi-purpose<00:02:47.430> use<00:02:47.610> mega<00:02:47.940> knives<00:02:48.239> so

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
general multi-purpose use mega knives so

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.360 
general multi-purpose use mega knives so
now<00:02:49.170> thanks<00:02:49.530> for<00:02:49.620> watching<00:02:49.890> let<00:02:50.100> me<00:02:50.130> know<00:02:50.280> if

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
now thanks for watching let me know if

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.890 
now thanks for watching let me know if
you<00:02:50.430> guys<00:02:50.519> have<00:02:50.730> used<00:02:50.910> these<00:02:51.000> bits<00:02:51.299> before<00:02:51.510> I

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
you guys have used these bits before I

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.110 
you guys have used these bits before I
is<00:02:52.890> really<00:02:53.190> my<00:02:53.310> first<00:02:53.579> time<00:02:53.760> having<00:02:53.970> that

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
is really my first time having that

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.509 
is really my first time having that
successful<00:02:54.840> use<00:02:55.019> of<00:02:55.049> them<00:02:55.320> like<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.130> said<00:02:56.370> that

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
successful use of them like I said that

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.310 
successful use of them like I said that
last<00:02:56.730> time<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.030> tried<00:02:57.209> using<00:02:57.359> it<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.900> carbide

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
last time I tried using it the carbide

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.720 
last time I tried using it the carbide
head<00:02:58.560> broke<00:02:58.769> off<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.130> I<00:02:59.190> think<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.459> might<00:02:59.579> have

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
head broke off so I think it might have

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.099 
head broke off so I think it might have
just<00:02:59.760> been<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.150> little<00:03:00.329> bit<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.600> fluke<00:03:00.840> but

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
just been a little bit of a fluke but

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.420 
just been a little bit of a fluke but
these<00:03:01.650> things<00:03:01.859> are<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.040> little<00:03:02.190> bit<00:03:02.400> more

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
these things are a little bit more

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.180 
these things are a little bit more
expensive<00:03:02.910> they<00:03:03.420> can<00:03:03.450> run<00:03:03.750> about<00:03:04.019> nine<00:03:04.799> bucks

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
expensive they can run about nine bucks

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.009 
expensive they can run about nine bucks
at<00:03:05.549> least<00:03:05.760> for<00:03:05.970> this<00:03:06.090> one<00:03:06.450> bit

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
at least for this one bit

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.960 
at least for this one bit
but<00:03:07.440> if<00:03:07.590> we<00:03:07.709> can<00:03:07.859> do<00:03:08.040> this<00:03:08.220> through<00:03:08.549> that<00:03:08.670> steel

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
but if we can do this through that steel

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.809 
but if we can do this through that steel
that<00:03:09.390> fast<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:10.739> really<00:03:11.280> can't<00:03:11.459> complain

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
that fast I really can't complain

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.759 
that fast I really can't complain
so<00:03:12.060> anyhow<00:03:12.720> thanks<00:03:13.019> for<00:03:13.109> watching<00:03:13.380> as<00:03:13.560> always

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769
