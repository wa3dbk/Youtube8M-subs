we're gonna be going over is how to add
detail<00:00:12.849> back<00:00:13.059> into<00:00:13.570> this<00:00:14.049> guy's<00:00:14.259> skin<00:00:14.799> where

detail back into this guy's skin where

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.480 
detail back into this guy's skin where
the<00:00:15.610> details<00:00:15.940> been<00:00:16.090> taken<00:00:16.420> out<00:00:16.570> so<00:00:17.410> a<00:00:17.770> lot<00:00:18.369> of

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
the details been taken out so a lot of

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.070 
the details been taken out so a lot of
the<00:00:18.550> time<00:00:18.790> if<00:00:19.150> you<00:00:19.390> haven't<00:00:19.570> run<00:00:19.780> into<00:00:19.990> this

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
the time if you haven't run into this

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.080 
the time if you haven't run into this
already<00:00:20.440> this<00:00:20.890> is<00:00:20.950> bound<00:00:21.460> to<00:00:21.640> happen<00:00:21.940> at<00:00:22.060> some

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
already this is bound to happen at some

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.290 
already this is bound to happen at some
point<00:00:22.300> where<00:00:23.110> you<00:00:23.580> you're<00:00:24.580> retouching<00:00:25.210> the

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
point where you you're retouching the

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.570 
point where you you're retouching the
skin<00:00:25.510> and<00:00:25.660> you<00:00:25.720> take<00:00:25.960> detail<00:00:26.440> out<00:00:26.650> of<00:00:26.830> it<00:00:26.950> so

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
skin and you take detail out of it so

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.760 
skin and you take detail out of it so
the<00:00:27.610> patch<00:00:28.090> tool<00:00:28.450> is<00:00:28.630> a<00:00:28.660> tool<00:00:28.930> that<00:00:28.960> I<00:00:29.170> use<00:00:29.470> a

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
the patch tool is a tool that I use a

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.280 
the patch tool is a tool that I use a
good<00:00:30.040> amount<00:00:30.280> but<00:00:31.090> it's<00:00:31.330> not<00:00:31.570> very<00:00:31.900> good<00:00:32.079> at

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
good amount but it's not very good at

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.579 
good amount but it's not very good at
keeping<00:00:32.489> underlying<00:00:33.489> detail<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:35.079> for<00:00:35.230> example

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:35.589 
keeping underlying detail so for example

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:37.290 
keeping underlying detail so for example
this<00:00:35.679> is<00:00:35.800> what<00:00:35.890> I<00:00:35.920> did<00:00:36.190> down<00:00:36.339> here<00:00:36.370> I'll<00:00:37.149> give

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
this is what I did down here I'll give

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.169 
this is what I did down here I'll give
you<00:00:37.359> an<00:00:37.449> extreme<00:00:37.809> example<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:39.010> I<00:00:39.039> I<00:00:39.550> circled<00:00:40.120> a

00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:40.179 
you an extreme example so I I circled a

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:41.939 
you an extreme example so I I circled a
spot<00:00:40.449> that<00:00:40.629> I<00:00:40.659> wanted<00:00:40.989> to<00:00:41.140> correct<00:00:41.589> and<00:00:41.890> I

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
spot that I wanted to correct and I

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.299 
spot that I wanted to correct and I
brought<00:00:42.190> it<00:00:42.429> on<00:00:42.550> accident<00:00:43.120> over<00:00:43.839> to<00:00:44.140> a<00:00:44.499> part

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
brought it on accident over to a part

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.700 
brought it on accident over to a part
that<00:00:45.339> was<00:00:45.550> kind<00:00:45.969> of<00:00:46.030> blurry<00:00:46.420> like<00:00:47.170> this<00:00:47.440> and

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
that was kind of blurry like this and

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.729 
that was kind of blurry like this and
what<00:00:48.370> I<00:00:48.399> did<00:00:48.609> is<00:00:48.730> I<00:00:48.819> wanted<00:00:49.149> to<00:00:49.230> fix<00:00:50.230> this<00:00:50.440> skin

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
what I did is I wanted to fix this skin

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.319 
what I did is I wanted to fix this skin
down<00:00:50.890> here<00:00:51.069> so<00:00:51.190> I<00:00:51.249> made<00:00:51.399> all<00:00:51.579> this<00:00:51.789> a<00:00:51.850> little

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
down here so I made all this a little

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.660 
down here so I made all this a little
bit<00:00:52.480> blurry<00:00:52.780> to<00:00:53.019> smoothen<00:00:53.469> it<00:00:53.559> out<00:00:53.679> so<00:00:54.460> now

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
bit blurry to smoothen it out so now

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.910 
bit blurry to smoothen it out so now
it's<00:00:55.569> looking<00:00:55.870> a<00:00:55.960> little<00:00:56.050> bit<00:00:56.199> plastic

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
it's looking a little bit plastic

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.009 
it's looking a little bit plastic
plasticky<00:00:57.850> down<00:00:58.059> here<00:00:58.390> so<00:00:58.479> I<00:00:58.539> wanted<00:00:58.780> to<00:00:58.839> add

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
plasticky down here so I wanted to add

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.169 
plasticky down here so I wanted to add
in<00:00:59.170> more<00:00:59.319> detail<00:00:59.739> this<00:00:59.920> is<00:01:00.100> a<00:01:00.219> really<00:01:00.850> simple

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
in more detail this is a really simple

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.229 
in more detail this is a really simple
technique<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.949> to<00:01:03.010> fix<00:01:03.339> this<00:01:03.489> hit<00:01:03.819> s<00:01:03.969> on<00:01:04.150> the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
technique so to fix this hit s on the

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.060 
technique so to fix this hit s on the
keyboard<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:04.780> go<00:01:04.900> to<00:01:04.960> your<00:01:05.229> clone<00:01:05.590> stamp<00:01:05.950> tool

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
keyboard to go to your clone stamp tool

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.709 
keyboard to go to your clone stamp tool
and<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.670> key<00:01:06.820> to<00:01:06.939> this<00:01:07.030> is<00:01:07.090> to<00:01:07.329> paint<00:01:07.540> with<00:01:07.659> a

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:07.719 
and the key to this is to paint with a

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:10.770 
and the key to this is to paint with a
low<00:01:07.930> opacity<00:01:08.110> about<00:01:08.770> 20%<00:01:09.579> and<00:01:09.939> I<00:01:10.149> am<00:01:10.299> on<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.479> soft

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
low opacity about 20% and I am on a soft

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.830 
low opacity about 20% and I am on a soft
edge<00:01:10.990> brush<00:01:11.079> and<00:01:11.710> all<00:01:12.009> you<00:01:12.159> do<00:01:12.369> is<00:01:12.640> I'm<00:01:13.570> gonna

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
edge brush and all you do is I'm gonna

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.050 
edge brush and all you do is I'm gonna
copy<00:01:14.079> this<00:01:14.350> down<00:01:14.560> really<00:01:14.920> quick<00:01:15.130> all<00:01:15.610> you<00:01:15.850> do

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
copy this down really quick all you do

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.910 
copy this down really quick all you do
is<00:01:16.329> hold<00:01:16.600> down<00:01:16.689> option<00:01:16.899> at<00:01:17.140> all<00:01:17.259> to<00:01:17.439> sample

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
is hold down option at all to sample

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.230 
is hold down option at all to sample
from<00:01:18.039> a<00:01:18.219> spot<00:01:18.520> that<00:01:18.549> already<00:01:19.000> has<00:01:19.210> some

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
from a spot that already has some

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.590 
from a spot that already has some
texture<00:01:19.899> and<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:21.430> paint<00:01:21.729> in<00:01:22.469> down<00:01:23.469> here

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
texture and just paint in down here

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.480 
texture and just paint in down here
where<00:01:25.600> you<00:01:25.719> want<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.079> texture<00:01:26.439> to<00:01:26.619> be<00:01:26.770> so<00:01:27.399> you

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
where you want the texture to be so you

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.359 
where you want the texture to be so you
can<00:01:27.640> see<00:01:27.820> it's<00:01:27.939> really<00:01:28.270> slight<00:01:28.869> but<00:01:29.680> it's<00:01:29.829> it's

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
can see it's really slight but it's it's

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.190 
can see it's really slight but it's it's
looking<00:01:30.549> really<00:01:30.969> good<00:01:31.329> it's<00:01:31.539> bringing<00:01:31.930> back

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
looking really good it's bringing back

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.319 
looking really good it's bringing back
some<00:01:32.920> of<00:01:33.039> that<00:01:33.130> texture<00:01:33.549> so<00:01:33.789> it<00:01:33.880> doesn't<00:01:34.149> look

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
some of that texture so it doesn't look

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.719 
some of that texture so it doesn't look
so<00:01:34.390> flat<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:36.869> plasticky<00:01:37.869> okay<00:01:38.799> so<00:01:39.549> there<00:01:39.700> you

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
so flat and plasticky okay so there you

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.279 
so flat and plasticky okay so there you
go<00:01:39.939> guys<00:01:40.119> that's<00:01:40.149> a<00:01:40.539> really<00:01:40.810> simple<00:01:40.990> technique

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
go guys that's a really simple technique

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.849 
go guys that's a really simple technique
that<00:01:41.799> will<00:01:42.390> allow<00:01:43.390> you<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.659> fix<00:01:44.170> parts<00:01:44.590> that

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:44.859 
that will allow you to fix parts that

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:48.029 
that will allow you to fix parts that
are<00:01:45.299> not<00:01:46.299> textured<00:01:46.869> and<00:01:47.109> so<00:01:47.679> they<00:01:47.799> don't<00:01:47.950> look

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
are not textured and so they don't look

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.039 
are not textured and so they don't look
like<00:01:48.189> plastic<00:01:48.429> so<00:01:49.090> here's<00:01:49.329> the<00:01:49.509> before<00:01:49.960> and

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
like plastic so here's the before and
