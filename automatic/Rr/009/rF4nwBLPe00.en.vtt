dumps and you flick a switch and they
turn<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.049> your<00:01:04.500> exhaust<00:01:04.830> goes<00:01:05.040> out<00:01:05.250> to

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
turn on and your exhaust goes out to

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.399 
turn on and your exhaust goes out to
side<00:01:05.640> or<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.420> get<00:01:06.630> underneath<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.260> take

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
side or you get underneath and take

side or you get underneath and take
three<00:01:07.710> bolts<00:01:08.070> off<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.580> then<00:01:08.670> put<00:01:08.790> some<00:01:08.850> pipes

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
three bolts off and then put some pipes

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.280 
three bolts off and then put some pipes
on<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:10.280> if<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.369> got<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> super<00:01:12.119> molded<00:01:12.810> kit<00:01:13.080> you

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.660 
for and I will tell you your thickness
so<00:02:10.480> if<00:02:10.570> you<00:02:10.630> want<00:02:10.810> 4-inch<00:02:11.200> pipe<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:12.340> of<00:02:12.400> course

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
so if you want 4-inch pipe and of course

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.320 
so if you want 4-inch pipe and of course
on<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.480> odd<00:02:13.660> sizes<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.470> just<00:02:14.710> got<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:14.920> get

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
on the odd sizes you just got to get

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.940 
on the odd sizes you just got to get
close<00:02:16.330> as<00:02:16.570> you<00:02:16.660> want<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:20.290> can<00:02:20.440> see<00:02:20.620> this

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
close as you want but you can see this

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.470 
close as you want but you can see this
is<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.160> first<00:02:21.400> one<00:02:21.640> that<00:02:21.670> I<00:02:21.850> ever<00:02:21.970> tried<00:02:22.330> you

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
is the first one that I ever tried you

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.570 
is the first one that I ever tried you
can<00:02:22.600> see<00:02:22.690> it's<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.930> little<00:02:22.960> kink<00:02:23.470> there<00:02:23.800> the

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
can see it's a little kink there the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.730 
can see it's a little kink there the
other<00:02:24.700> one's<00:02:24.910> pretty<00:02:25.180> good<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:26.050> trick<00:02:26.440> is<00:02:26.470> to

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
other one's pretty good the trick is to

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.090 
other one's pretty good the trick is to
not<00:02:27.640> overheat<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.660> takes<00:02:29.140> some<00:02:29.440> practice<00:02:29.650> I

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
not overheat it takes some practice I

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.770 
not overheat it takes some practice I
still<00:02:30.400> mess<00:02:30.580> it<00:02:30.760> up<00:02:30.850> every<00:02:31.150> once<00:02:31.360> in<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.600> while

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
still mess it up every once in a while

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.950 
still mess it up every once in a while
and<00:02:32.020> then<00:02:32.500> sometimes<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.220> can<00:02:33.370> even<00:02:33.400> just

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
and then sometimes you can even just

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.550 
and then sometimes you can even just
bend<00:02:34.960> it<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.170> little<00:02:35.200> bit<00:02:35.680> for<00:02:36.400> minor<00:02:36.640> bends<00:02:38.550> but

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
bend it a little bit for minor bends but

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.320 
bend it a little bit for minor bends but
so<00:02:41.560> when<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:41.980> got<00:02:42.160> your<00:02:42.250> stock<00:02:42.520> manifolds

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
so when you got your stock manifolds

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.550 
so when you got your stock manifolds
like<00:02:43.900> this<00:02:44.110> one<00:02:44.320> has<00:02:44.500> on<00:02:44.770> it<00:02:46.410> obviously<00:02:47.410> you

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
like this one has on it obviously you

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.350 
like this one has on it obviously you
got<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.860> get<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.100> to<00:02:48.190> curve<00:02:48.400> up<00:02:48.610> to<00:02:48.790> go<00:02:48.910> in<00:02:49.120> there

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
got to get it to curve up to go in there

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.480 
got to get it to curve up to go in there
and<00:02:51.300> what<00:02:52.300> I<00:02:52.330> did<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:53.260> get<00:02:53.410> DS<00:02:53.680> really<00:02:53.950> close<00:02:54.280> to

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
and what I did to get DS really close to

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.930 
and what I did to get DS really close to
the<00:02:54.610> same<00:02:54.850> is<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:56.560> bent<00:02:56.980> them<00:02:57.190> together<00:02:57.580> side<00:02:57.910> by

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
the same is I bent them together side by

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.970 
the same is I bent them together side by
side<00:02:58.390> well<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:58.780> did<00:02:58.990> one<00:02:59.170> over<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.530> other<00:02:59.680> so<00:02:59.920> I

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
side well I did one over the other so I

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.340 
side well I did one over the other so I
had<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.250> same<00:03:00.490> and<00:03:00.820> then<00:03:01.570> I<00:03:01.750> just<00:03:01.810> left<00:03:02.140> them

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
had the same and then I just left them

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.020 
had the same and then I just left them
as<00:03:02.470> sticks<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.190> then<00:03:03.280> both<00:03:03.490> sides<00:03:03.790> because

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
as sticks and then both sides because

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.070 
as sticks and then both sides because
your<00:03:04.240> engine<00:03:04.600> bays<00:03:04.810> are<00:03:05.200> little<00:03:06.040> offset<00:03:07.080> let's

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
your engine bays are little offset let's

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.910 
your engine bays are little offset let's
see<00:03:08.380> if<00:03:08.500> i<00:03:08.710> could<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:13.080> normally<00:03:14.080> have<00:03:14.290> one

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
see if i could and you normally have one

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.800 
see if i could and you normally have one
exhaust<00:03:15.310> tube<00:03:15.610> that's<00:03:15.910> further<00:03:16.270> forward<00:03:16.780> than

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
exhaust tube that's further forward than

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.180 
exhaust tube that's further forward than
the<00:03:16.990> other<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.260> that's<00:03:17.440> because<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.770> v8<00:03:18.160> the

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
the other and that's because the v8 the

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.390 
the other and that's because the v8 the
cylinders<00:03:18.880> are<00:03:19.030> offset<00:03:19.860> so<00:03:20.860> you<00:03:20.950> just<00:03:21.220> get

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
cylinders are offset so you just get

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.699 
cylinders are offset so you just get
that<00:03:21.640> up<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:22.270> want<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.959> try<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.170> get<00:03:23.440> some

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
that up and you want to try to get some

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.290 
that up and you want to try to get some
clearance<00:03:24.070> so<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:24.490> know<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:24.850> got<00:03:25.180> your

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
clearance so you know you got your

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.390 
clearance so you know you got your
realism<00:03:25.780> going<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:27.990> you<00:03:28.990> know<00:03:29.050> verisign<00:03:29.830> you

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
realism going and you know verisign you

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.370 
realism going and you know verisign you
could<00:03:30.640> even<00:03:30.760> follow<00:03:31.150> us<00:03:31.360> all<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.630> way<00:03:31.750> out<00:03:31.900> a

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
could even follow us all the way out a

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.080 
could even follow us all the way out a
course<00:03:32.830> on<00:03:33.190> this<00:03:33.520> one<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:33.820> would<00:03:33.940> have<00:03:34.030> been

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
course on this one it would have been

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.270 
course on this one it would have been
really<00:03:34.240> hard<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.630> get<00:03:34.870> that<00:03:35.110> styrene<00:03:35.890> and

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
really hard to get that styrene and

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.210 
really hard to get that styrene and
underneath<00:03:36.640> that<00:03:36.850> suspension<00:03:37.950> but<00:03:38.950> so

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
underneath that suspension but so

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.620 
underneath that suspension but so
there's<00:03:39.430> that<00:03:39.670> I<00:03:39.850> didn't<00:03:40.150> like<00:03:40.270> the<00:03:40.300> little

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
there's that I didn't like the little

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.480 
there's that I didn't like the little
exhausted<00:03:41.170> head<00:03:41.320> so<00:03:41.650> i<00:03:41.800> changed<00:03:42.070> it<00:03:42.340> and

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
exhausted head so i changed it and

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.010 
exhausted head so i changed it and
that's<00:03:43.240> what<00:03:43.330> actually<00:03:43.690> gave<00:03:43.810> me<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:43.959> idea

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
that's what actually gave me the idea

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.570 
that's what actually gave me the idea
for<00:03:44.230> all<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.500> other<00:03:44.680> exhaust<00:03:44.980> was<00:03:45.160> this<00:03:45.370> one

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
for all the other exhaust was this one

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.050 
for all the other exhaust was this one
kit<00:03:46.020> and<00:03:47.020> then<00:03:47.200> I<00:03:47.320> got<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.620> 69<00:03:48.130> over<00:03:48.520> here<00:03:48.850> and

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
kit and then I got the 69 over here and

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.570 
kit and then I got the 69 over here and
I<00:03:50.050> just<00:03:50.080> left<00:03:50.470> it<00:03:50.650> completely<00:03:50.830> stock<00:03:51.370> because

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
I just left it completely stock because

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.910 
I just left it completely stock because
i'm<00:03:51.760> actually<00:03:52.030> going<00:03:52.300> to<00:03:52.450> add<00:03:52.930> a<00:03:53.230> set<00:03:53.470> of<00:03:53.590> dumps

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
i'm actually going to add a set of dumps

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.390 
i'm actually going to add a set of dumps
to<00:03:54.100> this<00:03:55.140> but<00:03:56.140> it<00:03:56.320> would<00:03:56.410> be<00:03:56.440> super<00:03:56.890> duper

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
to this but it would be super duper

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.550 
to this but it would be super duper
duper<00:03:57.580> easy<00:03:57.790> if<00:03:58.390> your<00:03:58.870> kit<00:03:59.110> comes<00:03:59.440> with

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
duper easy if your kit comes with

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.980 
duper easy if your kit comes with
headers<00:04:00.040> or<00:04:00.310> any<00:04:00.520> full<00:04:00.850> length<00:04:01.090> exhaust

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
headers or any full length exhaust

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.160 
headers or any full length exhaust
manifold<00:04:02.530> like<00:04:02.740> this<00:04:03.330> and<00:04:04.330> just<00:04:04.360> go<00:04:04.959> get

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
manifold like this and just go get

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.949 
manifold like this and just go get
yourself<00:04:05.590> some<00:04:06.130> 8<00:04:06.370> inch<00:04:06.700> or<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.150> next<00:04:07.480> size<00:04:07.660> up

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
yourself some 8 inch or the next size up

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.620

everything tucked nice and tight but
with<00:04:49.639> plastic<00:04:50.240> it's<00:04:50.419> way<00:04:50.569> easier<00:04:51.490> use<00:04:52.490> heat<00:04:52.729> it

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
with plastic it's way easier use heat it

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
kind of want to watch what you're

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.040 
kind of want to watch what you're
bending<00:05:08.340> make<00:05:09.030> sure<00:05:09.240> it<00:05:09.330> doesn't<00:05:09.510> kink<00:05:09.840> too

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
bending make sure it doesn't kink too

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.650 
bending make sure it doesn't kink too
bad<00:05:10.550> say<00:05:11.550> I<00:05:11.580> even<00:05:11.910> heated<00:05:12.150> that<00:05:12.240> one<00:05:12.420> up<00:05:12.510> too

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
bad say I even heated that one up too

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.160 
bad say I even heated that one up too
much<00:05:13.670> heat<00:05:14.670> it<00:05:14.820> up<00:05:14.940> so<00:05:15.240> it'll<00:05:15.390> bend<00:05:15.750> but<00:05:16.020> not

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
much heat it up so it'll bend but not

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.700 
much heat it up so it'll bend but not
fall<00:05:16.560> on<00:05:16.590> its<00:05:17.040> own<00:05:17.570> you<00:05:18.570> get<00:05:18.810> a<00:05:18.840> little<00:05:19.350> bit

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
fall on its own you get a little bit

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.110 
fall on its own you get a little bit
more<00:05:21.380> smooth<00:05:22.380> bend<00:05:22.860> out<00:05:23.130> of<00:05:23.370> it<00:05:23.550> and<00:05:23.850> then<00:05:24.060> you

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
more smooth bend out of it and then you

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.850 
more smooth bend out of it and then you
just<00:05:24.240> got<00:05:24.420> to<00:05:24.450> keep<00:05:24.660> going<00:05:24.720> back<00:05:25.230> and<00:05:25.290> had<00:05:25.680> in

hope that helps you out barb BB q 175

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:25.630 
hope that helps you out barb BB q 175
and<00:06:20.990> that's<00:06:21.990> pretty<00:06:22.230> much<00:06:22.350> it<00:06:22.500> for<00:06:23.180> exhaust

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:25.640 
and that's pretty much it for exhaust

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.940 
and that's pretty much it for exhaust
it's<00:06:26.640> even<00:06:27.540> easier<00:06:27.690> to<00:06:27.990> do<00:06:28.110> out<00:06:28.260> the<00:06:28.440> side<00:06:28.650> man

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
it's even easier to do out the side man

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.060 
it's even easier to do out the side man
that's<00:06:29.190> real<00:06:29.520> simple<00:06:29.970> just<00:06:30.210> go<00:06:30.330> get<00:06:30.510> yourself

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
that's real simple just go get yourself

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.740 
that's real simple just go get yourself
so<00:06:32.070> I<00:06:32.100> don't<00:06:32.370> know<00:06:32.460> what<00:06:32.580> the<00:06:32.700> next<00:06:32.820> size<00:06:33.180> up<00:06:33.450> is

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
so I don't know what the next size up is

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.120 
so I don't know what the next size up is
