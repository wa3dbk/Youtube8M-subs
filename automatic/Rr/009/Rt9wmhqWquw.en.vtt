00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.190
 hello good night everyone i'm tudjman and 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.960
 this is the second step of the isstey of 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.780
 risto feng and for this step 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.699
 we will need the paralyzer then what 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.130
 only thing to do is go give it 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.350
 with the conducting stick to the spheres that 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.110
 there are all over the map who have 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.880
 already played this map those of xbox then 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.940
 surely you already know where the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.489
 locations is quite easy and it 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.739
 they see quite well and apart you hear 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.500
 there like a buzz when you pass by 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.630
 but good for those who are not from xbox 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.150
 and still do not have the map, so if 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.610
 you want to know, because there you have a 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.710
 between the lounge and the candy shop 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.690
 the next one that is this is within 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.390
 the mines and the easiest way to access 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.510
 to her is for the living room balcony 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.079
 We climb up and down the rails of 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.329
 mine carts out there 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.850
 well you saw the tour is quite 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.000
 easy because here they were giving 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.950
 turns from the other side of the mine 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.430
 until you get to it but well there what 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.189
 you have 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.649
 then the next one is next to the 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:19.439
 church on the left side also looks 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.590
 pretty easy and the next one is in the 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.720
 back of the mansion or if 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.119
 we look in front of the mansion after 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.450
 of having passed it then to the part 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.860
 right then you have the last sphere 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.200
 Then when you activate all of them, it will come out 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.630
 a bluff here good usually comes out more 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.819
 lit up but good in movie mode 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.369
 Well, what we have to do 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.350
 is to heat grenades try to throw it 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.630
 no i did not try if you could with the reid 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.509
 although above he carried it but he did not 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.030
 I took to experiment and once 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.659
 that we have it we take it and here it is 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.009
 step 2 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.869
 I hope you liked the ay 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.310

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.310
