00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.970
 like that 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.670
 conscious Jan van v 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.850
 mh and he asked a question 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.530
 then he explained that 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.770
 the switch from radio veronica 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.800

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.600
 touching people together with Willem van Kooten 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.940

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.670
 come to work 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.670
 and then I have yes in my sentence 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.300
 in forty years 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.610
 why do 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.739
 about this subject 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.619
 fed from 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:14.619
 the heavy passion radio 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:21.179
 you are so keep following her as long as your head fits 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:24.179
 but a weird one 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.879
 that is very important 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.239
 as a radio maker 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.159
 we are still going to be in its infancy 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.469
 make sure it is the right size 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:39.169
 3 to animals 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:43.179
 to read in this course even though dio is a science 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:47.799
 so it's published so much praise there are so many books 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.799
 were unbelievably in pain 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.519
 delve into it 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.519
 and weird 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.169
 referee atkinson on the internet that is possible 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.009
 from stee forty years ago this was not possible 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:06.199
 then it was nothing in that regard 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.459
 end to 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:10.479
 mark selby 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:13.939
 as much as possible and the nice thing is when you are part of yourself 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.439
 as this idea for myself is with internet at your feet 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.679
 where a 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:23.679
 you cannot velvet 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.179
