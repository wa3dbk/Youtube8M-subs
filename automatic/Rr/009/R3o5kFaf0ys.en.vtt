00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
like in a minute on the wall behind us

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.880 
like in a minute on the wall behind us
and<00:01:37.850> round<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> back<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:43.470> talk<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.799> through

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and round the back to talk you through

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.170 
and round the back to talk you through
the<00:01:44.009> controls<00:01:44.399> we've<00:01:44.579> got<00:01:44.700> here<00:01:44.909> we've<00:01:45.060> got

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the controls we've got here we've got

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.270 
the controls we've got here we've got
the<00:01:45.299> mains<00:01:45.540> power<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.110> there's<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.680> power<00:01:46.950> out

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the mains power in there's a power out

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.460 
the mains power in there's a power out
here<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.060> kind<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.630> link<00:01:49.110> further

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
here so you can kind of link further

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.050 
here so you can kind of link further
lighting<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.250> if<00:01:50.310> there's<00:01:50.460> only<00:01:50.520> one<00:01:50.820> or

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
two sockets in the room you don't have

parts<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.860> room<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.280> link<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
parts of the room you just link the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.490 
parts of the room you just link the
lighting<00:01:56.969> together<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.390> way<00:01:57.540> there's<00:01:58.079> DMX

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
lighting together that way there's DMX

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.380 
lighting together that way there's DMX
in<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.799> out<00:01:58.890> DMX<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.549> MIDI<00:01:59.790> for<00:02:00.240> lighting

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
in and out DMX like MIDI for lighting

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.109 
in and out DMX like MIDI for lighting
but<00:02:01.110> most<00:02:01.409> people<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:02.250> our<00:02:02.520> website<00:02:02.939> will

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
but most people on our website will

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.490 
but most people on our website will
probably<00:02:03.450> want<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.719> use<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.229> one<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.439> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
probably want to use this in one of the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.380 
probably want to use this in one of the
standalone<00:02:04.950> modes<00:02:05.280> by<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.909> way<00:02:06.030> these<00:02:06.119> bits

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
standalone modes by the way these bits

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.850 
standalone modes by the way these bits
here<00:02:06.570> there's<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.840> lock<00:02:07.079> here<00:02:07.350> which<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.649> quite

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
here there's a lock here which is quite

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.469 
here there's a lock here which is quite
good<00:02:08.039> for<00:02:08.069> locking<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.550> effect<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.119> also

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
good for locking the effect and also

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.479 
good for locking the effect and also
there<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:10.050> little<00:02:10.259> bit<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.099> screws<00:02:11.340> in

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
there is this little bit that screws in

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.160 
there is this little bit that screws in
here<00:02:11.670> it's<00:02:12.000> called<00:02:12.150> an<00:02:12.239> interlock<00:02:12.690> and

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
here it's called an interlock and

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.970 
here it's called an interlock and
without<00:02:13.470> that

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
without that

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.759 
without that
this<00:02:14.069> won't<00:02:14.280> work<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.819> without<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.769> the

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
this won't work the without that the the

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.580 
this won't work the without that the the
laser<00:02:16.950> won't<00:02:17.250> work<00:02:17.430> microphone<00:02:18.269> sensitivity

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
laser won't work microphone sensitivity

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.619 
laser won't work microphone sensitivity

listen out for your bass for your third
of<00:02:27.720> your<00:02:27.840> kick<00:02:27.989> drum<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.709> it<00:02:28.860> will<00:02:29.010> activate

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
of your kick drum so it will activate

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.670

lot of stuff going on here

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.720 
lot of stuff going on here
it<00:02:52.079> really<00:02:52.319> does<00:02:52.530> cover<00:02:52.769> all<00:02:53.010> your<00:02:53.040> bases<00:02:53.160> the
