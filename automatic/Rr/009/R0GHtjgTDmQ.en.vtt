00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.940
 the day 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:34.860
 I do not know what 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.860
 and the thing 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.150
 in the video and I saw that you said 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.760
 that there were people who did not think that 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.860
 you were smart that you have not 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.290
 explain to me how is that but explain it to me 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:02.060
 well sometimes at school I feel 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:02.060
 full of jokes and I feel bad 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:13.800
 but before saying no more let me 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.010
 tell him that I identify with you 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.230
 not because I was also the tumor in 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.880
 medicine has noticed me 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.530
 nobody notices me not even you 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.330
 girlfriend to the strange vices and 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.330

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.140

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.330

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.100

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:49.050
 the screen 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:52.620
 but everything I've done tells me read 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.530
 in the room where we slept three 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.560
 no loser or a fool I know everything 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.500
 what he says to you is wrong to meditate that 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.720
 jesse because there was a mind like a 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.259

 nobody will make you less bad worth a lot 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.660
 when one finds his way he begins to 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.400
 shine when you find your way 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.560
