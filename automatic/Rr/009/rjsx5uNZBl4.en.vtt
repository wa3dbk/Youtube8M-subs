00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:19.259 
going to be how to do HDR and the the

Adobe Lightroom dev team tells me that

Adobe Lightroom dev team tells me that
the<00:00:21.960> very<00:00:22.140> best<00:00:23.329> results<00:00:24.329> will<00:00:24.539> generally

the very best results will generally

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.139 
the very best results will generally
come<00:00:25.230> from<00:00:25.259> two<00:00:25.949> exposures<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.730> know<00:00:26.789> if<00:00:26.999> you've

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:27.149 
come from two exposures I know if you've

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:28.819 
come from two exposures I know if you've
been<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.419> big<00:00:27.749> HDR<00:00:28.259> fan<00:00:28.470> you're<00:00:28.649> probably

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
been a big HDR fan you're probably

been a big HDR fan you're probably
accustomed<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.369> doing<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:30.300> know<00:00:30.390> three<00:00:30.689> or

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
accustomed to doing you know three or

accustomed to doing you know three or
five<00:00:31.229> or<00:00:31.619> maybe<00:00:31.800> even<00:00:31.949> more<00:00:32.340> exposures<00:00:32.879> but

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
five or maybe even more exposures but

five or maybe even more exposures but
the<00:00:33.780> Lightroom<00:00:33.960> development<00:00:34.530> team<00:00:34.680> says<00:00:34.920> just

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
the Lightroom development team says just

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.369 
the Lightroom development team says just
to<00:00:35.340> do<00:00:35.489> two<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:36.300> may<00:00:36.510> partly<00:00:36.899> be<00:00:37.019> because

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
to do two that may partly be because

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:38.900 
to do two that may partly be because
they're<00:00:37.649> working<00:00:37.980> right<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.519> raw<00:00:38.670> data

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
they're working right on the raw data

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.090 
they're working right on the raw data
and<00:00:39.210> they're<00:00:39.629> taking<00:00:40.019> a<00:00:40.199> raw<00:00:40.440> file<00:00:40.769> and

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
and they're taking a raw file and

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.319 
and they're taking a raw file and
converting<00:00:41.609> it<00:00:41.699> into<00:00:41.850> another<00:00:42.510> raw<00:00:43.410> file<00:00:43.739> with

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
converting it into another raw file with

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.619 
converting it into another raw file with
even<00:00:45.329> more<00:00:46.129> dynamic<00:00:47.129> range<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.519> it<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.149> I'm

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
even more dynamic range in it so I'm

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.650 
even more dynamic range in it so I'm
going<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.899> show<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.140> got<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:50.480> this<00:00:51.480> guy

we'll<00:00:55.320> get<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.559> preview<00:00:55.890> box<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.339> pops<00:00:56.460> up

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
we'll get the preview box that pops up

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.430 
we'll get the preview box that pops up
and<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.300> will<00:00:57.480> pause<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:57.989> don't<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.289> to

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
and I will pause so you don't have to

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.770 
and I will pause so you don't have to
wait<00:00:58.589> for<00:00:58.769> this<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.070> I'll<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.249> right<00:00:59.370> back<00:00:59.780> now

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
wait for this and I'll be right back now

you can see we've got the starting

you can see we've got the starting
preview<00:01:02.489> from<00:01:02.969> Lightroom<00:01:03.570> for<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.280> HDR

Auto<00:01:09.480> align<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.050> always<00:01:10.320> smart<00:01:10.530> because<00:01:10.980> I

Auto align is always smart because I

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.980 
Auto align is always smart because I
never<00:01:11.370> use<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.760> tripod<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.420> tend<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.720> wiggle

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
never use a tripod so I tend to wiggle

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.850 
never use a tripod so I tend to wiggle
around<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.380> little<00:01:13.470> bit

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
more likely to be telling Lightroom to

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.180 
more likely to be telling Lightroom to
rely<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.950> one<00:01:26.490> exposure<00:01:26.940> or<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.390> other<00:01:27.980> and<00:01:28.980> in

rely on one exposure or the other and in
that<00:01:29.370> case<00:01:29.580> you<00:01:29.790> may<00:01:29.940> see<00:01:30.000> some<00:01:30.450> additional

that case you may see some additional

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820

because<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.630> can<00:01:39.780> see<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.290> one<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.530> my

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
because you can see that in one of my

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.410 
because you can see that in one of my
exposures<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.370> had<00:01:41.550> this<00:01:41.700> little<00:01:41.910> burst<00:01:42.240> of

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
exposures I had this little burst of

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.640 
exposures I had this little burst of
sunlight<00:01:42.720> coming<00:01:42.960> through<00:01:43.080> here<00:01:43.440> and<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
sunlight coming through here and the

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.170 
sunlight coming through here and the
other<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:43.980> did<00:01:44.220> not<00:01:44.400> and<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:44.760> ended<00:01:44.940> up<00:01:45.000> with

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
other one I did not and we ended up with

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.790 
other one I did not and we ended up with
this<00:01:45.330> wonky<00:01:45.720> artifact<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.410> I'm<00:01:46.500> going<00:01:46.650> to<00:01:46.710> hit

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
this wonky artifact so I'm going to hit

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.150 
this wonky artifact so I'm going to hit
low<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:48.060> we'll<00:01:48.270> see<00:01:48.420> how<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.750> looks

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.530 

usually<00:01:53.160> this<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.430> pretty<00:01:53.610> quick<00:01:53.850> yep<00:01:54.120> using

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
usually this is pretty quick yep using

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.330 
usually this is pretty quick yep using
it<00:01:54.780> more<00:01:55.020> or<00:01:55.110> less<00:01:55.260> takes<00:01:55.530> care<00:01:55.800> of<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:55.980> we<00:01:56.160> can

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
it more or less takes care of it we can

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.590 
it more or less takes care of it we can
play<00:01:56.460> with<00:01:56.640> some<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.910> these<00:01:56.970> other<00:01:57.210> ones<00:01:57.330> I'll

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
play with some of these other ones I'll

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.790 
play with some of these other ones I'll
leave<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.230> because<00:01:58.410> I<00:01:58.590> don't<00:01:58.620> want

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
leave that to you because I don't want

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.070 
leave that to you because I don't want

to waste your time okay let's hit merge
and<00:02:01.440> just<00:02:02.160> like<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.520> panels<00:02:02.910> it<00:02:03.240> goes<00:02:03.720> up<00:02:03.900> here

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
and just like the panels it goes up here

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.290 
and just like the panels it goes up here
to<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.800> progress<00:02:05.370> meter<00:02:05.640> I'm<00:02:05.910> going<00:02:06.120> to<00:02:06.180> hit

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
to a progress meter I'm going to hit

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.910 
to a progress meter I'm going to hit
pause<00:02:06.480> while<00:02:06.810> we<00:02:06.900> wait<00:02:07.050> for<00:02:07.260> that<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.560> complete

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
pause while we wait for that to complete

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.669 
pause while we wait for that to complete
and<00:02:08.129> then<00:02:08.310> I'll<00:02:08.399> show<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.700> what<00:02:08.850> we've<00:02:09.090> got

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
and then I'll show you what we've got

and then I'll show you what we've got
okay<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.830> see<00:02:11.070> we've<00:02:11.220> got<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.520> results<00:02:11.910> here

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
okay you see we've got the results here

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.410 
okay you see we've got the results here
in<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.180> library<00:02:12.600> grid

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
in the library grid

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.059 
in the library grid
and<00:02:13.510> here<00:02:13.960> we<00:02:14.080> are<00:02:14.110> in<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:14.410> develop<00:02:14.770> module

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
and here we are in the develop module

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.510 
and here we are in the develop module
you<00:02:15.220> can<00:02:15.250> see<00:02:15.520> that<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:16.319> lightroom<00:02:17.520> applied

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
you can see that it lightroom applied

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.730 
you can see that it lightroom applied
some<00:02:18.850> automatic<00:02:19.420> assumptions<00:02:20.050> about<00:02:20.319> you

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
some automatic assumptions about you

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.800 
some automatic assumptions about you
know<00:02:20.830> how<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.160> should<00:02:21.340> look<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:22.300> is<00:02:22.480> entirely

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
know how it should look this is entirely

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.990 
know how it should look this is entirely
up<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.350> this<00:02:23.680> is<00:02:23.740> still<00:02:24.100> a<00:02:24.130> raw<00:02:24.400> file<00:02:24.670> so

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
up to you this is still a raw file so

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.059 
up to you this is still a raw file so
you<00:02:25.030> still<00:02:25.390> have<00:02:25.569> complete<00:02:25.840> white<00:02:26.680> balance

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
you still have complete white balance

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.170 
you still have complete white balance
control<00:02:27.520> over<00:02:27.850> it

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
control over it

of<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.840> cartoony<00:02:35.380> HDR<00:02:35.920> look<00:02:36.130> it<00:02:36.340> is<00:02:36.790> nice<00:02:37.000> to

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
of the cartoony HDR look it is nice to

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.210 
of the cartoony HDR look it is nice to
have<00:02:37.360> some<00:02:37.720> of<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:38.020> cleaner<00:02:38.350> shadow<00:02:38.740> details

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
have some of the cleaner shadow details

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.580 
have some of the cleaner shadow details
there<00:02:39.580> then<00:02:39.790> we<00:02:39.970> would<00:02:40.090> get<00:02:40.540> from<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.170> single

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
there then we would get from a single

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.550 
there then we would get from a single
exposure<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.940> but<00:02:43.569> it's<00:02:43.810> totally<00:02:44.170> up<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.319> you

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560
