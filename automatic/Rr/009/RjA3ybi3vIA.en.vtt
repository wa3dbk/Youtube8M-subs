00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:08.910
 hello i want you the new one today 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:11.840
 nescafé dolce gusto sukalo automatic from 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.639
 de'longhi imagine what a hammer 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.890
 but I have through the insider the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.609
 possibility get this machine too 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.100
 test 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.140
 and as you can see i have them in red 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.189
 In addition, they still exist in there 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.840
 black or silver and priced 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.700
 at about 180 euros 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.530
 Included in the delivery was under 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.579
 other synonymous say yes I take 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.100
 sometimes waste container there is still one 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.820
 integrated catch basin where the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.719
 capsules can drain 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.550
 Well, I have the machine ever 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.840
 turned on why one here shines 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.170
 green lamp 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.300
 when you start the machine or you 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.829
 then do the whole thing here 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.559
 and then it takes about 30 seconds 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:05.880
 is ready to start one can with the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.159
 Machine cold as well as hot drinks 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.479
 do 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.920
 and yes, one still has one here 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:17.070
 Regulator where you have different bars 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.729
 from 1 to 7 can set so ever 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.369
 the less bars the stronger the drink 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.290
 the more two the more water and the more 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.040
 weaker the drink so 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.420
 For example, you want an espresso 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.430
 then prepare to take one 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.890
 bars or two depending on what is on the 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.210
 pack or you want one 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.350
 then prepare coffee, for example 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:44.600
 seven beams he at the back of the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.820
 machine is the water tank 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.790
 I think it's a bit unhappy 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.350
 for me anyway 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.210
 usually the machine is with me 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.460
 in the corner that is every time I go 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.079
 I would like to refill the water 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.380
 pull the machine forward and the 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.509
 Remove the water container lord 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.020
 I would like to do now times before but 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.759
 I can do it with one hand 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.830
 that's why it's a bit unhappy 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.330
 I think I would have somehow 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.770
 an inflow that I the water from above 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.880
 Can run somewhere like that 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.670
 what would I have wished for 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.410
 the tank is quite big so you 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.850
 It can easily make four drinks 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.850
 prepare so it's okay 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.360
 then we come to the words I 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.880
 I've got a total of total here 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.100
 Eight dead get a buckle latte 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.110
 macchiato delicious is good everywhere 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.780
 arrived 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.900
 there is a total of about 30 I think 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.160
 So everyone really should 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.800
 to find something 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.810
 also for children without caffeine 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.740
 then drink chocolate or iced tea 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.570
 espresso for the adult or latte 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:02.600
 macchiato cappuccino really what 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:06.060
 the heart is in every pack 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.540
 16 capsules and cappuccino 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.730
 For example, there are two colors once 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.920
 white for the milk farm and once the 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:19.830
 brown for the actual café one 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.720
 pack costs 449 but I have them too 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.910
 already seen for 479 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.580
 then you have to take care and that 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.920
 offer to wait I think so 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.540
 quite expensive 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:35.390
 the time now down breaks so 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.530
 between 30 and 60 cents per drink 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.019
 For example, trees where we have them 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.470
 here at the normal coffee are 16 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.330
 contain caps and you get too 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.610
 actually 16 drinks out at the 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.660
 cappuccino, on the other hand, only 8 since now 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.019
 needs two capsules per drink but 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.430
 we just have one to prepare and 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.530
 that's what I do not want to show you 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.450
 this relegated here is that 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.610
 adjustable as, for example, a 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.460
 then you can do that 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.070
 here above 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.840
 neither do I inject and inject 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:12.190
 I'll go to the middle now 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.500
 put the rail and then the glass so what 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:19.300
 I also absolutely have a must is 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.610
 These are this lighting the LED 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.930
 The lamps set the drink correctly 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:27.210
 in scene 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:32.620
 I think that's really nice and then strong 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:36.630
 on the pack is that you have six of 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:39.610
 setting seven bars must do that 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.220
 then you make it up next to her and 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:47.560
 then we come out and pull out of here 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:51.610
 then starts with the soft capsule 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.410
 so magnetic as the head of and then 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.530
 pushes us down but is the foil 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.970
 by poking and then you can too 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.970
 already strong with red 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:09.469
 find the machine also quite quiet 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:12.489
 also quite space save as I think 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:15.949
 she is quite slim that is quite good 

00:05:12.489 --> 00:05:20.419
 and yes, at the age of 15, that's going to happen 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:22.219
 water through the capsule pressed it 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.489
 It really does not take too long 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:28.820
 even if you receive guests you have 

00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:31.250
 no time consuming 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:35.540
 and you 're done with that 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:38.450
 milk foam looks wonderful so that 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:44.780
 This one drip stop function 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:46.340
 if you do that up here now 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.960
 get her out and just pour it 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:53.510
 here in this garbage bin and now 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:58.390
 comes the brown capsule have only one 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:06:04.600
 bar the requirements are a simple 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:04.600
 back down and go on 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:23.229
 in total, that should now be 250 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:26.659
 Milliliter since I know that this 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:31.430
 glass 220 meters is designed so white 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:33.229
 I do not know what's wrong there as well 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.270
 she is not a drip stop function 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:38.990
 understand is sometimes not yourself 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.340
 Brown cup are always dripping after a long time 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.349
 but I think I begrudge the 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.990
 machine usually one minute approximately 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:48.289
 to drip out otherwise you can yes 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:51.199
 also turn the lever up and then 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:55.069
 just listen to it dripping goes 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:58.389
 the rest yes and then you can the 

00:06:55.069 --> 00:07:01.009
 whole thing here again in the container 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:06.560
 so I do not know so well yet 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:08.870
 find is yes that the capsules just the 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.740
 Soft still following water are 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.930
 that means if I have one now 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.270
 press a little bit then runs the whole 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.909
 thing is really like a capsule full 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.589
 with water and then I have it all 

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:20.479
 that does not mean so do not want to be surrounded like that 

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:21.860
 Well, you have to look really good 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:23.870
 let drop I cut the 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.680
 sometimes even on the whole water 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:29.930
 come out and if the light is 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.589
 that may make a bit of a difference 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:34.460
 better 

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:36.080
 the sun just seems to see that 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:40.610
 but wonderful as I think for 

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:43.669
 the home is not great for all days 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:47.389
 it is a bit too expensive for me but so 

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:49.099
 for sunday afternoon or if you are at 

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:51.430
 friday from work is awesome 

00:07:49.099 --> 00:07:53.689
 especially if you receive guests 

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:57.650
 I think the machine is great 

00:07:53.689 --> 00:08:00.610
 yes I can recommend the 

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.960
 Drinks all taste very delicious and 

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:05.199
 I let go too well and now 

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.199
 ask
