don't<00:03:12.269> think<00:03:12.450> you<00:03:12.510> can<00:03:12.690> just<00:03:12.780> buy<00:03:13.049> this<00:03:13.109> thing

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
don't think you can just buy this thing

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.840 
don't think you can just buy this thing
cuz<00:03:13.769> I'm<00:03:13.829> pretty<00:03:14.010> sure<00:03:14.130> they<00:03:14.220> custom<00:03:14.609> make<00:03:14.730> it

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
cuz I'm pretty sure they custom make it

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.940 
cuz I'm pretty sure they custom make it
every<00:03:15.090> time<00:03:15.329> but<00:03:15.930> it's<00:03:16.170> got<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.319> maximus<00:03:16.769> eight
