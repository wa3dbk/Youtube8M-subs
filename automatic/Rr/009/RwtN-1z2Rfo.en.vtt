 to ensure the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee in the international market and 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.020
 meet the growing demand of the domestic market was created in 1997 the consortium 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.310
 coffee research 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.880
 However, the objective has already been developed through partnerships 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.670
 research in a cafe with solutions for technological support of the 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.250
 coffee agribusiness in brazil 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.870
 the consortium research coffee is an experiment on average the new cucumber 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.390
 which brings together dozens of institutions dedicated to teaching 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.750
 technology and technology research should transfer technology under 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.290
 coordination of africa work of pac affection 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.750
 god of creation the coffee research consortium 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.310
 has become an important center of production discipline are of 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.280
 scientific knowledge through the transfer of 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.319
 integrated information directed to the peer segments of the agro-industrial chain 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:52.319
 of coffee

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:31.929
 resistant to the main pests and diseases of coffee and with high 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:37.179
 many of these cultivars are already so widely used in 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:40.179
 main producing regions of the country 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:46.059
 and the technical factories in life consisting of the production of clonal seedlings 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:50.399
 of large-scale arabica coffee from 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:54.779
 characteristics oudin than the added value 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:59.549
 the result is the production of cultivars with a reduction of about 30 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.299
 days everything has a little case of conventionally and with cloned seedlings 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.369
 this high added value which gives Brazilian coffee more competitiveness 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:12.099
 in the international market in deir national 'she 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:19.139
 the biggest challenge faced by the coffee research consortium is the weight 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.860
 involvement of sustainable technologies 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.860
 which increases coffee productivity without compromising the environment 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.470
 respect for the environment combined with the improvement of productive processes 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.820
 results in better quality Brazilian coffee

 the consortium is developed by the consortium

 is the suspension of irrigation for a certain period 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:13.849
 known as leading debut with which allows the uniformity of the 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.889
 flowering and the maintenance of the flowerbed producing a
