good<00:01:00.629> for<00:01:00.960> gift<00:01:01.859> cards<00:01:01.949> when<00:01:02.850> you're<00:01:03.000> giving

that<00:01:57.210> much<00:01:57.360> more<00:01:57.420> difficult<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:58.079> put<00:01:58.229> them<00:01:58.320> in

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
that much more difficult to put them in

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.249 
that much more difficult to put them in
the<00:01:58.469> mail<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.829> someone<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.930> then<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.049> last

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
the mail to someone and then the last

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.740 
the mail to someone and then the last
one<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.860> created<00:02:01.979> which<00:02:02.790> might<00:02:03.329> be<00:02:03.540> my

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
one that I created which might be my

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.699 
one that I created which might be my
favorite<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:06.049> this<00:02:07.049> one<00:02:07.819> there's<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.910> little

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
favorite is this one there's a little

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.740 
favorite is this one there's a little
Eiffel<00:02:10.709> Tower<00:02:10.920> die-cut<00:02:11.430> back<00:02:11.610> there<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.599> is

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
Eiffel Tower die-cut back there this is

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.670 
Eiffel Tower die-cut back there this is
actually<00:02:13.170> some

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
actually some

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.410 
actually some
but<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:13.950> just<00:02:14.219> cut<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.459> little<00:02:14.579> small<00:02:14.969> piece<00:02:15.209> off

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
but I just cut a little small piece off

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.289 
but I just cut a little small piece off
and<00:02:15.659> I<00:02:15.719> wound<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.769> around<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.489> roses<00:02:17.939> to<00:02:18.150> get

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
and I wound it around the roses to get

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.929 
and I wound it around the roses to get
that<00:02:18.590> look<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.920> then<00:02:20.519> a<00:02:20.549> little<00:02:20.700> piece<00:02:20.879> of

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
that look and then a little piece of

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.509 
that look and then a little piece of
seam<00:02:21.269> binding<00:02:21.769> again<00:02:22.769> I<00:02:22.829> didn't<00:02:23.189> put<00:02:23.310> anything

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
seam binding again I didn't put anything

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.069 
seam binding again I didn't put anything
in<00:02:23.730> here<00:02:23.879> because<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.420> was<00:02:24.569> thinking<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:24.959> this

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
in here because I was thinking of this

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.709 
in here because I was thinking of this
as<00:02:25.260> kind<00:02:25.469> of<00:02:25.620> gift<00:02:25.829> card<00:02:26.069> holders<00:02:26.450> this<00:02:27.450> one's

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
as kind of gift card holders this one's

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.259 
as kind of gift card holders this one's
slightly<00:02:27.989> different<00:02:28.650> because<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:28.980> decided<00:02:29.549> to

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
slightly different because I decided to

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.110 
slightly different because I decided to
just<00:02:30.659> create<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.989> little<00:02:31.049> card<00:02:31.760> so<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.790> left<00:02:33.000> the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
just create a little card so I left the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.979 
just create a little card so I left the
inside<00:02:33.420> lengths<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.870> could<00:02:34.019> put<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:34.769> message<00:02:35.989> put

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
inside lengths I could put a message put

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.420 
inside lengths I could put a message put
that<00:02:37.139> on<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.439> front<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.829> kind<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.069> stick<00:02:38.280> with

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
that on the front to kind of stick with

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.199 
that on the front to kind of stick with
a<00:02:38.459> Parisian<00:02:38.909> theme<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:40.670> there's<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:41.969> one

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
a Parisian theme and there's that one

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.339 
a Parisian theme and there's that one
now<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:44.250> first<00:02:44.549> two<00:02:44.909> that<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.780> showed<00:02:46.109> you

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
now the first two that I showed you

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.089 
now the first two that I showed you
these<00:02:46.739> two<00:02:47.099> I<00:02:47.389> have<00:02:48.389> the<00:02:49.230> measurements<00:02:49.919> and

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
these two I have the measurements and

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.649 
these two I have the measurements and
directions<00:02:50.790> on<00:02:50.909> how<00:02:50.939> I<00:02:51.090> put<00:02:51.299> these<00:02:51.419> two

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
directions on how I put these two

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:56.000 
directions on how I put these two
together<00:02:52.250> on<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.310> video<00:02:53.639> that<00:02:53.939> should<00:02:54.389> be<00:02:55.010> right

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
together on a video that should be right

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.490 
together on a video that should be right
before<00:02:56.340> this<00:02:56.519> one<00:02:56.730> or<00:02:56.970> very<00:02:57.750> close<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.079> it<00:02:58.290> so

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
before this one or very close to it so

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.929 
before this one or very close to it so
you<00:02:58.590> can<00:02:58.620> check<00:02:58.889> that<00:02:58.919> out<00:02:59.069> for<00:02:59.340> all<00:02:59.400> those<00:02:59.669> if

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
you can check that out for all those if

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.539 
you can check that out for all those if
you're<00:03:00.060> if<00:03:00.359> you're<00:03:00.450> interested<00:03:01.079> in<00:03:01.549> the

same except for the insert piece and I
have<00:03:08.250> those<00:03:08.459> measurements<00:03:08.969> for<00:03:09.120> people<00:03:09.419> who

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
have those measurements for people who

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.979 
have those measurements for people who
are<00:03:09.629> interested<00:03:09.870> so<00:03:10.319> for<00:03:10.829> this<00:03:10.889> little<00:03:11.159> card<00:03:11.489> I

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
are interested so for this little card I

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:18.199 
are interested so for this little card I
just<00:03:13.310> made<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.340> 4<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.450> 1/4<00:03:16.019> inches<00:03:16.500> wide<00:03:16.769> by<00:03:17.669> 4

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
just made it 4 and 1/4 inches wide by 4

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.409 
just made it 4 and 1/4 inches wide by 4
and<00:03:18.479> 3/8<00:03:18.989> inches<00:03:19.620> tall<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.220> that<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.269> the

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
and 3/8 inches tall and that is the

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.349 
and 3/8 inches tall and that is the
measurement<00:03:21.840> for<00:03:22.829> this<00:03:23.010> little<00:03:23.280> card<00:03:23.519> the

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
measurement for this little card the

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.789 
measurement for this little card the
only<00:03:24.599> other<00:03:24.750> thing<00:03:24.989> that's<00:03:25.019> different<00:03:25.260> is

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
only other thing that's different is

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.969 
only other thing that's different is
that<00:03:25.979> I<00:03:26.250> did<00:03:26.669> not<00:03:27.049> put<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.470> piece<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.709> adhesive

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:28.979 
that I did not put the piece of adhesive

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:31.939 
that I did not put the piece of adhesive
the<00:03:29.400> little<00:03:29.549> piece<00:03:29.639> of<00:03:29.790> score<00:03:30.030> tape<00:03:30.530> here<00:03:31.530> this

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
the little piece of score tape here this

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.069 
the little piece of score tape here this
is<00:03:32.069> a<00:03:32.099> little<00:03:32.310> bit<00:03:32.430> wider<00:03:32.639> because<00:03:32.909> I<00:03:33.479> was<00:03:34.049> a

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
is a little bit wider because I was a

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.399 
is a little bit wider because I was a
little<00:03:34.260> worried<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.650> was<00:03:34.799> going<00:03:34.919> to<00:03:34.979> put

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
little worried that I was going to put

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.659 
little worried that I was going to put
you<00:03:37.409> know<00:03:37.500> too<00:03:37.560> much<00:03:37.799> dimension<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:38.639> I

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
you know too much dimension on it and I

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.309 
you know too much dimension on it and I
wanted<00:03:39.000> this<00:03:39.150> card<00:03:39.449> to<00:03:39.599> have<00:03:39.750> room<00:03:39.989> to<00:03:40.169> grow

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
wanted this card to have room to grow

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.710 
wanted this card to have room to grow
you<00:03:40.919> know<00:03:41.010> in<00:03:41.099> case<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.310> got<00:03:41.579> kind<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.269> poofier

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
you know in case I got kind of poofier

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.809 
you know in case I got kind of poofier
so<00:03:43.470> if<00:03:43.560> you'll<00:03:43.680> notice<00:03:43.769> this<00:03:44.220> one<00:03:44.280> like<00:03:44.699> I<00:03:44.790> said

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
so if you'll notice this one like I said

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.129 
so if you'll notice this one like I said
it's<00:03:45.090> not<00:03:45.209> adhered<00:03:45.750> these<00:03:46.439> if<00:03:46.859> you<00:03:46.979> go<00:03:47.009> to<00:03:47.189> look

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
it's not adhered these if you go to look

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.979 
it's not adhered these if you go to look
are<00:03:49.139> so<00:03:49.650> they<00:03:49.769> don't<00:03:49.949> open<00:03:50.009> his<00:03:50.250> wife<00:03:50.459> okay<00:03:51.150> so

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
are so they don't open his wife okay so

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.240 
are so they don't open his wife okay so
that's<00:03:52.169> the<00:03:52.349> big<00:03:52.500> difference<00:03:52.590> again<00:03:53.099> the

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
that's the big difference again the

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.129 
that's the big difference again the
