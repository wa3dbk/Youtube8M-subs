00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.230
 nervous about the same but I already improved a 

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:12.280
 little why 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:16.940
 I stopped talking about this 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:20.570
 but the three greens and alexis in this 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.880
 moment presents lesions 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.859
 they call laryngeal nodules because 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.310
 they are in the larynx if you do not take care of yourself 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.619
 we can finish even in the operating room and 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.689
 so it is very important that you take care 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.760
 your voice this week that you do not talk keep 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.000
 vocal rest has to keep watching you 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.239
 do not talk and do not sing now if it's your 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.239
 responsibility 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.620
 one 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.239
 had an important challenge because he had 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.430
 to prepare the song without being able to speak 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.670
 whatever it was for you it was not very difficult not 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.200
 so much ok ok 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.090
 I want you to prepare at home because 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.650
 this is a great musical and I know that 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.810
 Alexis is a boy who has a lot 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.390
 heart and you will achieve this challenge 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.090
 true yes 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.159

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.930
