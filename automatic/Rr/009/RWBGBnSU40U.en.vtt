 Cover and leave the chicken in the sauce for half an hour 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Half an hour later 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Copy the rest of the oil in the Tajin 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 And turn it until it turns blue 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Add onions and then green onions 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Then red pepper 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Add a water cup to the remaining chicken broth 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 And we pour it in the tajine 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Finally add chickpeas 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Cover the tajine 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 And leave it for twenty minutes 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Then turn the chicken over and cover it again 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 For twenty-five minutes 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 So the chicken is cooked 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Season with salt and camomile 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Wrap it to form a small rod 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Pour the boiled potatoes 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000

 Place the peppers on top 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 After the Tajin is cooked, let it cool down a bit 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
