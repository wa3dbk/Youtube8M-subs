00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
York I guess kind of this Connecticut

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.870 
York I guess kind of this Connecticut
New<00:01:54.299> England<00:01:54.329> area<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.549> know<00:01:56.670> there's

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
New England area and you know there's

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.029 
New England area and you know there's
mountains<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.420> trees<00:01:57.450> there<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.170> how<00:01:58.770> one

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
mountains and trees there and how one

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.800 
mountains and trees there and how one
moves<00:01:59.310> through<00:01:59.609> snowy<00:01:59.850> mountains<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.509> trees

moves through snowy mountains and trees

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.749 
moves through snowy mountains and trees
is<00:02:01.259> entirely<00:02:01.619> different<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.219> how<00:02:02.399> one<00:02:02.609> you

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
is entirely different to how one you

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.359 
is entirely different to how one you

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.919 
Constantinople less of a parkour thing
there's<00:02:07.950> there's<00:02:08.129> more<00:02:08.340> kind<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:09.750> see

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
there's there's more kind of you see

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.360 
there's there's more kind of you see
them<00:02:10.019> walking<00:02:10.170> through<00:02:10.470> snow<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.830> he's<00:02:11.190> sort

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
them walking through snow and he's sort

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.860 
them walking through snow and he's sort
of<00:02:11.400> trudging<00:02:11.640> through<00:02:12.000> snow<00:02:12.239> which<00:02:12.720> i<00:02:12.810> think

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
of trudging through snow which i think

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.869 
of trudging through snow which i think
is<00:02:13.019> fascinating<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.980> course<00:02:14.310> we<00:02:14.459> also<00:02:14.610> see

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
is fascinating of course we also see

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.089 
is fascinating of course we also see
animals<00:02:15.390> there's<00:02:15.629> a<00:02:15.690> there<00:02:16.110> are<00:02:16.140> bears<00:02:16.530> for

excited about bears are cool there's
going<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.590> be<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.739> skinning<00:02:23.519> I<00:02:23.700> guess<00:02:23.910> sort<00:02:24.209> of

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
going to be a skinning I guess sort of

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.569 
going to be a skinning I guess sort of
skinning<00:02:24.510> fur<00:02:24.810> trapping<00:02:25.080> kind<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.590> side<00:02:26.280> thing

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
skinning fur trapping kind of side thing

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.330 
skinning fur trapping kind of side thing
that<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.790> can<00:02:26.940> do<00:02:27.120> just<00:02:28.079> which<00:02:28.380> is<00:02:28.530> cool<00:02:28.739> one

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
powerful thing and one of the big parts

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.490 
powerful thing and one of the big parts
here<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.129> it<00:02:50.250> can<00:02:50.340> have<00:02:50.549> like<00:02:50.959> 2,000<00:02:51.959> NPCs
