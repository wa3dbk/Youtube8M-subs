00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:12.420
 [music] 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:14.309
 hello everyone I sang with you and it's 43 to 43 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.039
 part of the long hard mechanism in this part 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.199
 I will show you as I promised 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:22.260
 ultra compact comfort door 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.210
 2 on the 2nd floor is more comfortable than this one 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.220
 we built in the previous lego series 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.679
 need too costs more compact and 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.040
 scheme nemo pits unfortunately and to such not 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.040
 I thought it was a great scheme and 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.570
 almighty well ka i recently became 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.550
 watch his channel this man is 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.510
 Englishman well, or an American you sit like 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.800
 I would not shy in general its channel is called 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.379
 Meinkravt family 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.180
 I think the link I will leave in the description you 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.250
 You can look out for something there, but in general 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.610
 he is american and that's what i will say first 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.910
 turn 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:05.189
 so watching his video is very hard 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:08.430
 very incomprehensible there how to build everything but 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.860
 he relies on he has such 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.110
 You know the video where it builds let's say 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.320
 same door for a minute video that is 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.439
 Lasts exactly a minute not a minute 0 1 exactly 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.070
 minute and minute he is quick all 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.229
 the door is ready in general according to this from 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.330
 a short tutorial and built it in 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.250
 in general 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.770
 man I am of course at all 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.610
 respected such arrangements came up 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.930
 four piston doors for example four 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.040
 four here look i have 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.470
 3 to 3 piston door 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.540
 which I built myself 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.210
 without what garth without anyone's guide 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.950
 honestly generally and immediately used 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:57.829
 sand and sand as much as if not to the frame 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.520
 but it will be something like this 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:03.380
 business 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:05.509
 and this block it will always be in any 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.769
 three for three doors will remain here 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:13.940
 this block is incomprehensible here I prefer 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:17.120
 sand so therefore i use sand but 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.790
 he came up with a scheme that is 3 by 3 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.310
 the door is really the one that's the average 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.950
 a block somehow porsche left extends 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.920
 he also takes him behind him also 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.130
 came up with four by four door that 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.730
 generally just hard 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.670
 and also he came up with a bunch of piston 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.780
 elevators and not only them but as already 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.450
 I understood the practice of piston lifts for me 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:48.200
 sick theme whether it is mine mine 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.950
 something i have piston pistons me 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.019
 I push the waist design for many there 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.650
 watched cigarette videos cool cool 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:00.859
 the elevator works for me there somewhere to read 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.079
 the theme of the patch is this video and for some reason 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.510
 does not work can too already 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.319
 A new version of maynkrafta and you, too, and 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.019
 maybe this 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.639
 this is such an elevator does not work well in general yes 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.310
 why you have deviated from the topic 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:16.579
 let's start building the door here 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:22.459
 so that's what we put the model 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:28.880
 wall six by six so here's your 6 on 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:32.090
 3 and break the door for the door shorter 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:38.230
 Generally place and set as usual hidden 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.230
 piston doors here like this 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:47.880
 here the blocks and make the roof too, and somehow 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.980
 only wider which means that we need 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.440
 do we need to dig up this 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.890
 piston hole and last to pistons and 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.110
 do like this hold hold 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.770
 roadstone here put fakin here torch 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.320
 and set Peter's round delay of 3 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.080
 As far as I remember 4, we are already launching 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.200
 here is a block and here we put here 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.600
 Redstone This block is powered by 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.460
 Redstone that it is powered from the unit 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.760
 which is powered by a repeater which 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:21.090
 powered by a torch in general here with 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.810
 This aspect of the matter as well, and with any 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.000
 absolute side you decide which one 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.420
 me here on the one hand here 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:39.030
 another at all no difference set over 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:41.160
 torch block redstone repeater and like this 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.180
 that is the letter and 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.070
 yes not a letter well, I do not know Tetris 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.740
 there is such a figure 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:56.010
 Well, in general , everything is ready everything works 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:58.230
 just put this one wrong 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:02.790
 I'll put it here in general 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:06.320
 let's say a lever and everything should work it 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:11.760
 I'm just doing nothing. 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:15.860
 somewhere in something i was wrong and harry potter 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:18.860
 on four delays clearly clear sorry 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.560
 So yes it works but we like 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.219
 ravana connect in front so a 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.250
 invented 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:28.159
 easy very easy such a scheme 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.479
 connecting is very easy and simple in 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:35.539
 general here and so just go to redstone 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:40.210
 but oh so from this side where is matt 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:43.580
 Stone are closing beguiled and in general that 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.650
 here we have a lever let's say I 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.770
 I prefer here levers on the block 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:53.000
 higher then everything is redstone here and 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:56.060
 Peter and so here he goes in general here 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.310
 so here we connect the repeaters to 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.669
 the scheme did not turn on whose torch is not 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:05.960
 It will work here and so in general, all 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:09.169
 closed the door we have the door running 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:14.029
 we are ready now I have three such Tver 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:17.479
 2 need to remove this is not a buzz in general 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:20.240
 thank you all for watching it was 43 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:22.580
 part of the minecraft mechanism subscribe 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:27.849
 we like to put videos on the channel 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:33.370
 write comments and questions anything and 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:33.370
 Well, in general, you have been singing all while
