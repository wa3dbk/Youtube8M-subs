everybody apparently Rockstar released a

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.130 
everybody apparently Rockstar released a
comment<00:02:49.030> on<00:02:49.120> like<00:02:49.300> why<00:02:49.480> people<00:02:49.540> were<00:02:49.930> being

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
comment on like why people were being

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.740 
comment on like why people were being
reset<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:50.620> stuff<00:02:50.830> um<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:51.880> it's<00:02:52.360> because<00:02:52.630> they

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
reset and stuff um and it's because they

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.690 
reset and stuff um and it's because they
made<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:52.960> characters<00:02:53.530> before<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:54.100> patch<00:02:54.310> and

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
made the characters before the patch and

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.300 
made the characters before the patch and
those<00:02:55.180> characters<00:02:55.800> freeze<00:02:56.800> during<00:02:57.010> some

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
those characters freeze during some

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.070 
those characters freeze during some
missions<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:58.000> stuff<00:02:58.180> like<00:02:58.300> that<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:58.750> they're

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
missions and stuff like that so they're

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.920 
missions and stuff like that so they're
removing<00:02:59.440> their<00:02:59.980> data<00:03:00.340> out<00:03:00.640> of<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.820> cloud<00:03:01.060> so

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
removing their data out of the cloud so

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.160 
removing their data out of the cloud so
that<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.170> doesn't<00:03:02.410> corrupt<00:03:02.560> other<00:03:02.770> users<00:03:03.220> so

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
that it doesn't corrupt other users so

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.780 
that it doesn't corrupt other users so
it's<00:03:05.170> nothing<00:03:05.350> that<00:03:05.560> it's<00:03:05.830> just<00:03:06.100> one<00:03:06.340> person

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
it's nothing that it's just one person

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.070 
it's nothing that it's just one person
it's<00:03:06.910> definitely<00:03:07.300> like<00:03:07.420> a<00:03:07.570> lot<00:03:07.810> of<00:03:07.840> people

all the people that created their
characters<00:03:21.250> before<00:03:21.640> they<00:03:21.790> update<00:03:22.150> that

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
characters before they update that

Rockstar<00:03:23.290> released<00:03:23.590> not<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:24.060> not<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.210> update

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
Rockstar released not the not the update

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.300 
Rockstar released not the not the update
that<00:03:25.690> Sony<00:03:25.930> released<00:03:26.350> or<00:03:26.560> not<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:27.040> update

that Sony released or not the update
that<00:03:27.570> Xbox<00:03:28.570> released<00:03:28.960> I<00:03:29.110> don't<00:03:29.260> even<00:03:29.320> think

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
that Xbox released I don't even think

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.050 
that Xbox released I don't even think
they<00:03:29.650> released<00:03:29.980> an<00:03:30.100> update<00:03:30.370> but<00:03:30.520> even<00:03:30.850> if<00:03:30.940> they

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
they released an update but even if they

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.060 
they released an update but even if they
did<00:03:31.120> they<00:03:31.390> it's<00:03:32.380> not<00:03:32.650> that<00:03:32.860> update<00:03:33.570> so<00:03:35.070> it's

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
did they it's not that update so it's

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.850 
did they it's not that update so it's
definitely<00:03:36.520> not<00:03:36.610> just<00:03:37.570> you<00:03:38.550> I<00:03:40.410> was<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.590> point

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
definitely not just you I was to a point

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.590 
definitely not just you I was to a point
where<00:03:41.980> I<00:03:42.010> had<00:03:42.250> like<00:03:42.370> a<00:03:42.430> hundred<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.030> ninety

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
where I had like a hundred and ninety

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.360 
where I had like a hundred and ninety
thousand<00:03:44.110> dollars<00:03:44.380> I<00:03:44.500> was<00:03:44.620> almost<00:03:44.830> close<00:03:45.220> to

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
thousand dollars I was almost close to

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.970 
thousand dollars I was almost close to
getting<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.700> other<00:03:45.850> apartment<00:03:46.360> and<00:03:46.770> or<00:03:47.770> the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
getting the other apartment and or the

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.680 
getting the other apartment and or the
most<00:03:48.340> expensive<00:03:48.730> apartment<00:03:49.360> a<00:03:49.390> second

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
most expensive apartment a second

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.570 
most expensive apartment a second
expensive<00:03:50.140> apartment<00:03:51.010> for<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.250> two-car

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580

expensive apartment for the two-car
garage<00:03:51.850> one<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.150> think<00:03:52.330> it's<00:03:52.450> like<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.570> 10<00:03:52.840> car

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
garage one I think it's like a 10 car

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.030 
garage one I think it's like a 10 car
garage<00:03:53.350> actually<00:03:55.350> but<00:03:56.350> I<00:03:56.380> was<00:03:56.530> so<00:03:56.680> close<00:03:56.860> to

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
garage actually but I was so close to
