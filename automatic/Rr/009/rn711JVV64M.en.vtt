00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.750 

you<00:02:56.650> can<00:02:56.770> pick<00:02:56.980> them<00:02:57.100> all<00:02:57.280> if<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.460> like<00:02:57.610> as

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
you can pick them all if you like as

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.180 
you can pick them all if you like as
well<00:03:01.020> which<00:03:02.020> is<00:03:02.050> faster<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.650> do<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.920> pull<00:03:03.070> off

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
well which is faster to do the pull off

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.810 
well which is faster to do the pull off
so<00:03:03.430> so<00:03:04.390> anyway<00:03:04.480> that's<00:03:04.780> it's<00:03:05.440> a<00:03:05.560> useful<00:03:06.220> leg<00:03:06.580> to

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
so so anyway that's it's a useful leg to

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.520 
so so anyway that's it's a useful leg to
that's<00:03:07.240> good<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.630> know<00:03:07.660> you<00:03:07.960> can<00:03:07.990> use<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:08.410> in<00:03:08.500> a

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
that's good to know you can use it in a

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:19.110 
that's good to know you can use it in a
lot<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.650> blues<00:03:08.920> to<00:03:09.130> us<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:18.790> don't<00:03:18.940> have<00:03:19.030> to

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
lot of blues to us you don't have to

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.390 

you<00:03:48.840> know<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.710> can<00:03:49.890> mess<00:03:50.040> around<00:03:50.160> with<00:03:50.340> that

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
you know you can mess around with that

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.700 
you know you can mess around with that
Lake<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:50.850> fit<00:03:51.060> it<00:03:51.150> into<00:03:51.300> blues<00:03:51.630> licks<00:03:52.620> that

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.800 
Lake and fit it into blues licks that
you<00:03:52.890> already<00:03:53.130> know<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.520> it's<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:54.480> good<00:03:54.570> one<00:03:54.690> to

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
you already know and it's a good one to

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.690 
you already know and it's a good one to
know<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.410> by<00:03:55.740> the<00:03:55.770> way<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.100> sound<00:03:56.280> I'm<00:03:56.520> using

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
know and by the way the sound I'm using

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.870 
know and by the way the sound I'm using
I<00:03:56.970> just<00:03:57.180> got<00:03:57.360> back<00:03:57.570> my<00:03:57.810> Marshall<00:03:58.320> JVM<00:03:58.950> for<00:03:59.610> 10

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
I just got back my Marshall JVM for 10

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.980 
I just got back my Marshall JVM for 10
100<00:04:00.360> watt<00:04:00.540> head

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
100 watt head

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.490 
100 watt head
I<00:04:01.020> got<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.620> modified<00:04:02.220> done<00:04:03.030> some<00:04:03.270> mojo<00:04:03.990> to<00:04:04.380> it

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
I got it modified done some mojo to it

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.530 
I got it modified done some mojo to it
and<00:04:04.740> I<00:04:05.370> think<00:04:05.580> the<00:04:05.670> end<00:04:05.820> result<00:04:05.970> is<00:04:06.330> pretty

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
and I think the end result is pretty

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.050 
and I think the end result is pretty
sweet<00:04:06.720> so<00:04:07.140> I'm<00:04:07.980> going<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.250> be<00:04:08.340> using<00:04:08.610> this<00:04:08.700> a

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
sweet so I'm going to be using this a

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.300 
sweet so I'm going to be using this a
lot<00:04:09.660> more<00:04:09.930> hopefully<00:04:10.380> hopefully<00:04:10.890> doesn't

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
lot more hopefully hopefully doesn't

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:42.300 
lot more hopefully hopefully doesn't
break<00:04:11.490> down<00:04:11.520> like<00:04:11.880> I<00:04:11.910> did<00:04:12.000> before

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.240 

I'm<00:04:42.580> just<00:04:42.790> going<00:04:42.970> into<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.440> ot1<00:04:44.440> channel

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
I'm just going into the ot1 channel

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.130 
I'm just going into the ot1 channel
green<00:04:45.640> mode<00:04:45.910> no<00:04:46.720> pedals<00:04:47.080> whatsoever<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:49.140> with

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
green mode no pedals whatsoever and with

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.200 
green mode no pedals whatsoever and with
these<00:04:50.320> mods<00:04:50.620> I<00:04:50.830> had<00:04:50.980> made<00:04:51.250> to<00:04:51.280> it<00:04:51.520> it<00:04:51.730> really

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
these mods I had made to it it really

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.540 
these mods I had made to it it really
livens<00:04:53.140> up<00:04:53.380> damp<00:04:53.680> I<00:04:53.860> think<00:04:54.070> it<00:04:54.190> sounds<00:04:54.340> more

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
livens up damp I think it sounds more

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.120 
livens up damp I think it sounds more
kind<00:04:54.970> of<00:04:55.000> old-school<00:04:55.480> and<00:04:55.600> vintage<00:04:55.660> so<00:04:56.140> still

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
kind of old-school and vintage so still

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.160 
kind of old-school and vintage so still
thinks<00:04:57.310> I'm<00:04:57.760> still<00:04:57.970> exploring<00:04:58.420> the<00:04:58.810> tones<00:04:59.020> I

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
thinks I'm still exploring the tones I

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.690 
thinks I'm still exploring the tones I
can<00:04:59.290> get<00:04:59.410> with<00:04:59.560> it<00:04:59.590> but<00:04:59.830> this<00:05:00.220> is<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.520> first

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
can get with it but this is the first

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.920 
can get with it but this is the first
one<00:05:00.820> I<00:05:00.940> dialed<00:05:01.270> in<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.420> I<00:05:01.510> think<00:05:01.660> it's<00:05:01.840> pretty

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
one I dialed in and I think it's pretty

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.870 
one I dialed in and I think it's pretty
good

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.190
