00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.650
 this video on all those who 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.020
 already have a dog to retrieve 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.660
 can or at least once therefore 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.060
 brings heads and internet and indeed should 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.270
 it here why even go into those 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.599
 chasing a bit of discipline 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.879
 bring in 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.970
 if you just let the dog wait 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:39.040
 and this is where the exercise starts 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.140
 namely, it consists of four steps 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.480
 the one level lacks the rhythm 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.170
 to walk around one as you see here 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.920
 He should then sit down so 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.580
 waiting 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.470
 you look for him waiting a certain time 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.479
 and then send it with the command like that 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.839
 or so lost under the object 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:57.839
 after 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:02.260
 the beautiful thing is not 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.710
 just one object behind 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.540
 he rushed among other things also to 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.939
 example here in the high grass the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.040
 flames and thus also his nose 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.040
 exhausting and not just his eyes 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.119
 because this video to the people 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.439
 this is where your dog is sitting 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.720
 have taught as well as that 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.729
 retrieve the small note with 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.380
 that's the dog to wait for 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.880
 actually pretty simple while you are 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.770
 If you throw the dog, it is easy to keep it 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.470
 Neck from tight when he tries the ball 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.810
 afterwards one holds firmly so that he 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.390
 nothing comes after says no and 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.860
 sent him back in the seat when 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.619
 he does it and relaxed you can 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.890
 you lost with a book or such a search 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.340
 but every other command to rush 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.780
 ask 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.060
 the more often one repeats that he 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.369
 you become safer and you notice relatively 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.110
 quickly from which situation you can 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.440
 hand from the collar can let her from 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.440
 becomes 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.340
 si 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.230
 for all those who are with their dog 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.090
 still in the beginning or just yet 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.800
 I can not do that 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.380
 calm down the individual steps 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.330
 and most of all, the command that 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.209
 means that walking around the dog 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.940
 own body and sit next to the 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:38.489
 own body axis will be among others 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.489
 be a video of the next one 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.370
 and then as always until next time 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.370
 crooked
