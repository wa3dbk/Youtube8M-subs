00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
learned throughout my career you know

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.290 
learned throughout my career you know
he's<00:00:48.089> still<00:00:48.120> working<00:00:48.720> on<00:00:48.839> now

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.150 

I<00:00:54.510> always<00:00:55.050> learned<00:00:55.379> three<00:00:55.649> ways<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.980> learn

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
I always learned three ways you learn

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.150 
I always learned three ways you learn
watching<00:00:56.850> listening<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.660> doing<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.230> and

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
watching listening and doing and and

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.800 
watching listening and doing and and
that's<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.790> way<00:00:59.910> I<00:00:59.940> teach

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.350 

coach<00:01:06.079> porter<00:01:06.530> played<00:01:07.070> running<00:01:07.399> back<00:01:07.549> coach

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
coach porter played running back coach

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.130 
coach porter played running back coach
running<00:01:08.840> back<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.670> so<00:01:10.670> I<00:01:10.700> guess<00:01:10.970> that's<00:01:11.810> kind

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
running back and so I guess that's kind

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.780 
running back and so I guess that's kind
of<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.320> relationship<00:01:12.860> that<00:01:13.040> we<00:01:13.100> have<00:01:13.220> I<00:01:13.640> guess

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
of the relationship that we have I guess

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.340 
of the relationship that we have I guess
you<00:01:13.909> want<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:14.180> call<00:01:14.360> it<00:01:14.390> university<00:01:15.320> of

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
you want to call it university of

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.200 
you want to call it university of
running<00:01:15.680> back<00:01:15.829> you<00:01:16.640> know<00:01:16.850> it's<00:01:17.000> a<00:01:17.060> lot<00:01:17.180> of

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210
