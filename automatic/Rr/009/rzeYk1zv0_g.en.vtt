I<00:03:36.490> put<00:03:36.730> this<00:03:36.910> this<00:03:37.660> things<00:03:37.960> on

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:55.190 

could<00:03:43.860> get<00:03:44.130> in<00:03:44.340> here

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:05.030 

did<00:03:55.860> it<00:03:55.950> get<00:03:56.040> on<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.280> leather<00:03:56.460> too<00:03:58.940> I<00:04:04.040> think

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
did it get on the leather too I think

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.540 
did it get on the leather too I think
what<00:04:05.400> he<00:04:05.520> has<00:04:06.030> comes<00:04:06.450> down<00:04:06.720> here<00:04:07.250> it<00:04:08.250> cannot

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
what he has comes down here it cannot

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.640 
what he has comes down here it cannot
escape<00:04:08.790> gets<00:04:09.720> this<00:04:10.020> one<00:04:10.790> goes<00:04:11.790> around<00:04:12.150> here

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
escape gets this one goes around here

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.569 
escape gets this one goes around here
comes<00:04:13.650> down<00:04:14.040> here<00:04:15.440> catches<00:04:16.440> somehow<00:04:16.919> here<00:04:17.310> and

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
comes down here catches somehow here and

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.840 
comes down here catches somehow here and
then<00:04:17.730> leaks<00:04:18.329> down<00:04:18.630> from<00:04:18.989> here<00:04:19.519> quite<00:04:20.519> a<00:04:20.549> good

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
then leaks down from here quite a good

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:38.140 
then leaks down from here quite a good
amount<00:04:21.180> in<00:04:21.450> there

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.070 

so<00:04:39.150> you're<00:04:39.240> going<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.390> duct-tape<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.930> whole

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
so you're going to duct-tape the whole

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.410 
so you're going to duct-tape the whole
thing<00:04:40.290> away
