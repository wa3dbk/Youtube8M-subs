00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:16.049
 next to bruno 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.360
 and I will continue this theme of writing the dci 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.630
 this is the video of number 3 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.600
 and I go back a little on the basics of normative acts 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.530
 there is a northern chapter 5 in the police action 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.200
 law continues 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.440
 I remember nothing yesterday rule 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.060
 will not this abstract 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.290
 but mothers are usually defined per month 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.990
 by the generality 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.900
 and by abstraction the material material of leisure 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.450
 I do not remember anything. 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.150
 if you can call it formal law 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.930
 or normative act of concrete effect 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.900
 even so difficult to understand 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.700
 when a leitoa more material content of high in the north of Brazil 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.189
 is that it is a material law that is not rule generated rules 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.450
 they are subject 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.520
 there is an abstract control of constitutionality now when these 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.700
 laws which are general norms if it contains norms in dollars werley will form the act 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.370
 normative of concrete effect to him these laws 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.910
 do not remain subject to abstract control of constitutionality 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.350
 you do not have to give a leap he asks for a note five years later 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.850
 let's go back let's 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.940
 if he knows 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.070
 I remember nothing of this new generation before the joão de araras fiestas 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.070
 contains norms emboladas this contains singular norms are not submissive 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.560
 is in the constitution 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.259
 rule of law is defined by the submission of several nations of life 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.990
 to the right 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.170
 but this partially correct theme is because there are matters that are 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.540
 of the exclusive competence of the national congress 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.560
 some 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.770
 has some matters that are the exclusive competence of the 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.709
 of the camera control 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.119
 the senate 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:16.069
 and also has 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.699
 which will only be disciplined 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:19.780
 by law 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.829
 the day 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.759
 since we are talking about ordinary law 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:27.839
 there are two types of food that make up the text of the law 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:30.199
 the first 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:32.339
 the legislative bank 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:35.799
 is the second matter to legislate 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.429
 the legislative order 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:40.360
 is the preliminary part 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.759
 and beans 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:45.519
 in the matter of legislated so little is what is hidden from mta 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.000
 the rest active 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.860
 is when you believe that to give housing there you have a job of 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.409
 to do in the preliminaries for bedchamber put of media 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.209
 it's nice he 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.509
 in school matters 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.249
 It's the people that matter. 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:09.619
 I think the only difference is that he values ​​the singer and his partner 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:12.510
 or partner with the professional sanaa 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.830
 certainly you last year by the legislative order 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.519
 lost by 2 to 0 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.989
 booklet for free let's talk about this legislative order that is divided into 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.129
 three parts 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.369
 first part the preliminary part 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:33.369
 and prf held the period of application 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:35.949
 then the other host cities 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.739
 we have the normative part no. 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.079
 with the norms that regulate object defined in the practice to the injunction 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:43.959
 and we have the final part 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.239
 with the exhibitions 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.479
 now let's look at each other's asset item 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:52.109
 to sew 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.299
 he had 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.129
 talat piglet 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:00.980
 by day such are not in place it goes up to 6 times to stay in order 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:01.769
 legal 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.439
 is particularly given the denomination numbering 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:09.449
 this is living 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:10.769
 now we'll see 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.279
 the menu 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:15.539
 for lacerda mt collapsed on something né 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.299
 the foot menu for fatima 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.859
 said that the Bahia government's decision 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.220
 the menu will do what it will already allow you to already have the 

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:26.520
 knowledge of the matter to legislate 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.319
 besides immediately 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:30.870
 she will find out to ask what she wants 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.669
 now we will have to go to the UN 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.310
 he walked so expensive that he runs it is a place for him to release her so was the 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.259
 trading hour 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:46.509
 and here we have application basics we have application date first 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:47.830
 match 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.389
 and did so to avoid damage to systems serve as a reference 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:57.710
 the declaration of independence and the proclamation of the republic now let 

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:59.770
 speak of the legislated matter 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.870
 that one that henrique is a bit of law the team of inter 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.400
 it's slim 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.099
 they were present 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:12.050
 depending on the time we had that they are willing to go the numerical order the 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.830
 article is what is a basic unit of presentation 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.960
 - team captain 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.529
 parts 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:23.769
 the legislator to take place in 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.199
 renewal clause 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.770
 specific revocation clause it has to be precise 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.309
 Can you answer in court? 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:36.699
 I ask the ego 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:38.539
 besides expressing itself 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:41.030
 the current governor jan brewer 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.580
 and you have been displaced to be locked automatically or with the entry of a 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.639
 new discipline 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.129
 they must think it's like a pleonasm I know 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:54.639
 the company intends to materialize a little of the law 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:58.770
 may also contain the term of validity 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.990
 the clause of validity of that dream 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.619
 about the entrance in vigo 

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:06.629
 thaise saleh does not have any validity clause 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.809
 this legend will have a deadline of 45 days after 45 days she goes to work 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.809
 signature 

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:18.369
 it is for this reason the nuances need to be remedied 

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:20.830
 by a competent authority 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.730
 and to refer the referendum is made by the minister of state who answers for this 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:27.169
 for that matter 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.589
 next 20 will discover complementary law 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:32.240

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.240
 criticizing opining 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.240
 this is of fundamental importance 

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:48.479
 show
