 welcome to crafts with children 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.369
 dotcom episode 679 how to make a 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.090
 shrub of paper roses for your 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:29.240
 dolls as souvenir or gift 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:33.590
 materials cardboard branch small pattern 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:36.980
 pencil glue and scissors optional cap 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.680
 plastic and stuffing hello today we're going to 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.320
 use this bush that you see here as 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.210
 inspiration for our project let's 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.670
 to use a pattern that can be 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.860
 downloaded from our website 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.879
 crafts with children dotcom diagonal 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.610
 roses now I'm going to cut out the pattern and 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.830
 I'm going to use the medium size pattern 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.070
 I'm going to trace it on a piece of 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.190
 cardboard and then I'm going to cut out what I'm going 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.500
 to cut out a red flower and I'm going 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.110
 to cut out a little green star 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.570
 the flower is going to be the base of the roses and 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.400
 I'm going to use three of them and one 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.430
 little star to do the back 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.070
 of the rose let's start 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.890
 making this move by moving all 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.790
 the petals towards the center and squeezing 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.050
 the until forming the center of the rose 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.410
 then let's put a little bit of 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.200
 glue in the center in this way and 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.720
 then we will hold it this way 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.020
 until it dries then we go to 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.930
 take the second pattern and let's 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:46.650
 squeeze only the petals of this 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:50.430
 way making them a little bit hollow 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.020
 and when we have the form we are going to 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.110
 put a little bit of glue on the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.200
 center and then we're going to paste the pattern 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.740
 what we had done previously we are going to 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.460
 close a little bit like that and then we're going to 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.280
 take the third pattern now let's 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.860
 do the same as we did before 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.760
 but with more 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.030
 ends so that then there is no 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.760
 shape of the rose without having to take the 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.580
 how the center will leave a 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.830
 little bit hollow and then we're going to put a 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.210
 little bit of glue again and let's go 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.600
 to paste 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.970
 the center and here we already have the rose and 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.790
 formed now let's take the 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.980
 little star and what we are going to do is 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.490
 use the star to make the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.960
 back of the rose we're going to 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.630
 look for it a little bit using our 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.480
 fingers to make smaller roses or 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.610
 to make the smallest stars 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.170
 we can use the back a 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.300
 pencil or pencil eraser and water camos 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.790
 here we have the rose already finished and 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.950
 we have small roses that I did with 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.680
 the smallest pattern as you can see 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.310
 here and what we are going to do now is 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.960
 stick our roses to the bush 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.320
 we cut the shrub to the size that 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.560
 we want or the branch and then we take a 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.750
 detergent cap we put a little 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.540
 of glue in the center and then 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:27.160
 we put the bush inside the lid 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:31.129
 for filling I'm using plastic 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.530
 meat or vegetable packaging and 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.870
 Now I'm going to start putting my roses 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.970
 in my bush 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.159
 once you have all the roses of 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.220
 bets we already have the project 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:46.580
 determined and this project can be 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.459
 used for many occasions to 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.430
 weddings for parties as baby gifts 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.280
 shower can also be for dolls 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.860
 monster high for barbies as well 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.549
 It can also be used for dolls 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:05.060
 of 18 inches such as the Americas 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.980
 black and so forth I hope that this 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.739
 craftsmanship has been to your liking and not 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.230
 forget to share it and make it 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.040
 at home we will see you in the next video 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.040
 goodbye 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.659
 two
