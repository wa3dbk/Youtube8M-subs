00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
like you see it there it is you can see

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.100 
like you see it there it is you can see
it's<00:01:39.079> right<00:01:39.890> in<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:40.340> fur<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:40.970> attaching<00:01:41.929> into

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
it's right in the fur and attaching into

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.429 
it's right in the fur and attaching into
his<00:01:42.470> skin<00:01:43.039> so<00:01:43.310> that<00:01:44.179> stick<00:01:44.689> it's<00:01:44.869> pretty<00:01:45.110> small

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.859 
his skin so that stick it's pretty small
it's<00:01:45.679> probably<00:01:46.189> a<00:01:46.220> larval<00:01:46.640> stage<00:01:46.939> and<00:01:47.390> you<00:01:47.720> can

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
it's probably a larval stage and you can

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.719 
it's probably a larval stage and you can
actually<00:01:48.049> see<00:01:48.409> it<00:01:48.500> still<00:01:48.860> moving<00:01:49.340> so<00:01:49.549> it's

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
actually see it still moving so it's

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.580 
actually see it still moving so it's
alive<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.479> what<00:01:50.960> we're<00:01:51.110> going<00:01:51.229> to<00:01:51.259> do<00:01:51.439> is

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.309 
you get the mouthparts some people would
in<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.390> old<00:02:14.569> days<00:02:14.750> we<00:02:14.930> heard<00:02:15.140> about

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
in the old days we heard about

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.190 
in the old days we heard about
recommending<00:02:15.890> putting<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.790> hot<00:02:17.180> match<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:18.049> the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
recommending putting a hot match to the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.979 
recommending putting a hot match to the
tick<00:02:18.470> or<00:02:18.849> squeezing<00:02:19.849> the<00:02:20.000> tick<00:02:20.209> or<00:02:20.420> popping<00:02:20.840> it

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
tick or squeezing the tick or popping it

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.729 
tick or squeezing the tick or popping it
those<00:02:21.530> things<00:02:21.890> all<00:02:22.250> caused<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.910> tick<00:02:23.180> to

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
those things all caused the tick to

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.949 
those things all caused the tick to
secrete<00:02:24.739> saliva<00:02:25.010> into<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.880> cat<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.330> that<00:02:26.720> can

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
secrete saliva into the cat and that can

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.930 
secrete saliva into the cat and that can
spread<00:02:27.260> disease<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:27.980> want<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.370> grasp<00:02:28.549> the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
spread disease so you want to grasp the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.270 
spread disease so you want to grasp the
tick<00:02:29.420> right<00:02:29.930> at<00:02:30.049> its<00:02:30.230> mouth<00:02:30.380> part<00:02:30.799> so<00:02:30.980> you<00:02:31.070> sort

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
tick right at its mouth part so you sort

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.099 
tick right at its mouth part so you sort
of<00:02:31.370> close<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:31.850> mouth<00:02:32.150> as<00:02:32.390> you're<00:02:32.600> pulling<00:02:32.959> it

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
of close it mouth as you're pulling it

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.229 
of close it mouth as you're pulling it
and<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:33.680> can't<00:02:33.920> get<00:02:34.070> that<00:02:34.220> saliva<00:02:34.609> into<00:02:35.120> the

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
and it can't get that saliva into the

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.450 
and it can't get that saliva into the
cat
