00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.460
 friends of the photographer's whip here 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.919
 we bring the microphone with a boom and 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.509
 mount short wind and at the same time this 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:12.639
 comes with a little shortening for 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.060
 sift we will see each one of the 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.210
 parts 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:20.510
 Your kit contains a htc microphone 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.390
 ht 81 model in your drink box and case 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.850
 two cables one long 5 meters to 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.369
 connect the microphone from the reed 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.380
 up to your camera and a short cable of 20 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.570
 centimeters to connect the microphone 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.460
 about the camera is at the same time it comes with 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.330
 a small shoe to mount it on 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.330
 and go walking 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.320
 also includes an expandable surround rod 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.060
 up to two meters a speck short wind 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.820
 stuffed to absorb all the 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.100
 Wind impacts and an anti- shock mount 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.070
 impact notice that the mount has in 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.630
 the base an adjustable shoe because 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.180
 we can also place our 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.130
 microphone in the shoe where the flash goes 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.990
 from our camera so we can go 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.510
 recording while we walk in with the 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.540
 camera without using the cane 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.040
 this is a very complete team 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.110
 first we put a double battery to 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.560
 our microphone and we put it in the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.380
 switch on a closed 80 degree TV or 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.180
 in a 180 degree environmental 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.660
 depending on what we should do 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.100
 now we put the windproof mote this 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.670
 it slides through the microphone 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.220
 gently and secure it with the tape 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.200
 intern and the insurance is 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.050
 strongly insured and at the same time 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.280
 we place the anti-shock mount 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.590
 we just have to open the butterfly 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.680
 from behind and we close it and ready 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.440
 is strongly attached to the saddle 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.640
 and so with these leagues absorbs the impact 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.520
 at the time of walking 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.010
 we put the tip of the cane in the base 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.260
 of the saddle and this way they are 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.780
 insured the four elements very 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.300
 heavily armed 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.940
 remember that the saddle has leagues 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.190
 anti impact as you see it in the image and 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.020
 At the same time, it has a key so that 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.810
 if we can accommodate the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.650
 microphone at the desired angle to walk 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.980
 with him freely 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.780
 finally fabian connects the cable xlr or 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.269
 phantom on the back of the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.569
 mic and roll it around the 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.220
 reed notice that this cable measures 5 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.349
 meters for you to have a good 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.959
 trajectory and prolongation of it 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.150
 from the microphone to your camera 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.510
 ensures the angle to which you want 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.780
 point the microphone and stretch it this 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.540
 studio is 4 meters high and note 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.049
 as a fabian will wear moves and even 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.670
 shake the microphone since the leagues 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:50.379
 around the saddle they will absorb 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.379
 all the impacts of the wind 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.130
 This microphone comes with a 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.680
 speck short wind very effective for 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.750
 extreme winds below we are going to 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.960
 see how this shortening bike works 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.290
 very good friends there in front we have 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.920
 a turbine that has a power in 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.020
 an almost industrial power 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.720
 this turbine is quite strong and now 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.890
 they are going to bring the microphone closer to where 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.890
 is the turbine and is already going 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.000
 i 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.520
 and they perceived in the couplet that feels 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.890
 by the strong air of the turbine miren 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.570
 I'm going to keep talking but when 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.970
 approach the microphone look how it's going 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.950
 disappear my voice and goes will be heard 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.950
 the coupling feel the 7 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.420
 turbulence prevents it I have to climb the 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.190
 volume of my voice 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.260
 this happens many times when 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.480
 we use a short mota wind in 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.670
 these types of microphones and that appears 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.050
 turbulence feel what once again is 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.050
 bad self-prevalence 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.420
 that we always want to avoid in all 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.700
 audios of all our recordings 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.100
 this video is unedited so that 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.310
 you clearly perceive how it 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.970
 feel the audio with a microphone 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.460
 standard and a microphone with this too 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.090
 we are going to place the cut 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.550
 good friends here we have the microphone 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.590
 the dead girl cuts wind and we're going to 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.080
 put on the side of the turbine and go to 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.050
 see the difference 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:39.250
 I'm going to keep talking but this time 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:42.210
 already the coupling has been greatly reduced and 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:47.590
 I constantly have the fluffs at each 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:51.250
 20 as the wind diffuses through the 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.990
 Look, I keep talking, but now 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.270
 you do not hear so much at the top of the 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.530
 summit has been reduced by more than 80 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.419
 percent 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.189
 this is a concrete video that we have 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.379
 asked our fil of our 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:04.930
 customers remember that this video is 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:07.690
 without editing we have taken it aside the 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.150
 turbine and still they are heard alive and no longer 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.669
 I need to raise my voice or we go back to 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.440
 zoom the turbine but now you hear 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.020
 my voice is no longer heard so fit 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.199
 loud that you hear for example when 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.419
 we recorded on the beach where it is a place 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.370
 open that is not heard whatever 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:27.639
 complies with the air that is heard when 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.069
 we were filming in the street glued to 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.409
 the wall where the air stirred or in 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:35.169
 open spaces where there is too much 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:37.849
 there is a sample more friends of the effective and 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:41.199
 of your products thanks friends 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:41.199
 by watching this video
