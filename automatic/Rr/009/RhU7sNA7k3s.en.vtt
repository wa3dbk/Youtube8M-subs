engine if you live in California most of

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.440 
engine if you live in California most of
the<00:00:20.080> engines<00:00:21.080> come<00:00:21.610> just<00:00:22.610> like<00:00:22.700> this<00:00:23.060> in<00:00:23.330> a

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.450 
the engines come just like this in a

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.660 
the engines come just like this in a
bunch<00:00:23.660> of<00:00:23.810> parts<00:00:24.170> so<00:00:24.740> right<00:00:25.279> now<00:00:25.400> I'm<00:00:25.520> just

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
bunch of parts so right now I'm just

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.830 
bunch of parts so right now I'm just
going<00:00:25.850> to<00:00:26.170> assemble<00:00:27.170> the<00:00:27.410> engine<00:00:27.860> and<00:00:28.840> you

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
going to assemble the engine and you

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.400 
going to assemble the engine and you
know<00:00:29.960> you<00:00:30.290> guys<00:00:30.439> can<00:00:30.680> learn<00:00:30.830> how<00:00:31.040> to<00:00:31.070> do<00:00:31.279> that

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
know you guys can learn how to do that

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.450 
know you guys can learn how to do that
this<00:00:33.410> is<00:00:33.590> your<00:00:34.750> Magneto<00:00:35.920> this<00:00:36.920> is<00:00:37.040> what<00:00:37.190> gets

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
this is your Magneto this is what gets

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.660 
this is your Magneto this is what gets
the<00:00:37.670> signal<00:00:38.470> to<00:00:39.470> send<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:40.010> spark<00:00:40.400> to<00:00:40.640> your

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
the signal to send the spark to your

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.510 
the signal to send the spark to your
engine<00:00:41.410> so<00:00:42.410> we're<00:00:42.739> going<00:00:42.829> to<00:00:42.890> install<00:00:43.280> this

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
engine so we're going to install this

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.320 
engine so we're going to install this
first<00:00:45.910> as<00:00:47.620> you<00:00:48.620> can<00:00:48.800> see<00:00:49.070> it<00:00:49.400> sticks<00:00:49.910> out<00:00:50.060> more

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
first as you can see it sticks out more

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.810 
first as you can see it sticks out more
on<00:00:50.480> this<00:00:50.630> side<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:51.110> does<00:00:51.290> that<00:00:51.500> side<00:00:51.770> so<00:00:52.610> it's

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
on this side and does that side so it's

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.970 
on this side and does that side so it's
going<00:00:52.940> to<00:00:53.000> go<00:00:53.180> down<00:00:53.420> like<00:00:53.720> that<00:00:53.990> onto<00:00:54.920> your

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
going to go down like that onto your

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:02.400 
going to go down like that onto your
engine<00:00:56.110> so<00:00:57.110> put<00:00:58.070> it<00:00:58.130> in<00:00:58.190> place

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.660 

actually<00:01:03.410> first<00:01:05.619> guy<00:01:06.619> put<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:06.920> wires<00:01:07.250> through

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
actually first guy put the wires through

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.560 
actually first guy put the wires through
the<00:01:07.729> hole<00:01:07.850> right<00:01:08.210> here

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.760 

you

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.790 

take<00:01:21.770> this<00:01:21.950> little<00:01:22.250> black<00:01:22.550> boot<00:01:22.910> and<00:01:23.620> this<00:01:24.620> is

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
take this little black boot and this is

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.910 
take this little black boot and this is
to<00:01:25.130> prevent<00:01:25.580> water<00:01:25.760> from<00:01:25.910> getting<00:01:26.090> in<00:01:26.540> here<00:01:26.920> if

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
to prevent water from getting in here if

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.250 
to prevent water from getting in here if
you<00:01:28.070> ever<00:01:28.160> get<00:01:28.370> water<00:01:28.640> in<00:01:28.820> here<00:01:29.090> your<00:01:29.960> engine

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
you ever get water in here your engine

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.830 
you ever get water in here your engine
will<00:01:30.410> just<00:01:30.590> stop<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.760> getting<00:01:32.150> spark<00:01:32.540> and<00:01:32.750> it

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
will just stop and getting spark and it

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.400 
will just stop and getting spark and it
will<00:01:33.140> never<00:01:33.350> start<00:01:33.770> again<00:01:34.010> so<00:01:35.200> always<00:01:36.200> make

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
will never start again so always make

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.850 
will never start again so always make
sure<00:01:36.440> that<00:01:36.650> this<00:01:37.040> boot<00:01:37.400> is<00:01:38.080> in<00:01:39.080> there<00:01:39.560> pretty

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
sure that this boot is in there pretty

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:51.380 
sure that this boot is in there pretty
tight

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.970 

so<00:01:52.390> there's<00:01:52.600> two<00:01:52.780> bags<00:01:53.050> of<00:01:53.260> screws<00:01:53.620> the<00:01:53.770> ones

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
so there's two bags of screws the ones

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.390 
so there's two bags of screws the ones
that<00:01:54.250> don't<00:01:54.850> have<00:01:55.060> any<00:01:55.240> washers<00:01:55.810> are<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:57.190> ones

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
that don't have any washers are the ones

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.310 
that don't have any washers are the ones
that<00:01:58.030> you<00:01:58.150> don't<00:01:58.390> want<00:01:58.510> to<00:01:58.690> use<00:01:58.840> you<00:01:59.110> want<00:01:59.260> to

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
that you don't want to use you want to

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.290 
that you don't want to use you want to
use<00:01:59.410> these<00:01:59.590> longer<00:02:00.040> ones<00:02:00.190> that<00:02:00.550> came<00:02:00.760> with<00:02:01.030> the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
use these longer ones that came with the

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.560 
use these longer ones that came with the
washer<00:02:01.780> first<00:02:02.470> you<00:02:02.680> want<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:02.890> put<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.570> split

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
washer first you want to put the split

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.300 
washer first you want to put the split
washer<00:02:04.990> on<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:06.160> nut<00:02:06.340> on<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:06.940> bolt<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:09.009> then

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
washer on the nut on the bolt and then

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.370 
washer on the nut on the bolt and then
you<00:02:09.429> put<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.700> regular<00:02:09.880> washer<00:02:10.450> on<00:02:10.600> and<00:02:11.910> then

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
you put the regular washer on and then

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:22.650 
you put the regular washer on and then
start<00:02:14.380> tightening

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.020 

when<00:02:23.660> you're<00:02:23.780> tightening<00:02:24.640> always<00:02:25.640> make<00:02:25.820> sure

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
when you're tightening always make sure

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.850 
when you're tightening always make sure
you<00:02:26.120> do<00:02:26.270> crisscross<00:02:26.780> pattern<00:02:27.320> so<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:27.500> start

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
you do crisscross pattern so you start

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.560 
you do crisscross pattern so you start
here<00:02:28.190> then<00:02:28.550> here<00:02:29.030> then<00:02:29.180> here<00:02:29.750> then<00:02:30.320> here

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.300 

now<00:02:35.570> you're<00:02:35.690> going

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
now you're going

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
now you're going
Gasquet<00:02:36.940> put<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.810> on<00:02:39.030> put<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.300> cover<00:02:41.230> on

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
Gasquet put it on put the cover on

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.630 
Gasquet put it on put the cover on
and<00:02:43.990> this<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.650> where<00:02:44.800> you<00:02:44.890> use<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.190> shorter

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
and this is where you use the shorter

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:55.119 
and this is where you use the shorter
screws<00:02:45.910> without<00:02:46.630> washers

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.729 

okay<00:02:56.129> so<00:02:56.190> once<00:02:56.519> you're<00:02:56.670> done<00:02:56.700> with<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.739> now

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
okay so once you're done with that now

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.059 
okay so once you're done with that now
it's<00:02:58.950> time<00:02:59.159> to<00:02:59.190> install<00:02:59.700> your<00:02:59.970> piston<00:03:01.069> onto

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
it's time to install your piston onto

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.320 
it's time to install your piston onto
the<00:03:02.190> rod<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.580> make<00:03:02.760> sure<00:03:02.909> you<00:03:03.030> use<00:03:03.120> this

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
the rod and make sure you use this

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.280 
the rod and make sure you use this
little<00:03:03.569> bearing<00:03:03.959> right<00:03:04.140> here<00:03:05.750> if<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.900> can<00:03:07.049> see

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
little bearing right here if you can see

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.000 
little bearing right here if you can see
this<00:03:07.440> piston<00:03:07.950> has<00:03:08.099> a<00:03:08.480> little<00:03:09.480> arrow<00:03:10.010> that

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
this piston has a little arrow that

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.710 
this piston has a little arrow that
arrow<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:11.700> facing<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.780> exhaust<00:03:13.200> port<00:03:14.390> so<00:03:15.390> this

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
arrow is facing the exhaust port so this

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.479 
arrow is facing the exhaust port so this
side<00:03:15.959> is<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.170> intake<00:03:16.560> port<00:03:16.890> this<00:03:17.159> is<00:03:17.340> the

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
side is the intake port this is the

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.119 
side is the intake port this is the
exhaust<00:03:17.909> side<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:19.379> want<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.680> arrow<00:03:19.920> to

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
exhaust side so you want the arrow to

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:26.119 
exhaust side so you want the arrow to
point<00:03:20.549> that<00:03:21.150> way<00:03:21.360> towards<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.140> exhaust<00:03:25.129> so

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
point that way towards the exhaust so

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.920 
point that way towards the exhaust so
we're<00:03:26.430> going<00:03:26.519> to<00:03:26.609> take<00:03:26.849> out<00:03:27.090> there's<00:03:27.599> a<00:03:27.660> little

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
we're going to take out there's a little

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.800 
we're going to take out there's a little
pin<00:03:28.549> retainer<00:03:29.549> pin<00:03:29.849> in<00:03:30.000> there<00:03:30.150> just<00:03:30.390> take<00:03:30.599> that

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
pin retainer pin in there just take that

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:42.289 
pin retainer pin in there just take that
out<00:03:35.690> just<00:03:36.690> like<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:40.129> then<00:03:41.129> push<00:03:41.879> this<00:03:42.090> little

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
out just like that then push this little

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:49.660 
out just like that then push this little
shaft<00:03:42.659> out<00:03:45.950> make<00:03:46.950> sure<00:03:47.129> it's<00:03:47.280> facing<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:47.849> way

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
shaft out make sure it's facing that way

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.360 
shaft out make sure it's facing that way
just<00:03:50.670> like<00:03:50.849> this

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.199 

put<00:03:56.910> this<00:03:57.030> bearing<00:03:57.569> inside<00:03:58.280> see<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.310> where

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
put this bearing inside see the where

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.580 
put this bearing inside see the where
the<00:04:00.330> rod<00:04:00.510> is<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.959> put<00:04:01.140> it<00:04:01.200> inside<00:04:01.290> that<00:04:01.560> hole

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
the rod is you put it inside that hole

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.490 
the rod is you put it inside that hole
and<00:04:04.590> now<00:04:05.360> make<00:04:06.360> sure<00:04:06.390> it's<00:04:06.690> lined<00:04:06.930> up<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.380> put

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
and now make sure it's lined up and put

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.210 
and now make sure it's lined up and put
the<00:04:07.620> shaft<00:04:07.890> through<00:04:10.280> just<00:04:11.280> like<00:04:11.370> that

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
the shaft through just like that

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:24.890 
the shaft through just like that
now<00:04:14.220> take<00:04:14.489> the<00:04:14.670> retainer<00:04:15.060> clip

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.290 

next<00:04:26.009> what<00:04:27.009> you<00:04:27.129> have<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:27.400> do<00:04:27.610> is<00:04:27.940> you're<00:04:28.270> going

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
next what you have to do is you're going

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.600 
next what you have to do is you're going
to<00:04:28.449> slide<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:28.930> cylinder<00:04:29.259> on<00:04:29.530> this<00:04:30.370> is<00:04:30.520> the

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
to slide the cylinder on this is the

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.210 
to slide the cylinder on this is the
intake<00:04:30.940> side<00:04:31.240> this<00:04:31.509> is<00:04:31.569> the<00:04:31.690> exhaust<00:04:32.199> side<00:04:33.419> so

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
intake side this is the exhaust side so

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.119 
intake side this is the exhaust side so
this<00:04:36.220> is<00:04:36.370> a<00:04:36.400> very<00:04:36.669> delicate<00:04:36.970> part<00:04:37.539> because

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
this is a very delicate part because

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:42.570 
this is a very delicate part because
sliding<00:04:39.129> the<00:04:39.280> cylinder<00:04:39.759> over<00:04:41.099> the<00:04:42.099> piston

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
sliding the cylinder over the piston

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.050 
sliding the cylinder over the piston
rings<00:04:43.949> you<00:04:44.949> have<00:04:45.099> to<00:04:45.250> compress<00:04:45.699> the<00:04:45.849> piston

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
rings you have to compress the piston

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:55.409 
rings you have to compress the piston
ring<00:04:46.419> so<00:04:46.690> they<00:04:46.900> so<00:04:47.409> it<00:04:47.530> slides<00:04:47.830> over<00:04:54.210> you<00:04:55.210> see

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
ring so they so it slides over you see

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.770 
ring so they so it slides over you see
right<00:04:55.629> here<00:04:55.780> on<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:55.960> piston<00:04:57.690> there's<00:04:58.690> a

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
right here on the piston there's a

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.059 
right here on the piston there's a
little<00:04:59.970> little<00:05:00.970> notch<00:05:01.569> that<00:05:02.169> holds<00:05:02.889> the

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
little little notch that holds the

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.580 
little little notch that holds the
piston<00:05:03.490> ring<00:05:03.789> in<00:05:04.060> place<00:05:04.270> you<00:05:05.199> want<00:05:05.380> to<00:05:05.470> make

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
piston ring in place you want to make

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.040 
piston ring in place you want to make
sure<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:06.009> piston<00:05:06.400> ring<00:05:06.610> is<00:05:07.050> compressed

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
sure the piston ring is compressed

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.529 
sure the piston ring is compressed
around<00:05:08.440> that<00:05:08.680> notch<00:05:08.949> so<00:05:09.940> if<00:05:10.060> your<00:05:10.240> if<00:05:10.419> you

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
around that notch so if your if you

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.290 
around that notch so if your if you
rotate<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.020> ring<00:05:11.319> like<00:05:11.500> this<00:05:11.759> then<00:05:12.759> it's<00:05:13.150> not

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
rotate the ring like this then it's not

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.350 
rotate the ring like this then it's not
going<00:05:13.569> to<00:05:13.630> sit<00:05:14.080> flat<00:05:14.470> and<00:05:14.909> your<00:05:15.909> engine<00:05:16.060> just

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
going to sit flat and your engine just

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.439 
going to sit flat and your engine just
won't<00:05:16.599> work<00:05:16.780> so<00:05:16.860> make<00:05:17.860> sure<00:05:17.889> it's<00:05:18.449> going

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
won't work so make sure it's going

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.540 
won't work so make sure it's going
around<00:05:19.690> that<00:05:20.169> little<00:05:20.440> groove<00:05:20.680> that<00:05:20.979> holds<00:05:21.460> it

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
around that little groove that holds it

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.360 
around that little groove that holds it
in<00:05:21.639> place<00:05:21.960> and<00:05:22.960> then<00:05:23.560> the<00:05:23.710> same<00:05:23.919> thing<00:05:24.129> on<00:05:24.280> the

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
in place and then the same thing on the

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.950 
in place and then the same thing on the
top<00:05:24.400> piston<00:05:25.000> ring<00:05:25.150> you<00:05:25.270> can't<00:05:25.509> see<00:05:25.719> from<00:05:25.930> that

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
top piston ring you can't see from that

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.399 
top piston ring you can't see from that
angle<00:05:26.289> but<00:05:27.120> there's<00:05:28.120> a<00:05:28.180> notch<00:05:28.419> here<00:05:28.659> facing<00:05:29.050> me

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
angle but there's a notch here facing me

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:35.240 
angle but there's a notch here facing me
so<00:05:29.560> first<00:05:30.219> I'm<00:05:30.400> going<00:05:30.520> to<00:05:30.610> do<00:05:30.699> the<00:05:30.819> top<00:05:31.509> ring

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.339 

you're<00:05:36.250> going<00:05:36.400> to<00:05:36.460> come<00:05:36.870> compress<00:05:37.870> the<00:05:38.139> ring

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 
you're going to come compress the ring

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:46.890 
you're going to come compress the ring
and<00:05:38.620> then<00:05:40.020> push<00:05:41.020> the<00:05:41.229> cylinder<00:05:41.440> down<00:05:42.750> over<00:05:43.750> it

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.940 

okay<00:05:47.770> that<00:05:48.040> was<00:05:48.130> ringing<00:05:48.490> number<00:05:49.120> one<00:05:51.060> now

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
okay that was ringing number one now

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.100 
okay that was ringing number one now
make<00:05:53.950> sure<00:05:54.190> the<00:05:54.820> second<00:05:55.300> ring<00:05:55.450> is<00:05:55.630> lined<00:05:55.900> up

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
make sure the second ring is lined up

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:04.300 
make sure the second ring is lined up
with<00:05:56.170> the<00:05:56.440> notch

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:24.909 

compress<00:06:05.270> the<00:06:05.480> ring

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:35.559 

and<00:06:25.520> that's<00:06:25.699> it

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:35.569 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:38.600 

now<00:06:36.569> your<00:06:36.719> cylinders<00:06:37.199> on<00:06:37.379> remember<00:06:38.009> if<00:06:38.249> it

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
now your cylinders on remember if it

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.050 
now your cylinders on remember if it
doesn't<00:06:38.939> go<00:06:39.060> on<00:06:39.240> smooth<00:06:39.770> then<00:06:40.770> it's<00:06:41.550> probably

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 
doesn't go on smooth then it's probably

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.360 
doesn't go on smooth then it's probably
because<00:06:42.300> the<00:06:42.449> piston<00:06:42.810> ring<00:06:42.960> is<00:06:43.080> not

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 
because the piston ring is not

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.209 
because the piston ring is not
compressed<00:06:44.719> over<00:06:45.719> the<00:06:45.840> notch<00:06:46.020> so<00:06:46.469> never<00:06:46.770> force

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:47.219 
compressed over the notch so never force

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:49.010 
compressed over the notch so never force
it<00:06:47.400> or<00:06:47.669> else<00:06:47.849> the<00:06:48.090> piston<00:06:48.449> ring<00:06:48.599> will<00:06:48.749> break

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
it or else the piston ring will break

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.219 
it or else the piston ring will break
real<00:06:49.800> easy<00:06:50.180> next<00:06:51.180> you<00:06:51.270> take<00:06:51.300> your<00:06:51.629> metal<00:06:52.050> head

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:52.229 
real easy next you take your metal head

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:54.999 
real easy next you take your metal head
gasket<00:06:52.770> anyway<00:06:53.580> it<00:06:53.639> doesn't<00:06:53.879> matter

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:55.009 
gasket anyway it doesn't matter

00:06:55.009 --> 00:07:03.580 
gasket anyway it doesn't matter
place<00:06:56.009> it<00:06:56.219> on<00:06:56.310> top
