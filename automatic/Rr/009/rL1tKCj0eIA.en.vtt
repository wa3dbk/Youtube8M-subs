00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.240
 married friend network viewer major 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.279
 once again we started with great joy 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.110
 the program opening the bible on tv 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.090
 Thank you for your emails and we 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.880
 We started as we promised the week. 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.579
 started to study an e-mail from our 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.829
 dear brother viewer hamilton 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:34.739
 sales that he is from the city of são paulo 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:36.480
 he asked the question through the program 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.080
 of good new radio that are not 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.270
 answering on tv and he asks the 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.180
 next I have a huge doubt about 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.340
 reincarnation and if indeed the bible 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.790
 It shows that John the Baptist was she is 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.040
 Incarnate is a tv network program heard 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.620
 teachers experience this talk that 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.060
 joao batista was the same person who denied it 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.880
 if the teacher's achievement was well emphatic 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:04.470
 saying that he would rather believe in jesus 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.960
 than in Joao really because 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.070
 I said that I'm going to start 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.040
 Justifying because I said that 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.970
 believed more in John of the queen is 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.950
 lines because reincarnation like me 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.850
 I started to say the past program is 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.400
 better the greater the more perfect justice 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.650
 divine applied on the planet 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.650
 there is nothing better than you should 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.870
 able to pay what you owe and to 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.150
 reincarnation is the opportunity 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.659
 wonderful that God gives us as 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.430
 jesus in mateus 5 25 is going to hurry has 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.740
 pay what he owes to his brother when 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.619
 I was also with him because if you did not 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.830
 do you can not god then there is 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.220
 a pressing need for an adjustment of 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.330
 You're here while you're on the way. 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.680
 with them 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:59.700
 mateus 5 25 and the incarnation as I spoke 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:04.830
 It's a universal belief you can even 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:08.970
 say I do not believe it but it's yours too 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.289
 I do not believe how much my commitment because 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.140
 the Hebrew teacher when I 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.109
 I asked him if he believed in 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.269
 reincarnation he is a jew he replied 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.500
 Who needs to believe in you and me? 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.010
 was absolutely sure 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.750
 and today I have called you my dear friend 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.120
 You must believe because I do not have 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.120
 absolutely no doubt that 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.520
 including you who have questions will also 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.770
 reincarnation and not punishment is not 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.160
 wonderful opportunity that God gives us 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:41.670
 to welcome what we owe then I 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.750
 wanted to start with this message is in the 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.760
 our work 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.430
 analyzing the biblical translations that have 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:52.580
 eight chapters on reincarnation in 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:55.080
 and you have doubts here that you 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.080
 about reincarnation and if indeed the 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.320
 Bible shows that John the Baptist was web 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.570
 reincarnated come we calmly but 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.530
 I created for you here, this text is from 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.110
 kardec no 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.760
 I 'll tell you later who I am. 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.530
 that comes to the world as a goal 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.270
 to achieve in your life. 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.060
 every person comes to the world with a goal 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:21.000
 with a project with a mission 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.660
 if the man does not finish his mission 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.340
 to another incarnation is not 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.230
 kardec is saying this I 'm not 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.630
 repeating that it is not alan kardec 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.200
 as we do not know exactly which goal 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:38.850
 of each one we are guided by the objective 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:42.360
 common to all who do good 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.120
 through the Torah that the divine revelation 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.980
 the five books and basses emitisse volt 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.720
 which are the commandments that are natural 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.470
 this is the task that is incumbent on all 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.260
 Jews and we should do our best to 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:03.510
 to fulfill it in the best way who says 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:06.420
 is this rabbi rafael calling from the book 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:12.269
 and this man is the director of 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:18.650
 Israel yeshiva or college are agouti 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:23.729
 paulo very well that information 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:26.250
 Jewish but I'm going to the Bible you 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.229
 What do you have, do you have some points there? 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.160
 We'll get there but I 'll start. 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:36.480
 by matheus matheus 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:43.310
 chapter 11 verse 10 to 14 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:48.030
 see if you take chapter 11 257 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:51.990
 Jesus begins to speak to those 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:56.070
 seconds mateus to break it they 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:05:01.530
 Jesus began to talk about John 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:05.790
 baptist to the crowds whatsoever to see in the 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:08.190
 desert a reed shaken by the wind but 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.410
 who would see a man dressed in clothes 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.310
 thin but those who wear thin clothes 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:16.320
 are the palaces and kings then the reinforcement 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.170
 of a prophet 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.190
 I told you that yes and more than one 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.210
 prophet 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.080
 more than a prophet is his that is 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.290
 written 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.890
 Behold, send the messenger before you. 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:34.170
 and prepare your way before you 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.760
 Then Jesus puts Jesus above a 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:40.110
 prophet but that the prophet is a 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:42.120
 messenger of god a the gate of god 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:47.370
 joao batista 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.419
 only the book and malachi speak in his 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.060
 chapter 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:53.040
 behold, I will send the prophet Elijah 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.740
 before you see the great end of the day 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:02.160
 Lord Jesus is talking about John 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:05.220
 Baptist is speaking what he says here. 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.230
 prepare the way and jesus is already useless 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.880
 I say to you comes in is 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:12.210
 woman did not appear anyone greater than 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.000
 John the Baptist and yet less than 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.790
 kingdom of heaven greater than he 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.850
 and continues from the days of John the Baptist 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:23.040
 until now the king of heaven has suffered violence and 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:26.040
 have been able to do so because all 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.010
 prophets and actor to prophesy 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:31.919
 until joao 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:37.860
 If you want to know the credit 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:40.440
 he is the one who should come only hamilton 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.050
 my dear friend, you add Jesus 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.510
 who has ears listen to who can 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.790
 understand 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:49.720
 This understands why I tell you 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:51.520
 I said that John the Baptist is going to say no 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.350
 He said he was not beautiful but he said 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.420
 that it was because he did not remember because 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:58.030
 I do not remember you remember who you are. 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.950
 was hamilton this doubt every day that 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.830
 you have in relation to reincarnation is 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:04.530
 because you can not remember who you were and 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.090
 Why does John the Baptist have to remember 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:09.700
 when they asked him to 0 and they did not 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:12.060
 I am but Jesus says he is there 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:14.200
 that someone with big letters 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.260
 to fight that said it was not jesus 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.180
 said it was from jesus joão batista 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.760
 I have no fear is the slightest doubt that 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:24.490
 I get jesus and you my car was 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.930
 singing stays with who does not leave 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:30.340
 because in the minute we're going back to 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:33.310
 continue to respond to the 

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.060
 of our dear hamilton salt and are 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.940
 Paulo 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.470
 one minute will not leave if you want to take 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.370
 only a little time gives more but more than 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.370
 This does not happen until now.
