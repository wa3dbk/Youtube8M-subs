00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 hello you love me again 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.750
 a make up tutorial 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.090
 last time I have you as my shows 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.590
 day make up looks and I thought 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.660
 I'm going to be right in the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.790
 next video and show you how you are 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.740
 make it a school wake up 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.880
 can and I would say I'm lying 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.880
 go directly 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.410
 and here you can see the video of my 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.109
 see make up day 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.970
 In short, I have a base 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.680
 I applied a light weight 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.350
 foundations applied my dark circles 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.480
 covered with a concealer and the 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.350
 be patient until your profession 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.629
 worn and actually only two 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.170
 Things at a school makeup 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.180
 important in my opinion are 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.680
 not too dark and just not too 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.339
 a lot of the good 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.460
 So that's why I take as eyeshadow 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.830
 so what quite so only bright tones and 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.390
 delicate tones like these two of mine 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:10.630
 dior palette so that looks like and 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:13.130
 wear this bright here our 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.610
 beveled island under mine 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.610
 eyebrows 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.850
 goes there again on her finger 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.860
 so it really is not too strong 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.630
 shimmers otherwise gets even worse 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.469
 in the form of the teachers, then 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:32.630
 at least a little bit of us here 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:37.579
 the bright and then the lid 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:40.270
 with his fluffy brush this 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:44.289
 salmon-colored eyeshadows or 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:50.679
 rosÃ©farbenen you have and in the 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:50.679
 lid fold no easy 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.880
 the shoe make up is one of them 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.600
 little eyeliner because I have the from 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.910
 maybelline new york lesting drama that 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.980
 is partly one 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:15.530
 There you turn and then it happens 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:18.940
 a bit out and carry one 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.250
 also here only one page on completely live 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.940
 So only to his side are 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.940
 slight swing 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.160
 so one of the lines looks only at the 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.240
 side opens with a little swing 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.860
 the eye something 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.780
 You do not look so tired anymore 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.820
 then I have something really cool new 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.120
 I wanted to show you today times of 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:45.020
 epsilon a lipgloss at the same time it is 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.870
 but also a blas and wear it first 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:52.010
 once on lips on is newton 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.550
 tender pink really nice feels good 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.530
 on 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.530
 on the lips and then 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:19.950
 points and then you lubricate the whole 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:22.110
 Unfortunately, it is quite nice with your finger 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.879
 expensive I 've got it for free but 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.049
 I 've seen it, I know that 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:30.239
 But it costs about 34 euro. I am 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.730
 almost sure that you in the drugstore 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.769
 I also find an alternative 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.569
 It is also important that the hairstyle fits 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.489
 and I always found it annoying when the 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.739
 Hair in the face is missing even if one 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.450
 over the books 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.430
 That's why I always like her 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.530
 closed to a bush I'll show you 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.140
 now a very small trick like 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.049
 I've always done that to myself 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.840
 then made me braid and my hair 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.530
 plaited the braid 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.530
 it is very fast 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:14.540
 Now I have my head and then 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:17.570
 really just around my here 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:22.450
 even rum is totally simplistic I know 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.450
 but it looks better 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:40.470
 then relax and fix that and for 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.810
 the protruding always rule that way 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.900
 Annoying are always extreme with me 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:51.150
 for that I have an anti frizz spray from 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:53.550
 l'oreal laver it says and that's always 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.590
 better than h spray hair spray so glued 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:00.240
 and then I jump that little one 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:07.100
 Grow on it and go with it or came 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:07.100
 by hand through here as well 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:20.110
 ok, they are so nice people 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.680
 That 's it, that was my shoe make-up that was 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.990
 My hairstyle made extremely fast 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.910
 is and I hope you liked it 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.920
 you love and i would say that by 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.920
 next time have fun imitating
