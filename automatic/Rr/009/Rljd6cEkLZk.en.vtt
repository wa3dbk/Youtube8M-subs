00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
pound equivalent ok so that gives you a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.830 
pound equivalent ok so that gives you a
gauge<00:00:37.680> as<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.010> how<00:00:38.219> much<00:00:38.430> line<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.390> spool<00:00:39.660> will

if<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.329> try<00:01:00.539> doing<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.960> without<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.260> rod<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
if you try doing it without the rod you

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.290 
if you try doing it without the rod you
find<00:01:02.280> you're<00:01:02.399> getting<00:01:02.609> all<00:01:02.730> sorts<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.120> trouble

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
find you're getting all sorts of trouble

find you're getting all sorts of trouble
with<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> real<00:01:03.870> move<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.650> get

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
with the real move in and you get

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.910 
with the real move in and you get
tangles<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.460> causes<00:01:05.670> big<00:01:06.360> issues<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:07.799> way

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
tangles and it causes big issues the way

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.560 
tangles and it causes big issues the way
I<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.430> do<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.790> very<00:01:08.850> simple

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
I like to do it is very simple

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.929 
I like to do it is very simple
I'll<00:01:10.170> take<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> end<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> line<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.820> I'll

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
I'll take the end of the line and I'll

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.859 
I'll take the end of the line and I'll
just<00:01:12.090> make<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> simple<00:01:12.600> loop<00:01:14.750> okay<00:01:17.869> there's

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
just make a simple loop okay there's

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.219 
just make a simple loop okay there's
your<00:01:18.990> loop<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.729> then<00:01:20.729> get<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> line<00:01:21.270> put<00:01:22.140> it

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
your loop I then get the line put it

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.780 
your loop I then get the line put it
back<00:01:22.409> through<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.710> loop<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:23.880> create<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.210> lasso

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
back through the loop to create a lasso

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.080 
back through the loop to create a lasso
okay<00:01:26.790> I'll<00:01:27.390> open<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.960> bail<00:01:28.140> arm<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:29.009> I'll<00:01:29.850> put

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
okay I'll open the bail arm and I'll put

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.560 
okay I'll open the bail arm and I'll put
the<00:01:30.210> line<00:01:30.680> over<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.770> top<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:34.110> spool<00:01:35.570> and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the line over the top of the spool and

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.480 
the line over the top of the spool and
you'll<00:01:36.750> notice<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.770> will<00:01:38.040> tighten

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
you'll notice that that will tighten

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.270 
you'll notice that that will tighten
itself<00:01:39.530> if<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.650> did<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.950> right<00:01:41.100> way<00:01:41.250> around

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
itself if I did it the right way around

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.770 
itself if I did it the right way around
I<00:01:41.640> just<00:01:41.670> need<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.060> change<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.479> around<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
I just need to change it around the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.480 
I just need to change it around the
other<00:01:42.869> way<00:01:43.729> against<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.790> spool<00:01:45.740> okay<00:01:46.740> another

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
other way against the spool okay another

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.690 
other way against the spool okay another
thing<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.390> mention<00:01:49.040> that<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.159> put<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.430> nut

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
thing to mention that you put the nut

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.899 
thing to mention that you put the nut
the<00:01:50.880> knot<00:01:51.119> at<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.720> bottom<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:53.009> spool<00:01:54.680> okay

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
the knot at the bottom of the spool okay

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.730 
the knot at the bottom of the spool okay
that's<00:01:56.909> important<00:01:57.390> because<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:58.380> keeps<00:01:58.560> it

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
that's important because it keeps it

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.219 
that's important because it keeps it
away<00:01:58.890> from<00:01:59.729> catching<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> line<00:02:01.790> okay<00:02:03.229> so

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
away from catching on the line okay so

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.280 
away from catching on the line okay so
there<00:02:04.380> we<00:02:04.409> go<00:02:04.700> let's<00:02:05.700> pull<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.060> up<00:02:06.259> before<00:02:07.259> I

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
there we go let's pull it up before I

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.469 
there we go let's pull it up before I
spawn<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.710> up<00:02:07.829> if<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.099> have<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.580> potential<00:02:09.300> to

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
spawn it up if you have the potential to

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.990 
spawn it up if you have the potential to
do<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.899> it's<00:02:10.259> always<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.560> good<00:02:10.800> idea<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.730> place

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
do it it's always a good idea to place

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.940 
do it it's always a good idea to place
the<00:02:12.300> spool<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:13.020> line<00:02:13.200> in<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.650> book

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
the spool of line in a book

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.350 
the spool of line in a book
of<00:02:14.010> water<00:02:14.900> couple<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.989> advantages<00:02:16.879> it<00:02:17.879> reduces

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
of water couple of advantages it reduces

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.630 
of water couple of advantages it reduces
the<00:02:18.540> friction<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.560> line<00:02:19.800> as<00:02:20.010> you're

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
the friction on the line as you're

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.610 
the friction on the line as you're
reeling<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.030> in<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.900> also<00:02:21.959> seems<00:02:22.379> to

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
reeling it in and it also seems to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.040 
reeling it in and it also seems to
improve<00:02:23.129> the<00:02:23.400> line<00:02:23.610> lay<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.629> get<00:02:24.840> on<00:02:24.989> the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
improve the line lay that you get on the

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.000 
improve the line lay that you get on the
reel<00:02:27.050> another<00:02:28.050> important<00:02:28.560> thing<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.709> think

reel another important thing to think

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.550 
reel another important thing to think
about<00:02:29.129> is<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:30.209> see<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.420> lot<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.660> people<00:02:30.870> reeling

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
about is you see a lot of people reeling

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.330 
about is you see a lot of people reeling
the<00:02:31.680> line<00:02:31.890> off<00:02:32.190> in<00:02:33.120> this<00:02:33.300> manner<00:02:34.250> sticking<00:02:35.250> a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
the line off in this manner sticking a

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.339 
the line off in this manner sticking a
pencil<00:02:35.730> through<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:36.060> spool<00:02:36.330> if<00:02:37.019> you've<00:02:37.200> got<00:02:37.319> a

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
pencil through the spool if you've got a

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.780 
pencil through the spool if you've got a
spool<00:02:37.650> like<00:02:37.830> this<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.220> has<00:02:38.310> got<00:02:38.489> smooth

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
spool like this that has got smooth

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.839 
spool like this that has got smooth
edges<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.840> can<00:02:40.019> actually<00:02:40.519> help<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.730> reduce

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
edges you can actually help to reduce

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.020 
edges you can actually help to reduce
line<00:02:42.330> twists<00:02:42.750> by<00:02:43.340> removing<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.430> line<00:02:44.640> off<00:02:44.879> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
line twists by removing the line off the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.270 
line twists by removing the line off the
spool<00:02:45.330> in<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.049> same<00:02:46.290> way<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.709> it's<00:02:46.890> wound<00:02:47.099> on

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
spool in the same way that it's wound on

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.250 
spool in the same way that it's wound on
to<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.519> reel<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:48.269> sounds<00:02:48.569> complicated<00:02:48.900> but

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
to the reel it sounds complicated but

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.539 
to the reel it sounds complicated but
one<00:02:49.470> you've<00:02:49.620> done<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.920> few<00:02:49.950> times<00:02:50.130> you'll

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
one you've done it a few times you'll

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:51.920 
one you've done it a few times you'll
see<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.730> advantage<00:02:51.299> it<00:02:51.450> just<00:02:51.630> helps<00:02:51.900> to

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
see the advantage it just helps to

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.069 
see the advantage it just helps to
reduce<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.799> line<00:02:53.040> twists<00:02:53.540> so<00:02:54.540> I'll<00:02:54.630> place<00:02:54.870> the

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
reduce the line twists so I'll place the

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:01.009 
reduce the line twists so I'll place the
spool<00:02:55.730> in<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:57.000> bucket<00:02:57.269> of<00:02:57.360> water<00:02:58.640> and<00:03:00.019> then

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
spool in the bucket of water and then

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.550 
spool in the bucket of water and then
wine<00:03:01.829> nice<00:03:02.579> and<00:03:02.910> carefully<00:03:03.420> onto<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.380> reel

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
wine nice and carefully onto the reel

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.199 
wine nice and carefully onto the reel
now<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.069> start<00:03:05.459> with<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.760> first<00:03:06.000> few

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
now to start with the first few

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.440 
now to start with the first few
revolutions<00:03:06.590> I'll<00:03:07.590> do<00:03:07.829> very<00:03:08.099> very<00:03:08.400> slowly<00:03:08.790> to

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
revolutions I'll do very very slowly to

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.470 
revolutions I'll do very very slowly to
ensure<00:03:09.569> that<00:03:10.079> there's<00:03:10.500> no<00:03:10.680> loops<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.610> line<00:03:11.880> or

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
ensure that there's no loops of line or

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.300 
ensure that there's no loops of line or
any<00:03:12.810> problems<00:03:13.290> with<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.500> line<00:03:13.709> snagging<00:03:14.190> on

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
any problems with the line snagging on

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.520 
any problems with the line snagging on
the<00:03:14.430> reel<00:03:14.610> ok<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.540> once<00:03:15.720> it's<00:03:15.900> on<00:03:16.049> then<00:03:16.319> you

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
the reel ok and once it's on then you

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.370 
the reel ok and once it's on then you
can<00:03:16.560> really<00:03:17.010> start<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.630> speed<00:03:18.630> up<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.900> process

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
can really start to speed up the process

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.559 
can really start to speed up the process
now<00:03:20.370> you'll<00:03:20.549> notice<00:03:20.760> Andy<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.299> I'm<00:03:21.389> actually

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
now you'll notice Andy that I'm actually

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.990 
now you'll notice Andy that I'm actually
holding<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.230> line<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:23.220> create<00:03:23.400> some<00:03:23.760> tension

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
holding the line to create some tension

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.059 
holding the line to create some tension
whilst<00:03:24.690> winding<00:03:25.139> the<00:03:25.200> line<00:03:25.380> onto<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.799> spool

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
whilst winding the line onto the spool

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.129 
whilst winding the line onto the spool
if<00:03:26.549> I<00:03:26.609> just<00:03:26.819> simply<00:03:27.120> wind<00:03:27.329> it<00:03:27.510> off<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.810> spool

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
if I just simply wind it off the spool

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.770 
if I just simply wind it off the spool
the<00:03:28.709> line<00:03:28.889> will<00:03:29.100> bunch<00:03:29.340> up<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:29.760> bed<00:03:30.030> in<00:03:30.239> so

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
the line will bunch up and bed in so

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.319 
the line will bunch up and bed in so
it's<00:03:30.930> important<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.590> learn<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.190> wine<00:03:32.549> wine

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
it's important to learn the wine wine

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.270 
it's important to learn the wine wine
the<00:03:33.930> line<00:03:34.200> under<00:03:34.799> some<00:03:35.010> tension<00:03:35.660> now<00:03:37.100> if<00:03:38.100> you

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
the line under some tension now if you

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.520 
the line under some tension now if you
started<00:03:38.639> to<00:03:38.790> get<00:03:38.910> too<00:03:39.540> much<00:03:39.720> friction<00:03:40.049> on<00:03:40.470> your

nicely and I'm managing to load the reel
very<00:03:55.590> very<00:03:55.889> efficiently<00:03:56.549> would<00:03:57.540> you

very very efficiently would you

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.170 
very very efficiently would you
generally<00:03:58.139> fill<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.950> whole<00:03:59.099> spool<00:03:59.459> with<00:03:59.940> line

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
generally fill the whole spool with line

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.089 
generally fill the whole spool with line
well<00:04:00.660> that's<00:04:01.079> an<00:04:01.260> absolutely<00:04:01.859> fundamental

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
well that's an absolutely fundamental

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.979 
well that's an absolutely fundamental
question<00:04:02.849> and<00:04:02.970> something<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.359> beginners

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
question and something that beginners

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.500 
question and something that beginners
often<00:04:04.560> get<00:04:04.739> wrong<00:04:05.000> when<00:04:06.000> I<00:04:06.090> finished<00:04:06.389> doing

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
often get wrong when I finished doing

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.030 
often get wrong when I finished doing
this<00:04:06.720> I'll<00:04:06.900> show<00:04:07.109> you<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.410> difference<00:04:07.769> but

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
this I'll show you the difference but

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.089 
this I'll show you the difference but
you<00:04:08.519> need<00:04:08.670> to<00:04:08.819> have<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.120> line<00:04:09.329> loaded<00:04:10.169> to<00:04:11.069> the

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
you need to have the line loaded to the

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.460 
you need to have the line loaded to the
optimum<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:12.209> don't<00:04:12.389> want<00:04:12.540> too<00:04:12.690> much<00:04:12.900> line<00:04:13.230> so

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
optimum you don't want too much line so

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.020 
optimum you don't want too much line so
that<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.709> falls<00:04:13.919> off<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.280> spool<00:04:14.549> causes

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
that it falls off the spool causes

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.050 
that it falls off the spool causes
tangles<00:04:15.599> and<00:04:15.900> not<00:04:16.079> enough<00:04:16.410> so<00:04:17.099> it<00:04:17.250> reduces<00:04:17.400> the

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
tangles and not enough so it reduces the

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.760 
tangles and not enough so it reduces the
effectiveness<00:04:18.539> of<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.260> reel<00:04:19.470> during<00:04:20.010> casting

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
effectiveness of the reel during casting

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.610 
effectiveness of the reel during casting
anyway<00:04:22.770> I'll<00:04:22.950> quickly<00:04:23.130> load<00:04:23.940> this<00:04:24.120> line<00:04:24.360> on

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
anyway I'll quickly load this line on

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.110 
anyway I'll quickly load this line on
alright<00:04:25.830> then<00:04:25.979> Andy<00:04:26.280> that<00:04:26.820> looks<00:04:26.970> about

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
alright then Andy that looks about

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.370 
alright then Andy that looks about
spot-on<00:04:27.570> so<00:04:28.340> I've<00:04:29.340> loaded<00:04:29.639> the<00:04:30.110> spool<00:04:31.110> to

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
spot-on so I've loaded the spool to

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.780 
spot-on so I've loaded the spool to
about<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.190> optimum<00:04:32.610> level<00:04:32.960> so<00:04:33.960> cut<00:04:34.229> the<00:04:34.320> line

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
about the optimum level so cut the line

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.219 
about the optimum level so cut the line
and<00:04:35.790> you'll<00:04:36.090> notice<00:04:36.449> that<00:04:38.630> we've<00:04:39.630> not<00:04:39.810> under

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
and you'll notice that we've not under

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.920 
and you'll notice that we've not under

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
filled the spool as in the case of this

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.020 
filled the spool as in the case of this
reel<00:04:43.139> here<00:04:43.470> which<00:04:44.250> is<00:04:44.370> going<00:04:44.520> to<00:04:44.580> seriously

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
reel here which is going to seriously

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.000 
reel here which is going to seriously
hamper<00:04:45.449> your<00:04:45.660> casting<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.290> the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
hamper your casting and the

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.980 
hamper your casting and the
effectiveness<00:04:47.430> of<00:04:47.639> the<00:04:47.790> reel<00:04:47.970> and<00:04:48.660> I<00:04:48.750> haven't

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
effectiveness of the reel and I haven't

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.159 
effectiveness of the reel and I haven't
overfilled<00:04:49.590> it<00:04:50.510> you<00:04:51.510> can<00:04:51.660> see<00:04:51.840> that<00:04:52.020> there's

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
overfilled it you can see that there's

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:53.960 
overfilled it you can see that there's
still<00:04:52.320> a<00:04:52.380> few<00:04:52.680> millimeters<00:04:53.220> left<00:04:53.460> there<00:04:53.790> of

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
still a few millimeters left there of

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.920 
still a few millimeters left there of
lip<00:04:54.510> on<00:04:54.660> the<00:04:54.810> spool<00:04:55.220> so<00:04:56.220> it's<00:04:57.150> quite<00:04:57.389> critical

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
lip on the spool so it's quite critical

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.779 
lip on the spool so it's quite critical
to<00:04:58.110> make<00:04:58.260> sure<00:04:58.410> that<00:04:58.530> you<00:04:58.680> load<00:04:58.919> the<00:04:59.370> reel<00:04:59.550> up

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
to make sure that you load the reel up

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.700 
to make sure that you load the reel up
with<00:05:00.479> the<00:05:00.600> correct<00:05:00.960> quantity<00:05:01.410> of<00:05:01.500> life

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
with the correct quantity of life

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:12.790 
with the correct quantity of life
brilliant<00:05:02.550> thanks<00:05:02.850> James

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800
