 Tutorial: Redstone Basics 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.740
 There are 3 different block properties in Minecraft: 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.800
 Charged blocks, such as Redstone torches, pictured here as yellow wool 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.180
 Powered blocks, depicted as red wool, could block anyone (solid) 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.690
 be cared for. 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.570
 In this case, Redstone dust is attached to the block. Later more... 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.160
 And normal, undriven blocks. 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.850
 Loaded blocks 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.050
 Charged blocks are just like powered blocks, but they 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.750
 Enable limit cable. 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.200
 A (Redstone) torch can be such a charged block 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.330
 The cable (redstone dust) 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.680
 Connected cables connect. 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.380
 It can be moved up and down. 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.700
 But only 1 block. 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.250
 And it takes 1 block of space above to connect. 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:01:00.230
 An active cable also powers the blocks below and at its ends. 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.710
 Just ignore from where the cable is powered;) 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.730
 A loaded block only supplies one cable for 15 blocks. 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.550
 After 15 blocks you need a Redstone repeater, more on that later. 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.050
 Incidentally, electricity flows 9 blocks in driven rails. (More on this 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.780
 later) 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.170
 The Redstone Torch 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.930
 A torch is a charged block and supplies (redstone) dust. 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.930
 The torch also loads the block over her. 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:35.230
 A torch goes off when the block to which it is attached is supplied. 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.050
 Such a torch is no longer loaded. It no longer provides electricity. 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.730
 Redstone Torch also have a little delay. 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.670
 When a Redstone torch goes on and off too fast, 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.640
 burns them and stops working for about 10 seconds. 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.550
 Redstone Repeater 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.300
 A repeater has an entrance and an exit, 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.540
 determines from which side you place it. 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.120
 And he has 4 settings to change his delay. 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.470
 The repeater comes on when it gets power ... 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.320
 or by a powered block in front of its entrance. 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.750
 Passing cable does not activate the repeater. 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.840
 An activated repeater loads the block in front of its output. 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.430
 Triggers (levers, knobs, pressure plates, detector rails) 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.390
 For the time a button is pressed, it loads itself and the block on which he is 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.340
 is attached. 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.680
 The same applies to activated levers. 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.600
 Printing plates behave the same way, but they are attached to the ground. 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.990
 Just like detector rails. 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.230
 The difference between the wood and lithographic plate is that the 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.140
 Stone plate at least the weight of a mob or player needed to 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.070
 to be triggered. 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.270
 For example, it is not pressed by an item. 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.960
 Or from an empty lore. 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.560
 Triggerable objects 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.200
 (Doors, TNT, vending machines, note pads, switches and powered rails) 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.140
 Automata, rails and TNT blocks are triggered 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.370
 when touching a powered block. 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.580
 It is not necessary to supply the object. (The same applies to powered rails) 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:07.510
 Doors must touch or be energized on a charged block. 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.650
 The same applies to iron doors. 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.500
 Note pads need to be powered. 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.170
 Have fun!
