00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:08.460
 December 21, 2012 on this day 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.000
 will be a grand cosmic 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.400
 phenomenon 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.040
 all the planets of our star system 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.890
 line up on one side of 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.710
 the sun as a result of 9 celestial bodies 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.510
 located on the conditional line together 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.240
 they will cross and quatre our galaxies 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.689
 which is called the milky way and the sun 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.380
 will be in its very center but the most 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.140
 amazing 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.390
 following the planets of our system into one 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.239
 a row will line up and the planets of other stellar 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.360
 systems and the conditional vector is formed 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.219
 millions of light years long in 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.610
 to the astronomical world this is called 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.370
 great parade of the planets according to forecasts 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.010
 scientists at the same time happen to him 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.530
 several amazing events first 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.510
 the moon obscure the sun then the same 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.840
 make and venera 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.739
 which means humanity can see two 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.809
 solar eclipse window after another 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.780
 experts say that the last time 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.630
 such a grand cosmic phenomenon 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.479
 took place 26,000 years ago and then on 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.330
 the earth has undergone a sharp change in climate all 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.670
 living on the planet instantly died 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.890
 according to many researchers the same 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.110
 the most can happen this time 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.300
 because when thousands of different planets 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.800
 line up they can 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.900
 break the universal balance 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.600
 gathered on one side of the sun 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.460
 the planets seem to outweigh the other with nothing 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.660
 part of our galaxy 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.540
 Milky Way 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.750
 teana is like a ship caught in a storm 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.580
 just roll over and go to 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.430
 free swimming in the universe 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.680
 if it happens then the earth cannot 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.650
 hold onto its former orbit and and 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.330
 waiting for global turmoil in our 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.000
 the planet will begin gravitational 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.869
 disturbances will rise 3 kilometer 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.830
 tsunami waves sweeping away everything in its path 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.570
 destructive earthquakes will occur 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.160
 and hurricanes will erupt all volcanoes 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.970
 it can completely destroy 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.090
 humanity 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.780
 in just a few months people will disappear 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.780
 from the face of the earth
