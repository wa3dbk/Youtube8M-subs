00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:15.399
 side us but m 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:17.599

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.630

 so as you can see once a better enemy marker 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.780
 here the role of the job 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.970

 she presidents of rates Moscow - a little bit 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.530

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.720
 the king m 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.270

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.350
 as it's an explanatory makeup 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.900
 the Phocean colors 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.300
 so first step the red 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.300

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.920
 Cannes film festival 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.720
 we did not take for this boundless humor 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.960
 So here is 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.960

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:13.760
 in full compliance 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.760
 so after I take the blue 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.369
 a ticket for this third world country 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:21.739

 it's my thing right now 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.459
 in the end right away from the conflict 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.079
