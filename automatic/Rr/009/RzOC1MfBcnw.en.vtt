00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.220 
you can look at the top five cards of
your<00:02:43.769> opponent's<00:02:44.220> deck<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:45.060> guess<00:02:45.989> it's

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
your opponent's deck so I guess it's

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.570 
your opponent's deck so I guess it's
pretty<00:02:46.440> good<00:02:46.709> if<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:47.130> know<00:02:47.340> how<00:02:47.549> to

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.229 
pretty good if you know how to
strategize<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:49.370> that's<00:02:50.370> pretty<00:02:50.579> much<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.790> but

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
strategize so that's pretty much it but

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.080 
strategize so that's pretty much it but
you<00:02:51.690> know<00:02:51.840> grapples<00:02:52.739> again<00:02:53.250> because<00:02:53.670> i'm<00:02:54.060> a
