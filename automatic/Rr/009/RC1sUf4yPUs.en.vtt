 P 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.300
 but 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.640
 x 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.910
 at 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.910
 like this 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.960
 but 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.310
 about 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.550
 this time 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.940
 you are watching makars 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.270
 at the end of summer 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.590
 on the eve of the new millennium 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.990
 humanity is becoming aware 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.240
 that losing its accustomed role and 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.250
 becomes part inefficient 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.830
 most people involved 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.650
 by art 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.820
 are shifted towards decorativeness and 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.990
 have fun 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.970
 and preoccupied with more commercial 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.780
 the effectiveness of their work 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.930
 but the authors remain who continue 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.710
 do that 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.450
 which is proper to do real 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.380
 even if there is money ahead 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.440
 such an area far from art 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.410
 fifth grade italian photographer 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.750
 oliviero tuscany now over six 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.590
 months implementing perhaps the most powerful 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.480
 conflicting worrisome 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.740
 advertising campaign which go 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.460
 boundaries of advertising and becomes 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.460
 evidence of our era 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.960
 for counts 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.590
 trifle it happened in 1982, we have our 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.940
 things went well but on the inside 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.450
 the Russian market and we decided to become a company 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.670
 presented all over the world for this 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.039
 we needed advertising advertising in 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.039
 based on global thinking 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.389
 Belozerov year by this time I 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:16.139
 worked other companies 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:18.709
 Yes, and now I continue to work not only on 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.279
 organized by luciano benetton 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:21.649
 own addressed me 

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:23.959
 because people are already different my work 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.219
 11 years care I worked 23 actually I 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.369
 came up with their image back later in the pen 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:32.589
 chili in general i worked for all serious 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:34.729
 fashion publications 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:35.710
 Putin 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.310
 if you want it by then Luciano 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.840
 benetton understood that ordinary advertising 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.400
 sister who were scored all the magazines and 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.299
 newspapers no longer work 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.389
 really traditional advertising 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.249
 is in crisis then on 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:53.010
 this field but it is 12 years ago and did not 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.219
 apply to the usual advertising campaign 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.209
 since then prefers cooperation 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.599
 teacher man is the same 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.719
 we proceeded the ninth language in the flowerbed 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:03.639
 that advertisements are not objects 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.489
 so she has an independent 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.579
 value with advertising should not serve 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.519
 product significant interest 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.790
 never lives his life and 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.689
 aims to create the name of the son and 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:17.689
 the ashes of the capital of hunchback dollars 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.069
 under the roof of that 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.489
 say that the leaders and we 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.059
 explained oliviero tuscany then what 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:28.799
 we want to get the best and most beautiful 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.539
 an ad campaign in the world in Iraqi like him 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:33.609
 if only I could come up 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.479
 demo that time tuscany 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.779
 already managed to prove himself a creator to open 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:41.309
 man floating against the current on 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:44.309
 packing passers 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:49.159
 her I don't think advertising can do all her 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.750
 make a person not buy goods on the street 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.450
 can imagine a small number 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.420
 people so hardheaded this 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.500
 to refuse to buy the right things 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.140
 because they don't like ads 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.420
 an experienced person buys the goods they 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.740
 advertisements in general can not be bought 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.850
 political advertising is only needed to 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.600
 the man thought understood laughed behind 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.850
 pay TV advertising should not force 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.329
 person to buy goods 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.449
 they are looking for ways 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:21.319
 I am responsible for the creative part of the body 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:24.319
 that is, came up with a picture 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.080
 they actually we do very little 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.090
 advertising we do it quite a bit but 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.410
 this is very strong promotional purposes i 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.370
 I donâ€™t think I should invest in 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.050
 advertising a lot of money 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.720
 I think it's not endless actors 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.759
 cleaning touch create such 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:41.800
 picture 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.000
 which was remembered from the first time 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.830
 sport i create an image and offering it for 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.330
 advertising campaign we never discuss 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.530
 and Ziya Brayan position the thing is that I have 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.360
 no ideas 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.360
 tel we work according to it i'm males 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.229
 we started by recruiting people model 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.669
 at the beginning of the campaign we still showed that 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:12.999
 an accident and but the models that we 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.909
 used 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:16.939
 but all nations are represented operations on 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:19.939
 what are the third attempts on earth 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.540
 in this case, when you surprise the company 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.919
 came up with representatives of UNESCO 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.210
 in Paris 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.210
 he came to look at my work in the studio 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.350
 where are the officials and all the colors they are there 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.050
 played with each other place you know what 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.789
 unesco is under the umbrella of the organization 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.720
 united nations 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.960
 Apparently he saw these gaming treatments 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.960
 said merged merged 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.400
 at least I have the same advertising projects 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.669
 caused controversy criticism 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.400
 it became obvious that in many countries 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.180
 preserved still racism explicit or hidden 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.290
 semaphore tobol people did not understand why 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.259
 this we shoot together young guys with 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.960
 different skin color on the rights of many countries 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.250
 persist racial prejudice from now on 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.910
 tolerance this causes debate on 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.300
 about our advertising and pr 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.430
 year our company had something else 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.680
 require advertising and PR Dmitri 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.910
 Medvedev and we understood that in order to 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.160
 help solve racial problems 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.750
 Dmitry needs to divide the country into 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.409
 ice floe 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:28.699
 show on ours with him in different ways 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:31.720
 as much as possible variation on this topic 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:34.259
 results served us here 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:36.229
 Of course, when you do something 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.169
 interesting people have different 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:40.369
 opinions on this 

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:42.909
 very often the opposite 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:45.529
 at the same time I think that even oresko rejection 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:48.169
 our advertising still works for us 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:50.990
 because harsh aversion aversion 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.499
 testifies that he drew himself 

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:56.330
 attention if there is someone who is me 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.069
 criticizes them because someone does not agree 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:01.330
 if someone has to be this someone to me 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.080
 look and think stupefied that is my 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.599
 The goal is reached Klitschko does not scare me 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:08.819
 far worse than false consent 

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:11.819
 positive 

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:25.939
 etc 

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:28.499
 etc 

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:31.099
 this time we have long been any informational 

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:32.790
 the message is propaganda 

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:33.370
 politics
