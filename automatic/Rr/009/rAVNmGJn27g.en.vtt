unanswered<00:00:19.520> so<00:00:20.520> we<00:00:20.939> have<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.769> essentially

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
unanswered so we have to essentially

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.099 
unanswered so we have to essentially
analyze<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.850> question<00:00:24.390> as<00:00:24.630> thoroughly<00:00:24.900> as

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
analyze this question as thoroughly as

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.589 
analyze this question as thoroughly as
possible<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.769> try<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.099> find<00:00:26.250> an<00:00:26.460> answer<00:00:26.599> but

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
possible to try and find an answer but

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.710 
possible to try and find an answer but
even<00:00:27.840> then<00:00:28.019> it's<00:00:28.460> still<00:00:29.460> going<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.179> be<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.420> bit

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
even then it's still going to be a bit

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.590 
even then it's still going to be a bit
blurry<00:00:31.170> but<00:00:31.470> first<00:00:32.250> let's<00:00:32.759> at<00:00:32.940> least<00:00:32.969> note<00:00:33.450> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
blurry but first let's at least note the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.810 
blurry but first let's at least note the
question<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.410> if<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.649> read<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.010> title

guy
that's<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.950> good<00:00:41.129> question<00:00:41.840> the<00:00:42.840> phone<00:00:43.079> guy

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
that's a good question the phone guy

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.580 
that's a good question the phone guy
never<00:00:43.559> really<00:00:43.890> has<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> distinct<00:00:45.090> killer<00:00:45.590> so

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
never really has a distinct killer so

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.430 
never really has a distinct killer so
I'm<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.390> already<00:00:48.390> rule<00:00:48.750> out<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.200> Tory

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
I'm going to already rule out the Tory

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.850 
I'm going to already rule out the Tory
animatronics<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.640> v1<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.570> over-talk

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
animatronics and the v1 and over-talk

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.410 
animatronics and the v1 and over-talk
animatronics<00:00:52.860> due<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> fact<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.000> they

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
animatronics due to the fact that they

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.080 
animatronics due to the fact that they
weren't<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.870> five<00:00:55.140> nights<00:00:55.379> one<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.309> they

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
weren't in five nights one so they

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.330 
weren't in five nights one so they
cannot<00:00:57.600> possibly<00:00:58.260> kill<00:00:58.710> them<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.190> down

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
cannot possibly kill them so it's down

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.520 
cannot possibly kill them so it's down

so let's take it apart piece by piece
earlier<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.490> audio<00:02:07.120> you<00:02:07.570> could<00:02:07.780> hear<00:02:08.020> the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
earlier in the audio you could hear the

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.220 
earlier in the audio you could hear the
door<00:02:08.410> banging<00:02:08.710> which<00:02:09.460> means<00:02:09.759> that<00:02:10.270> was<00:02:10.509> foxy

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
door banging which means that was foxy

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.080 
door banging which means that was foxy
running<00:02:11.710> down<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.040> corridor<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:12.550> banging<00:02:13.000> on

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090

the door

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.990 
the door
which<00:02:14.110> means<00:02:14.440> we<00:02:14.800> know<00:02:14.980> that<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.370> left<00:02:15.610> door

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
which means we know that the left door

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.320 
which means we know that the left door
is<00:02:16.300> closed<00:02:16.750> so<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.830> means<00:02:18.070> foxy<00:02:18.760> couldn't

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
is closed so that means foxy couldn't

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.840 
is closed so that means foxy couldn't
have<00:02:19.420> killed<00:02:19.630> them<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.070> Bonnie<00:02:21.070> couldn't

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
have killed them due to the fact that

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.970 
have killed them due to the fact that
Bonnie<00:02:23.980> only<00:02:24.430> attacks<00:02:24.700> from<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.180> left<00:02:25.390> or<00:02:25.660> on

only toy Freddy now this shows that it

only toy Freddy now this shows that it

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
killed him but it's most likely toy

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.940 
killed him but it's most likely toy
Freddy<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:48.660> did<00:03:48.930> it<00:03:49.080> due<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.620> fact<00:03:49.769> that

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
Freddy that did it due to the fact that

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.250 
Freddy that did it due to the fact that
he's<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.459> one<00:03:50.640> who<00:03:51.180> got<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.599> scream<00:03:51.930> and

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
he's the one who got the scream and

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.259 
he's the one who got the scream and
usually<00:03:52.769> when<00:03:52.950> you've<00:03:53.099> died<00:03:53.370> they<00:03:54.090> scream

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
usually when you've died they scream

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.190 
usually when you've died they scream
honestly<00:03:57.269> this<00:03:57.420> isn't<00:03:57.630> as<00:03:57.870> conclusive

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
honestly this isn't as conclusive

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.770 
honestly this isn't as conclusive
evidence<00:03:58.530> as<00:03:59.010> we'd<00:03:59.280> like<00:03:59.519> but<00:03:59.819> at<00:04:00.360> least<00:04:00.599> we've

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
evidence as we'd like but at least we've

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.990 
evidence as we'd like but at least we've
narrowed<00:04:00.989> it<00:04:01.170> down<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.380> two<00:04:01.800> maybe<00:04:02.610> even<00:04:02.790> three

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
narrowed it down to two maybe even three

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.630 
narrowed it down to two maybe even three
because<00:04:03.690> many<00:04:04.290> people<00:04:04.650> seem<00:04:04.920> to<00:04:05.130> speculate

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
because many people seem to speculate

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.490 
because many people seem to speculate
that<00:04:05.670> Freddy<00:04:06.209> doesn't<00:04:06.420> just<00:04:06.870> have<00:04:07.080> to<00:04:07.110> do<00:04:07.350> the

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
that Freddy doesn't just have to do the

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.800 
that Freddy doesn't just have to do the
toreador<00:04:07.860> march<00:04:08.130> on<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.489> left<00:04:08.700> side<00:04:08.880> he<00:04:09.569> just

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
toreador march on the left side he just

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.660 
toreador march on the left side he just
does<00:04:10.080> it<00:04:10.230> on<00:04:10.319> the<00:04:10.470> left<00:04:10.650> side<00:04:10.830> to<00:04:11.340> keep

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
does it on the left side to keep

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.330 
does it on the left side to keep
consistent<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.750> that's<00:04:13.530> where<00:04:13.860> everyone

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
consistent and that's where everyone

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.180 
consistent and that's where everyone
else<00:04:14.459> attacks<00:04:14.819> so<00:04:15.180> he<00:04:15.390> want<00:04:15.599> to<00:04:15.720> be<00:04:16.290> like

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
else attacks so he want to be like

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.940 
else attacks so he want to be like
everyone<00:04:17.609> else<00:04:17.820> but<00:04:18.410> honestly<00:04:19.410> I<00:04:19.440> don't<00:04:19.650> think

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
everyone else but honestly I don't think

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.219 
everyone else but honestly I don't think
that's<00:04:20.100> conclusive<00:04:20.400> evidence<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:21.389> I<00:04:22.079> don't

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
that's conclusive evidence and I don't

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.500 
that's conclusive evidence and I don't
know<00:04:22.560> if<00:04:22.860> we<00:04:23.160> will<00:04:23.430> ever<00:04:23.460> get<00:04:23.880> an<00:04:24.000> answer<00:04:24.360> to

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
know if we will ever get an answer to

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.690 
know if we will ever get an answer to
this<00:04:24.630> question<00:04:25.110> but<00:04:25.320> at<00:04:25.770> least<00:04:25.919> now<00:04:26.220> we<00:04:26.280> have<00:04:26.490> a

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
this question but at least now we have a

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
this question but at least now we have a
basic<00:04:27.419> idea<00:04:27.570> of<00:04:27.870> who's<00:04:28.229> done<00:04:28.530> it
