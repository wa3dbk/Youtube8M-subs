and<00:01:13.009> Pat<00:01:13.220> them<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.640> dry<00:01:15.160> the<00:01:16.160> potatoes<00:01:16.670> need<00:01:16.880> to

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
and Pat them to dry the potatoes need to

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.870 
and Pat them to dry the potatoes need to
be<00:01:17.119> dry<00:01:17.450> because<00:01:18.320> if<00:01:18.619> you<00:01:18.740> put<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.610> wet

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
be dry because if you put the wet

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.700 
be dry because if you put the wet
potatoes<00:01:20.450> in<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.720> oil<00:01:20.960> they<00:01:21.200> will<00:01:21.350> splatter

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
potatoes in the oil they will splatter

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.570 
potatoes in the oil they will splatter
real<00:01:22.070> bad

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
real bad

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.200 
real bad
I<00:01:24.580> have<00:01:25.580> canola<00:01:26.060> oil<00:01:26.390> heated<00:01:27.080> to<00:01:27.610> 350<00:01:28.610> degrees

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
I have canola oil heated to 350 degrees

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.770 
I have canola oil heated to 350 degrees
I<00:01:29.510> found<00:01:30.049> that<00:01:30.200> if<00:01:30.350> you<00:01:30.500> go<00:01:30.710> above<00:01:31.420> 350<00:01:32.420> degrees

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
I found that if you go above 350 degrees

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.440 
I found that if you go above 350 degrees
the<00:01:33.140> potato<00:01:33.560> chips<00:01:33.860> end<00:01:34.130> up<00:01:34.280> browner<00:01:34.610> so<00:01:35.390> if

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
the potato chips end up browner so if

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.560 
the potato chips end up browner so if
you<00:01:35.570> keep<00:01:35.780> it<00:01:35.930> between<00:01:36.140> safe<00:01:36.850> 325<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.060> 350

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
you keep it between safe 325 and 350

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:45.930 
you keep it between safe 325 and 350
they<00:01:38.990> turn<00:01:39.409> out<00:01:39.530> just<00:01:39.979> right

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.640 

it<00:01:46.940> takes<00:01:47.180> about<00:01:47.360> three<00:01:47.870> minutes<00:01:48.050> to<00:01:48.350> cook

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
it takes about three minutes to cook

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.770 
it takes about three minutes to cook
them<00:01:48.940> when<00:01:49.940> they're<00:01:50.090> done<00:01:50.240> they'll<00:01:50.540> stop

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
them when they're done they'll stop

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.200 
them when they're done they'll stop
sizzling<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:51.770> they'll<00:01:52.040> be<00:01:52.340> completely<00:01:52.670> Brown

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
sizzling and they'll be completely Brown

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:03.760 
sizzling and they'll be completely Brown
I<00:02:01.180> take<00:02:02.180> them<00:02:02.360> out<00:02:02.540> of<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:02.750> pot<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.020> put<00:02:03.620> them

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
I take them out of the pot and put them

I take them out of the pot and put them
on<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:03.980> rack<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:04.670> drain<00:02:05.030> I<00:02:05.300> have<00:02:05.780> two<00:02:06.470> wrecks

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
on a rack to drain I have two wrecks

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.240 
on a rack to drain I have two wrecks
crisscross<00:02:07.700> over<00:02:08.240> a<00:02:08.479> cookie<00:02:09.170> sheet<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:10.070> keep

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
crisscross over a cookie sheet to keep

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.850 
crisscross over a cookie sheet to keep
them<00:02:10.460> from<00:02:10.610> falling<00:02:11.090> through<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:12.080> this<00:02:12.230> gets

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
them from falling through and this gets

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.270 
them from falling through and this gets
a<00:02:12.980> lot<00:02:13.130> of<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.400> oil<00:02:13.430> off<00:02:13.880> of<00:02:14.180> them<00:02:15.280> after

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
a lot of the oil off of them after

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.340 
a lot of the oil off of them after
they've<00:02:16.430> drained<00:02:16.700> on<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.060> rack<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:17.690> put<00:02:18.140> them

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
they've drained on the rack I put them

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.850 
they've drained on the rack I put them
on<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.620> paper<00:02:18.920> towel<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.580> drain<00:02:19.610> some<00:02:20.150> more

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
on a paper towel to drain some more

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.650 
on a paper towel to drain some more
here's<00:02:21.860> how<00:02:22.070> many<00:02:22.250> potato<00:02:22.670> chips<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.240> ended<00:02:23.540> up

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
here's how many potato chips I ended up

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.370 
here's how many potato chips I ended up
with<00:02:23.990> from<00:02:24.470> five<00:02:24.800> potatoes<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:26.480> ones<00:02:26.930> in<00:02:27.260> the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
with from five potatoes the ones in the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.400 
with from five potatoes the ones in the
top<00:02:27.620> left-hand<00:02:28.310> corner<00:02:28.720> were<00:02:29.720> cooked<00:02:30.080> at<00:02:30.260> the

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
top left-hand corner were cooked at the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.110 
top left-hand corner were cooked at the
higher<00:02:30.590> temperature<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.580> can<00:02:31.730> see<00:02:31.940> what<00:02:32.090> I

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
higher temperature so you can see what I

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.510 
higher temperature so you can see what I
mean<00:02:32.300> about<00:02:32.360> how<00:02:32.840> they<00:02:33.050> turn<00:02:33.260> out<00:02:33.290> browner<00:02:33.830> if

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
mean about how they turn out browner if

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.250 
mean about how they turn out browner if
you<00:02:34.640> keep<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.030> temperature<00:02:35.060> down<00:02:35.870> between

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
you keep the temperature down between

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.160 
you keep the temperature down between
325<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.160> 350<00:02:37.820> they<00:02:38.180> turn<00:02:38.390> out<00:02:38.420> better

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
325 and 350 they turn out better

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.910 
325 and 350 they turn out better
I<00:02:40.090> put<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.240> potato<00:02:41.600> chips<00:02:41.990> in<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.290> paper<00:02:42.530> bag

coat<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.400> potato<00:02:46.760> chip

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.460 

started<00:03:25.310> out<00:03:25.459> with<00:03:25.730> a<00:03:25.790> full<00:03:26.180> bottle<00:03:26.629> of<00:03:26.810> canola

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
started out with a full bottle of canola

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.210 
started out with a full bottle of canola
oil<00:03:27.709> I<00:03:28.220> also<00:03:28.790> made<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.629> poder<00:03:30.139> Ito's<00:03:30.500> if

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
oil I also made the poder Ito's if

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.970 
oil I also made the poder Ito's if
you've<00:03:31.430> seen<00:03:31.639> that<00:03:31.670> video<00:03:32.139> from<00:03:33.139> this<00:03:33.349> oil<00:03:33.620> and

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
you've seen that video from this oil and

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.580 
you've seen that video from this oil and
the<00:03:34.310> potato<00:03:34.639> chips<00:03:35.030> then<00:03:35.690> this<00:03:35.959> is<00:03:36.109> how<00:03:36.230> much<00:03:36.409> I

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
the potato chips then this is how much I

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.699 
the potato chips then this is how much I
had<00:03:36.799> left<00:03:37.099> I<00:03:37.599> found<00:03:38.599> a<00:03:38.780> neat<00:03:38.989> gadget<00:03:39.500> for

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
had left I found a neat gadget for

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.830 
had left I found a neat gadget for
straining<00:03:40.189> oils<00:03:40.579> I<00:03:40.670> believe<00:03:41.000> I<00:03:41.150> bought<00:03:41.359> this

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
straining oils I believe I bought this

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.429 
straining oils I believe I bought this
strainer<00:03:42.379> at<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:43.099> Dollar<00:03:43.370> Tree<00:03:43.930> was<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:44.959> set<00:03:45.290> of

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:45.439 
strainer at the Dollar Tree was a set of

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:50.699 
strainer at the Dollar Tree was a set of
two<00:03:45.680> one<00:03:46.010> fits<00:03:46.310> a<00:03:46.430> bottle<00:03:46.819> and<00:03:47.030> one<00:03:47.329> fits<00:03:47.599> a<00:03:47.720> jar

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.949 

so<00:03:51.709> that's<00:03:52.069> how<00:03:52.280> I<00:03:52.310> made<00:03:52.609> potato<00:03:53.030> chips<00:03:53.450> that

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
so that's how I made potato chips that

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.080 
so that's how I made potato chips that
it<00:03:54.109> was<00:03:54.230> definitely<00:03:54.680> worthwhile<00:03:55.040> they<00:03:55.790> taste

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
it was definitely worthwhile they taste

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.349 
it was definitely worthwhile they taste
very<00:03:56.239> good<00:03:56.510> in<00:03:56.930> fact<00:03:56.959> I<00:03:57.829> cut<00:03:58.669> them<00:03:58.879> a<00:03:58.910> bit

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
very good in fact I cut them a bit

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.449 
very good in fact I cut them a bit
thinner<00:03:59.720> than<00:04:00.079> store-bought<00:04:00.500> potato<00:04:01.099> chips

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
thinner than store-bought potato chips

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.280 
thinner than store-bought potato chips
so<00:04:01.730> they're<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.030> most<00:04:02.239> delicate<00:04:02.629> potato

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
so they're the most delicate potato

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.020 
so they're the most delicate potato
chips<00:04:03.590> I've<00:04:03.769> ever<00:04:03.949> eaten

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
chips I've ever eaten

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.509 
chips I've ever eaten
I<00:04:05.090> think<00:04:05.629> it<00:04:05.780> cost<00:04:05.989> about<00:04:06.260> $1<00:04:06.769> to<00:04:07.159> make<00:04:07.190> these

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
I think it cost about $1 to make these

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.330 
I think it cost about $1 to make these
potato<00:04:07.909> chips<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.629> if<00:04:08.870> I<00:04:09.019> had<00:04:09.250> potatoes<00:04:10.250> that

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
potato chips and if I had potatoes that

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.180 
potato chips and if I had potatoes that
I<00:04:10.400> grew<00:04:10.669> myself<00:04:10.879> I<00:04:11.629> could<00:04:12.169> cut<00:04:12.379> that<00:04:12.530> cost<00:04:12.949> in

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
I grew myself I could cut that cost in

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.769 
I grew myself I could cut that cost in
half<00:04:13.569> so<00:04:14.569> hope<00:04:15.109> it<00:04:15.319> helps
