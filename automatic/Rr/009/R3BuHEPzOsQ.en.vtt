00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.789
 hello people today i want to go back 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.759
 with a fashion idea beginning and end 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.390
 although we have this john deere 61 here 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:37.450
 50 m 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.129
 We'll go into detail in a minute so we 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.769
 look in the shop since we have the 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.420
 Johnny is not quite mine now 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.989
 You can not speak that much now 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.190
 remove 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.790
 yes, let's take a look 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.160
 trekker 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.050
 now I have to do that one time 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.420
 console again looked at what four 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.460
 Features we have once with 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.300
 five and six different lights 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.089
 Once back at 6 and the front of the 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.600
 internet 5 in addition of course this 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.060
 normal I with f and yes we can 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.399
 just turn everything off again 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.200
 all around lights turn hereby post 1 1 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:17.050
 that with me actually on the 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.660
 keyboard would have to look left 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.880
 still fast also had left right 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.710
 barmbeker too and 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.990
 what can you have to say we have 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.759
 then here apache controls with button 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.340
 five and six that means some 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.680
 weeks to move up and off 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.149
 round the key 5 and 6 then what 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.289
 some followers is quite practical 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.119
 For example, if you 're wrong somehow 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:42.649
 built the then ever quite 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:44.390
 cool and no matter what else it is 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.399
 unfortunately elementary does not work 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.170
 a little stupid but you can do this 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.429
 to change 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.310
 from outside that is a very nice one 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.920
 Tractor on this small dirt 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.090
 texture on the side so a bit 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.369
 pretty well done is a little one 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.869
 remodeling of the old model and 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:06.799
 available on all 2013 the link pack 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.360
 I'll put you in the description and yes 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.319
 actually pretty cool we now times 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.930
 purely inside I grab the console 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.700
 back out with the spacebar could t 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.020
 you can activate control 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:24.730
 several times the mother 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:27.430
 can you turn lights or blinkers like that 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:32.040
 activate all or not depending 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.540
 we like that so after the 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.870
 description we now come to 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:42.350
 a negative point and that is at 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.720
 the trek so you can if you are 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.030
 one thing does not have a second one 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.040
 can perceive is now time for the 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.500
 weight driven from the outset 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.300
 just before that nothing happens so too 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.800
 prove is ever the trailer 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:00.370
 and the weight depends 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.540
 Of course that works then works 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.939
 we can no longer accept the trailer 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.620
 That's the only negative point 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.079
 I wondered until now a tractor and 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.090
 that was not a shame but otherwise 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.980
 the trek really pretty well done 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.780
 and from her up 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.810
 no fashion recommendation although the motto 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.590
 But was I'm really pretty cool and 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.730
 for smaller work or so there you go 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.500
 only one thing can attach 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.360
 actually pretty cool and me 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.300
 think with the material can be the 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.980
 really see 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.510
 think that was it again 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.980
 for this video is really over right 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.140
 an abo then thumbs up high if 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.500
 you liked the video and the houses 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.550
 for trekking and until next time 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.550
 newer already included
