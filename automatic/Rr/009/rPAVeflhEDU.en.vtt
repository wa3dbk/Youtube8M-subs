00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.350 
it's pretty simple to do it just can be
take<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> lot<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.700> time<00:01:32.880> because<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.150> need<00:01:33.329> a

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
take a lot of time because you need a

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.730 
take a lot of time because you need a
lot<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.720> speed<00:01:34.020> points<00:01:34.229> if<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.500> do<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
lot of speed points if you do it the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.179 
lot of speed points if you do it the
proper<00:01:34.920> way

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
proper way

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.679 
proper way
but<00:01:35.820> if<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.000> do<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.210> kind<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.450> like<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
but if you do it kind of like the

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.450 
but if you do it kind of like the
cheating<00:01:36.990> way<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.470> don't<00:01:37.619> know<00:01:37.920> existed

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
cheating way that I don't know existed

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.120 
cheating way that I don't know existed
it<00:01:38.549> until<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.850> did<00:01:39.000> accidently<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.710> you

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
it until I did accidently is that you

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.980 
it until I did accidently is that you
just<00:01:41.869> go<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.829> career<00:01:44.540> part<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.840> you
