00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
excel magic trick 377 to 380 and this

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.020 
excel magic trick 377 to 380 and this
trick<00:00:13.139> we<00:00:13.259> want<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.500> see<00:00:13.620> how<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.799> round<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:15.000> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
trick we want to see how to round to the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.740 
trick we want to see how to round to the
nearest<00:00:15.150> 5<00:00:16.400> 4<00:00:17.400> negative<00:00:17.580> numbers<00:00:18.150> so<00:00:18.180> this

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
nearest 5 4 negative numbers so this

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.410 
nearest 5 4 negative numbers so this
number<00:00:19.050> should<00:00:19.770> end<00:00:19.980> up<00:00:20.160> getting<00:00:21.029> rounded

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
number should end up getting rounded

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.359 
number should end up getting rounded
down<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.630> negative<00:00:21.990> 5<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.800> one<00:00:23.039> should<00:00:23.250> be

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
down to negative 5 this one should be

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.939 
down to negative 5 this one should be
negative<00:00:23.519> 5<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:24.300> one<00:00:24.539> should<00:00:24.750> be<00:00:24.900> 10<00:00:25.260> this

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
negative 5 this one should be 10 this

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.859 
negative 5 this one should be 10 this
one<00:00:26.189> should<00:00:26.369> be<00:00:26.400> 5<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.269> always<00:00:27.390> rounding

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
one should be 5 so it's always rounding

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.710 
one should be 5 so it's always rounding
to<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> multiple<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.099> nearest<00:00:29.400> 5<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.480> M

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
to a multiple to the nearest 5 the M

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.530 
to a multiple to the nearest 5 the M
round<00:00:31.710> function<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.520> available<00:00:33.059> if<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.329> have

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
round function is available if you have

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.549 
round function is available if you have
the<00:00:33.780> more<00:00:34.200> funk<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.960> let's<00:00:36.960> go<00:00:37.110> ahead<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.410> and

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
the more funk and let's go ahead and and

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.440 
the more funk and let's go ahead and and
it's<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:39.440> more<00:00:40.440> funk<00:00:41.010> add-in<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:42.360> we're

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
it's the more funk add-in but we're

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.150 
it's the more funk add-in but we're
gonna<00:00:42.540> see<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.750> there's<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.110> problem<00:00:43.620> with

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
gonna see that there's a problem with

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.979 
gonna see that there's a problem with
this<00:00:44.340> I've<00:00:44.579> done<00:00:44.969> other<00:00:45.120> videos<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.750> shown

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
this I've done other videos and shown

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.560 
this I've done other videos and shown
the<00:00:46.309> great<00:00:47.309> uses<00:00:47.640> for<00:00:47.670> M<00:00:47.879> realm<00:00:48.090> but<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.450> is

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
the great uses for M realm but this is

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.930 
the great uses for M realm but this is
where<00:00:48.750> M<00:00:48.899> round<00:00:49.200> won't<00:00:49.410> work<00:00:49.770> M<00:00:50.539> round

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
where M round won't work M round

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.040 
where M round won't work M round
highlight<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.090> number<00:00:54.449> right<00:00:54.629> there<00:00:54.660> and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
highlight that number right there and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.889 
highlight that number right there and
then<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.590> multiple<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.489> going<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> be<00:00:57.239> that

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
then the multiple is going to be that

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.229 
then the multiple is going to be that
I'll<00:00:58.199> hit<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> f4<00:00:58.620> key<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.160> lock<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.090> when

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
I'll hit the f4 key to lock it and when

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.660 
I'll hit the f4 key to lock it and when
I<00:01:00.270> control<00:01:00.719> enter<00:01:01.050> forget<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.430> not

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
I control enter forget it it's not

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.899 
I control enter forget it it's not
handling<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.870> negative<00:01:04.530> numbers<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.729> need

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
handling the negative numbers so we need

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.700 
handling the negative numbers so we need
to<00:01:06.030> use<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.390> round<00:01:06.659> function<00:01:07.200> I'm<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:07.560> to

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
to use the round function I'm going to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.310 
to use the round function I'm going to
highlight<00:01:07.890> all<00:01:08.040> these<00:01:08.460> cells<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.930> round

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
highlight all these cells that round

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.350 
highlight all these cells that round
function<00:01:10.799> could<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> same<00:01:11.760> thing<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.150> M

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
function could do the same thing that M

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.609 
function could do the same thing that M
round<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.170> divide<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
round but you have to divide and

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.030 
round but you have to divide and
multiply<00:01:14.990> active<00:01:15.990> cell<00:01:16.229> at<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.409> top<00:01:16.650> we<00:01:16.830> say

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
multiply active cell at the top we say

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.300 
multiply active cell at the top we say
round<00:01:17.570> we<00:01:18.570> take<00:01:18.780> our<00:01:18.960> number<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.770> we're

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
round we take our number and we're

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.340 
round we take our number and we're
always<00:01:20.400> going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.759> divide<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.630> number<00:01:22.020> by<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
always going to divide the number by the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.800 
always going to divide the number by the
multiple<00:01:23.130> whatever<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.939> f4<00:01:26.299> comma<00:01:27.299> we're

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
multiple whatever it is f4 comma we're

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.380 
multiple whatever it is f4 comma we're
always<00:01:28.049> going<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.409> round<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.250> integer<00:01:29.880> 0

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
always going to round to the integer 0

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.210 
always going to round to the integer 0
says<00:01:30.750> hey<00:01:30.900> round<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> nearest<00:01:31.619> ones

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
says hey round to the nearest ones

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.300 
says hey round to the nearest ones
position<00:01:32.630> but<00:01:33.630> we've<00:01:33.780> divided<00:01:34.380> here<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.130> now

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
position but we've divided here so now

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.490 
position but we've divided here so now
what<00:01:35.520> do<00:01:35.579> we<00:01:35.670> need<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.939> do<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.509> multiply<00:01:37.110> in

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
what do we need to do just multiply in

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.440 
what do we need to do just multiply in
essence<00:01:37.920> what<00:01:38.070> happened<00:01:38.400> here<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.729> divided

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
essence what happened here is we divided

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.179 
essence what happened here is we divided
this<00:01:39.570> got<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> number<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.619> fives<00:01:41.009> there<00:01:41.520> are

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
this got the number of fives there are

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.560 
this got the number of fives there are
divided<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.430> integer<00:01:44.790> which<00:01:45.000> hacked<00:01:45.360> off

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
divided to the integer which hacked off

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.690 
divided to the integer which hacked off
that<00:01:45.780> little<00:01:45.960> integer<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.710> then<00:01:47.100> multiplied

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
that little integer and then multiplied

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.780 
that little integer and then multiplied
how<00:01:48.000> many<00:01:48.240> fives<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:48.960> had<00:01:49.170> times<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.950> 5f

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
how many fives we had times the 5f

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.859 
how many fives we had times the 5f
whoops

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
