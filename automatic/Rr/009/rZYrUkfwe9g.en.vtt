00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.399
 You can not sell this part because in 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.899
 this case we will not have what is a 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:09.820
 brother of the cattle primary 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.040
 secondary right now what are we going to 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.750
 do the following right now what 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.240
 is going to realize is that we are going 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.890
 to lower what is the voltage to a 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.349
 voltage in which allows us to be able 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.060
 work this part let's see what happens 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.060
 with this in this case 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.970
 what we have 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.170
 now 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.380
 this 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.160
 there it is in this case it is not happening 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.530
 account 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.210
 26 very good 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.450
 next I have a second 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.670
 transformer 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.740
 this transformer we are going to make a 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.480
 special connection with him the first 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.110
 transformer we know that it is a 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.380
 type connection that isolated because it's 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.780
 isolated because if we realize not 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.180
 we have this connection between this part 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.430
 with this they remember when you 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.860
 they gave continuity then good in 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.830
 this part we saw that it was isolated in this 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.680
 type of connection we are going to make 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.430
 a small variation below what 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.130
 what I'm going to do is that I'm going to connect 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.670
 the primary 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.670
 d 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:44.740
 and my first transformer 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:47.640
 and we are still there and in this case 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.640
 here I have to 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.429
 same here I still have this part not 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.159
 very well in this case I already have my 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:02.280
 first part of the feed now 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.679
 this in this case this type of connection 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.910
 what I'm going to do is known with a 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:10.830
 autotransformer in this case good a 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.930
 of the characteristics that the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.940
 autotransformer is going to be the next 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.270
 in this case where we are going to connect 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.170
 as auto transformer base the second 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.170
 transformer 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.650
 let's see what happens so that we 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.900
 we can see it more clearly I'm going to 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.140
 take the extremes that give me more 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.140
 voltage 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.940
 although reply to comment 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.940
 in this part 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.520
 with this very well 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.580
 very well then since I have I 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.820
 is for this connection 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.330
 next I will perform what 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.330
 following 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.990
 I'm going to measure 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.780
 the voltage 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.790
 in age in this case of how much they say 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.980
 voltage now 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.790
 serves 29 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.610
 very well 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.280
 next what I'm going to do is 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.380
 the following below what I'm going to 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:33.420
 to do is that I'm going 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.420
 disconnect this part from the ends 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.750
 I'm going to change it 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.410
 as soon as it is at a voltage 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.070
 of 23 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:57.630
 in this case that is what we saw when 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.630
 voltage familiarization 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.910
 in this case it can be but in this case 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:14.230
 we see that it increases how much 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:17.070
 within the reference was 26 63 and 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.070
 how much was reduced 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.960
 it came up three later and we connect it where 

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:25.860
 are the 26 and connecting it upside down is 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.860
 reduce 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.840
 I do not know if they have this something 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.080
 in this case good this is the way 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.150
 which is said that a 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.390
 autotransformer the autotransformer 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.600
 it's supposed to connect that connects 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.600
 in 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:48.279
 primary with secondary 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.379
 this is for when we maybe 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:54.580
 we want something with a small 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:56.740
 increase in voltage with a 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.669
 decrement possibly where 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.669
 we could find 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.350
 who do their work 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.680
 on the computer where it connects on the 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.680
 computer 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:23.939
 in 120 more 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.040
 not apart 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.620
 in a regulator and I do not know if later they have 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.970
 found some regulators or then 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.970
 has three same ones 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.340
 laws or three focuses 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:48.230
 and well out there he says regulating line 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:48.230
 normal low 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.340
 or regulating highly lines 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.820
 as well 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:59.320
 in this case what happens if it arrives too high 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:02.160
 I can really lower it if it arrives well 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:06.830
 figuration 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.830
 and if it comes less, increase 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.210
 It is a function 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.620
 because this is a part then for 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.139
 that told us that he was not so smart 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.660
 it was not so difficult for us in this case 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:28.120
 we do not start this practice directly 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.550
 with the 127 bots because our 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.160
 transformer will not stand for 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:36.699
 that's what we use that one so that 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.710
 help us reduce the voltage that 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:39.630
 needs to 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.420
 but in this case the autotransformer 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.490
 connects that in series of the primary with 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.350
 the secondary in this case that is 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.060
 connected with another transformer who 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.820
 is 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.740
 this transformer is only for us 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:56.550
 is helping us to lower the assembly 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.550
 any
