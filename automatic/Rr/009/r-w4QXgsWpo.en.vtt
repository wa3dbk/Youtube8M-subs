to splay the brush down and push down on

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.160 
to splay the brush down and push down on
it<00:01:05.379> so<00:01:05.680> that<00:01:05.830> the<00:01:05.860> brush<00:01:06.690> the<00:01:07.690> brush<00:01:07.900> will

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
it so that the brush the brush will

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.030 
it so that the brush the brush will
actually<00:01:09.690> lay<00:01:10.690> very<00:01:10.869> flat<00:01:11.049> if<00:01:11.680> you're<00:01:11.890> going

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
to go back and forth and back and forth

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.710 
to go back and forth and back and forth
so<00:01:13.659> that<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:14.020> paint<00:01:14.260> works<00:01:15.030> up<00:01:16.030> towards<00:01:16.570> the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
so that the paint works up towards the

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.740 
so that the paint works up towards the
ferrule<00:01:17.080> ferrule<00:01:17.729> meaning<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:19.030> metal<00:01:19.540> part

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
ferrule ferrule meaning the metal part

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.260 
ferrule ferrule meaning the metal part
here<00:01:20.070> all<00:01:21.070> right<00:01:21.220> if<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.610> brush<00:01:21.850> looks<00:01:22.119> like

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
here all right if the brush looks like

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.030 
here all right if the brush looks like
it's<00:01:22.479> separating<00:01:23.170> which<00:01:23.320> mine<00:01:23.530> does<00:01:23.770> a<00:01:23.799> little

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
it's separating which mine does a little

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.490 
it's separating which mine does a little
bit<00:01:24.250> it<00:01:24.460> may<00:01:24.610> mean<00:01:24.820> that<00:01:24.850> there's<00:01:25.210> not<00:01:25.500> enough

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
bit it may mean that there's not enough

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.890 
bit it may mean that there's not enough
water<00:01:26.890> which<00:01:27.549> you<00:01:27.729> would<00:01:27.850> just<00:01:28.060> tip<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.720> very

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
water which you would just tip the very

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.410 
water which you would just tip the very
very<00:01:29.229> end<00:01:29.500> of<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.830> brush<00:01:30.040> in<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.970> water<00:01:31.000> and

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
very end of the brush in the water and

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.179 
very end of the brush in the water and
then<00:01:31.540> do<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:31.840> again<00:01:31.930> but<00:01:32.740> we'll<00:01:32.920> see<00:01:33.159> as<00:01:33.369> I<00:01:34.149> go

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189
