00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
now if you haven't gotten the point by

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.380 
now if you haven't gotten the point by
now<00:00:04.890> we<00:00:05.100> really<00:00:05.310> like<00:00:05.609> this<00:00:05.790> little<00:00:06.089> four<00:00:06.299> and

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
now we really like this little four and

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.610 
now we really like this little four and
a<00:00:06.420> half<00:00:06.600> inch<00:00:06.810> roller<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.259> here's<00:00:07.470> another

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
a half inch roller and here's another

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.070 
a half inch roller and here's another
area<00:00:08.160> again<00:00:08.610> we<00:00:08.820> talked<00:00:09.059> about<00:00:09.360> maybe<00:00:09.599> rolling

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
area again we talked about maybe rolling

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.410 
area again we talked about maybe rolling
a<00:00:10.200> nine<00:00:10.380> inch<00:00:10.620> into<00:00:10.920> your<00:00:11.040> trim<00:00:11.370> but<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.269> is

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
a nine inch into your trim but this is

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.970 
a nine inch into your trim but this is
going<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.630> be<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:13.230> much<00:00:13.410> easier<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.860> these

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
going to be so much easier in these

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.799 
going to be so much easier in these
small<00:00:14.340> areas<00:00:14.700> we<00:00:14.790> can<00:00:14.940> fit<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.330> between<00:00:15.660> these

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
small areas we can fit in between these

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.880 
small areas we can fit in between these
doorways<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.940> it'll<00:00:17.940> allow<00:00:18.150> us<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.890> continue

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
doorways and it'll allow us to continue

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.910 
doorways and it'll allow us to continue
again<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.609> keep<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:21.029> wet<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.750> our<00:00:22.529> small

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
again to keep this wet in our small

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.590 
again to keep this wet in our small
areas<00:00:23.310> here<00:00:23.550> we'll<00:00:23.699> use<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.939> small<00:00:24.330> roller

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
areas here we'll use the small roller

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.660 
areas here we'll use the small roller
and<00:00:24.869> then<00:00:25.080> we'll<00:00:25.410> lay<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.859> down<00:00:25.920> as<00:00:26.430> we

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
and then we'll lay this down as we

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.820 
and then we'll lay this down as we
progress<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> bigger<00:00:27.810> wall<00:00:28.109> we

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
progress that on to the bigger wall we

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.439 
progress that on to the bigger wall we
use<00:00:29.039> our<00:00:29.189> large<00:00:29.460> roller<00:00:29.820> for<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> bigger

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
use our large roller for the bigger

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.500 
use our large roller for the bigger
areas<00:00:30.960> now<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.920> particular<00:00:32.099> case<00:00:32.610> I'm

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
areas now in this particular case I'm

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.840 
areas now in this particular case I'm
going<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.750> go<00:00:33.870> ahead<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.440> cut<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.489> ahead<00:00:35.790> of

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
going to go ahead and cut in ahead of

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.000 
going to go ahead and cut in ahead of
David<00:00:36.450> he's<00:00:36.719> gonna<00:00:36.899> do<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.290> rolling<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
David he's gonna do the rolling and

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.830 
David he's gonna do the rolling and
we're<00:00:38.399> going<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.550> show<00:00:38.760> how<00:00:38.940> two<00:00:39.000> people<00:00:39.270> can

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
we're going to show how two people can

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.330 
we're going to show how two people can
really<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.430> good<00:00:42.500> technique<00:00:43.500> if<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.160> get

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
really have a good technique if you get

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.420 
really have a good technique if you get
this<00:00:44.579> system<00:00:44.960> so<00:00:45.960> we've<00:00:46.860> gotten<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.309> this

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
this system so we've gotten to this

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.810 
this system so we've gotten to this
point<00:00:47.760> now<00:00:48.090> instead<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.719> me<00:00:48.840> getting<00:00:48.989> down<00:00:49.320> and

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
point now instead of me getting down and

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.100 
point now instead of me getting down and
rediff<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.940> my<00:00:51.059> roller<00:00:51.329> I'm<00:00:51.539> gonna<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.870> Dave

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
rediff in my roller I'm gonna have Dave

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.360 
rediff in my roller I'm gonna have Dave
go<00:00:52.350> ahead<00:00:52.379> since<00:00:52.860> he's<00:00:53.039> gonna<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
go ahead since he's gonna have the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.819 
go ahead since he's gonna have the
9-inch<00:00:53.670> go<00:00:54.510> ahead<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.809> place<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.440> paint<00:00:55.649> for

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
9-inch go ahead and place the paint for

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.069 
9-inch go ahead and place the paint for
me<00:00:55.980> we<00:00:56.100> talked<00:00:56.309> about<00:00:56.719> placing<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> paint

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
me we talked about placing the paint

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.569 
me we talked about placing the paint
spreading<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.649> paint<00:00:58.829> smoothing<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.340> paint

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
spreading the paint smoothing the paint

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.900 
spreading the paint smoothing the paint
so<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.850> can<00:01:00.030> place<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.350> any<00:01:01.350> way<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.770> want<00:01:01.949> we're

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
so we can place it any way we want we're

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.130 
so we can place it any way we want we're
going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.120> do<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:03.629> Dave's<00:01:03.870> going<00:01:04.019> to

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
going to do it here as Dave's going to

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.170 
going to do it here as Dave's going to
go<00:01:04.229> ahead<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.589> get<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.739> nine<00:01:05.640> inch<00:01:05.850> roller

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
go ahead and get that nine inch roller

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.750 
go ahead and get that nine inch roller
give<00:01:06.510> me<00:01:06.659> some<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.049> paint<00:01:07.320> here<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.580> way

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
give me some to paint here and that way

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.130 
give me some to paint here and that way
I<00:01:08.790> don't<00:01:08.939> have<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.330> climb<00:01:09.570> down<00:01:09.600> off<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
I don't have to climb down off the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.700 
I don't have to climb down off the
ladder

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
ladder

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.990 
ladder
we're<00:01:11.460> placing<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> paint<00:01:13.670> now<00:01:14.670> we're<00:01:14.880> going

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
we're placing the paint now we're going

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.490 
we're placing the paint now we're going
to<00:01:15.060> spread<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> paint<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.930> just<00:01:16.110> grabbed<00:01:16.320> this

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
to spread the paint I just grabbed this

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.429 
to spread the paint I just grabbed this
paint<00:01:16.830> run<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.280> up<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.729> tape<00:01:18.409> grab<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
paint run it up to the tape grab a

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.320 
paint run it up to the tape grab a
little<00:01:19.680> more<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.070> pink<00:01:20.310> here<00:01:20.670> run<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.060> down

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
little more of the pink here run it down

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.780 
little more of the pink here run it down
to<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.580> top<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.850> door<00:01:25.430> brushing<00:01:26.430> into<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
to the top of the door brushing into the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.569 
to the top of the door brushing into the
tape<00:01:27.119> brushing<00:01:27.780> into<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.110> tape<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:29.280> then

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
tape brushing into the tape and then

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.569 
tape brushing into the tape and then
we'll<00:01:29.700> do<00:01:29.850> our<00:01:29.880> final<00:01:30.500> spreading<00:01:34.400> like<00:01:35.400> it's

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
we'll do our final spreading like it's

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.700 
we'll do our final spreading like it's
just<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.970> big<00:01:36.270> roller<00:01:36.659> but<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.409> small

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
just like a big roller but it's a small

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.569 
just like a big roller but it's a small
area<00:01:38.810> getting<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.020> texture<00:01:40.619> again<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.310> see

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
area getting that texture again you see

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.370 
area getting that texture again you see
the<00:01:41.729> coverage<00:01:42.090> will<00:01:42.270> get<00:01:42.390> nice<00:01:42.720> coverage<00:01:43.049> all

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the coverage will get nice coverage all

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.620 
the coverage will get nice coverage all
the<00:01:43.409> way<00:01:43.590> up<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> ceiling<00:01:44.360> brush<00:01:45.360> it

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the way up to the ceiling brush it

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.889 
the way up to the ceiling brush it
terrible<00:01:46.530> coverage<00:01:47.420> can't<00:01:48.420> emphasize<00:01:48.869> this

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
terrible coverage can't emphasize this

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.230 
terrible coverage can't emphasize this
enough<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.530> that's<00:01:49.649> why<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:49.979> technique<00:01:50.610> now

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
enough so that's why this technique now

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.210 
enough so that's why this technique now
I<00:01:51.360> finished<00:01:51.659> smoothing<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:53.040> we've<00:01:53.189> got

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
I finished smoothing this and we've got

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.090 
I finished smoothing this and we've got
to<00:01:53.460> quickly<00:01:53.759> move<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.500> larger<00:01:55.829> areas

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
to quickly move on to the larger areas

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.770 
to quickly move on to the larger areas
of<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.280> wall<00:01:58.700> again<00:01:59.700> while<00:01:59.909> Dave<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.390> rolling

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
of the wall again while Dave is rolling

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.480 
of the wall again while Dave is rolling
the<00:02:00.899> larger<00:02:01.290> areas<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.590> walls<00:02:01.829> now<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.100> can

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
the larger areas the walls now I can

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.700 
the larger areas the walls now I can
comfortably<00:02:02.759> focus<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:03.689> these<00:02:03.840> two<00:02:03.899> tools<00:02:04.380> and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
comfortably focus on these two tools and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.219 
comfortably focus on these two tools and
just<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.759> slight<00:02:06.210> cut<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.689> at<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.930> bottom

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
just do the slight cut in at the bottom

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.559 
just do the slight cut in at the bottom
and<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.439> top<00:02:07.649> as<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:08.039> come<00:02:08.250> across<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:09.000> just

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
and the top as we come across I just

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.410 
and the top as we come across I just
need<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.899> make<00:02:10.020> sure<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.229> stay<00:02:10.560> out<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.679> his<00:02:10.860> way

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
need to make sure I stay out of his way

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.740 
need to make sure I stay out of his way
but<00:02:12.420> I'll<00:02:12.540> roll<00:02:12.780> back<00:02:13.020> in<00:02:13.290> I'll<00:02:13.530> get

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
but I'll roll back in I'll get

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.040 
but I'll roll back in I'll get
him<00:02:13.900> some<00:02:14.140> more<00:02:14.350> cut<00:02:14.590> in<00:02:14.800> here<00:02:15.900> brushing<00:02:16.900> into

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
him some more cut in here brushing into

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.650 
him some more cut in here brushing into
the<00:02:17.230> ceiling<00:02:17.740> and<00:02:17.950> again<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.670> final<00:02:18.940> move

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
the ceiling and again the final move

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.230 
the ceiling and again the final move
take<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:20.800> roller<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.550> cover<00:02:21.970> up<00:02:22.210> that

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
take that roller and cover up that

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.900 
take that roller and cover up that
brushed<00:02:22.810> area<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.980> now<00:02:24.130> Dave<00:02:24.400> will<00:02:24.580> come<00:02:24.760> back

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
brushed area and now Dave will come back

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.090 
brushed area and now Dave will come back
and<00:02:25.150> just<00:02:25.300> blend<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.690> large<00:02:25.930> roller<00:02:26.230> won't<00:02:26.950> have

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
and just blend a large roller won't have

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.510 
and just blend a large roller won't have
to<00:02:27.220> get<00:02:27.340> too<00:02:27.580> close<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.210> ceiling

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
to get too close to the ceiling

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.090 
to get too close to the ceiling
and<00:02:30.520> I'm<00:02:30.640> going<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.820> go<00:02:30.970> down<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.420> bottom

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
and I'm going to go down to the bottom

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.040 
and I'm going to go down to the bottom
do<00:02:33.100> some<00:02:33.280> cut<00:02:33.520> in<00:02:33.700> down<00:02:33.880> here<00:02:34.240> try<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.720> stay

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
do some cut in down here try to stay

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.130 
do some cut in down here try to stay
ahead<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.440> him<00:02:35.620> but<00:02:36.580> not<00:02:36.820> going<00:02:37.180> too<00:02:37.450> far<00:02:37.750> that

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
ahead of him but not going too far that

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.620 
ahead of him but not going too far that
this<00:02:38.290> paint<00:02:38.620> begins<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.160> dry<00:02:39.430> so<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.360> can

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
this paint begins to dry so I can

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.449 
this paint begins to dry so I can
obviously<00:02:40.780> go<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.620> little<00:02:41.860> quicker<00:02:42.220> because

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
obviously go a little quicker because

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.390 
obviously go a little quicker because
I'm<00:02:42.730> not<00:02:42.850> doing<00:02:43.120> as<00:02:43.240> much<00:02:43.450> work<00:02:44.130> now<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.160> might

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
I'm not doing as much work now I might

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.370 
I'm not doing as much work now I might
even<00:02:45.550> use<00:02:45.820> this<00:02:45.970> little<00:02:46.450> roller<00:02:46.720> as<00:02:46.959> he<00:02:47.110> gets<00:02:47.290> a

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
even use this little roller as he gets a

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.110 
even use this little roller as he gets a
little<00:02:47.410> closer<00:02:47.860> so<00:02:48.220> he<00:02:48.250> doesn't<00:02:48.760> have<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:49.000> get

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
little closer so he doesn't have to get

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.949 
little closer so he doesn't have to get
so<00:02:49.330> close<00:02:49.570> to<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.840> outlets<00:02:51.540> now<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.570> lot<00:02:52.810> of

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
so close to the outlets now a lot of

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.390 
so close to the outlets now a lot of
people<00:02:53.260> will<00:02:53.410> want<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.650> tape<00:02:53.890> off<00:02:54.130> these

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
people will want to tape off these

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.520 
people will want to tape off these
outlets<00:02:54.820> just<00:02:55.300> in<00:02:55.450> case<00:02:55.630> you<00:02:55.810> happen<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.200> drag

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
outlets just in case you happen to drag

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.350 
outlets just in case you happen to drag
your<00:02:56.709> roller<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.190> drop<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.580> over<00:02:57.640> top<00:02:57.970> of<00:02:58.000> it

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
your roller and drop it over top of it

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.910 
your roller and drop it over top of it
of<00:02:59.080> course<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.440> want<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.650> be<00:02:59.709> very<00:02:59.770> careful

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
of course you want to be very careful

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:15.369 
of course you want to be very careful
around<00:03:02.920> these<00:03:03.390> areas

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.289 

so<00:03:16.379> you<00:03:16.530> can<00:03:16.680> see<00:03:16.920> how<00:03:17.099> this<00:03:17.280> pain<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:17.849> going<00:03:18.030> on

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
so you can see how this pain is going on

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.599 
so you can see how this pain is going on
in<00:03:18.480> one<00:03:18.810> continuous<00:03:19.409> film<00:03:19.920> on<00:03:20.129> the<00:03:20.219> entire

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
in one continuous film on the entire

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.429 
in one continuous film on the entire
wall<00:03:20.999> we<00:03:21.870> haven't<00:03:22.139> pre-cut<00:03:22.709> in<00:03:22.980> we're<00:03:23.430> just

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:24.439 
wall we haven't pre-cut in we're just

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.690 
wall we haven't pre-cut in we're just
wet<00:03:25.439> into<00:03:25.739> wet<00:03:25.889> as<00:03:26.069> we<00:03:26.219> go

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
wet into wet as we go

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.280 
wet into wet as we go
and<00:03:27.980> this<00:03:28.980> really<00:03:29.519> does<00:03:29.790> solve<00:03:30.629> that<00:03:30.810> common

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
and this really does solve that common

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.699 
and this really does solve that common
problem<00:03:31.859> of<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.790> Hat<00:03:33.030> band<00:03:33.329> where<00:03:33.719> people

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
problem of the Hat band where people

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.479 
problem of the Hat band where people
brush<00:03:35.040> in<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:36.090> brush<00:03:36.599> down<00:03:36.870> real<00:03:37.079> low<00:03:37.489> then

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
brush in and brush down real low then

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.520 
brush in and brush down real low then
when<00:03:38.639> the<00:03:39.239> roller<00:03:39.480> comes<00:03:39.870> over<00:03:40.170> we've<00:03:40.319> got<00:03:40.500> a

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
when the roller comes over we've got a

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.949 
when the roller comes over we've got a
double<00:03:40.919> coat<00:03:41.129> right<00:03:41.340> here<00:03:41.569> so<00:03:42.569> we're<00:03:42.870> gonna

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
double coat right here so we're gonna

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.770 
double coat right here so we're gonna
have<00:03:43.109> one<00:03:43.319> single<00:03:43.709> coat<00:03:43.980> very<00:03:44.480> uniformly<00:03:45.480> put

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
have one single coat very uniformly put

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.330 
have one single coat very uniformly put
on<00:03:45.930> with<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.319> large<00:03:46.530> roller<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.040> small

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
on with the large roller and the small

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.530 
on with the large roller and the small
roller<00:03:47.750> will<00:03:48.750> progress<00:03:48.959> onto<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.680> corner

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
roller will progress onto the corner

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.439 
roller will progress onto the corner
move<00:03:51.540> on<00:03:51.659> to<00:03:51.840> our<00:03:51.870> next<00:03:51.930> wall<00:03:56.060> okay<00:03:57.060> now<00:03:57.209> here's

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
move on to our next wall okay now here's

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:58.939 
move on to our next wall okay now here's
an<00:03:57.629> area<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:58.049> we<00:03:58.169> always<00:03:58.319> have<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.680> have<00:03:58.769> some

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949 
an area that we always have to have some

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:00.890 
an area that we always have to have some
concern<00:03:59.340> with<00:03:59.400> either<00:03:59.849> we<00:04:00.000> need<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.329> cut<00:04:00.599> into

the<00:04:25.949> way<00:04:26.070> into<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.460> corner<00:04:26.729> and<00:04:27.110> I<00:04:28.110> need<00:04:28.320> to

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
the way into the corner and I need to

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.110 
the way into the corner and I need to
move<00:04:28.530> out<00:04:28.710> of<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:28.860> way<00:04:28.889> so<00:04:29.070> Dave<00:04:29.520> can<00:04:29.550> get<00:04:29.940> to

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
move out of the way so Dave can get to

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:41.180 
move out of the way so Dave can get to
the<00:04:30.270> main<00:04:30.780> part<00:04:31.110> of<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.259> wall

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.970 

and<00:04:42.190> like<00:04:42.400> I<00:04:42.430> say<00:04:42.790> this<00:04:43.030> is<00:04:43.090> definitely<00:04:43.980> much

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
and like I say this is definitely much

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.060 
and like I say this is definitely much
quicker<00:04:45.340> much<00:04:46.120> more<00:04:46.390> efficient<00:04:47.020> and<00:04:47.200> a<00:04:47.920> much

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
quicker much more efficient and a much

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.310 
quicker much more efficient and a much
better<00:04:48.280> quality<00:04:48.820> job<00:04:49.390> when<00:04:49.630> we<00:04:49.750> can<00:04:49.900> keep<00:04:50.110> this

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
better quality job when we can keep this

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.980 
better quality job when we can keep this
paint<00:04:50.650> wet<00:04:50.890> and<00:04:51.880> again<00:04:52.180> many<00:04:52.450> times<00:04:52.750> this

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
paint wet and again many times this

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.840 
paint wet and again many times this
would<00:04:53.140> be<00:04:53.260> two<00:04:53.560> people<00:04:54.180> for<00:04:55.180> most<00:04:55.510> jobs
