00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.880 
the jetpack like I am doing it right
here<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.960> really<00:02:04.140> nice<00:02:04.409> thing<00:02:04.710> if

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
here but it's a really nice thing if

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.670 
here but it's a really nice thing if
you're<00:02:05.159> for<00:02:05.520> example<00:02:06.030> down<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.869> cave<00:02:07.170> or<00:02:07.469> if

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
you're for example down in a cave or if

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.619 
you're for example down in a cave or if
you're<00:02:07.860> exploring<00:02:08.310> something<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:09.209> stop<00:02:09.450> your

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
you're exploring something to stop your

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.170 
you're exploring something to stop your
fall<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.530> can<00:02:10.560> simply<00:02:11.039> do<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.610> with<00:02:11.970> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
fall you can simply do that with the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.670 
fall you can simply do that with the
tech

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
tech

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.699 
tech
but<00:02:13.549> also<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:14.209> good<00:02:14.450> thing<00:02:14.689> is<00:02:14.959> if<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.680> don't

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
but also a good thing is if you don't

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.300 
but also a good thing is if you don't
want<00:02:16.099> to<00:02:16.189> use<00:02:16.400> your<00:02:16.609> JPEG<00:02:16.969> fuel<00:02:17.629> for<00:02:18.290> that<00:02:18.590> for

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
want to use your JPEG fuel for that for

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.280 
want to use your JPEG fuel for that for
example<00:02:19.790> if<00:02:19.939> you're<00:02:20.239> falling<00:02:20.689> down<00:02:20.870> here<00:02:21.140> now

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
example if you're falling down here now

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.059 
example if you're falling down here now
you<00:02:22.159> can<00:02:22.370> use<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.849> parachute<00:02:23.480> which<00:02:23.810> yeah<00:02:24.769> you

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
you can use the parachute which yeah you

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.250 
you can use the parachute which yeah you
just<00:02:25.280> gotta<00:02:25.549> have<00:02:25.849> it<00:02:26.000> selected<00:02:26.209> in<00:02:26.719> the<00:02:26.930> menu

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
just gotta have it selected in the menu

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.069 
just gotta have it selected in the menu
down<00:02:27.980> there<00:02:28.219> in<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.489> club<00:02:28.849> bar<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.329> then

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
down there in the club bar and then

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.250 
down there in the club bar and then
right<00:02:30.439> click<00:02:30.769> and<00:02:30.950> hold<00:02:31.879> the<00:02:32.060> right<00:02:32.389> click<00:02:32.659> so

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
the parachute is activated and now if

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.809 
the parachute is activated and now if
you're<00:02:36.319> colliding<00:02:36.829> down<00:02:37.010> like<00:02:37.250> this<00:02:37.430> you

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
you're colliding down like this you

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.780 
you're colliding down like this you
won't<00:02:38.030> get<00:02:38.269> hurt<00:02:38.469> but<00:02:39.469> yeah<00:02:39.650> let's<00:02:39.859> just<00:02:40.340> lie

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
won't get hurt but yeah let's just lie

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.149 
won't get hurt but yeah let's just lie
bit<00:02:41.060> more<00:02:41.299> just<00:02:41.659> to<00:02:41.840> show<00:02:42.109> how<00:02:42.379> long<00:02:42.950> this

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
bit more just to show how long this

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.050 
bit more just to show how long this
holds<00:02:43.519> and<00:02:43.720> then<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:44.900> guys<00:02:45.079> see<00:02:45.859> now<00:02:46.159> the<00:02:46.220> fuel

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
holds and then you guys see now the fuel

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.440 
holds and then you guys see now the fuel
is<00:02:47.180> below<00:02:47.510> 25<00:02:48.169> percent<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:48.980> if<00:02:49.849> it<00:02:49.970> gets<00:02:50.180> way

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
is below 25 percent and if it gets way

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.780 
is below 25 percent and if it gets way
too<00:02:50.480> low<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:51.019> will<00:02:51.049> do<00:02:51.650> an<00:02:51.769> emergency<00:02:52.239> descent

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
too low it will do an emergency descent

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.209 
too low it will do an emergency descent
so<00:02:55.790> you're<00:02:56.180> not<00:02:56.480> in<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.870> danger<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.290> dying<00:02:57.919> by

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
home it should be working like that I

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.619 
home it should be working like that I
have<00:03:53.510> no<00:03:53.810> idea<00:03:53.959> why<00:03:54.970> it's<00:03:55.970> not<00:03:56.209> working<00:03:56.269> right

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
have no idea why it's not working right

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.839 
have no idea why it's not working right
now<00:03:56.810> that<00:03:57.230> might<00:03:57.470> be<00:03:57.680> because<00:03:57.799> I<00:03:58.160> checked<00:03:58.670> out

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
now that might be because I checked out

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.330 
now that might be because I checked out
quite<00:03:59.510> a<00:03:59.540> bunch<00:04:00.200> of<00:04:00.410> mods<00:04:00.709> on<00:04:00.920> this<00:04:01.099> world

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
quite a bunch of mods on this world

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.720 
quite a bunch of mods on this world
already<00:04:01.670> so<00:04:02.209> that<00:04:02.720> might<00:04:02.959> be<00:04:02.989> why<00:04:03.500> but<00:04:04.280> usually

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
already so that might be why but usually

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.330 
already so that might be why but usually
this<00:04:05.030> will<00:04:05.209> teleport<00:04:05.599> you<00:04:05.840> back<00:04:06.170> home<00:04:06.379> and<00:04:06.620> the

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
this will teleport you back home and the

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.390 
this will teleport you back home and the
other<00:04:07.549> switch<00:04:08.000> with<00:04:08.690> will<00:04:09.170> return<00:04:10.069> you<00:04:10.250> back

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
other switch with will return you back

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.130 
other switch with will return you back
to<00:04:10.640> the<00:04:10.670> last<00:04:10.970> place<00:04:11.299> that<00:04:11.329> you<00:04:11.660> use<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.110> other

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
to the last place that you use the other

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.400 
to the last place that you use the other
switch<00:04:12.650> so<00:04:13.430> if<00:04:13.940> you're<00:04:14.239> for<00:04:14.720> example<00:04:15.200> in<00:04:15.319> the

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
switch so if you're for example in the

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.949 
switch so if you're for example in the
cave<00:04:15.620> you<00:04:16.190> can<00:04:16.370> just<00:04:16.669> use<00:04:17.000> this<00:04:17.299> switch<00:04:17.630> the

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
cave you can just use this switch the
