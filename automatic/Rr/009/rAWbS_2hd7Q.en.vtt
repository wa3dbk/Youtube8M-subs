00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.430
 ah 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.070
 to the light like this 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.710
 today I bring you a tutorial plus a 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.130
 I will teach you hairstyle in this video 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.770
 how to make these three quotes that are very 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.099
 easy and very simple to do 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.099
 with me 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.960
 let's take a lock of hair 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.660
 and let's make 3 partitions 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.360
 and let's start 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.360
 to weave a three-strand braid 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.060
 the trick of this braid is at the end 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.160
 so do not despair and if well 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.700
 before reaching the end of the braid 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.020
 I took one of the extremes 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.960
 what does it do? 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:45.470
 and the result should stay if I take 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.870
 a little girl and tie the lock of hair 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.600
 do not worry , the first time you do not 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.280
 is still trying 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.280
 sure it's going to turn out 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.540
 let's do the same thing on the other side 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:48.270
 let's do it again take another section of 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.940
 your hair and divide it into 3 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.320
 make a three - strand braid as 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.320
 you usually do it 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.820
 and before reaching the end 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:11.610
 take one end of the braid 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:14.180
 and raise the braid you will see that the braid is 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.180
 delicious 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:24.800
 it only remains to tie it with a rubber band 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.380
 and you can accommodate the result 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.400
 You will see like this but remember that if you do not 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.680
 the first one is still trying 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.040
 because sometimes the first one does not 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.040
 remains 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:18.540
 Finally, take again 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.870
 another lock of hair 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.960
 partition to it in three and re-weave 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.250
 one in three-strand braid like 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.250
 you usually do it 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:35.180
 notice that before reaching the end 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:39.120
 you must grab one end of 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.590
 the braid and with your other two fingers 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.200
 the tissue goes up 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:48.100
 the braid is going to risk and goes to 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.710
 to be a kind of little vibrator 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.950
 it means that in the braid is fine 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.640
 made now just tie the hair and 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.640
 accommodates 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.800
 my braids were like that 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:39.830
 As you can see the braids do not have a 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:43.400
 finished perfect because that's how it is 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.550
 type of braids and my hairstyle is not 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.940
 perfect because I like it as well as 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.270
 It looks and finally I put a 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.270
 bow tie 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:00.569
 so that it looks flirtatious but you 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:04.169
 you can put what you want 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:05.990
 I hope you liked this braid and 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.330
 the hairstyle 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.130
 and I hope that you practice it in your house 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.860
 it really is that it is very easy and very 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.729
 simple once you have practiced it and 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.310
 what do you get 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:21.380
 practice had it 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.380
 and you tell me how it went
