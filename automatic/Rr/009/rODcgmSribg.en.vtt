00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:15.040
 sabrina love 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:19.410
 from there were no plains on the evil of yours 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.410
 natural instinct that you play at the casino 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.580
 in the evening I hear it and it's the right time 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.030
 we are in mugello to try the new one 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.250
 renault clio 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.830
 a reading that breaks with tradition 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.750
 and presents itself with a very line 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:43.840
 modern very youthful face almost osei 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:48.000
 we would say the reading is completely 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.430
 ignored and also presents aspects 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.190
 Advanced multimedia like today is used 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:59.650
 also on segment b or di cars 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:06.310
 utilitarian and initially mounts engines 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:09.509
 of 900 cc with 3 cylinders and 1500 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.440
 turbodiesel both from 90 horses 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.440
 let's see how cats 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.219
 thank you are from torino the region 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:52.010
 also not certain roar this engine three 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:54.050
 cylinders certainly has a certain panache and 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.990
 to be a nine hundred cm 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.950
 cubic its 90 horses make it a lot 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.890
 well 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.600
 it's not that it's a sport but up 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.500
 paths that you can also like 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.760
 entertain an excellent steering act 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.280
 really lets you make the curves in 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.180
 absolute safety and follow also 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.040
 very well to the trajectories comfort and 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.230
 noticeable only some of the risk of 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.400
 dynamic on the highway the only thing that 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.740
 obviously we didn't like the 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.310
 satellite that does not provide information 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:28.040
 timely and sometimes it even happened 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.120
 to be in an absolute turn 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.670
 around the same center without a street 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.680
 of exit at that point it comes to change 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.680
 sarah just recovers 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.920
 also this diesel 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.440
 that's fine, we tried both 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.380
 it is a really comfortable act but in 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.270
 this segment b is not known if it has 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.870
 reason for existing the bio segment on 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.270
 segment ced because these cars never 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.650
 they can satisfy everyone's needs 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.210
 cesco are here with Francis Fountain 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.680
 right external relations manager 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.930
 Italian level 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.290
 absolutely practically a car 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.980
 of segment c being 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.600
 characterized with a car of the 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.390
 segment b because we have slightly 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.880
 stretched and we realized that in 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.040
 a period of crisis like ours la 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.959
 people instead of rising from segment b to 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.100
 segment ca hold this forever 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:29.280
 site of this car is a car that 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:33.120
 offers so many emotions a brand design 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.700
 totally renewed sensual and e 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.440
 also very Latin for its curves 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.280
 we have a lot of innovation 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.220
 inside the cars 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.680
 the link system that is set up 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.840
 connection with the car but also with 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.430
 the outside world looks like a tablet that 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.620
 is inserted in the dashboard and that you 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.990
 allows interfacing second 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.560
 car than with the outside world 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.270
 hear francesco 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.599
 in the end what interests the 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.120
 public are always the prices are a lot 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.910
 interesting because it starts from 13 thousand 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.489
 and 5 with the version what is already super 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.380
 equipped the interesting point that 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.450
 has equipment compared to us 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.370
 we cost as much as kyo 3 in that 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.780
 previous version we don't have 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.880
 we have increased the prices we are at the same 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.590
 level of the previous version though 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.590
 having taken a big leap they say 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.400
 so we said no brand design 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.410
 we said a lot of innovation 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.910
 accessible to all 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.500
 and finally the third point is the 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.040
 personalization here we are in one 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.710
 totally customized car 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.850
 in fact, who with dare I can 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.080
 create your own tailored suit and 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.540
 going even more or less public 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.680
 see here we have the red bridge 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:56.690
 we have many chrome details on the 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.880
 steering wheel on the air vents and on the 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.710
 shift knob 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.870
 so this inside the outside 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.330
 there are also many possibilities 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.830
 customization on the bodywork and the 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:12.740
 car becomes even more mi anyway 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.740
 which I have puts everything and I great 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:24.550
 when I say I love you 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.969
 here I love you 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.659
 but it is the pure sacrosanct 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:30.659
 he deserved 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.740
 no no
