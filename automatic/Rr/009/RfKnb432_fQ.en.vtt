00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.099 

whenever<00:00:03.100> you<00:00:03.370> want<00:00:03.610> to<00:00:03.730> refine<00:00:04.509> your

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:05.109 
whenever you want to refine your

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.730 
whenever you want to refine your
animation<00:00:05.769> to<00:00:06.279> make<00:00:06.460> things<00:00:06.779> start<00:00:07.779> fast<00:00:08.320> or

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:08.740 
animation to make things start fast or

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.310 
animation to make things start fast or
end<00:00:09.070> slowly<00:00:09.639> to<00:00:10.179> change<00:00:10.570> whether<00:00:10.900> you<00:00:11.049> have

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:11.320 
end slowly to change whether you have

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.259 
end slowly to change whether you have
hold<00:00:11.740> frames<00:00:12.190> you<00:00:12.549> can<00:00:12.579> just<00:00:12.879> study<00:00:13.059> the

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:13.269 
hold frames you can just study the

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.119 
hold frames you can just study the
position<00:00:13.780> of<00:00:13.900> things<00:00:14.110> without<00:00:14.320> interpolation

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129 
position of things without interpolation

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:16.830 
position of things without interpolation
then<00:00:15.820> you<00:00:15.969> want<00:00:16.090> to<00:00:16.209> use<00:00:16.420> something<00:00:16.450> called

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
then you want to use something called

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.310 
then you want to use something called
the<00:00:17.260> graph<00:00:17.619> editor<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:19.180> use<00:00:19.630> this<00:00:19.810> tool<00:00:20.020> let's

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
the graph editor to use this tool let's

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.870 
the graph editor to use this tool let's
go<00:00:20.470> ahead<00:00:20.560> and<00:00:20.680> create<00:00:20.890> something<00:00:21.040> very<00:00:21.610> very

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
go ahead and create something very very

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.320 
go ahead and create something very very
basic<00:00:22.360> a<00:00:22.510> simple<00:00:23.230> solid<00:00:23.470> that<00:00:23.830> will<00:00:23.950> animate

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
basic a simple solid that will animate

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.510 
basic a simple solid that will animate
so<00:00:25.330> let's<00:00:25.450> go<00:00:25.540> to<00:00:25.600> our<00:00:25.750> layer<00:00:26.230> menu<00:00:26.440> choose<00:00:27.250> new

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
so let's go to our layer menu choose new

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.390 
so let's go to our layer menu choose new
and<00:00:27.850> create<00:00:28.600> a<00:00:28.660> brand<00:00:28.870> new<00:00:28.960> solid<00:00:29.250> I'm<00:00:30.250> going

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
and create a brand new solid I'm going

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.740 
and create a brand new solid I'm going
to<00:00:30.490> be<00:00:30.550> mine<00:00:30.700> pretty<00:00:31.060> bright<00:00:31.330> color<00:00:31.570> like<00:00:31.720> this

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
to be mine pretty bright color like this

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.420

about<00:01:06.580> here<00:01:07.080> when<00:01:08.080> we<00:01:08.200> scrub<00:01:08.530> our<00:01:08.710> current

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
about here when we scrub our current

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.649 
about here when we scrub our current
time<00:01:09.220> indicator<00:01:09.370> we<00:01:09.850> should<00:01:10.060> have<00:01:10.270> a<00:01:10.420> basic

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
time indicator we should have a basic

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.880 
time indicator we should have a basic
animation<00:01:11.110> and<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:13.390> do<00:01:13.540> so<00:01:14.290> let's<00:01:14.470> say<00:01:14.590> we<00:01:14.710> want

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
animation and we do so let's say we want

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.170 
animation and we do so let's say we want
to<00:01:15.150> animate<00:01:16.150> this<00:01:17.040> inside<00:01:18.040> the<00:01:18.820> graph<00:01:19.000> editor

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
to animate this inside the graph editor

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.530 
to animate this inside the graph editor
or<00:01:19.840> just<00:01:20.530> simply<00:01:20.740> modify<00:01:21.369> it<00:01:21.430> click<00:01:22.360> on<00:01:22.450> this

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540

icon right here to open up the graph
editor<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.990> I'm<00:01:26.590> going<00:01:26.710> to<00:01:26.770> go<00:01:26.830> ahead<00:01:26.860> and

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
editor and I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.190 
editor and I'm going to go ahead and
move<00:01:27.190> this<00:01:27.340> up<00:01:27.400> so<00:01:28.390> we<00:01:28.479> can<00:01:28.570> focus<00:01:28.720> on<00:01:28.990> what<00:01:29.110> we

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
move this up so we can focus on what we

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.679 
move this up so we can focus on what we
have<00:01:29.380> here<00:01:29.710> now<00:01:30.280> it<00:01:30.400> looks<00:01:30.460> a<00:01:30.580> little<00:01:30.670> scary<00:01:30.939> we

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
have here now it looks a little scary we

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.289 
have here now it looks a little scary we
have<00:01:31.900> simply<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.799> value<00:01:33.430> of<00:01:33.640> whatever<00:01:34.119> we're

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
have simply the value of whatever we're

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.690 
have simply the value of whatever we're
changing<00:01:34.659> in<00:01:34.780> this<00:01:35.650> case<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:36.070> position<00:01:36.490> and

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
changing in this case the position and

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.230 
changing in this case the position and
we<00:01:37.420> have<00:01:37.659> these<00:01:38.140> two<00:01:38.500> lines<00:01:39.310> here<00:01:39.640> now<00:01:40.119> if<00:01:40.180> you

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
we have these two lines here now if you

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.609 
we have these two lines here now if you
don't<00:01:40.420> see<00:01:40.600> these<00:01:40.780> that's<00:01:41.080> because<00:01:41.380> you<00:01:41.470> might

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
don't see these that's because you might

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.469 
don't see these that's because you might
have<00:01:41.799> some<00:01:41.950> of<00:01:42.040> the<00:01:42.100> settings<00:01:42.580> I<00:01:42.790> have<00:01:43.090> not

have some of the settings I have not

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.929 
have some of the settings I have not
selected<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:44.439> for<00:01:44.590> example<00:01:44.619> you<00:01:45.070> can<00:01:45.520> go<00:01:45.640> here

selected so for example you can go here
and<00:01:46.060> you<00:01:46.420> can<00:01:46.540> choose<00:01:46.930> to<00:01:47.500> edit<00:01:47.650> the<00:01:47.890> value

to separate the dimensions

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.280 
to separate the dimensions
of<00:02:15.470> your<00:02:15.950> graph<00:02:16.490> so<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:17.480> can<00:02:17.600> look<00:02:17.870> over<00:02:17.990> here

of your graph so you can look over here
and<00:02:18.380> you'll<00:02:18.500> see<00:02:18.590> that<00:02:18.710> change<00:02:19.010> so<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:19.250> click

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
and you'll see that change so I click

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.520 
and you'll see that change so I click
here<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:19.790> I<00:02:20.540> can<00:02:20.780> see<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:21.200> separate

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
here and I can see the separate

here and I can see the separate
positions<00:02:21.680> here<00:02:22.130> click<00:02:22.700> here<00:02:22.880> again<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.300> now

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
positions here click here again and now

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.320 
positions here click here again and now
everything<00:02:24.200> is<00:02:24.350> on<00:02:24.590> one<00:02:24.950> line<00:02:25.190> so<00:02:26.030> this<00:02:26.180> is<00:02:26.270> a

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
everything is on one line so this is a

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.150 
everything is on one line so this is a
easier<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.960> figure<00:02:27.170> out<00:02:27.350> exactly<00:02:27.920> what's

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
easier to figure out exactly what's

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.310 
easier to figure out exactly what's
going<00:02:28.280> on<00:02:28.460> I<00:02:28.700> can<00:02:29.030> see<00:02:29.150> that<00:02:29.180> X<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.110> red

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
going on I can see that X is the red

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.570 
going on I can see that X is the red
line<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.820> why<00:02:31.820> is<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.570> green<00:02:32.780> line<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:34.340> what<00:02:34.550> I

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
line and why is the green line so what I

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.610 
line and why is the green line so what I
could<00:02:34.760> do<00:02:34.880> with<00:02:35.120> these<00:02:35.510> guys<00:02:35.720> is<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:36.140> can<00:02:36.320> grab

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
could do with these guys is I can grab

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.490 
could do with these guys is I can grab
let's<00:02:37.010> say<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.940> red<00:02:38.330> line<00:02:38.540> here<00:02:38.750> which<00:02:39.230> don't

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
let's say the red line here which don't

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.190 
let's say the red line here which don't
forget<00:02:39.740> represents<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.460> ground<00:02:41.150> plane<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.810> I

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
forget represents the ground plane and I

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.260 
forget represents the ground plane and I
can<00:02:42.410> move<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:43.900> I'm<00:02:44.900> changing<00:02:45.260> its<00:02:45.410> value

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
can move it and I'm changing its value

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.390 
can move it and I'm changing its value
so<00:02:47.270> on<00:02:47.600> frame<00:02:47.900> 0<00:02:48.230> instead<00:02:48.710> of<00:02:48.890> it<00:02:48.980> being<00:02:49.010> all

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
so on frame 0 instead of it being all

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.870 
so on frame 0 instead of it being all
the<00:02:49.550> way<00:02:49.640> at<00:02:49.880> 0<00:02:50.510> which<00:02:51.080> is<00:02:51.200> up<00:02:51.380> here<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.920> can<00:02:52.400> take

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
the way at 0 which is up here I can take

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.080 
the way at 0 which is up here I can take
the<00:02:53.180> red<00:02:53.570> and<00:02:54.050> move<00:02:54.320> it<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.620> I'm<00:02:55.490> manually

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
the red and move it and I'm manually

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.030 
the red and move it and I'm manually
changing<00:02:56.630> animation<00:02:57.200> right<00:02:57.440> here<00:02:57.680> by<00:02:57.830> using

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
changing animation right here by using

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.940 
changing animation right here by using
the<00:02:58.340> graph<00:02:58.520> editor<00:02:59.320> likewise<00:03:00.320> I<00:03:00.590> can<00:03:00.740> change

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
the graph editor likewise I can change

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.610 
the graph editor likewise I can change
its<00:03:01.130> y<00:03:01.520> value<00:03:02.090> which<00:03:02.360> is<00:03:02.480> up<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:02.900> down<00:03:03.110> the

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
its y value which is up and down the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.460 
its y value which is up and down the
same<00:03:03.830> way<00:03:04.040> I'll<00:03:04.670> grab<00:03:05.180> this<00:03:05.360> frame<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:06.260> I'll

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
same way I'll grab this frame and I'll

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.090 
same way I'll grab this frame and I'll
move<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.460> value<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.030> I'm<00:03:08.810> putting<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.440> cube

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
move the value and I'm putting the cube

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.960 
move the value and I'm putting the cube
somewhere<00:03:10.580> else<00:03:10.730> i<00:03:11.590> can<00:03:12.590> grab<00:03:13.160> multiple

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
somewhere else i can grab multiple

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.970 
somewhere else i can grab multiple
frames<00:03:14.150> by<00:03:14.420> simply<00:03:14.720> drag<00:03:15.080> selecting<00:03:15.530> like<00:03:15.680> so

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
frames by simply drag selecting like so

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.670 
frames by simply drag selecting like so
and<00:03:16.280> i<00:03:17.030> can<00:03:17.180> change<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.750> way<00:03:18.200> the

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
and i can change the way the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.860 
and i can change the way the
interpolation<00:03:19.250> happens<00:03:19.910> with<00:03:20.540> these<00:03:20.690> guys

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
interpolation happens with these guys

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.540 
interpolation happens with these guys
over<00:03:21.110> here<00:03:21.410> so<00:03:21.740> let<00:03:21.830> me<00:03:21.890> go<00:03:22.010> ahead<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.250> show

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
over here so let me go ahead and show

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.760 
over here so let me go ahead and show
you<00:03:22.880> we<00:03:23.180> have<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.840> ability<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.290> edit<00:03:24.530> the

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
you we have the ability to edit the

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.770 
you we have the ability to edit the
selected<00:03:24.860> keyframes<00:03:25.300> we<00:03:26.300> can<00:03:26.480> turn<00:03:26.660> on

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
selected keyframes we can turn on

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.020 
selected keyframes we can turn on
something<00:03:27.020> called<00:03:27.200> a<00:03:27.350> hold<00:03:27.770> frame<00:03:28.490> which<00:03:28.850> will

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
something called a hold frame which will

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.810 
something called a hold frame which will
pretty<00:03:29.210> much<00:03:29.300> give<00:03:29.450> us<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:30.430> very<00:03:31.430> linear

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
pretty much give us a very linear

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.840 
pretty much give us a very linear
animation<00:03:32.690> which<00:03:33.260> means<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:34.130> cube<00:03:34.460> isn't

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
animation which means the cube isn't

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.910 
animation which means the cube isn't
going<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.120> actually<00:03:35.630> move<00:03:35.990> it's<00:03:36.410> simply<00:03:36.800> going

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
going to actually move it's simply going

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.490 
going to actually move it's simply going
to<00:03:37.070> appear<00:03:37.700> where<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.360> is<00:03:38.570> indicated<00:03:39.290> in<00:03:39.350> the

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
to appear where it is indicated in the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.140 
to appear where it is indicated in the
graph<00:03:39.740> I'll<00:03:40.220> go<00:03:40.400> ahead<00:03:40.490> and<00:03:40.580> demonstrate<00:03:40.760> this

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
graph I'll go ahead and demonstrate this

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.090 
graph I'll go ahead and demonstrate this
notice<00:03:44.150> that<00:03:44.300> it<00:03:44.900> doesn't<00:03:45.200> move<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.980> that

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
notice that it doesn't move to that

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.480 
notice that it doesn't move to that
location<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.610> just<00:03:46.790> winds<00:03:47.090> up<00:03:47.270> there<00:03:48.310> so<00:03:49.310> if<00:03:49.430> i

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
location it just winds up there so if i

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.160 
location it just winds up there so if i
want<00:03:49.670> to<00:03:49.730> have<00:03:49.850> animation<00:03:50.480> i<00:03:50.600> have<00:03:50.720> to<00:03:50.840> turn<00:03:51.050> it

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
want to have animation i have to turn it

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.120 
want to have animation i have to turn it
back<00:03:51.320> on<00:03:51.500> for<00:03:51.709> something<00:03:52.040> like<00:03:52.130> linear<00:03:54.070> or<00:03:55.070> a

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
back on for something like linear or a

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.300 
back on for something like linear or a
busy<00:03:55.940> eh<00:03:55.970> so<00:03:56.810> this<00:03:56.959> is<00:03:56.990> Otto<00:03:57.200> busy<00:03:57.560> eh<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:57.860> now

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
busy eh so this is Otto busy eh and now

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.940 
busy eh so this is Otto busy eh and now
we<00:03:58.370> have<00:03:58.490> handles<00:03:59.060> that<00:03:59.270> allow<00:03:59.540> us<00:03:59.570> to<00:03:59.950> create

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
we have handles that allow us to create

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.890 
we have handles that allow us to create
smoother<00:04:01.520> animation<00:04:01.670> if<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:02.150> need<00:04:02.270> to<00:04:02.390> so<00:04:02.870> I

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
smoother animation if you need to so I

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.240 
smoother animation if you need to so I
can<00:04:03.020> go<00:04:03.110> ahead<00:04:03.170> and<00:04:03.290> grab<00:04:03.530> these<00:04:03.770> and<00:04:03.830> change

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
can go ahead and grab these and change

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.060 
can go ahead and grab these and change
the<00:04:04.400> curve<00:04:05.290> we<00:04:06.290> even<00:04:06.440> have<00:04:06.680> something<00:04:06.950> called

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
the curve we even have something called

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.520 
the curve we even have something called
easing<00:04:07.700> so<00:04:08.060> easing<00:04:08.780> allows<00:04:09.080> you<00:04:09.260> to<00:04:09.350> have

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
easing so easing allows you to have

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.530 
easing so easing allows you to have
things<00:04:09.800> start<00:04:10.760> fast<00:04:11.480> or<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.500> slowly<00:04:13.430> or<00:04:13.760> have

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
things start fast or and slowly or have

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.270 
things start fast or and slowly or have
a<00:04:14.570> nice<00:04:14.840> motion<00:04:15.230> in<00:04:15.350> between<00:04:15.709> and<00:04:15.980> that's<00:04:16.160> what

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
a nice motion in between and that's what

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.410 
a nice motion in between and that's what
these<00:04:16.370> icons<00:04:16.760> allow<00:04:16.970> you<00:04:17.030> to<00:04:17.120> do<00:04:17.209> over<00:04:17.390> here

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
these icons allow you to do over here

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.860 
these icons allow you to do over here
these<00:04:18.290> are<00:04:18.410> your<00:04:18.500> easing<00:04:19.160> options<00:04:20.030> so<00:04:20.750> you<00:04:20.780> can

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
these are your easing options so you can

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.380 
these are your easing options so you can
grab<00:04:21.290> for<00:04:21.590> example<00:04:21.950> the<00:04:22.400> last<00:04:22.760> two<00:04:23.180> keyframes

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
grab for example the last two keyframes

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.050 
grab for example the last two keyframes
and<00:04:23.870> you<00:04:24.680> can<00:04:24.800> choose<00:04:25.040> one<00:04:25.850> of<00:04:25.880> these<00:04:26.000> options

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
and you can choose one of these options

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.900 
and you can choose one of these options
and<00:04:26.600> you<00:04:26.720> see<00:04:26.930> that<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.200> the<00:04:28.010> graph

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
and you see that the the graph

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.860 
and you see that the the graph
changes<00:04:30.910> all<00:04:31.910> right<00:04:32.060> so<00:04:32.150> we<00:04:32.240> can<00:04:32.360> have<00:04:32.510> easing

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
changes all right so we can have easing

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.600 
changes all right so we can have easing
in<00:04:33.050> easing<00:04:33.500> out<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:33.920> it<00:04:34.100> will<00:04:34.220> change<00:04:34.460> the

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
in easing out and it will change the

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.950 
in easing out and it will change the
smoothness<00:04:34.970> of<00:04:35.210> the<00:04:35.270> animation<00:04:37.810> once<00:04:38.810> you're

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
smoothness of the animation once you're

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.960 
smoothness of the animation once you're
done<00:04:39.170> with<00:04:39.230> the<00:04:39.470> graph<00:04:39.650> editor<00:04:39.880> simply<00:04:40.880> click

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
done with the graph editor simply click

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.000 
done with the graph editor simply click
this<00:04:41.150> icon<00:04:41.360> again<00:04:41.660> and<00:04:41.960> you'll<00:04:42.500> be<00:04:42.560> back<00:04:42.770> and

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
this icon again and you'll be back and

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.790 
this icon again and you'll be back and
your<00:04:43.310> timeline
