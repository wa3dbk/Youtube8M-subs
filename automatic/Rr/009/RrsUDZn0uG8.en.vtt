00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.350
 comes in a thin cardboard box 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.120
 the design of which immediately allows 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.399
 understand that we are not an ordinary laptop 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.780
 and the device is a transformer kit 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.000
 deliveries included accompanying 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.309
 documentation of the power supply to 18 watts and a

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.879
 designed to compensate for the lack

 tablet part block design 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.159
 power supply makes it easy to replace the plug 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.350
 at the right moment it is for sure 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.350
 Frequent users will appreciate 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.189
 tablet body consists of four 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.140
 different details with color and texture 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.850
 materials are chosen in such a way that 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.159
 not even the most demanding owner 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.840
 will feel no aesthetic 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.899
 dissonance note that the mass of the tablet 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.789
 makes 500 85 grams thickness is only 8 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.190
 and 9 millimeters with the weight of the full 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.149
 tablet docking kit is equal to only 117

 1366 resolution at 768 pixels 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.210
 screen brightness is adjustable from 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.860
 20 to 350 candles per square meter at 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.390
 this is also available automatic

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.229
 5 simultaneous touches in addition 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.450
 between them and the matrix there is no air 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.069
 interlayers to avoid glare 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.720
 revealing that the developers 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.009
 used not nameless material 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.649

 scratch gorilla glass 3 glass 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.830
 the panel covers not only the matrix and 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.290
 the area around it is about the width 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.940
 one and a half centimeters on top of this 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.950
 edging you can find a webcam 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.079
 and on the lower windows touch button 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.700
 The next part of the case of silver 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.890
 the plastic contains a pair of frontal 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.019
 speakers using a small chamfer she 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.489
 moves to the sides of the case improving

 top of the tablet completely 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.799
 loose on the bottom will take out the 9 pin 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.579
 branded connector for communication with 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.769

 fixing despite the small area 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.720
 this fine line 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.060
 here also fit all the necessary 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.010

 devices in turn the back panel 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.730
 The tablet is also assembled from two parts. 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.410
 light gray plastic 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.030

 the lion's back part of the device 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.910
 the use of plastic allowed 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.799
 to avoid

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.170
 full sized usb connectors 2 0 case 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.030
 the docking station is completely made of 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.950
 plastic at the same time on the working panel 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.660
 silver material is used

 is 9 by 5 centimeters of this 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.599
 enough for normal operation 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.099
 with windows interface it is plastic

 transformation acer aspire switch 10 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.970
 passes on standard for models

 format two in one script display 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.970
 the module is completely removed from the dock 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.190
 after which it can be used as 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.990
 ordinary monoblock tablet fixation 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.910
 the tablet in the docking station is done with 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.099
 using a proprietary system built on 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.169
 two powerful magnets and a pair of plastic 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.820
 pins with small snaps which 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.950
 snap into tablet holes 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.690
 to remove the tablet from the dock enough 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.849
 just pull him by holding 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.680
 the bottom of the transformer is such a way 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:47.120
 convenient because the user disappears 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.050
 need to look for a push 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.700

 reliable connection with a strong jerk 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.370
 you risk dropping one of the parts 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.960
 transformer of the above 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.599
 descriptions understand how exactly happens

 tablet to dock like screen keyboard so 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.570
 and in the opposite direction this mode is convenient 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.550
 use the touch interface and 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.620
 view movies and photos not 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.280

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.550
 but upside down so 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.500
 that the transformer relies on 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.090
 the surface of the table is not the bottom but the front
