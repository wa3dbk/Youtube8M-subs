 respect the natural form of flowers 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:51.079

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.600
 in the beaten egg 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.030
 we take a little bit off the excess and then 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.439
 in the breadcrumbs by insisting well for 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.439
 coat the cheese well 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.280
 then we reserve them on a plate 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.780
 and we'll put them in the cool for 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.409

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.459
 let's start the salad 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:40.970
 so we start by slicing the cabbage 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:44.500
 red the handis so endive 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.500

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.340
 same passion for celery slices 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.850
 then sticks a little bit of 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:45.420
 grapes that are simply cut into 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:51.810
