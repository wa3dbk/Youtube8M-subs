00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
three goals down but it's a tough start

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.330 
three goals down but it's a tough start
they<00:00:09.900> came<00:00:10.110> at<00:00:10.260> us<00:00:10.290> pretty<00:00:10.530> hard<00:00:10.679> they're

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
they came at us pretty hard they're

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.810

pretty<00:00:11.490> good<00:00:11.639> team<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.880> lot<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.179> speed<00:00:13.670> they<00:00:14.670> got

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
pretty good team a lot of speed they got

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.330 
pretty good team a lot of speed they got
us<00:00:14.910> down<00:00:15.089> quick<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.350> think<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.130> showed<00:00:17.279> a

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
us down quick and I think it showed a

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.490 
us down quick and I think it showed a
lot<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.460> character<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.810> our<00:00:18.960> team<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.350> come

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
lot of character of our team to come

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.710 
lot of character of our team to come
back<00:00:19.680> like<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.670> said<00:00:20.730> three<00:00:21.029> goals<00:00:21.210> down<00:00:21.390> I

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
back like I said three goals down I

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.849 
back like I said three goals down I
think<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.050> battled<00:00:22.350> really<00:00:22.529> hard<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
think we battled really hard in the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.759 
think we battled really hard in the
third<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:24.000> should<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.570> stay<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.470> game<00:00:25.619> there

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
third it should I stay in the game there

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.240 
third it should I stay in the game there
at<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.949> end<00:00:27.170> so<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.349> think<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.769> got<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.070> a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
at the end so I think you got to be a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.030 
at the end so I think you got to be a
little<00:00:30.060> proud<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.570> we<00:00:30.660> got<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> point<00:00:31.050> but<00:00:31.349> you

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
little proud that we got a point but you

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.330 
little proud that we got a point but you
gotta<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.430> better<00:00:32.610> start<00:00:32.910> next<00:00:33.870> game<00:00:34.340> she

gotta have a better start next game she

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.790 
gotta have a better start next game she
see<00:00:35.489> any<00:00:35.610> specific<00:00:36.540> reasons<00:00:36.989> why<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.200> gave<00:00:37.649> to

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800

see any specific reasons why you gave to
me<00:00:37.829> three<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.700> over<00:00:38.790> we'd<00:00:39.950> just<00:00:40.950> looked<00:00:41.190> like

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
me three and over we'd just looked like

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.310 
me three and over we'd just looked like
they<00:00:41.489> were<00:00:41.550> they<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.690> lot<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.840> jump<00:00:43.140> I

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
they were they have a lot of jump I

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.750 
they were they have a lot of jump I
don't<00:00:43.500> think<00:00:43.559> they<00:00:43.829> played<00:00:44.100> yesterday<00:00:44.280> that's

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
don't think they played yesterday that's

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.940 
don't think they played yesterday that's
for<00:00:44.969> sure<00:00:45.090> they<00:00:45.960> were<00:00:46.110> flying<00:00:46.469> around<00:00:46.590> it

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
for sure they were flying around it

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.340 
for sure they were flying around it
gotta<00:00:47.579> love<00:00:47.730> speed<00:00:47.969> they're<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> good<00:00:48.300> team<00:00:48.350> so

gotta love speed they're a good team so
like<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.309> said<00:00:50.809> I<00:00:51.809> think<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.800> was<00:00:52.949> great<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:54.180> our

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
like I said I think it was great on our

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.840 
like I said I think it was great on our
part<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:55.320> battled<00:00:55.949> back<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.129> tied<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
part that we battled back and tied the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.099 
part that we battled back and tied the
game<00:00:57.050> three<00:00:58.050> goals<00:00:58.260> there<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.280> know<00:00:59.399> I

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
game three goals there and you know I

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.640 
game three goals there and you know I
don't<00:01:01.109> know<00:01:01.170> what<00:01:01.500> was<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.800> 30<00:01:02.550> minutes<00:01:02.910> I

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
don't know what was it 30 minutes I

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.200 
don't know what was it 30 minutes I
guess<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.769> lot<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.920> character<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.700> think<00:01:06.150> we

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
guess a lot of character and I think we

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.870 
guess a lot of character and I think we
can<00:01:06.330> build<00:01:06.450> off<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:07.400> you<00:01:08.400> used<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.790> do

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
can build off that you used to do

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.060 
can build off that you used to do
smaller<00:01:09.270> rinks<00:01:09.750> what<00:01:10.439> do<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.619> say<00:01:10.770> buzz<00:01:10.950> your

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
smaller rinks what do you say buzz your

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.330 
smaller rinks what do you say buzz your
teammates<00:01:11.460> do<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.729> see<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:13.340> reasons

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
teammates do you see in the reasons

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.210 
teammates do you see in the reasons
there<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.880> they're<00:01:15.299> not<00:01:15.450> used<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.869> uh<00:01:16.680> I

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
there that they're not used to uh I

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.700 
there that they're not used to uh I
don't<00:01:17.490> know<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.700> think<00:01:18.350> they<00:01:19.350> may<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.530> been

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
don't know I think they may have been

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.940 
don't know I think they may have been
used<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.520> bigger<00:01:20.909> sheet<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.950> think

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
used to the bigger sheet but I think

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.160 
used to the bigger sheet but I think
they<00:01:23.040> did<00:01:23.159> well<00:01:23.310> i<00:01:23.340> think<00:01:23.689> it<00:01:24.689> was<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.020> was<00:01:25.110> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
they did well i think it was if it was a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.510 
they did well i think it was if it was a
feeling-out<00:01:25.470> process<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:26.070> think<00:01:26.100> they<00:01:26.400> just

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
feeling-out process I think they just

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.950 
feeling-out process I think they just
they<00:01:26.790> were<00:01:26.850> better<00:01:27.090> than<00:01:27.180> us<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
they were better than us and that in the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.870 
they were better than us and that in the
first<00:01:28.350> half<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.829> think<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.790> were

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
first half and I think it we were

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.920 
first half and I think it we were
actually<00:01:30.000> better<00:01:30.240> than<00:01:30.329> him<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.630> think<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
actually better than him I think in the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.690 
actually better than him I think in the
second<00:01:31.229> half<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.680> think<00:01:31.950> our<00:01:32.220> guys<00:01:32.369> figured

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
second half so I think our guys figured

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.109 
second half so I think our guys figured
it<00:01:32.820> out<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.180> maybe<00:01:34.079> they<00:01:34.799> were<00:01:34.860> not<00:01:35.460> used<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.880> I

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
it out and maybe they were not used to I

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.120 
it out and maybe they were not used to I
still<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.840> still<00:01:36.960> got<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.350> get<00:01:37.560> back<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.890> forth

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
still I still got to get back and forth

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.469 
still I still got to get back and forth
to<00:01:38.280> i'm<00:01:38.460> not<00:01:38.490> i'm<00:01:38.880> not<00:01:38.939> used<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.329> everything

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
to i'm not i'm not used to everything

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.910 
to i'm not i'm not used to everything
you<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:39.869> I've<00:01:39.960> been<00:01:39.990> playing<00:01:40.290> over<00:01:40.500> here<00:01:40.650> for
