00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.160
In a time when fear had surrounded us

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.800
When the ground shook and destruction occurred

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.480
And despair seems all that the eye can see

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.020
There’s a shelter called hope where we can stand.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.320
No earthquake can shake our hope away

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.520
For the past has taught us that we can say

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.000
We will rise once again.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.220
From the place that we're in

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.240
Hand in Hand with faith we'll stand

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.320
And with God as our guide

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.340
Side by side

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.900
Together we will rise.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.660
Nothing can tear apart unity

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.520
When everyone looks to one goal

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.320
And trials can bring opportunity

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.660
To give from your spirit and soul

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.580
We must kneel and pray

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.020
When troubles seem long

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:37.940
Thank God for the breath of a brand new day

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.580
We will rise once again.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.920
From the place that we're in

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.740
Hand in Hand with faith we'll stand

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.420
And with God as our guide
Side by side

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.620
Together we will rise.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.420
So work with all your might

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.100
Don’t give up the fight

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.580
We will rise once again.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.520
From the place that we're in

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.560
Hand in Hand with faith we'll stand

00:03:39.336 --> 00:03:46.996
And with God as our guide
Side by side

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.140
Together we will rise.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.980
We will rise once again.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.480
From the place that we're in

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.320
Hand in Hand with faith we'll stand

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.620
And with God as our guide
Side by side

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.340
Together we will rise.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.640
we will rise again

00:04:36.588 --> 00:04:38.988
