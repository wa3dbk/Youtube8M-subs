00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.350
 music 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.510
 music 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:42.970
 hello I'm daniel moves well January 6 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.010
 where are you from I am from new orleans 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.010
 new orleans louisiana 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.580
 and what brings you here because it brings me 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.880
 here the guitar 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:58.420
 they had a former Brazilian teacher who 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.950
 worked lanÃºs to that it was predicted 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.120
 guitar I'm always going to take you a lot 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.660
 farther than a car 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.980
 and here it is and in principle to go 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.980
 studying the flamenco guitar 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.469
 for me and there are 33 very large cultures of 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.990
 handyman and American culture the 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:28.869
 Brazilian in Spanish 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.380
 this last one being for me 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.360
 the highest level technically I do not the 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.399
 flamenco guitar technique without 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.399
 same 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.399
 equalizable 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.550
 it is a combination there then jazz 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.070
 and flamenco does have a lot 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.950
 Common action on process 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.720
 rhythms the sense of feeling that 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.730
 requires each one 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.380
 they are much more similar to what 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.380
 you would think maybe you know 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.650
 I like 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.569
 but what are some things that I have 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:18.469
 learned about everything here in Spain 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:22.219
 that all that effort all that work 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:25.579
 with the guitar practicing trying 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:27.850
 doing all that well also all that 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.650
 it can also be offered 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.810
 I dont know 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.780
 dv 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.510
 also the traditional carol in the 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.450
 moment was something new 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.830
 but I think so 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.870
 in all art and especially and also 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.349
 whoever has Christian content is very 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:55.670
 important that it evolve that is very 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:58.480
 good and professional and current can 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.480
 give us museums 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.829
 yes 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.560
 music is learned by listening 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.190
 and some good recordings in a good 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.800
 look for friend there is the music is not there 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.180
 in a paper or a score so that if 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.640
 you want to learn to sing or play 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.360
 Anything so you have to listen 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.360
 to intern 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.740
 that is internalize when when I was 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.740
 learning 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.769
 i 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.319
 that music communicates very much, that is, 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.800
 that has a lot of information 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:03.580
 and I also believe 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:07.650
 that like everything beautiful has a 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.650
 very strong relationship with the truth 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:17.709
 and then it's fun is 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.709
 cheerful can be can be very sad 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:31.770
 hey well no 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.770
 Christmas is helpful
