00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.399 
love about this biodegradable pot is you
just<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.759> take<00:02:00.420> off<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.960> plastic

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
just have to take off the plastic

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.100 
just have to take off the plastic
wrapper<00:02:03.409> and<00:02:04.820> you<00:02:05.820> can<00:02:06.000> see<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.750> there<00:02:06.930> are

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
wrapper and you can see that there are

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.960 
wrapper and you can see that there are
four<00:02:07.439> little<00:02:07.560> plants<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.250> there<00:02:08.429> already

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
four little plants in there already

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.210 
four little plants in there already
and<00:02:09.450> what<00:02:09.570> I<00:02:09.600> do<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.019> just<00:02:10.049> tear<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.770> bottom

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
and what I do is I just tear the bottom

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.229 
and what I do is I just tear the bottom
of<00:02:12.709> the<00:02:13.709> container<00:02:14.069> like<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.459> so<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.000> roots

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
of the container like that so the roots

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.110 
of the container like that so the roots
will<00:02:15.450> grow<00:02:15.569> through

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
will grow through

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.800 
will grow through
and<00:02:16.360> then<00:02:16.959> just<00:02:17.590> dig<00:02:17.770> a<00:02:17.800> hole<00:02:18.209> like<00:02:19.209> this<00:02:19.450> place

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
and then just dig a hole like this place

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.630 
and then just dig a hole like this place
it<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.500> peel<00:02:20.830> back<00:02:21.099> this<00:02:21.940> peat<00:02:22.780> moss

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
it and I peel back this peat moss

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.970 
it and I peel back this peat moss
biodegradable<00:02:24.640> pot<00:02:25.300> like<00:02:25.569> that<00:02:25.650> just<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:26.830> the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
biodegradable pot like that just so the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.400 
biodegradable pot like that just so the
edge<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.670> lip<00:02:27.849> doesn't<00:02:28.330> show<00:02:28.599> and<00:02:28.900> then<00:02:29.319> I

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
edge of the lip doesn't show and then I

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.729 
edge of the lip doesn't show and then I
tuck<00:02:29.709> them<00:02:29.980> in<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.940> let's<00:02:31.510> do<00:02:31.630> this<00:02:31.810> again<00:02:32.140> so

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
tuck them in so let's do this again so

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:39.120 
tuck them in so let's do this again so
we<00:02:32.860> take<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:35.220> off<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.370> plastic<00:02:36.819> wrapper<00:02:38.130> peel

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
we take and off the plastic wrapper peel

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.630 
we take and off the plastic wrapper peel
off<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.489> bottom<00:02:40.800> find<00:02:41.800> a<00:02:41.860> new<00:02:41.980> home<00:02:42.190> for<00:02:42.489> it

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
off the bottom find a new home for it

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.330 
off the bottom find a new home for it
like<00:02:42.819> this<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.480> take<00:02:44.140> off<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:44.590> edge<00:02:44.739> and<00:02:45.280> the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
like this and take off the edge and the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.000 
like this and take off the edge and the
reason<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.700> take<00:02:45.940> that<00:02:46.180> edge<00:02:46.540> off<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:47.470> that<00:02:47.920> you

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
reason I take that edge off is that you

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.070 
reason I take that edge off is that you
can<00:02:48.160> have<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.400> wicking<00:02:48.910> effect<00:02:49.330> meaning<00:02:49.690> the

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
can have a wicking effect meaning the

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.990 
can have a wicking effect meaning the
wind<00:02:50.350> can<00:02:50.620> blow<00:02:50.769> across<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.459> edge<00:02:51.610> of<00:02:51.850> that

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
wind can blow across the edge of that

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.330 
wind can blow across the edge of that
peat<00:02:52.239> moss<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.720> dry<00:02:53.319> out<00:02:53.530> these<00:02:53.799> young<00:02:54.100> herbs

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
peat moss and dry out these young herbs

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.910 
peat moss and dry out these young herbs
before<00:02:54.580> they<00:02:54.910> really<00:02:55.540> get<00:02:55.720> started<00:02:56.019> now<00:02:56.530> what

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
before they really get started now what

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.009 
before they really get started now what
you'll<00:02:57.069> discover<00:02:57.190> before<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.970> very<00:02:58.269> short<00:02:58.720> time

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
you'll discover before a very short time

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.190 
you'll discover before a very short time
this<00:03:00.010> planter<00:03:00.580> will<00:03:00.790> be<00:03:00.910> completely<00:03:01.599> full<00:03:01.900> of

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
this planter will be completely full of

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.979 
this planter will be completely full of
fresh<00:03:02.620> cilantro<00:03:02.920> leaves<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.299> love<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.720> take
