I've<00:03:16.319> always<00:03:16.560> have<00:03:16.829> to<00:03:16.950> get<00:03:17.069> some<00:03:17.250> new<00:03:17.280> e<00:03:17.370> exes

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
I've always have to get some new e exes

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.550 
I've always have to get some new e exes
so<00:03:18.329> that<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.750> good<00:03:18.959> way<00:03:19.079> to<00:03:19.109> start<00:03:19.319> things

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
so that is a good way to start things

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.559 
so that is a good way to start things
off<00:03:19.829> I<00:03:20.100> wish<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.670> my<00:03:20.880> favorite<00:03:21.120> starters

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
Sceptile could have had an awesome tin

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.610 
Sceptile could have had an awesome tin
but<00:03:24.000> i<00:03:24.239> guess<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.959> awesome<00:03:25.200> 10<00:03:25.319> is<00:03:25.380> gonna<00:03:25.530> be

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
but i guess the awesome 10 is gonna be

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.860 
but i guess the awesome 10 is gonna be
left<00:03:25.829> for<00:03:25.920> Blaziken<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:26.850> really<00:03:27.239> awesome<00:03:27.750> let

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
left for Blaziken so really awesome let

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.650 
left for Blaziken so really awesome let
me<00:03:27.959> set<00:03:28.170> that<00:03:28.200> one<00:03:28.440> aside<00:03:28.500> there<00:03:29.480> zoom<00:03:30.480> backed

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
me set that one aside there zoom backed

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.509 
me set that one aside there zoom backed
out<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.380> i'll<00:03:31.590> get<00:03:31.739> into<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:31.950> next<00:03:32.190> one<00:03:32.340> can

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
out and i'll get into the next one can

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.059 
out and i'll get into the next one can
we<00:03:32.609> have<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.850> double<00:03:33.299> a<00:03:33.660> double<00:03:33.750> e<00:03:34.260> x<00:03:34.440> video<00:03:34.739> or<00:03:35.010> i

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
we have a double a double e x video or i

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.410 
we have a double a double e x video or i
guess<00:03:35.220> we<00:03:35.459> kind<00:03:35.670> of<00:03:35.700> already<00:03:35.819> have<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.060> double

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
guess we kind of already have a double

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.259 
guess we kind of already have a double
cuz<00:03:36.660> we<00:03:37.290> got<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.590> preview<00:03:37.950> with<00:03:38.269> Blaziken

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
cuz we got that preview with Blaziken

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.479 
cuz we got that preview with Blaziken
but<00:03:39.739> let's<00:03:40.739> see<00:03:40.859> if<00:03:40.889> we<00:03:40.980> get<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.100> second<00:03:41.430> one

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
but let's see if we get a second one

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.370 
but let's see if we get a second one
from<00:03:41.639> an<00:03:41.760> actual<00:03:41.880> pack<00:03:43.400> current<00:03:45.200> okay<00:03:46.200> I'll

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
from an actual pack current okay I'll

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.129 
from an actual pack current okay I'll
see<00:03:46.530> what<00:03:46.620> we<00:03:46.709> got<00:03:47.180> we<00:03:48.180> have<00:03:48.420> a<00:03:48.750> beautiful

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
see what we got we have a beautiful

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.120 
see what we got we have a beautiful
dragonair<00:03:50.060> we<00:03:51.060> have<00:03:51.269> Gallade<00:03:51.780> spero<00:03:52.079> yo<00:03:52.680> well

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
dragonair we have Gallade spero yo well

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.129 
dragonair we have Gallade spero yo well
okay<00:03:53.940> we<00:03:54.060> can<00:03:54.209> kind<00:03:54.420> of<00:03:54.569> use<00:03:54.630> this<00:03:54.810> with<00:03:54.989> the

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
okay we can kind of use this with the

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.839 
okay we can kind of use this with the
Golay<00:03:55.380> DX<00:03:55.709> but<00:03:55.920> this<00:03:56.160> actually<00:03:56.340> evolves<00:03:56.790> it

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
Golay DX but this actually evolves it

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.839 
Golay DX but this actually evolves it
into<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.120> mega<00:03:57.359> so<00:03:57.630> if<00:03:57.720> we<00:03:57.810> get<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:58.019> mega<00:03:58.319> glade

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
into the mega so if we get a mega glade

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.849 
into the mega so if we get a mega glade

the primal clash this is well actually
all<00:04:31.200> these<00:04:31.470> sets<00:04:31.650> all<00:04:31.830> these<00:04:32.010> said<00:04:32.160> some<00:04:32.340> type

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
these sets I'm very far from completing

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.020 
these sets I'm very far from completing
the<00:04:36.690> only<00:04:36.960> set<00:04:37.370> I'm<00:04:38.370> really<00:04:38.580> close<00:04:38.850> to

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
the only set I'm really close to

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.870 
the only set I'm really close to
completing<00:04:39.330> is<00:04:39.720> flash<00:04:40.590> fire<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.400> I<00:04:41.460> saw<00:04:41.640> more

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
completing is flash fire and I saw more

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.490 
completing is flash fire and I saw more
flash<00:04:42.060> fire<00:04:42.270> packs<00:04:42.570> to<00:04:42.780> kill<00:04:42.990> we're<00:04:43.200> kind<00:04:43.470> of

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
flash fire packs to kill we're kind of

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.470 
flash fire packs to kill we're kind of
done<00:04:43.650> with<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.860> booster<00:04:44.130> boxes<00:04:44.520> but<00:04:44.790> I<00:04:45.030> still

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
done with the booster boxes but I still

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.630 
done with the booster boxes but I still
have<00:04:45.630> some<00:04:45.750> other<00:04:45.930> sealed<00:04:46.380> items<00:04:46.770> that<00:04:47.010> have

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
have some other sealed items that have

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.130 
have some other sealed items that have
flash<00:04:47.910> fire<00:04:48.120> packs<00:04:48.360> in<00:04:48.570> them<00:04:48.750> so<00:04:48.960> we'll

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
flash fire packs in them so we'll

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.720 
flash fire packs in them so we'll
hopefully<00:04:49.350> get<00:04:49.800> those<00:04:49.950> last<00:04:50.100> few<00:04:50.310> flash<00:04:50.550> fire

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
hopefully get those last few flash fire

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.060 
hopefully get those last few flash fire
cards<00:04:51.060> but<00:04:51.660> for<00:04:51.840> now<00:04:51.870> we<00:04:52.290> have<00:04:52.500> a<00:04:52.710> knitter
