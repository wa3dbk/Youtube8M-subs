bouquet is something I picked yesterday
on<00:00:19.109> one<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.350> my<00:00:19.529> walks<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.640> very<00:00:20.910> similar<00:00:21.210> to

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
on one of my walks it's very similar to

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.630 
on one of my walks it's very similar to
what<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.810> did<00:00:22.080> when<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.350> design<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:23.010> piece<00:00:23.310> I

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
what I did when I design this piece I

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.759 
what I did when I design this piece I
picked<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.510> flowers<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:25.230> looked<00:00:25.439> at<00:00:25.590> them

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
picked the flowers and looked at them

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.710 
picked the flowers and looked at them
and<00:00:25.920> if<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.130> look<00:00:26.279> at<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.490> petals<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.539> can

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
and if you look at the petals you can

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.240 
and if you look at the petals you can
kind<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:27.990> see<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.320> shapes<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.890> them<00:00:29.070> and

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
kind of see the shapes of them and

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.659 
kind of see the shapes of them and
decide<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.330> how<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.689> want<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.340> designer<00:00:32.340> look

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
decide on how you want the designer look

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.540 
decide on how you want the designer look
and<00:00:32.790> that's<00:00:32.910> what<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.210> did<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:34.160> with<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.370> in

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
and that's what I did and with that in

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.990 
and that's what I did and with that in
mind<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:36.149> piece<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> pendant<00:00:37.290> necklace

necklace so what I'm demonstrating here
I've<00:01:15.840> already<00:01:16.110> done<00:01:16.740> four<00:01:17.340> petals<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.900> want

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
I've already done four petals and I want

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.230 
I've already done four petals and I want
to<00:01:19.200> show<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.470> what<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.130> start<00:01:20.520> off<00:01:20.700> with<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.210> I

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
to show you what I start off with is I

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.020 
to show you what I start off with is I
start<00:01:21.689> off<00:01:21.869> creating<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:23.130> bezel<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.759> don't

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
start off creating the bezel but I don't

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.980 
start off creating the bezel but I don't
close<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.570> yet

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
close it yet

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.289 
close it yet
the<00:01:25.320> bezel<00:01:25.560> normally<00:01:26.340> takes<00:01:26.729> these<00:01:27.000> little

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
the bezel normally takes these little

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.780 
the bezel normally takes these little
stones<00:01:27.570> here<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:28.950> I've<00:01:29.070> learned<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.610> it's

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
stones here but I've learned that it's

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.690 
stones here but I've learned that it's
much<00:01:29.970> easier<00:01:30.450> if<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:31.020> first<00:01:31.740> put<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> petals<00:01:32.520> on

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
much easier if I first put the petals on

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.020 
much easier if I first put the petals on
and<00:01:32.970> then<00:01:33.479> stitch<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.740> stone<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.820> use

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
and then stitch in the stone and I use

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.569 
and then stitch in the stone and I use
peyote<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.750> do<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.860> at<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.100> point<00:01:38.340> and

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
peyote to do that so at this point and

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.310 
peyote to do that so at this point and
then<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.119> earrings<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.900> want<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.170> show

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
then the and the earrings I want to show

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.899 
then the and the earrings I want to show
you<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.590> back<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.040> earrings<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
you the back of the earrings the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.760 
you the back of the earrings the
earrings<00:01:41.970> have<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> little<00:01:42.780> piece<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:42.990> chain<00:01:43.439> on

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
earrings have a little piece of chain on

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.469 
earrings have a little piece of chain on
it<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.250> what<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.399> do<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:44.970> found<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
it and what I do and I found it the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.929 
it and what I do and I found it the
easiest<00:01:45.840> way<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.110> do<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:47.490> put<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.880> in

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
easiest way to do it and I put this in

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.210 
easiest way to do it and I put this in
my<00:01:48.090> instruction<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:48.810> like<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.409> add<00:01:49.920> my

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
my instruction just like this I add my

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.700 
my instruction just like this I add my
chain<00:01:50.579> before<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.210> add<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.869> petals<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.500> makes

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
chain before I add the petals it makes

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.130 
chain before I add the petals it makes
it<00:01:52.860> much<00:01:53.009> easier<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.490> stitch<00:01:53.939> once<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.780> add<00:01:54.960> to

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
it much easier to stitch once I add to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.560 
it much easier to stitch once I add to
chain<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:56.009> hold<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.520> towards<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.060> back<00:01:57.270> of

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
chain I just hold it towards the back of

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.770 
chain I just hold it towards the back of
the<00:01:57.659> bezel<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:59.549> continue<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.210> stitch<00:02:00.479> my

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
the bezel and I continue to stitch my

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.920 
the bezel and I continue to stitch my

I push them to my work I'm gonna make
the<00:02:21.090> first<00:02:21.300> chain<00:02:21.750> for<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:22.740> pedal<00:02:29.810> stitching

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
the first chain for this pedal stitching

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.520 
the first chain for this pedal stitching
into<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.890> bezel<00:02:32.180> tip<00:02:35.630> now<00:02:36.630> in<00:02:36.930> Chevron<00:02:37.140> chain

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
into the bezel tip now in Chevron chain

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.740 
into the bezel tip now in Chevron chain
you<00:02:37.680> have<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:37.920> use<00:02:38.280> existing<00:02:38.760> chains<00:02:39.360> after

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
you have to use existing chains after

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.560 
you have to use existing chains after
the<00:02:40.080> first<00:02:40.320> one<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:41.220> like<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.460> netting<00:02:41.940> so

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
the first one so it's like a netting so

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.050 
the first one so it's like a netting so
we're<00:02:42.720> going<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:42.990> stitch<00:02:43.320> into<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:44.370> 4th<00:02:44.670> bead

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
we're going to stitch into the 4th bead

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.460 
we're going to stitch into the 4th bead
from<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.260> connector<00:02:47.070> on<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.460> previous<00:02:47.850> chain

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
from the connector on the previous chain

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.760 
from the connector on the previous chain
there<00:02:49.470> we<00:02:49.620> go<00:02:49.770> we<00:02:49.950> got<00:02:49.980> 2<00:02:50.520> chains<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.090> far<00:02:51.330> 1<00:02:51.720> 2<00:02:52.200> 3

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
there we go we got 2 chains so far 1 2 3

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.810 
there we go we got 2 chains so far 1 2 3

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
the outside edge of the first row which

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.640 
the outside edge of the first row which
will<00:03:48.069> create<00:03:48.280> an<00:03:48.549> increase<00:03:48.970> that's<00:03:49.239> why<00:03:49.480> these

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
will create an increase that's why these

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.500 
will create an increase that's why these
the<00:03:50.650> second<00:03:51.099> row<00:03:51.220> is<00:03:51.400> wider<00:03:51.670> than<00:03:51.849> the<00:03:52.060> first

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.119 
the second row is wider than the first
row<00:03:53.459> so<00:03:54.459> again<00:03:55.000> we<00:03:55.269> use<00:03:55.299> nine<00:03:56.079> beads<00:03:56.410> this

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
row so again we use nine beads this

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:00.089 
row so again we use nine beads this
procedure<00:03:57.910> is<00:03:58.209> repetitious<00:03:59.079> so<00:03:59.319> it's<00:03:59.500> easy<00:03:59.799> to

what<00:04:48.160> makes<00:04:48.460> it<00:04:48.669> wider<00:04:49.030> there's<00:04:49.419> an<00:04:49.570> increase

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
what makes it wider there's an increase

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.730 
what makes it wider there's an increase
on<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:50.889> second<00:04:51.310> row<00:04:52.050> so<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:53.200> second<00:04:53.590> row<00:04:53.680> is

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
on the second row so the second row is

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.529 
on the second row so the second row is
wider<00:04:54.039> than<00:04:54.190> the<00:04:54.370> first<00:04:54.610> which<00:04:54.789> gives<00:04:54.820> it<00:04:55.330> the

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
wider than the first which gives it the

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.010 
wider than the first which gives it the
appearance<00:04:55.960> of<00:04:56.590> a<00:04:57.160> petal<00:04:57.580> that<00:04:57.760> widens<00:04:58.120> on<00:04:58.660> the

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
appearance of a petal that widens on the

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.060 
appearance of a petal that widens on the
outside<00:04:59.410> edge<00:05:00.479> this<00:05:01.479> is<00:05:01.630> my<00:05:01.810> last<00:05:02.080> chain<00:05:02.590> for

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
outside edge this is my last chain for

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.580 
outside edge this is my last chain for
the<00:05:03.250> second<00:05:03.610> row<00:05:03.729> now<00:05:04.240> to<00:05:04.630> get<00:05:04.780> this<00:05:04.930> petal<00:05:05.380> to

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
the second row now to get this petal to

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.089 
the second row now to get this petal to
really<00:05:05.979> stick<00:05:06.880> be<00:05:07.300> stiff<00:05:07.750> and<00:05:08.050> sit<00:05:08.289> properly<00:05:08.800> I

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
really stick be stiff and sit properly I

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:10.800 
really stick be stiff and sit properly I
really<00:05:09.550> need<00:05:09.700> to<00:05:09.729> add<00:05:09.910> gap<00:05:10.270> beads<00:05:10.539> that<00:05:10.660> may

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
really need to add gap beads that may

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.990 
really need to add gap beads that may
explain<00:05:11.110> if<00:05:11.500> you<00:05:11.830> notice<00:05:12.310> this<00:05:12.430> is<00:05:12.610> not<00:05:12.789> as

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
explain if you notice this is not as

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.060 
explain if you notice this is not as
clean<00:05:13.510> as<00:05:13.780> this<00:05:13.990> pedal<00:05:14.380> and<00:05:14.530> that's<00:05:14.680> because

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
clean as this pedal and that's because

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.879 
clean as this pedal and that's because
we<00:05:15.280> have<00:05:15.460> a<00:05:15.490> gap<00:05:15.760> here<00:05:16.180> gap<00:05:16.840> here<00:05:17.169> and<00:05:17.380> one<00:05:17.590> two

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
we have a gap here gap here and one two

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.070 
we have a gap here gap here and one two
three<00:05:17.919> at<00:05:18.250> the<00:05:18.370> top<00:05:18.550> we<00:05:19.030> really<00:05:19.360> need<00:05:19.539> to<00:05:19.720> fill

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
three at the top we really need to fill

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.649 
three at the top we really need to fill
those<00:05:20.289> in<00:05:20.349> so<00:05:20.800> to<00:05:20.860> do<00:05:21.099> that<00:05:21.130> I'm<00:05:21.610> just<00:05:22.180> gonna<00:05:22.330> go

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:22.659 
those in so to do that I'm just gonna go

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:24.959 
those in so to do that I'm just gonna go
around<00:05:23.110> I<00:05:23.620> pick<00:05:23.830> up<00:05:23.950> my<00:05:24.099> first<00:05:24.310> beat<00:05:24.580> I'm<00:05:24.669> still

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:24.969 
around I pick up my first beat I'm still

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:29.070 
around I pick up my first beat I'm still
in<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:25.210> first<00:05:25.450> gap

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.050 

and<00:05:30.080> just<00:05:30.680> going<00:05:30.830> to<00:05:30.890> stitch<00:05:31.160> around<00:05:31.340> filling

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
and just going to stitch around filling

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.310 
and just going to stitch around filling
in<00:05:32.180> the<00:05:32.330> gaps<00:05:33.280> so<00:05:34.280> that<00:05:34.550> this<00:05:34.850> petal<00:05:35.390> will<00:05:35.990> sit

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
in the gaps so that this petal will sit

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.890 
in the gaps so that this petal will sit
stiffly<00:05:36.980> as<00:05:37.160> an<00:05:37.400> armature<00:05:37.730> and<00:05:37.910> be<00:05:38.330> movable

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
stiffly as an armature and be movable

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.650 
stiffly as an armature and be movable
without<00:05:39.460> just<00:05:40.460> flopping<00:05:40.910> around<00:05:41.030> we<00:05:41.360> wanted

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
without just flopping around we wanted

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:48.610 
without just flopping around we wanted
to<00:05:41.750> have<00:05:41.930> some<00:05:42.350> shape<00:05:46.030> okay<00:05:47.260> this<00:05:48.260> is<00:05:48.410> my

and I only have one to go this is pretty

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.820 
and I only have one to go this is pretty
much<00:06:24.740> done<00:06:25.070> here's<00:06:25.640> the<00:06:25.880> finished<00:06:26.240> piece<00:06:26.830> once

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
much done here's the finished piece once

much done here's the finished piece once
the<00:06:28.010> petals<00:06:28.310> are<00:06:28.460> done<00:06:28.700> you<00:06:29.390> end<00:06:29.570> up<00:06:29.800> cinching

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
the petals are done you end up cinching

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.860 
the petals are done you end up cinching
in<00:06:30.950> your<00:06:31.100> stones<00:06:31.460> these<00:06:31.910> little<00:06:32.210> stones<00:06:32.480> here

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
in your stones these little stones here

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.690 
in your stones these little stones here
and<00:06:33.050> then<00:06:34.010> you're<00:06:34.160> going<00:06:34.250> to<00:06:34.310> add<00:06:34.520> another

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
and then you're going to add another

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.180 
and then you're going to add another
round<00:06:35.270> of<00:06:35.600> Chevron<00:06:36.500> chain<00:06:36.770> with<00:06:36.980> two

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
round of Chevron chain with two

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.070 
round of Chevron chain with two
millimeter<00:06:37.670> crystals<00:06:38.270> little<00:06:38.630> bitty<00:06:38.780> tiny

millimeter crystals little bitty tiny
round<00:06:39.440> crystals<00:06:40.040> and<00:06:40.250> at<00:06:40.880> that<00:06:41.060> point<00:06:41.360> you're

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
round crystals and at that point you're

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.940 
round crystals and at that point you're
going<00:06:41.870> to<00:06:41.930> tie<00:06:42.080> off<00:06:42.260> your<00:06:42.290> thread<00:06:42.500> and<00:06:42.860> you're
