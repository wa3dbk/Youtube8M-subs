port also has a webcam and a microphone

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.699 
port also has a webcam and a microphone
if<00:02:24.360> you're<00:02:24.510> doing<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.780> video<00:02:25.019> chat<00:02:25.349> that

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
if you're doing the video chat that

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.809 
if you're doing the video chat that
webcam<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.340> right<00:02:26.549> there<00:02:28.340> kind<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.400> tippy<00:02:29.730> on

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
webcam is right there kind of tippy on

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.839 
webcam is right there kind of tippy on
the<00:02:29.910> notebook<00:02:30.120> has<00:02:30.959> two<00:02:31.319> USB<00:02:31.560> ports<00:02:32.250> one<00:02:32.700> on

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
the notebook has two USB ports one on

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:41.059 
the notebook has two USB ports one on
either<00:02:33.000> side<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:37.650> has<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:39.140> wired<00:02:40.140> network<00:02:40.680> port

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
either side it has a wired network port

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.280 
either side it has a wired network port
so<00:02:41.640> if<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:41.880> are<00:02:42.090> hooked<00:02:42.390> up<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.599> a<00:02:42.750> wired<00:02:42.989> net

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
so if you are hooked up to a wired net

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.229 
so if you are hooked up to a wired net
network<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.130> can<00:02:44.250> just<00:02:44.549> plug<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.849> right<00:02:45.000> in

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
network you can just plug it right in

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.360 
network you can just plug it right in
but<00:02:46.019> we<00:02:46.110> cover<00:02:46.650> that<00:02:46.829> with<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.040> rubber<00:02:47.280> plug

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
but we cover that with a rubber plug

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.280 
but we cover that with a rubber plug
because<00:02:48.090> we<00:02:48.209> think<00:02:48.450> most<00:02:48.660> people<00:02:49.049> who<00:02:49.110> use

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
because we think most people who use

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.449 
because we think most people who use
this<00:02:49.500> are<00:02:49.680> going<00:02:49.829> to<00:02:49.920> be<00:02:50.010> using<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.430> with
