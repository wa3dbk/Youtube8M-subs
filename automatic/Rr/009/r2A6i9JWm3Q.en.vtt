detailed<00:00:30.259> plan<00:00:30.439> thought<00:00:31.189> through<00:00:31.550> rather

than I've got a great idea I've got a

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.950 
than I've got a great idea I've got a
great<00:00:34.220> opportunity<00:00:34.489> or<00:00:35.300> I'm<00:00:35.480> passionate

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
great opportunity or I'm passionate

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.840

about<00:00:36.080> food<00:00:36.470> or<00:00:36.710> love<00:00:36.980> coffee<00:00:37.220> therefore<00:00:37.760> I'm

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
about food or love coffee therefore I'm

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.750 
about food or love coffee therefore I'm
buying<00:00:38.059> the<00:00:38.210> cafe<00:00:38.570> so<00:00:39.080> you<00:00:40.040> know<00:00:40.220> rather<00:00:40.610> than

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
buying the cafe so you know rather than

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.579 
buying the cafe so you know rather than
just<00:00:41.120> a<00:00:41.239> great<00:00:41.480> or<00:00:41.629> great<00:00:41.839> idea<00:00:42.230> or<00:00:42.379> great

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:42.589 
just a great or great idea or great

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:45.399 
just a great or great idea or great
location<00:00:43.160> rather<00:00:43.670> than<00:00:43.970> a<00:00:44.120> detailed<00:00:44.570> plan<00:00:44.750> so

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:45.409 
location rather than a detailed plan so

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.250 
location rather than a detailed plan so
that's<00:00:45.920> probably<00:00:46.190> one<00:00:46.610> of<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:46.910> UM<00:00:47.260> very

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
that's probably one of the UM very

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.100 
that's probably one of the UM very
common<00:00:48.620> mistake<00:00:48.739> I<00:00:49.129> see<00:00:49.930> also<00:00:50.930> is<00:00:51.050> that

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
common mistake I see also is that

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.490 
common mistake I see also is that
they're<00:00:51.410> not<00:00:51.590> knowing<00:00:51.980> their<00:00:52.129> target<00:00:52.670> market

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
they're not knowing their target market

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.830 
they're not knowing their target market
that<00:00:54.280> would<00:00:54.550> be<00:00:54.670> think

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
that would be think

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.630 
that would be think
or<00:00:56.140> sleep<00:00:56.590> or<00:00:56.800> voice<00:00:57.010> I<00:00:57.040> love<00:00:57.340> you

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
or sleep or voice I love you

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.210 
or sleep or voice I love you

the the common yeah common here

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.580 
the the common yeah common here
people<00:02:19.930> sort<00:02:20.740> of<00:02:20.800> lacking<00:02:21.220> detail<00:02:21.940> planning

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.370 

the<00:02:27.070> second<00:02:27.520> common<00:02:27.970> mistakes<00:02:28.900> people<00:02:29.080> make

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
the second common mistakes people make

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.210 
the second common mistakes people make
and<00:02:29.950> I<00:02:30.130> see<00:02:30.340> very<00:02:30.460> often<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:32.500> cash<00:02:32.710> flow<00:02:32.980> or

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
and I see very often is the cash flow or

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.310 
and I see very often is the cash flow or
enough<00:02:33.490> allowing<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:34.180> enough<00:02:34.450> capital<00:02:34.870> or

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
enough allowing it enough capital or

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.410 
enough allowing it enough capital or
perhaps<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:36.010> backup<00:02:36.340> money<00:02:36.550> to<00:02:36.940> sustain

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
perhaps the backup money to sustain

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.660 
perhaps the backup money to sustain
their<00:02:37.630> business<00:02:37.660> look<00:02:38.410> it's<00:02:38.920> probably<00:02:39.100> not<00:02:39.520> an

their business look it's probably not an

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.420 
their business look it's probably not an

buy into a goodwill the cash flow is
ticking<00:02:46.300> over<00:02:46.540> that's<00:02:46.720> not<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:46.900> problem<00:02:47.080> but<00:02:47.410> I

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
ticking over that's not a problem but I

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.380 
ticking over that's not a problem but I
often<00:02:48.130> see<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:48.580> lot<00:02:48.760> of<00:02:48.820> people<00:02:49.090> go<00:02:49.180> into<00:02:49.209> the
