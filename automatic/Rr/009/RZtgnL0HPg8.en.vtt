00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.919
 what are the systems that are 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.840
 organizing these areas of instability 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.000
 bring this snow condition 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.730
 there the historical snow for the states 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.699
 united a satellite of the nasa showing the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.400
 advance of these clouds to the region of 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.010
 East American band and giving the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.869
 is the moisture holder for the 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.939
 occurrence of snow according to information 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.949
 of the North American 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.289
 meteorology we had accumulated 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.260
 long island snow nine centimeters 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.290
 personal areas also had a rat with 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.440
 5.5 cm of snow the gusts of 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.450
 winds reached 110 kilometers per 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.040
 time in some areas then personal 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.559
 we are talking about strong winds 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.739
 associated with the occurrence of snow 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.449
 since the formation of nebulosity is not 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.309
 associated with one to the low 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.809
 atmospheric pressure 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.699
 when I have the training system 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.590
 low atmospheric pressure they end up 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.670
 causing cloud development 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.829
 loaded 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.470
 regardless of the occurrence of snow or 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.240
 the rain will be present in 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.520
 both cases clouds with large 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.890
 vertical depth then you can see 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.920
 that most areas of new york 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.450
 boston region here from the east 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.369
 united states in general 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.950
 we take the formation of these great clouds 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.530
 that end up bringing there in a condition 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.810
 of blizzard also personal as I 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.150
 I have in these tones more drawn to the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.310
 blue I have ever temperature in the 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.000
 as lower temperatures are 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.860
 minors 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.720
 that means I have clouds 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.390
 with great vertical development the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.409
 that we have a system working for the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.509
 U.S 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.240
 we now have the presence of staff 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.630
 polar fleet that is largely responsible 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.750
 for bringing the transport of masses of 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.689
 air from popular areas to 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.579
 regions and sweet tropics catching the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.399
 canada and also some areas of 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.040
 united states now the already popular is 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.350
 positioned exactly on the exit area 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.090
 east side of the United States has a 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.670
 low pressure personal system 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.979
 atmospheric levels at the surface levels 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.360
 estimated in the meteorological models 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.800
 estimate that the system has a 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.440
 intensity of approximately 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.990
 nine hundred and eighty six grandchildren 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.820
 is a rather intense low that 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.070
 ends up bringing a convergence of more 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.380
 humidity for the region so I have to 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.670
 moisture injection and I also have 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.350
 presence of cold air 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.770
 an atmospheric high pressure system 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.250
 a little further north that blocks the 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.070
 the advance of this low atmospheric pressure 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.080
 to move out of the North Atlantic Ocean 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.690
 so the guys I have a low 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.730
 pressure that it is blocked by a 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.530
 atmospheric high pressure system by 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.620
 account of this blockage at high 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.050
 encourage the entry of more 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.060
 polar air over continental areas of the 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.760
 United States the temperature drops still 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.960
 more and associated with the moisture I have 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.960
 the occurrence of snow
