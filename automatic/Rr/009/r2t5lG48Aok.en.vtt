375

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.060 
375
it<00:00:25.710> was<00:00:26.039> pretty<00:00:26.550> beat<00:00:27.119> up<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.660> mean<00:00:28.439> it's<00:00:28.859> still

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
it was pretty beat up I mean it's still

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.009 
it was pretty beat up I mean it's still
a<00:00:29.130> little<00:00:29.340> beat<00:00:29.460> up<00:00:29.609> definitely<00:00:30.090> but<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
a little beat up definitely but the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.040 
a little beat up definitely but the
racks<00:00:31.260> were<00:00:31.500> really<00:00:32.160> bent<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.930> think<00:00:33.930> it

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
racks were really bent and I think it

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.049 
racks were really bent and I think it
was<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.350> foot<00:00:34.890> peg<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.520> was<00:00:35.670> completely

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
was this foot peg it was completely

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.720 
was this foot peg it was completely
broken<00:00:36.329> off<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.899> somebody<00:00:37.890> tried<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.190> jb<00:00:38.640> weld

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
broken off and somebody tried to jb weld

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.490 
broken off and somebody tried to jb weld
it<00:00:38.910> back<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:41.570> but<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:43.079> actually<00:00:43.379> got

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
it back on but it's actually got

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.950 
it back on but it's actually got
plastics<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.250> were<00:00:44.690> horribly<00:00:45.690> held

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
plastics that were horribly held

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.470 
plastics that were horribly held
together<00:00:46.110> with<00:00:46.379> like<00:00:46.710> screws<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.450> I

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
together with like screws and so I

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.970 
together with like screws and so I
did<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.780> good<00:00:48.899> stitch<00:00:49.200> job<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:51.770> now<00:00:52.770> they're

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
did a good stitch job to it now they're

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.939 
did a good stitch job to it now they're
actually<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.399> strong<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.760> usable

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
actually like strong and usable

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.220 
actually like strong and usable
stitching<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.100> best<00:00:56.550> ever

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
stitching the best ever

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.110 
stitching the best ever
this<00:00:59.219> mud<00:00:59.579> flap<00:00:59.850> was<00:01:00.059> held<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:02.000> think<00:01:03.000> with

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
this mud flap was held on I think with

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.270 
this mud flap was held on I think with
like<00:01:03.390> two<00:01:03.660> zip<00:01:03.870> ties<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.530> like<00:01:05.010> something

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
like two zip ties and like something

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.410 
like two zip ties and like something
like<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.479> had<00:01:07.140> an<00:01:07.260> extra<00:01:08.210> metal<00:01:09.210> piece

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
like that so I had an extra metal piece

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.090 
like that so I had an extra metal piece
that<00:01:09.450> goes<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:09.990> here<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.500> didn't<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:11.070> it

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
that goes on here just didn't have it

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.609 
that goes on here just didn't have it
and<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.400> threw<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:16.020> timing<00:01:16.380> chain<00:01:16.549> is

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
and I threw that on the timing chain is

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.050 
and I threw that on the timing chain is
extremely<00:01:19.619> loose<00:01:22.159> I'm<00:01:23.159> not<00:01:23.310> exactly<00:01:23.549> sure<00:01:23.729> why

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
extremely loose I'm not exactly sure why

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.760 
extremely loose I'm not exactly sure why
but<00:01:24.270> that's<00:01:24.390> one<00:01:24.810> thing<00:01:25.080> when<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.320> try<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.530> fix

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
but that's one thing when we try to fix

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.100 
but that's one thing when we try to fix
today<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:27.210> Kickstarter<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.840> kind<00:01:28.020> of

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
today and the Kickstarter is kind of

today and the Kickstarter is kind of
stripped<00:01:28.350> out<00:01:28.970> but<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.240> have<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.170> parts<00:01:31.590> to

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
stripped out but I have that parts to

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.560 
stripped out but I have that parts to
