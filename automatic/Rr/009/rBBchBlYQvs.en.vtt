my habitat did I would skein that one
for<00:05:45.870> a<00:05:45.900> while<00:05:46.110> now<00:05:46.460> and<00:05:47.460> I've<00:05:47.580> glued<00:05:47.849> down<00:05:48.030> a

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
lot of chips on I actually D lambda on

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.089

and it worked out great

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:55.519 
and it worked out great
some<00:05:54.330> dual<00:05:54.509> I'm<00:05:54.750> be<00:05:54.930> skating<00:05:55.110> this<00:05:55.289> up<00:05:55.440> to

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:55.529 
some dual I'm be skating this up to

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:56.860 
some dual I'm be skating this up to
reshape<00:05:55.830> the<00:05:55.889> tail<00:05:56.190> because<00:05:56.430> it's<00:05:56.580> really

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
this these will last me well into the

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.709 
this these will last me well into the
spring<00:06:23.310> I<00:06:23.580> believe<00:06:23.819> because<00:06:24.180> I'm<00:06:24.360> in<00:06:24.599> the

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:24.719 
spring I believe because I'm in the

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:27.350 
spring I believe because I'm in the
winter<00:06:24.990> I'm<00:06:25.169> mostly<00:06:25.409> skating<00:06:25.800> indoors<00:06:26.360> where

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
winter I'm mostly skating indoors where

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.279 
winter I'm mostly skating indoors where
it's<00:06:27.719> smooth<00:06:28.440> and<00:06:28.860> decks<00:06:29.099> last<00:06:29.400> really<00:06:29.940> long

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:30.289 
it's smooth and decks last really long

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.959 
it's smooth and decks last really long
so<00:06:31.289> these<00:06:31.620> should<00:06:31.889> be<00:06:32.130> last<00:06:32.370> me<00:06:32.610> a<00:06:32.639> while<00:06:32.729> so
