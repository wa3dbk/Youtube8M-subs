Patrick blank did these wonderful
vertical<00:00:37.770> walls<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.340> thought<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.640> would<00:00:38.730> be<00:00:38.850> a

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
vertical walls we thought it would be a

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.910 
vertical walls we thought it would be a
great<00:00:39.120> opportunity<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.809> showcase<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.819 
anniversary it was very very important I
just<00:00:58.199> think<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.559> was<00:00:58.739> impossible<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.760> use<00:01:00.059> only

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
just think it was impossible to use only

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.090 
just think it was impossible to use only
orchids<00:01:01.829> because<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.910> are<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.660> enhance<00:01:04.589> their

orchids because you are to enhance their
beauty<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:06.030> enhance<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.720> beauty<00:01:06.840> by

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
beauty and you can enhance the beauty by

vertical garden is to me as a scientist

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.300 
vertical garden is to me as a scientist
a<00:01:52.090> way<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.660> introduce<00:01:53.040> biodiversity<00:01:54.040> in

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
a way to introduce biodiversity in

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.400 
a way to introduce biodiversity in
cities<00:01:54.820> because<00:01:55.420> as<00:01:55.600> you<00:01:55.720> explained<00:01:56.110> you<00:01:56.260> can

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
cities because as you explained you can

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.290 
cities because as you explained you can
have<00:01:56.590> so<00:01:57.100> many<00:01:57.280> more<00:01:57.520> different<00:01:57.700> species<00:01:58.090> of

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
have so many more different species of

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.300 
have so many more different species of
plants<00:01:58.750> on<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.080> vertical<00:01:59.290> structure<00:01:59.860> that<00:02:00.190> on

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
plants on the vertical structure that on

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.470 
plants on the vertical structure that on
an<00:02:00.400> original<00:02:00.550> structure<00:02:01.240> like<00:02:01.360> the

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
an original structure like the

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.330 
an original structure like the
traditional<00:02:01.630> way<00:02:02.020> of<00:02:02.050> gardening<00:02:02.500> is<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:02.950> it's

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
traditional way of gardening is and it's

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.680 
traditional way of gardening is and it's
the<00:02:03.520> perfect<00:02:03.670> structure<00:02:04.270> for<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.540> because

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
the perfect structure for that because

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.320 
the perfect structure for that because
of<00:02:04.930> course<00:02:05.140> vertical<00:02:05.950> space<00:02:06.220> is<00:02:06.580> available<00:02:06.820> in

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
of course vertical space is available in

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.150 
of course vertical space is available in
any<00:02:07.510> CD<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.350> world<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.740> maybe<00:02:08.890> especially

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
in New York every rock it shows a little

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.050 
in New York every rock it shows a little
bit<00:02:16.930> different<00:02:17.320> this<00:02:17.980> one<00:02:18.190> is<00:02:18.460> unique<00:02:18.670> in<00:02:18.940> its

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
bit different this one is unique in its

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.570 
bit different this one is unique in its
own<00:02:19.210> way<00:02:19.450> first<00:02:19.840> because<00:02:20.260> you<00:02:20.860> know<00:02:20.980> we<00:02:21.400> have<00:02:21.550> a

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
own way first because you know we have a

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.930 
own way first because you know we have a
lot<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.790> wall<00:02:22.600> art<00:02:22.870> it's<00:02:23.620> about<00:02:23.920> plans<00:02:24.340> really

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
lot of wall art it's about plans really

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.600 
lot of wall art it's about plans really
on<00:02:25.300> walls<00:02:25.630> so<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.620> show<00:02:26.890> itself<00:02:27.220> when<00:02:27.490> you

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
on walls so you the show itself when you

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.310 
on walls so you the show itself when you
come<00:02:27.790> in<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.480> feel<00:02:28.720> like<00:02:28.780> you're<00:02:28.840> more<00:02:29.140> in<00:02:29.260> a
