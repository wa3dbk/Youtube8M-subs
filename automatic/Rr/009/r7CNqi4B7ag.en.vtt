 body and muscle to keep them toned 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.439
 let's start one of the important parts of the body 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.799
 girls this is of course the gluteus maximus 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.280
 of the most basic exercises to lift 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.890
 buttocks we get up in doggy pose bend 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.600
 leg in the knee pull the sock on 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.799
 and make such movements 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.430
 lift your leg up and try 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.470
 keep an angle of 90 degrees and please 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.229
 Try not to just swing the leg and 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.860
 to lift it exactly this muscle to 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.930
 did you feel her 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.500
 exercise number two is also to tighten 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:56.820
 the so-called ears of ours here 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.880
 girls with you parts ozone is exactly like that 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.250
 same as in exercise number one we 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.570
 take out the leg to the side and start 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.340
 lift it up 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.039
 very important to follow so that the foot does not 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:14.430
 came out not forward, not backward, but moved 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:15.930
 clearly exactly one year so here 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.970
 also very important to feel 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.810
 that you have exactly that muscle strain 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.910
 which you need not forward not back we 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.320
 do not fall down and stand exactly and 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:32.970
 raise only the following leg 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:37.050
 exercise on the upper muscles of the buttocks 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.320
 directly here for this to us 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.540
 need to lie on the floor 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.560
 leave the handles in front of you to bend the legs 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.519
 in the knees then take the socks over and 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.519
 do such a mode 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.610
 This is the footing in the summer and feel 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.940
 that you tighten the upper muscles of the buttocks 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.829
 and directly here is the triceps core very 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.200
 it is important to do this exercise as if 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:07.579
 semicircle that is, you should leg 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.049
 go up go down go up 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:13.739
 go down it now I exaggerate what was 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.600
 understand the essence of this exercise again 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:21.750
 it looks like this 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:26.400
 and again we will not fill socks 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:30.330
 handle legs the following exercise on 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.810
 thigh muscle tightening 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.390
 many recommend doing lunges here 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.840
 so that you have movement 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.580
 Forward, I personally understood that for 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.810
 it's a little complicated for me and it goes big 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.970
 load on your knees so much easier 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.970
 do this with legs 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.390
 take sock take about an angle 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:58.530
 45 degrees second leg align on 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:02.070
 level masochka first leg and just 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:06.210
 making movements while gripping the angle 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.930
 90 degrees without falling anywhere 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.580
 knee 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.230
 we squat like this load 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.480
 kneel goes a lot less 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.549
 to strengthen the exercise and strengthen 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.430
 effect you can take the pens small 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.530
 dumbbells but if not under dumbbells gnome 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.330
 You can take and buckets of water and bottles with 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.330
 water and other similar materials

 we did the leg exercise also 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.740
 important female figure is the handle 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.139

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:56.060
 case for this we fit items on 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.039
 which we can well rest against 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:02.180
