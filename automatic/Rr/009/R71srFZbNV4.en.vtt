00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.999
 Hello such people after youtube 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.220
 a long wait finally we were made 

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:09.620
 actually the first trailer of batman and 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.780
 superman in this video we will analyze this 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.019
 first trailer with some curiosities 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.699
 that I could notice good let's start in these 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.980
 first scenes are shown to us 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.140
 superman in a trial class this is 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.849
 owes to the disaster caused in metropolis 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.800
 by the arrival of General Zod and the 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.369
 superman's attempt to protect the 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.230
 humanity 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.509
 apparently they fear how dangerous it is 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.609
 could be superman if it were revealed in his 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.520
 against making him responsible for the 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.469
 disaster caused in the second scene 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.480
 we are shown to bruce and part of the 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.610
 Superman fight against General Zod 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.350
 seen from another angle due to its 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.390
 expressions you can see certain 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.370
 rivalry that is created by seeing so much 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.320
 destruction without control as a note 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.940
 curious this is the same scene in the 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.859
 it shows something for the first time 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.390
 related to batman in the movie 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.520
 man of steel ' 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.530
 then the Batcave is shown to us 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.450
 some vehicles and batman costumes 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.000
 then we see a newspaper with the 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.070
 initials you let your family die 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.960
 it seems this may be the reason why 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.729
 which brush stops being batman in the 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.890
 attempt to save his family from 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.050
 building fire could have failed 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.090
 and see your family die notice that you 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.740
 shows us a suit a bit burned and 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.960
 worn to see this was 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.759
 traumatized and decided to leave the mantle of 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.979
 batman for a while but seeing 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.780
 Superman with this immense power decides 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.399
 to resume being like batman even though 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.369
 some see it as a 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.470
 anti-hero night show us more 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.740
 scenes of superman saving some 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.539
 people if somewhat exaggerated xd and 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.700
 we see a bit of lex luthor next to 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.160
 superman kneeling before him because of 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.899
 your expressions of anger or frustration 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.580
 my mind is weakened because 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.289
 found a way to do it with 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.080
 help of the kryptonite that we were 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.360
 shows later on here we see the 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.220
 body of the general zod this is due to a 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.170
 I try to find a weakness 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.090
 steel man is also said to 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.200
 his DNA departed for the creation of 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.689
 doomsday 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.759
 then we move on to more scenes one in 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.680
 particular shows us a kind of 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.649
 flashback to the murder of the parents of 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.450
 bruce and part of his funeral then we see 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.970
 to the woman wonder and superman 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.190
 supposedly fighting against each other and 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.230
 batman coming to the scene in my opinion 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.390
 they are fighting against done state 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.280
 since as you will remember in the synopsis 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.349
 tells us that batman and superman at the end 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.269
 they would join to fight a threat 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.430
 older as they had already fought 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.349
 previously it seems to me that this is the 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.660
 part where they are already joining forces 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.870
 to beat the threat greater than in 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.940
 this case could be where after 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.799
 this shows us some scenes of 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.630
 action with superman soldiers 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.299
 against batman this to cause 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.549
 expectation and what worked for them 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.650
 last one shows us some scenes of 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.680
 action to then end with batman and 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.390
 superman in front of my opinion this is 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.819
 an excellent trailer and I'm already 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.739
 excited for this movie apparently 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.569
 this cinematic universe looks 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.700
 promising and with great surprises 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.319
 Excuse me if I still do not bring my voice but 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.719
 Well I promise you that I will not be late 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.260
 and your friend from winter here greets you and 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.260
 until next time 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.349
 due to the expectation that caused the 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:16.239
 memes did not wait for many of 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.239
 they and they caused me funny hehe
