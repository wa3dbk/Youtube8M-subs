you should go back to bet fair at across

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.949 
you should go back to bet fair at across
and<00:02:23.530> we've<00:02:23.709> got<00:02:23.969> that's<00:02:24.969> the<00:02:25.450> equivalent<00:02:25.900> of

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
and we've got that's the equivalent of

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.720 
and we've got that's the equivalent of
one<00:02:26.019> hundred<00:02:26.170> one<00:02:26.469> point<00:02:26.739> five<00:02:27.040> girls<00:02:27.400> there

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
one hundred one point five girls there

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.509 
one hundred one point five girls there
and<00:02:28.510> we've<00:02:28.689> got<00:02:28.719> three<00:02:29.139> odds<00:02:29.739> of<00:02:29.980> three<00:02:30.219> point

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
and we've got three odds of three point

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.330 
and we've got three odds of three point
five<00:02:30.849> so<00:02:31.510> if<00:02:31.629> you<00:02:31.750> were<00:02:31.840> trading<00:02:32.139> in<00:02:32.469> incorrect

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
five so if you were trading in incorrect

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.240 
five so if you were trading in incorrect
score<00:02:34.019> and<00:02:35.019> you<00:02:35.349> needed<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:37.739> get<00:02:38.739> out<00:02:38.889> quickly

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.470 
score and you needed to get out quickly
you<00:02:39.579> could<00:02:39.730> bet<00:02:40.030> if<00:02:40.629> you<00:02:40.959> could<00:02:41.079> bet<00:02:41.470> under<00:02:42.480> one

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.830 
because the two markets are not treated
as<00:03:15.729> the<00:03:15.879> same<00:03:15.909> bag<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:19.000> that's<00:03:19.180> an<00:03:19.299> example<00:03:19.389> of

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
as the same bag so that's an example of

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.460 
as the same bag so that's an example of
how<00:03:20.229> we<00:03:20.290> could<00:03:20.620> use<00:03:20.650> an<00:03:21.720> equivalent<00:03:22.720> market<00:03:23.199> to
