00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
hair will blend together into big waves

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.670

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
it blends together very nicely so all I

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.950

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
these curls and that just creates the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.850 
these curls and that just creates the
big<00:03:54.920> wave<00:03:55.760> as<00:03:56.210> you<00:03:56.420> can<00:03:56.780> see<00:03:56.960> from<00:03:57.380> this<00:03:57.650> side
