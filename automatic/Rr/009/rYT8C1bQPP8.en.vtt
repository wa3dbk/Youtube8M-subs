00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.620 
assume you did not buy homes inspection
before<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.230> bought<00:02:04.410> the<00:02:04.530> house<00:02:04.710> no<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:06.270> that's

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
before you bought the house no so that's

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.060 
before you bought the house no so that's
sort<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.870> like<00:02:07.050> doing<00:02:07.410> the<00:02:07.560> trailer<00:02:07.920> before

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070

sort of like doing the trailer before
the<00:02:08.369> horse<00:02:08.610> yeah<00:02:08.880> because<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.630> wrote<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.050> book

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
the horse yeah because I wrote that book

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.020 
the horse yeah because I wrote that book
for<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> reason<00:02:10.890> especially<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.640> houses<00:02:12.000> like

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
for a reason especially in houses like

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.760 
for a reason especially in houses like
this<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.870> hundred<00:02:13.170> years<00:02:13.440> old<00:02:13.620> you're

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
this and a hundred years old you're

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.320 
this and a hundred years old you're
going<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:13.950> be<00:02:14.040> looking<00:02:14.190> at<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:15.090> major

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
going to be looking at the major

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.540 
going to be looking at the major
possibilities<00:02:15.690> I've<00:02:16.500> lead<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.190> more<00:02:17.370> than

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
possibilities I've lead and more than

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.640 
possibilities I've lead and more than
likely<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.300> paint<00:02:18.540> okay

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
likely in the paint okay

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.320 
likely in the paint okay
more<00:02:19.830> than<00:02:19.980> likely<00:02:20.160> because<00:02:20.610> it's<00:02:20.790> original

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
more than likely because it's original

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.500 
more than likely because it's original
now<00:02:21.840> also<00:02:22.170> we<00:02:22.530> have<00:02:22.800> anything<00:02:23.700> before<00:02:23.940> 1980

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
now also we have anything before 1980

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.500 
now also we have anything before 1980
has<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.810> possibility<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.560> 1<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:25.980> 5<00:02:26.220> ratio<00:02:26.820> mix<00:02:27.300> of

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
has a possibility of 1 to 5 ratio mix of

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.740 
has a possibility of 1 to 5 ratio mix of
asbestos<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.710> plaster<00:02:29.370> really<00:02:30.120> okay<00:02:30.480> not

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
asbestos in the plaster really okay not

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.230 
asbestos in the plaster really okay not
to<00:02:31.350> mention<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:31.980> vinyl<00:02:32.310> tiles<00:02:32.580> if<00:02:32.820> you<00:02:32.910> have<00:02:33.030> 9
