can be torn off when dirty Sun tissues
at<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.699> back<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.330> can<00:00:24.510> clean<00:00:24.720> everything

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
at the back so you can clean everything

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.900 
at the back so you can clean everything
out<00:00:25.199> them<00:00:25.410> if<00:00:25.920> you're<00:00:26.160> left-handed<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.789> can

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
out them if you're left-handed you can

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.400 
out them if you're left-handed you can
put<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.150> cable<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.810> handle<00:00:28.109> like<00:00:28.230> this

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
put the cable in the handle like this

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.950 
put the cable in the handle like this
with<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.650> bit<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.830> tape<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.730> set<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.510> too<00:00:30.660> low

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
with a bit of tape and set it on too low

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.110 
with a bit of tape and set it on too low
you're<00:00:31.800> working<00:00:32.130> on<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.340> low<00:00:32.550> temperature

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
you're working on the low temperature

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.010 
you're working on the low temperature
mark<00:00:33.920> now<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:34.980> wax<00:00:35.219> should<00:00:35.460> melt<00:00:35.820> easily<00:00:36.390> but

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
mark now the wax should melt easily but

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.209 
mark now the wax should melt easily but
not<00:00:37.170> be<00:00:37.290> running<00:00:37.590> all<00:00:37.680> over<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.980> place

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
not be running all over the place

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.310 
not be running all over the place
obviously<00:00:38.820> hold<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.149> arm<00:00:39.270> flat<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.960> put<00:00:40.230> it

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
obviously hold the arm flat and put it

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.180 
obviously hold the arm flat and put it
into<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.680> area<00:00:41.100> for<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.790> first<00:00:41.969> experiments

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
into this area for the first experiments

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.590 
into this area for the first experiments
now<00:00:44.190> with<00:00:44.520> one<00:00:44.700> color<00:00:44.969> let's<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.390> look<00:00:45.480> at

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
now with one color let's just look at

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.299 
now with one color let's just look at
the<00:00:45.690> four<00:00:45.899> effects<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.469> smoothing<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.219> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
the four effects of smoothing for the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.410 
the four effects of smoothing for the
horizon<00:00:47.989> lifting<00:00:48.989> for<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.680> foliage<00:00:49.920> effect

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
horizon lifting for the foliage effect

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.520 
horizon lifting for the foliage effect
the<00:00:51.420> edge<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.809> iron<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.110> pushed<00:00:52.379> through

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the edge of the iron is pushed through

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.580 
the edge of the iron is pushed through
to<00:00:53.309> create<00:00:53.430> grasses<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.020> point<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
to create grasses and the point of the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.670 
to create grasses and the point of the
iron<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:56.550> touched<00:00:56.789> into<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> wax

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
iron is just touched into the wax

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.529 
iron is just touched into the wax
touched<00:00:58.680> onto<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> card<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.370> make<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> spot<00:00:59.940> and

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
touched onto the card to make a spot and

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.180 
touched onto the card to make a spot and
then<00:01:00.719> flicked<00:01:01.020> one<00:01:01.199> win<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.530> other<00:01:01.620> for<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
then flicked one win the other for the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.729 
then flicked one win the other for the
bird<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.480> your<00:01:03.629> horizon<00:01:04.140> foliage

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
bird so you have your horizon foliage

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.520 
bird so you have your horizon foliage
and<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.460> details<00:01:05.850> there<00:01:06.810> are<00:01:06.930> four<00:01:07.170> sorts<00:01:07.470> of

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
and the details there are four sorts of

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.060 
and the details there are four sorts of
horizons<00:01:07.979> really<00:01:08.340> flat<00:01:09.090> low<00:01:09.600> hills<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.890> high

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
horizons really flat low hills the high

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.640 
horizons really flat low hills the high
hills<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:12.360> course<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.930> peaky<00:01:13.229> mountains

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
hills and of course the peaky mountains

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.929 
hills and of course the peaky mountains
all<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.430> made<00:01:14.580> with<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> iron

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
all can be made with the iron

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.010 
all can be made with the iron
progression<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.000> landscape<00:01:18.540> goes<00:01:18.780> through

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
progression of landscape goes through

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.679 
progression of landscape goes through
one<00:01:19.200> color<00:01:19.470> two<00:01:19.770> colors<00:01:20.189> some<00:01:20.970> foreground<00:01:21.540> of

one color two colors some foreground of
the<00:01:21.869> sky<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.650> then<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.700> full-blown<00:01:24.479> landscape

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
the sky and then a full-blown landscape

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.410 
the sky and then a full-blown landscape
all<00:01:25.320> made<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> iron<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.880> details<00:01:27.240> are

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
all made with the iron the details are

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.289 
all made with the iron the details are
flowers<00:01:27.689> can<00:01:28.020> then<00:01:28.140> be<00:01:28.320> developed<00:01:29.000> water<00:01:30.000> can

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
flowers can then be developed water can

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.020 
flowers can then be developed water can
be<00:01:30.450> added<00:01:30.810> other<00:01:31.140> things<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:32.040> eventually<00:01:32.729> you

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
be added other things and eventually you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.260 
be added other things and eventually you
come<00:01:33.299> with<00:01:33.450> your<00:01:33.570> full<00:01:33.810> landscape<00:01:34.560> picture

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
come with your full landscape picture

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.340 
come with your full landscape picture
we'll<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> look<00:01:36.600> at<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.780> one<00:01:36.990> right<00:01:37.170> now

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
we'll have a look at this one right now

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.310 
we'll have a look at this one right now
though<00:01:37.579> to<00:01:38.579> start<00:01:38.850> off<00:01:39.000> with<00:01:39.210> you've<00:01:40.049> got<00:01:40.200> to

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
though to start off with you've got to

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.319 
though to start off with you've got to
make<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> sky<00:01:40.799> need<00:01:41.100> lots<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.610> white<00:01:41.880> and

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
make the sky need lots of white and

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.300 
make the sky need lots of white and
we're<00:01:42.630> working<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.950> sort<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.189> an

we're working in a in a sort of an

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.069 
we're working in a in a sort of an
angled<00:01:44.670> direction<00:01:45.240> see<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.509> angle<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.930> the

much colour mind because it's very
strong<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.540> when<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.720> pull<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.500> iron

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
strong so that when you pull the iron

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.980 
strong so that when you pull the iron
across<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.310> point<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.729> at<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> bottom<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.930> as

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
across the point is at the bottom so as

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.200 
across the point is at the bottom so as
not<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.259> get<00:01:55.530> any<00:01:55.770> trailing<00:01:56.310> point<00:01:56.820> marks

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
not to get any trailing point marks

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.990 
not to get any trailing point marks
through<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.079> wax<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:59.219> can<00:01:59.250> go<00:01:59.520> over<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.850> as

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
through the wax you can go over it as

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.030 
through the wax you can go over it as
often<00:02:00.119> as<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.390> like<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:01.290> more<00:02:01.469> often<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.860> go

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
often as you like the more often you go

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.030 
often as you like the more often you go
over<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.369> more<00:02:02.460> mixed-up<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.119> becomes<00:02:03.450> and

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
over it the more mixed-up it becomes and

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.520 
over it the more mixed-up it becomes and
if<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.159> go<00:02:05.310> over<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:06.509> make<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.869> liquid<00:02:07.229> and

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
if you go over it to make it liquid and

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.830 
if you go over it to make it liquid and
warm<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.979> then<00:02:08.310> sort<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.670> swish<00:02:09.270> through<00:02:09.690> it

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
warm and then sort of swish through it

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.930 
warm and then sort of swish through it
that's<00:02:10.200> an<00:02:10.319> angle<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:11.039> can<00:02:11.250> create<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.640> bit

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
that's an angle you can create a bit

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.610 
that's an angle you can create a bit
more<00:02:12.150> direction

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
more direction

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.660 
more direction
so<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.310> get<00:02:14.610> these<00:02:14.760> sort<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.440> oblique<00:02:16.670> paths

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
so you get these sort of oblique paths

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.979 
so you get these sort of oblique paths
of<00:02:18.440> movement<00:02:19.440> in<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.709> sky<00:02:20.510> now<00:02:21.510> using<00:02:21.810> two

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
of movement in the sky now using two

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.470 
of movement in the sky now using two
colors<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.800> olive<00:02:23.010> green<00:02:23.190> number<00:02:23.459> 23<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.360> the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
colors the olive green number 23 and the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.949 
colors the olive green number 23 and the
brown<00:02:24.720> or<00:02:24.750> 45<00:02:25.440> sage<00:02:25.680> green<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.660> number<00:02:27.660> 14

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
brown or 45 sage green and number 14

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.610 
brown or 45 sage green and number 14
Brown<00:02:29.390> load<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.629> part<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.170> iron<00:02:31.319> and

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
Brown load that part of the iron and

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.770 
Brown load that part of the iron and
then<00:02:31.739> smooth<00:02:32.250> gently<00:02:33.090> right<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.660> way<00:02:33.750> across

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
then smooth gently right the way across

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.460 
then smooth gently right the way across
the<00:02:34.200> card<00:02:34.470> back<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.099> across<00:02:36.000> again<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:37.290> that

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
the card back and across again so that

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.160 
the card back and across again so that
you<00:02:37.620> lay<00:02:37.980> on<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.400> color<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.060> at<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:39.989> same

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
you lay on the color and at the same

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.960 
you lay on the color and at the same
time<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.680> create<00:02:40.920> different<00:02:41.220> thicknesses<00:02:41.819> of

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
time you create different thicknesses of

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.000 
time you create different thicknesses of
that<00:02:42.150> color<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.019> gives<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.349> sort<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.650> depth

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
that color so it gives a sort of depth

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.000 
that color so it gives a sort of depth
to<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.310> landscape<00:02:45.260> hold<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.410> card<00:02:46.709> in<00:02:46.860> your

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
to the landscape hold the card in your

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.280 
to the landscape hold the card in your
hand<00:02:47.280> when<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.849> did<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.120> dabbing<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.720> avoid

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
hand when you did the dabbing and avoid

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.050 
hand when you did the dabbing and avoid
touching<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.950> top<00:02:50.190> edge<00:02:50.459> of<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.880> iron

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
touching the top edge of the iron

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.900 
touching the top edge of the iron
otherwise<00:02:52.049> you<00:02:52.200> get<00:02:52.319> arc<00:02:52.530> marks<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.190> then<00:02:53.790> to

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
otherwise you get arc marks and then to

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.120 
otherwise you get arc marks and then to
put<00:02:54.090> in<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.420> color<00:02:54.780> harmony<00:02:55.170> just<00:02:55.500> add<00:02:55.650> colors

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
put in the color harmony just add colors

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.650 
put in the color harmony just add colors
that<00:02:56.250> are<00:02:56.370> in<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.549> sky<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:57.030> already<00:02:57.329> in<00:02:57.510> the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
that are in the sky and already in the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.229 
that are in the sky and already in the
picture<00:02:58.019> like<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.290> brown<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.890> blue<00:02:59.280> sort<00:03:00.180> of

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
picture like the brown a blue sort of

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.229 
picture like the brown a blue sort of
Sri<00:03:00.780> C<00:03:01.019> pink<00:03:01.260> color<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:02.010> dab<00:03:02.489> those<00:03:02.790> on<00:03:03.030> so

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
Sri C pink color and dab those on so

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.270 
Sri C pink color and dab those on so
they<00:03:03.360> blend<00:03:03.629> into<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.110> foreground<00:03:04.349> this

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
they blend into the foreground this

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.940 
they blend into the foreground this
gives<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:05.579> far<00:03:05.819> better<00:03:05.970> color<00:03:06.299> harmony<00:03:06.950> then

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
gives a far better color harmony then

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.039 
gives a far better color harmony then
again<00:03:08.220> using<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.819> edge<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.360> iron<00:03:09.540> make

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
again using the edge of the iron make

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.690 
again using the edge of the iron make
sure<00:03:10.319> that<00:03:10.500> wax<00:03:10.739> doesn't<00:03:10.980> ripple<00:03:11.400> out<00:03:11.519> as

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
sure that wax doesn't ripple out as

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.819 
sure that wax doesn't ripple out as
you're<00:03:11.819> doing<00:03:11.879> this<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:12.329> clean<00:03:12.599> it<00:03:12.720> first<00:03:12.900> just

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
you're doing this so clean it first just

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.009 
you're doing this so clean it first just
slide<00:03:14.129> up<00:03:14.310> through<00:03:14.579> some<00:03:14.940> sort<00:03:15.660> of<00:03:15.690> random

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
just make the spot remember and then

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.250 
just make the spot remember and then
flick<00:03:23.190> one<00:03:23.370> way<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:23.819> the<00:03:23.910> other<00:03:23.940> way<00:03:24.260> again

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.710 
as you can in doing the dots otherwise
it<00:03:33.389> looks<00:03:33.630> a<00:03:33.870> little<00:03:33.989> bit<00:03:34.549> preconceived

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
it looks a little bit preconceived

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.599 
it looks a little bit preconceived
trying<00:03:36.720> too<00:03:36.870> hard<00:03:37.040> once<00:03:38.040> it's<00:03:38.220> cooled<00:03:38.459> down
