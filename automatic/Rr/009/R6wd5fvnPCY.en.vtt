00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
based off of is essentially a paradiddle

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.180 
based off of is essentially a paradiddle
the<00:00:44.510> interesting<00:00:44.960> thing<00:00:45.140> is<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:45.620> first<00:00:45.920> time

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
the interesting thing is the first time

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.009 
the interesting thing is the first time
you<00:00:46.370> play<00:00:46.579> the<00:00:46.609> groove<00:00:46.940> is<00:00:47.180> not<00:00:47.480> going<00:00:47.840> to<00:00:47.930> be

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
you play the groove is not going to be

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.380 
you play the groove is not going to be
the<00:00:48.170> same<00:00:48.410> as<00:00:48.620> when<00:00:49.129> you<00:00:49.280> loop<00:00:49.550> it<00:00:49.760> so<00:00:49.969> we<00:00:50.239> need

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
the same as when you loop it so we need

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.299 
the same as when you loop it so we need
to<00:00:50.510> learn<00:00:50.690> this<00:00:50.960> groove<00:00:51.260> in<00:00:51.500> a<00:00:51.920> way<00:00:52.070> where<00:00:52.280> we

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
to learn this groove in a way where we

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:53.950 
to learn this groove in a way where we
can<00:00:52.579> start<00:00:52.969> it<00:00:53.090> correctly<00:00:53.480> and<00:00:53.750> then

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
can start it correctly and then

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.450 
can start it correctly and then
understand<00:00:54.410> that<00:00:54.559> as<00:00:54.710> we<00:00:54.890> loop<00:00:55.160> it<00:00:55.309> it's

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
understand that as we loop it it's

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.189 
understand that as we loop it it's
actually<00:00:55.820> going<00:00:55.969> to<00:00:56.059> change<00:00:56.179> the<00:00:56.750> second<00:00:57.079> time

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
actually going to change the second time

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.079 
actually going to change the second time

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
around so I'm gonna put the pattern on

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.669 
around so I'm gonna put the pattern on
the<00:00:59.210> screen<00:00:59.300> for<00:00:59.629> the<00:00:59.750> very<00:00:59.989> very<00:01:00.230> first<00:01:00.530> time

rest of the group so the second bar of
this<00:02:17.599> fill<00:02:18.230> would

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
this fill would

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.729 
this fill would
read<00:02:19.069> left<00:02:19.489> left<00:02:19.910> right<00:02:20.180> right<00:02:20.560> left<00:02:21.560> right

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
left left and in B to that left will be

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.750 
left left and in B to that left will be
accented<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.680> then<00:02:24.950> will<00:02:25.069> continue<00:02:25.459> like<00:02:25.640> we

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
accented and then will continue like we

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.430 
accented and then will continue like we
just<00:02:25.910> learned<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.180> first<00:02:26.360> group<00:02:26.629> right<00:02:27.080> left

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
just learned the first group right left

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.430 
just learned the first group right left
right<00:02:27.680> right<00:02:27.860> left<00:02:28.400> right<00:02:29.000> left<00:02:29.209> right<00:02:29.690> so

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
right right left right left right so

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.170 
right right left right left right so
this<00:02:30.680> pattern<00:02:30.920> is<00:02:31.190> very<00:02:31.340> very<00:02:31.580> easy<00:02:31.790> just<00:02:32.090> to

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
this pattern is very very easy just to

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.550 
this pattern is very very easy just to
understand<00:02:32.569> that<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:33.110> way<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:33.500> start

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
understand that the way that you start

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.410 
understand that the way that you start
it<00:02:33.950> is<00:02:34.069> not<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.519> way<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:34.640> you'll<00:02:34.879> continue

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
it is not the way that you'll continue

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.820 
it is not the way that you'll continue
to<00:02:35.450> play<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.810> as<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.080> go<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.470> hopefully

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
to play it as you go and hopefully

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.110 
to play it as you go and hopefully
that'll<00:02:36.980> make<00:02:37.190> sense<00:02:37.220> when<00:02:37.610> we<00:02:37.730> slow<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.090> down

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
that'll make sense when we slow it down

00:02:38.120 --> 00:03:52.550 
that'll make sense when we slow it down
and<00:02:38.420> play<00:02:38.569> it<00:02:38.599> a<00:02:38.690> couple<00:02:38.840> times

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.750
