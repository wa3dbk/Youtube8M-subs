signal goes up no problem no issues I

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.440 
signal goes up no problem no issues I
don't<00:00:40.200> do<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.379> once<00:00:40.590> more<00:00:41.059> but<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.210> time

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
don't do that once more but this time

don't do that once more but this time
I'm<00:00:42.600> not<00:00:42.629> going<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.020> touch<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.230> I'm<00:00:43.559> gonna<00:00:43.680> let

I'm not going to touch it I'm gonna let

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.610 
I'm not going to touch it I'm gonna let
it<00:00:43.980> go<00:00:44.190> completely<00:00:44.840> and<00:00:45.840> do<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> exact<00:00:46.500> same

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
it go completely and do the exact same

test<00:00:54.140> no<00:00:55.140> problem

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
test no problem

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.260 
test no problem
works<00:00:56.100> perfect

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.210 

and<00:01:02.900> just<00:01:03.110> in<00:01:03.230> case<00:01:03.320> anybody<00:01:03.740> thinks<00:01:04.040> I<00:01:04.100> got

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
and just in case anybody thinks I got

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.280 
and just in case anybody thinks I got
anything<00:01:04.370> funky<00:01:04.820> going<00:01:05.060> on<00:01:05.180> here<00:01:05.390> all<00:01:05.750> it's

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
anything funky going on here all it's

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.450 
anything funky going on here all it's
doing<00:01:06.470> is<00:01:06.650> resting<00:01:07.070> on<00:01:07.190> a<00:01:07.220> table<00:01:07.900> that's<00:01:08.900> it

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
doing is resting on a table that's it

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.270 
doing is resting on a table that's it
there's<00:01:10.460> our<00:01:10.580> glass<00:01:10.820> table<00:01:11.240> you<00:01:11.330> can<00:01:11.480> even<00:01:11.630> see

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
there's our glass table you can even see

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.310 
there's our glass table you can even see
that's<00:01:13.280> all<00:01:13.520> it<00:01:13.670> is<00:01:13.810> so<00:01:14.810> let's<00:01:15.020> do<00:01:15.170> this<00:01:15.260> one

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
that's all it is so let's do this one

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.190 
that's all it is so let's do this one
more<00:01:15.500> time<00:01:16.150> see<00:01:17.150> if<00:01:17.270> I<00:01:17.360> can<00:01:17.540> reproduce<00:01:17.810> this

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
more time see if I can reproduce this

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.800 
more time see if I can reproduce this
sometimes<00:01:18.980> I<00:01:19.160> find<00:01:20.980> it<00:01:21.980> does<00:01:22.190> work<00:01:22.400> sometimes

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
sometimes I find it does work sometimes

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.240 
sometimes I find it does work sometimes
not<00:01:23.810> as<00:01:24.080> good<00:01:24.530> as<00:01:24.650> if<00:01:24.800> you<00:01:24.860> didn't<00:01:25.040> have<00:01:25.100> your

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
not as good as if you didn't have your

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.340 
not as good as if you didn't have your
hand<00:01:25.400> there<00:01:25.550> but<00:01:25.730> it<00:01:25.820> will<00:01:26.030> work<00:01:28.990> other<00:01:29.990> times

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
hand there but it will work other times

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.040 
hand there but it will work other times
like<00:01:30.650> right<00:01:30.890> now<00:01:31.330> it<00:01:32.330> can't<00:01:32.630> even<00:01:32.840> get<00:01:33.020> a

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
like right now it can't even get a

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.640 
like right now it can't even get a
signal<00:01:33.470> it's<00:01:33.830> totally<00:01:35.080> dead<00:01:36.080> from<00:01:36.350> what<00:01:36.470> I<00:01:36.500> can

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
signal it's totally dead from what I can

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:46.840 
signal it's totally dead from what I can
see<00:01:37.750> try<00:01:38.750> moving<00:01:38.990> my<00:01:40.240> hand<00:01:41.240> here<00:01:45.400> yep<00:01:46.460> I<00:01:46.580> think

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
see try moving my hand here yep I think

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.880 
see try moving my hand here yep I think
the<00:01:46.970> app<00:01:47.090> actually<00:01:47.390> froze<00:01:48.200> as<00:01:48.470> a<00:01:48.500> matter<00:01:48.770> of

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
the app actually froze as a matter of

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.230 
the app actually froze as a matter of
fact<00:01:49.720> so<00:01:50.720> what<00:01:50.840> I'm<00:01:50.930> gonna<00:01:51.020> do

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
fact so what I'm gonna do

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.520 
fact so what I'm gonna do
oops<00:01:54.610> just<00:01:55.610> kill<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.060> app<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:57.170> do<00:01:57.320> it<00:01:57.410> one

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
oops just kill the app and do it one

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.530 
oops just kill the app and do it one
more<00:01:57.680> time<00:01:59.350> why<00:02:00.350> is<00:02:00.380> that<00:02:00.500> not<00:02:00.740> dying<00:02:01.450> there<00:02:02.450> we

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
more time why is that not dying there we

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:09.700 
more time why is that not dying there we
go

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:21.339 

okay<00:02:11.330> same<00:02:12.330> idea

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.960 

all<00:02:22.349> I'm<00:02:22.650> doing<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:23.040> holding<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.430> bottom<00:02:23.730> left

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
all I'm doing is holding the bottom left

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.790 
all I'm doing is holding the bottom left
so<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.330> does<00:02:27.510> depend<00:02:27.540> how<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.080> hold<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.620> like

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
so it does depend how you hold it like

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.740 
so it does depend how you hold it like
obviously<00:02:29.640> sometimes<00:02:30.060> II<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.239> little<00:02:30.540> bit<00:02:30.630> of

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
obviously sometimes II a little bit of

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.770 
obviously sometimes II a little bit of
signal<00:02:31.340> just<00:02:32.340> before<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.239> couldn't<00:02:33.510> even<00:02:33.569> get

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
signal just before it couldn't even get

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.890 
signal just before it couldn't even get
anything<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:38.760> this<00:02:38.940> would<00:02:39.150> be<00:02:39.269> a<00:02:39.300> usable

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
anything so this would be a usable

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.300 
anything so this would be a usable
signal<00:02:40.110> if<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.410> happen<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.680> pick<00:02:40.800> up<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.010> iPad

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
signal if I happen to pick up the iPad

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.140 
signal if I happen to pick up the iPad
this<00:02:41.550> way<00:02:42.290> just<00:02:43.290> do<00:02:43.380> one<00:02:43.560> more<00:02:43.590> test<00:02:43.950> here<00:02:44.250> try

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
this way just do one more test here try

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.520 
this way just do one more test here try
a<00:02:45.180> little<00:02:45.330> bit<00:02:45.540> different<00:02:45.870> with<00:02:45.959> my<00:02:46.110> placement

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
a little bit different with my placement

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.280 
a little bit different with my placement
of<00:02:46.590> my<00:02:46.620> hand<00:02:46.950> moving<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.459> up<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.610> little<00:02:47.730> bit

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.960 

this<00:02:52.290> would<00:02:52.500> be<00:02:52.590> not<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:52.860> usable<00:02:53.340> version

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
this would be not so usable version

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.400 
this would be not so usable version
again<00:02:54.690> on<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.930> move<00:02:55.580> all<00:02:56.580> of<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.700> sudden<00:02:57.410> presto

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
again on the move all of a sudden presto

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:11.630 
again on the move all of a sudden presto
change-o<00:02:58.890> it's<00:02:59.250> perfect

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.390 

now<00:03:12.640> we'll<00:03:12.850> do<00:03:12.940> one<00:03:13.090> last<00:03:13.270> test<00:03:14.100> with<00:03:15.100> me<00:03:15.220> not

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
now we'll do one last test with me not

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.830 
now we'll do one last test with me not
touching<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.240> should<00:03:16.360> be<00:03:16.480> back<00:03:16.660> to

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
touching it and it should be back to

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:38.260 
touching it and it should be back to
totally<00:03:17.410> normal<00:03:19.140> yo

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.380 

now<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:38.930> real<00:03:39.260> issue<00:03:39.290> with<00:03:39.830> this<00:03:40.240> besides<00:03:41.240> it

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
now the real issue with this besides it

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.780 
now the real issue with this besides it
obviously<00:03:41.750> not<00:03:41.870> working<00:03:42.370> just<00:03:43.370> to<00:03:43.520> show<00:03:43.730> -

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
obviously not working just to show -

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.000 
obviously not working just to show -
there's<00:03:44.450> no<00:03:44.630> tricks<00:03:44.990> going<00:03:45.350> on<00:03:45.500> just<00:03:45.860> a

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
there's no tricks going on just a

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.050 
there's no tricks going on just a
standard<00:03:47.080> iPad<00:03:48.080> and<00:03:48.410> a<00:03:48.680> Griffin<00:03:49.670> case<00:03:49.940> and

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
standard iPad and a Griffin case and

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.880 
standard iPad and a Griffin case and
oops<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.240> accidentally<00:03:53.660> shrunk<00:03:54.140> the<00:03:54.380> speed

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
oops I accidentally shrunk the speed

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.790 
oops I accidentally shrunk the speed
test<00:03:55.130> app<00:03:55.310> there<00:03:56.120> we<00:03:56.210> go<00:03:56.560> but<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.650> real

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
test app there we go but the real

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.290 
test app there we go but the real
problem<00:03:58.070> with<00:03:58.340> this<00:03:58.430> is<00:03:58.610> that<00:03:58.640> when<00:03:59.180> you've

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
problem with this is that when you've

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.240 
problem with this is that when you've
got<00:03:59.330> an<00:03:59.630> iPad<00:03:59.930> it's<00:04:00.200> natural<00:04:00.740> to<00:04:00.860> hold<00:04:01.070> your

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
got an iPad it's natural to hold your

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.320 
got an iPad it's natural to hold your
iPad<00:04:01.610> from<00:04:01.880> the<00:04:02.240> bottom<00:04:02.570> left<00:04:03.160> right<00:04:04.160> and<00:04:04.430> use

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
iPad from the bottom left right and use

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.620 
iPad from the bottom left right and use
your<00:04:05.600> other<00:04:05.870> hand<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:07.030> operate<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.450> now

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
your other hand to operate it now

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.180 
your other hand to operate it now
obviously<00:04:08.780> I'm<00:04:09.020> holding<00:04:09.260> my<00:04:09.350> iPhone<00:04:09.680> but<00:04:09.860> if<00:04:10.040> I

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
obviously I'm holding my iPhone but if I

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.370 
obviously I'm holding my iPhone but if I
had<00:04:10.400> my<00:04:10.610> other<00:04:10.820> hand<00:04:11.090> right<00:04:11.210> there<00:04:11.270> and<00:04:12.140> you

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
had my other hand right there and you

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.870 
had my other hand right there and you
know<00:04:12.470> clicking<00:04:12.800> around<00:04:12.890> doing<00:04:13.250> my<00:04:13.280> thing<00:04:13.580> it's

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
know clicking around doing my thing it's

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.120 
know clicking around doing my thing it's
very<00:04:14.030> natural<00:04:14.360> to<00:04:14.660> hold<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:14.990> that<00:04:15.080> way<00:04:15.260> so<00:04:16.100> I

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
very natural to hold it that way so I

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.350 
very natural to hold it that way so I
don't<00:04:16.430> know<00:04:16.489> how<00:04:16.640> the<00:04:16.700> Apple<00:04:17.239> engineers

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.360 
don't know how the Apple engineers

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.600 
don't know how the Apple engineers
missed<00:04:17.870> this<00:04:18.110> because<00:04:18.290> this<00:04:18.560> is<00:04:18.709> how<00:04:18.830> every

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.610 
missed this because this is how every

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:20.890 
missed this because this is how every
normal<00:04:19.970> human<00:04:20.209> being<00:04:20.360> is<00:04:20.480> probably<00:04:20.720> gonna

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
normal human being is probably gonna

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.410 
normal human being is probably gonna
hold<00:04:21.110> their<00:04:21.799> iPad<00:04:22.400> if<00:04:22.640> they're<00:04:23.090> holding<00:04:23.300> it<00:04:23.330> in

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
hold their iPad if they're holding it in

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.050 
hold their iPad if they're holding it in
landscape<00:04:23.630> mode<00:04:23.930> if<00:04:24.260> they're<00:04:24.380> holding<00:04:24.500> it<00:04:24.740> and

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
landscape mode if they're holding it and

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.710 
landscape mode if they're holding it and
vertical<00:04:26.060> obviously<00:04:26.480> it's<00:04:26.600> a<00:04:26.630> little

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
vertical obviously it's a little

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.540 
vertical obviously it's a little
different<00:04:28.840> yeah<00:04:29.840> I<00:04:30.020> mean<00:04:30.230> the<00:04:30.590> obvious<00:04:31.190> fix

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
different yeah I mean the obvious fix

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.130 
different yeah I mean the obvious fix
some<00:04:31.730> people<00:04:31.910> might<00:04:32.060> see<00:04:32.210> us<00:04:32.300> well<00:04:32.540> geez<00:04:32.840> why

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
some people might see us well geez why

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.540 
some people might see us well geez why
don't<00:04:33.350> you<00:04:33.440> just<00:04:33.650> flip<00:04:33.860> it<00:04:33.980> around<00:04:34.070> if<00:04:34.430> it

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
don't you just flip it around if it

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.460 
don't you just flip it around if it
doesn't<00:04:34.820> do<00:04:34.910> it<00:04:35.030> this<00:04:35.330> way<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:35.750> by<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.020> way<00:04:36.200> it

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
doesn't do it this way and by the way it

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.080 
doesn't do it this way and by the way it
doesn't<00:04:36.770> do<00:04:37.040> it<00:04:37.130> this<00:04:37.250> way<00:04:37.460> if<00:04:37.670> you're<00:04:37.790> holding

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
doesn't do it this way if you're holding

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.050 
doesn't do it this way if you're holding
it<00:04:38.180> bottom<00:04:38.450> by<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:38.690> bottom<00:04:39.850> well<00:04:40.850> yeah

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
it bottom by the bottom well yeah

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.670 
it bottom by the bottom well yeah
basically<00:04:41.390> if<00:04:41.510> you<00:04:41.540> flip<00:04:41.720> it<00:04:41.810> over<00:04:41.930> 180

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
basically if you flip it over 180

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.280 
basically if you flip it over 180
degrees<00:04:43.040> then<00:04:43.670> yeah<00:04:44.210> I'm<00:04:44.660> holding<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:45.110> by<00:04:45.230> the

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
degrees then yeah I'm holding it by the

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.140 
degrees then yeah I'm holding it by the
ball<00:04:45.440> in<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.620> same<00:04:45.800> way<00:04:46.010> it<00:04:46.490> works<00:04:46.700> fine<00:04:46.940> as<00:04:47.120> a

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
ball in the same way it works fine as a

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
ball in the same way it works fine as a
matter<00:04:47.330> of<00:04:47.390> fact<00:04:47.540> I'll<00:04:47.660> demonstrate<00:04:47.870> that

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
matter of fact I'll demonstrate that

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:54.750 
matter of fact I'll demonstrate that
right<00:04:48.500> now

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.450 

exact<00:04:55.760> same<00:04:56.000> kind<00:04:56.300> of<00:04:56.420> holding<00:04:56.840> on<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.050> left

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
exact same kind of holding on the left

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.120 
exact same kind of holding on the left
bottom<00:04:58.460> left<00:04:58.670> rather<00:04:59.440> my<00:05:00.440> thumbs<00:05:00.710> kind<00:05:01.040> of

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
bottom left rather my thumbs kind of

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.480 
bottom left rather my thumbs kind of
blocking<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.560> iPad<00:05:03.560> signal<00:05:03.920> but<00:05:04.070> it<00:05:04.250> doesn't

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
blocking the iPad signal but it doesn't

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.240 
blocking the iPad signal but it doesn't
matter<00:05:04.640> you<00:05:04.790> can<00:05:04.880> see<00:05:05.030> it's<00:05:05.150> perfect<00:05:06.250> totally

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
matter you can see it's perfect totally

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:19.129 
matter you can see it's perfect totally
fine
