00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.290
 ran 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:15.549
 It is Hiromi of Hello Hiro copy lab 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:18.140
 We have reported great progress 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.690
 It is the last video 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:25.300
 that 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:33.160
 and I made a mnp to b mobile's high-speed straight-line plan of 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:35.720
 Hey by the report Tteyuu was irritated without out also that it is the rate per person Once Tsu house 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.310
 I received it but 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:44.350
 After uploading that video 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:47.620
 It is the 27th of February in terms of wintering date 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:52.750
 After waking up in the morning to winter 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:57.640
 I switched lte and 3g and did speed measurement 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:02.480
 And I wonder if slow because lte of the line is crowded also the Tteyuu 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:09.020
 Conversely, using that app web t correct 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:11.060
 If you disable the 3g and pick up the radio wave, maybe the line is open and the speed is fast 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.780
 I thought that I might not be 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.070
 The east to 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.860
 Diligently in I want Well data in I'm tried 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.960
 I downloaded it 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:26.350
 I checked the speed but 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:33.150
 The morning of this 27th Marsa city 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.150
 It is faster Tan towards the 3g is at that time without speed out after all lt 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.640
 Hmm 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.450
 Pop 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.630
 Hmm 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.950
 me 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.170
 goo 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.820
 Hmm 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:53.320
 In Well, from 8 o'clock in the morning 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:55.430
 It's about 8 o'clock in the commute rush hour , so it's about mark g and then 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.680
 Lunch break 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.400
 While everyone in the break time is fiddling with mobile 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.200
 I swear and have accepted 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:10.179
 Then a well 3 o'clock snack time 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:14.730
 In a time of coming home is usually from about 6 am to 7 am 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.730
 In Kedomo I tried to measure wintering speed 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.660
 Hmm 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.460
 Hmm 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.660
 Four days 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.320
 none 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.620
 Hmm 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:35.930
 Now dramatically faster 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:41.480
 I do not know the clear reason why it is the official tweets of that flight mobile 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:45.810
 It is not clear that there is no such report or increased 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:49.380
 Cormorant that over 27 people new from 26 inches 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:55.819
 I can not think at all, but the speed has become faster 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:03:02.269
 Because I live in Tokyo, I'm on the subway Ginza line 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:07.700
 Is a 12-minute o'clock this 9 when measured in the train around the Nihonbashi I 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:09.680
 I got a speed of 25 mbps . 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.609
 It is not great 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.220
 I occasionally from the field containing the b until now 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:19.310
 It is also during commuting 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.150
 I was doing sideway measurement but 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.530
 Come out now 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:28.220
 I think 0.8 eyes were more and more like that 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:34.970
 As soon as it became in the 27 days 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:42.880
 Really this Toka's flexible eyes to really be averaged in I was a peak of the day 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:47.739
 9 No matter how low in had come out about mbps 2.5 eye abnormalities had come out 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:51.079
 This is the last video I 'm out of budget 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:57.319
 Nde did not expect a change in such a dramatic 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:04:03.630
 Shim with voice calls of plastic color version 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:08.100
 3 people have the speed of the descent at 3460 a month 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:10.240
 Transfer and b mobile in but I say Rutte be used in the limit mnp 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.819
 'S 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:19.579
 High-speed boat science with sound plan 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:24.080
 There are times when 15 people or such speed comes out like unlimited with limit just before 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:27.650
 In An'n command and stable-mer for now 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.710
 In the state that the speed of the average ball comes out 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.840
 Lumbar muscle 2,780 yen 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:39.009
 This is a great deal 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:42.830
 My videos say this is stressful if you look at it and suddenly a bar 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:46.370
 Well and b mobile's use people will more and more 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.920
 As of the sash of Yes Kedomo imagine I get pearsall 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:53.070
 Hmm 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:56.550
 I didn't think it would be so good at the moment, so on the way back I 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:05:00.830
 I watched youtube videos but 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:03.550
 At 360 p resolution 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.580
 I saw it nonstop 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.310
 Great 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.360
 Nowadays 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.930
 The time is 2329 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.780
 It is not a time zone that there are a lot of people doing net quite well 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.310
 At a little speed 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.310
 I want to do measurement 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.050
 Yes 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.449
 5.9 mbps 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:40.390
 It will do a lot of people are using Yappa 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:43.420
 30 is also ping wanted to with do you think I during this time 0.8 and enough fast speed mm sec f 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:49.040
 I think that it is considerably faster 4 buildings breath 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:51.920
 Was up to this time moving in that please try to you if good reference 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.740
 I did not think it would change this way 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:58.610
 By say was I thought of the business alliance 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.889
 b mobile 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:06.390
 I N the future is culture 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:13.550
 To say I sold dipped below together with the bio 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:19.880
 Did not want to worry about what Mr. Bio had done to strengthen the facilities to 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:20.889
 Well i 've made b mobile 's investment and that's why I'm upgrading my facilities or now 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.540
 Until 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:29.150
 Because it was late like a fucking fucking 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:31.250
 Is any has become faster stomach There are amended by more users correct the user to change for the worse 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:36.740
 I don't know 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:40.760
 After this 27th I have not felt that speed to hold that much anymore 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:43.529
 All the time rice is whether the ball first Toka 20 people in like this is Hayatokun 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:48.269
 So it has come out that kind of speed 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:50.639
 Kedomo this is I do not know to say whether nationally this speed comes out 

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:57.840
 I am to the park 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:07:01.030
 If you live in the city and try to measure the speed by moving the 23 wards 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.400
 Well that's quite a change 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.990
 mnp a 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:11.540
 If you are looking for a destination 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:16.580
 How is it? If you think that this video was really great, please by all means 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:18.310
 If you have a good button, I'm sorry I gave up quite 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:23.350
 No way these 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:27.970
 It's not a one-shot reversal, but I'm not sure it's going to happen 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:30.420
 Yes first met Tano wing of the video has nothing to do 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.420
 What no 

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:35.379
 I received it but it was lovely 

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:39.790
 I was able to fish 

00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:42.210
 Thank you for watching until the end 

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.210
