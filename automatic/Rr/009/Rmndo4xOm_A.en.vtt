00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.199
 welcome to your channel tutorials and 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.570
 contributions today I will teach you how to 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.090
 recover your micro SD memories 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.860
 hard drives and any device 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.259
 storage that is not damaged 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.300
 physically good to me the problem that 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.219
 this micro sd pulls me is that every time 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.020
 that I connect it makes me slow the pc 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:34.730
 although already formatted a thousand times 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.920
 the same thing always happens to me but today 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.750
 We will solve this problem too 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.329
 We will solve the problem that 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.280
 our usb micro sd or hard drives we 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.670
 appear in this way and do not leave us 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.589
 enter good for this we will use this 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.249
 program the link is in the description 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:54.949
 it is portable and it weighs nothing we open it 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:57.800
 as an administrator this will appear and 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.780
 we give in continue for free we will appear 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.100
 this window with the disks or memories 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.100
 that we have connected 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.630
 come on my pc and see what letter is our 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.630
 memory or disk and we select it 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.090
 and we click on the continue button here 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.430
 will tell us the details of our memory 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.530
 or hard drive we go to the window of 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.530
 the pair and we give in formatting device 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.840
 and we hope it is important not to mark this 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.700
 option formats faster the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.550
 device and it's as if the way you 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.650
 will normally pause the video in what 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.480
 that the process continues 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.480
 the process is almost over 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.900
 where says sector have to wait for 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.229
 that reaches the same amount that has 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.229
 here 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.359
 when the yellow bar is that 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.359
 the process ended 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.810
 once the process is finished we close 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.810
 the program 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.550
 open my pc as you will see the memory or 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.890
 hard disk will appear this way 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.840
 we just have to open our memory or 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.220
 disk and it will ask us to form it time 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.220
 if we do it normally 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.510
 once you finish formatting already 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.510
 we can use our device 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.510
 usually 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.940
 if you have a record with 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.040
 information they want what they need 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.690
 comment and like to upload a 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.800
 tutorial on how to recover these 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.800
 files that we delete 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.400
 well I will show you that after a 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.290
 time the memory or disk continues 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.180
 working normally since I 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.980
 I formatted the memory that will connect and 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.410
 it works even better than how I had it 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.569
