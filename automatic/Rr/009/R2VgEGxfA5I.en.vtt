00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.455
 "Contact with poultry and cancer" 

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:11.439
 Thousands of Americans still die from exposure to asbestos 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:13.785
 decades after its use was greatly reduced. 

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:17.230
 Indeed, cancer has been hidden in the body for several years. 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.012
 We are now in the so-called third wave of asbestos-related diseases. 

00:00:21.012 --> 00:00:24.203
 The first wave was observed in asbestos miners 

00:00:24.203 --> 00:00:25.800
 and began in the 1920s. 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.942
 The second phase involved workers building 

00:00:27.942 --> 00:00:30.017
 ships and buildings that worked with asbestos 

00:00:30.017 --> 00:00:32.900
 it was in the 30s, 40s and 50s. 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.103
 Now with how "asbestos buildings 

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:39.679
 they began to grow old and dilapidate during those sixty years, " 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.553
 only builders are no longer at risk 

00:00:41.553 --> 00:00:45.468
 “There is a theoretical risk of serious exposure to asbestos from the environment 

00:00:45.468 --> 00:00:48.932
 residents, tenants and users of these buildings. 

00:00:48.932 --> 00:00:54.329
 Among them are school children, office workers, maintenance staff and the general public. ” 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.327
 American Academy of Pediatrics, CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) 

00:00:59.327 --> 00:01:03.301
 and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) “assume that over the next 30 years 

00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:06.342
 in the United States appears approximately 

00:01:06.342 --> 00:01:08.951
 1,000 cases of mesothelioma and lung cancer 

00:01:08.951 --> 00:01:13.177
 as a result of exposing asbestos from the school building that occurred in their childhood. " 

00:01:13.177 --> 00:01:16.156
 But it all started with the workers. 

00:01:16.156 --> 00:01:20.920
 How did one insensitively filed internal message from the industry: 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:30.102
 "If you lived a good life while working with asbestos products, why not die for it." 

00:01:30.102 --> 00:01:32.183
 To find out if something is carcinogenic, 

00:01:32.183 --> 00:01:35.457
 you study those who are most exposed to the substance. 

00:01:35.457 --> 00:01:36.797
 So we learned about the potential danger 

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:38.877
 asbestos in the form of its carcinogenicity. 

00:01:38.877 --> 00:01:40.680
 And that's exactly what we learn 

00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:45.000
 on the potential hazards and carcinogenicity of poultry viruses. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.670
 I've been talking about increased mortality for years 

00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:50.910
 of poultry workers. It was related to the chicken cancer viruses they cause 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.690
 warts and can also be transmitted to ordinary people, 

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:59.440
 since it is enough to handle fresh or frozen meat. 

00:01:59.447 --> 00:02:03.070
 Last year I spoke about the biggest study ever done on this subject, 

00:02:03.071 --> 00:02:05.330
 which confirms the findings of three further studies. 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.070
 “Poultry slaughterhouse workers and processors 

00:02:08.073 --> 00:02:11.090
 factories had an increased risk of death from certain cancers. " 

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:14.670
 The latest study among the risks involved 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.160
 with poultry contact has added penis cancer deaths. 

00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:20.830
 This study was conducted on 20,000 poultry workers. 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:25.500
 However, we have a new study involving 30,000 people. 

00:02:25.506 --> 00:02:26.740
 The aim of the study was 

00:02:26.744 --> 00:02:30.280
 "Test the hypothesis that exposure to poultry (cancerous) viruses" 

00:02:30.286 --> 00:02:32.830
 which happens very often with workers, 

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:35.590
 not to mention the general population 

00:02:35.591 --> 00:02:39.150
 “May be associated with an increased risk of death 

00:02:39.154 --> 00:02:41.940
 liver and pancreatic cancer. " 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.270
 They found that the people who beat the chickens 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.660
 they had about 9 times the risk of developing pancreatic cancer and liver cancer. 

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:51.130
 In order to compare it, 

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:53.660
 the most carefully examined risk factor for pancreatic cancer, 

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:56.720
 One of the deadliest types of cancer is smoking cigarettes. 

00:02:56.722 --> 00:03:00.540
 But even if you smoke for over 50 years 

00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:03.910
 you should only double the risk of developing pancreatic cancer. 

00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:05.490
 It seems that people slaughtering chickens 

00:03:05.492 --> 00:03:08.080
 they are exposed to almost 9 times more risk than ordinary people. 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:11.850
 In the case of liver cancer, alcohol is an important risk factor. 

00:03:11.856 --> 00:03:13.840
 Those who consume more than four glasses of alcoholic drink a day 

00:03:13.847 --> 00:03:15.930
 have a triple risk of developing liver cancer, 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.350
 but poultry slaughterhouse workers have compared 

00:03:18.354 --> 00:03:21.110
 the general population even 9 times the risk of this cancer. 

00:03:21.111 --> 00:03:24.220
 There are diseases that only occur in the meat industry worker. 

00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:27.720
 For example, the newly described "disease of salami workers", 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.940
 which affects people who work with a wire brush 

00:03:30.948 --> 00:03:34.010
 8 hours a day of durable sausages 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.180
 with noble white mold on the surface. 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.900
 However, most of the diseases suffered by people working with meat are more universal. 

00:03:40.902 --> 00:03:43.790
 The connection between asbestos and cancer 

00:03:43.798 --> 00:03:45.870
 it was so easy to detect because 

00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:50.580
 that asbestos caused a particularly unusual disease 

00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:52.390
 which was virtually unknown until 

00:03:52.397 --> 00:03:55.820
 asbestos mining and industrial use. 

00:03:55.821 --> 00:03:58.990
 But pancreatic cancer can get poultry workers 

00:03:58.993 --> 00:04:02.970
 is the same pancreatic cancer we could get from smoking cigarettes. 

00:04:02.972 --> 00:04:07.940
 The more difficult it is to discover the cause-and-effect relationship. 

00:04:07.942 --> 00:04:11.850
 Do not expect to see an asbestos-like ban in the near future, 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:25.180
 for example KFC chicken dishes.
