hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:22.680
You know we make many kinds of parathas but each paratha is very unique because of the ingredients what we add to give a nice flavor.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.520
Dear friends today I'm going to show you how to make nice, fantastic, tasty palak paneer paratha

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.620
You know we all love the flavor of palak paneer and all we are doing is trying to get the same flavors into the paratha.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:46.520
For this take finely chopped garlic, the garlic should be so fine because this is going to go as a stuffing to the paratha.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.120
So it should be fine, otherwise the parathas will tear

00:00:50.120 --> 00:01:05.160
In this just add one teaspoon of butter. Add salt, you know be careful when you're adding salt in this because in the butter also there may be salt and even spinach has salt.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:16.240
Add a pinch of salt. In this add aamchur powder, you know to give this little bit of sourness what we need for this paratha and garlic, nutmeg and spinach

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:26.020
So you're going to add a pinch of nutmeg, add little bit of garam masala powder. Just half a teaspoon of garam masala powder should be good.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:35.600
In this add Kasuri methi powder. This will give a very nice buttery flavor to your parathas and chilli powder.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.040
If your going to eat it spicy, add little extra

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.140
You can also add chopped green chillis in this. Just mix all these masala nicely

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:53.200
Hmmm! ahhh! hmmm! The flavor of this butter and this garlic and aamchur powder with this chilli powder itself is fantastic.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.840
Now we are going to add spinach. This spinach has been blanched and chopped.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.480
You know if you make the puree of this spinach it will become watery.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.700
So as a stuffing that's not good, so we're just going to chop them. Just make sure you chop it really fine.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:17.320
And our last ingredient, paneer. Grate the paneer and add. You know the quantity of paneer should be more than the spinach

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.960
so that it gives a very nice texture to the paratha.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:32.560
Now, you know just divide this paneer and palak masala into equal portions and remember one thing; this masala is going to spread as a thin layer in the paratha.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:42.620
So, it should be slightly little more salt than what you normally eat bacause when it is spread in along with the roti; this has to taste good.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.800
Whenever you make this masala, make sure you taste it. Only when this is tasty, your paratha will come out tasty.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:59.900
The dough for this paratha has to be super soft, you know because the masala that is going to go inside that is also soft and also the size of the dough

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.040
should be smaller than the size of the masala that is when your palak paneer paratha is going to be very tasty.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:14.380
Now with the help of just little flour just make the edges thin of this dough. If you want you can also use the rolling pin.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:24.760
Ok. And make the edges thin. Now put this masala inside and pull the edges together.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:36.320
And if there is any extra dough just remove the extra dough and you'll have a perfect paratha.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.880
While rolling the paratha do not use too much of flour. Some people make the mistake of adding too much flour.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:53.440
You know, you just need flour so that this dough doesn't stick to the table where you're rolling but if it is too much, you know this flour when moved onto the hot pan will burn and wont look good

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.080
So use as little flour as possible and the roll them and now; this is perfect.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.880
And now both sides this is perfect.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:13.600
Look at this. And you should be able to see little bit green dots on it all over. That's when you have spread the dough nicely and the masala inside is also evenly distributed.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:25.800
Now just put this on a hot tava, ok. You cook it on both sides, till you get the nice golden dots and then we're going to apply butter.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:36.720
Now, you know look at this. Make sure, you know that you cook well on both sides. You need to get these golden dots that will make this paratha look good

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:46.520
and also look at both sides. Once this is nicely cooked apply little bit of butter and then this will become super and super tasty.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:58.240
Dear friends I'm telling you this is one of the best parathas. But do not forget if you don't add garlic, if you don't add nutmeg, if you don't add kasuri methi it's not going to be super awesome.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.820
Vahchef style paratha if you want to really enjoy it, make sure you add all of them and then you'll get perfect paratha.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:14.660
You know just look at the paratha, how much they puff up and steam. But the aroma is what I have to die for. Wow!

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:23.660
Fantastic! This palak paneer paratha, trust me I call them orgasmic parathas They are super super yummy. Super tasty.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.960
I'm telling you, you don't need pickle, you don't need dahi, you don't need anything. Love love is what this paratha will give you.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:46.500
Hmmm! Vah! This is super. Super super yummy! wow wow wow

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:59.760
