00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
twisty puzzle the dodge 'ok ultimate now

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.420 
twisty puzzle the dodge 'ok ultimate now
at<00:00:15.179> first<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:15.809> looks<00:00:16.080> just<00:00:16.470> like<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:17.070> normal

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
at first this looks just like a normal

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.170 
at first this looks just like a normal
dodging<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.770> also<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.920> first<00:00:20.160> turns<00:00:20.520> like<00:00:21.150> a

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
dodging and also it first turns like a

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.620 
dodging and also it first turns like a
Norman<00:00:21.510> tajuk<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:21.990> have<00:00:22.140> these<00:00:22.320> corner<00:00:22.830> terms

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
Norman tajuk we have these corner terms

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.849 
Norman tajuk we have these corner terms
like<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:26.720> but<00:00:27.720> this<00:00:27.900> puzzle<00:00:28.289> does<00:00:28.439> not<00:00:28.619> do

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
like this but this puzzle does not do

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.010 
like this but this puzzle does not do
tip<00:00:29.189> turns<00:00:29.689> but<00:00:30.689> instead<00:00:31.700> it<00:00:32.700> has<00:00:33.090> these<00:00:33.420> deep

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
tip turns but instead it has these deep

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:44.779 
tip turns but instead it has these deep
turns<00:00:36.140> like<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:42.500> so<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.530> combines<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.550> cuts

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
turns like this so it combines the cuts

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.119 
turns like this so it combines the cuts
of<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> pen<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.390> ultimate<00:00:45.750> which<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.950> deep

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
of the pen to ultimate which is the deep

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.479 
of the pen to ultimate which is the deep
cut<00:00:47.370> right<00:00:47.550> here<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:49.530> cuts<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.280> dodge

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
cut right here and the cuts of the dodge

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.920 
cut right here and the cuts of the dodge
'ok<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:51.539> cut<00:00:51.870> right<00:00:52.079> here<00:00:53.539> hence<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.750> name

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
'ok this cut right here hence the name

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.400 
'ok this cut right here hence the name
tajuk<00:00:55.680> ultimate<00:00:59.570> and<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.780> lets<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.079> see<00:01:01.320> it

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
tajuk ultimate and that lets you see it

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:10.760 
tajuk ultimate and that lets you see it
very<00:01:01.559> clearly<00:01:08.930> this<00:01:09.930> puzzle<00:01:10.260> has<00:01:10.380> taken<00:01:10.710> me

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
very clearly this puzzle has taken me

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.429 
very clearly this puzzle has taken me
several<00:01:11.040> months<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:12.180> complete<00:01:12.409> starting<00:01:13.409> from

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
several months to complete starting from

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.010 
several months to complete starting from
the<00:01:13.650> design<00:01:13.920> process<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:15.689> was<00:01:15.810> very

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
the design process and it was very

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.170 
the design process and it was very
difficult<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.710> figure<00:01:16.860> out<00:01:17.159> how<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:18.119> a

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
difficult to figure out how to get a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.660 
difficult to figure out how to get a
mechanism<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.590> puzzle<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.400> make<00:01:20.520> it

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
mechanism for this puzzle to make it

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.530 
mechanism for this puzzle to make it
work<00:01:21.170> this<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.350> due<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.680> problem<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.540> these

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
work this is due to the problem of these

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.609 
work this is due to the problem of these
pieces<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.790> deep<00:01:26.970> cuts<00:01:27.409> now<00:01:28.409> one

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
pieces here and the deep cuts now one

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.429 
pieces here and the deep cuts now one
could<00:01:28.920> theoretically<00:01:29.549> build<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.630> puzzle<00:01:31.079> by

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
could theoretically build this puzzle by

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.319 
could theoretically build this puzzle by
starting<00:01:31.799> with<00:01:31.920> an<00:01:32.070> internal<00:01:32.549> pent<00:01:32.790> ultimate

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
starting with an internal pent ultimate

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.950 
starting with an internal pent ultimate
or<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.560> case<00:01:34.670> Ghostman<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.960> then

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
or in this case Ghostman and then

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.140 
or in this case Ghostman and then
building<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.470> mega<00:01:37.829> mix<00:01:38.130> layer<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.670> top<00:01:38.700> and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
building a mega mix layer on top and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.990 
building a mega mix layer on top and
hiding<00:01:39.600> some<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.930> pieces<00:01:40.759> this<00:01:41.759> would

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
hiding some of the pieces this would

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.410 
hiding some of the pieces this would
result<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:43.170> Dodger<00:01:43.530> Goldsmith<00:01:44.420> but

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
result in the Dodger Goldsmith but

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.350 
result in the Dodger Goldsmith but
there's<00:01:46.350> one<00:01:46.590> problem<00:01:46.649> with<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.360> because

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
there's one problem with that because

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.719 
there's one problem with that because
these<00:01:48.810> centres<00:01:49.170> triangles<00:01:49.710> are<00:01:49.860> isolated<00:01:50.610> by

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
these centres triangles are isolated by

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.030 
these centres triangles are isolated by
these<00:01:50.909> deep<00:01:51.149> cuts<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:52.049> could<00:01:52.259> simply<00:01:52.500> remove

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
these deep cuts you could simply remove

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.370 
these deep cuts you could simply remove
them<00:01:53.340> with<00:01:54.000> these<00:01:54.210> if<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:55.170> use<00:01:55.350> that

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
them with these if you use that

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.609 
them with these if you use that
mechanism<00:01:56.329> so<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.390> can't<00:01:57.719> build<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.439> way

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
mechanism so you can't build it that way

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.429 
mechanism so you can't build it that way
you<00:01:58.829> have<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.369> include<00:01:59.759> a<00:02:00.060> middle<00:02:00.780> layer<00:02:00.990> under

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
you have to include a middle layer under

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.410 
you have to include a middle layer under
here<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.799> hold<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.939> these<00:02:03.060> centres

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
here to hold on to these centres

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.459 
here to hold on to these centres
triangles<00:02:05.719> but<00:02:06.719> then<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:06.990> raises<00:02:07.350> another

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
triangles but then this raises another

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.559 
triangles but then this raises another
problem<00:02:08.009> if<00:02:08.129> we<00:02:08.459> have<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.819> hidden<00:02:09.090> middle<00:02:09.390> layer

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
problem if we have a hidden middle layer

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.730 
problem if we have a hidden middle layer
how<00:02:10.050> do<00:02:10.110> we<00:02:10.289> stop<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.560> from<00:02:10.800> miss<00:02:10.950> aligning

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
how do we stop it from miss aligning

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.100 
how do we stop it from miss aligning
this<00:02:13.670> has<00:02:13.850> been<00:02:13.970> an<00:02:14.090> ongoing<00:02:14.210> problem<00:02:14.600> for<00:02:14.900> a

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
this has been an ongoing problem for a

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.350 
this has been an ongoing problem for a
very<00:02:15.410> long<00:02:15.590> time<00:02:15.650> is<00:02:16.190> if<00:02:16.730> we're<00:02:16.910> building<00:02:17.270> a

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
very long time is if we're building a

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.250 
very long time is if we're building a
four-layer<00:02:18.020> corner<00:02:18.860> turning<00:02:19.070> icosahedron

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
four-layer corner turning icosahedron

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.560 
four-layer corner turning icosahedron
like<00:02:21.260> this<00:02:21.560> how<00:02:22.400> do<00:02:22.460> we<00:02:22.640> stop<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.330> inter

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
like this how do we stop the inter

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.890 
like this how do we stop the inter
middle<00:02:23.840> layer<00:02:23.960> from<00:02:24.110> misalign<00:02:25.240> well<00:02:26.240> I<00:02:26.480> have

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
middle layer from misalign well I have

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.520 
middle layer from misalign well I have
found<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.350> way<00:02:27.500> it's<00:02:28.310> my<00:02:28.520> own<00:02:28.670> unique<00:02:28.880> mechanism

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
found a way it's my own unique mechanism

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.000 
found a way it's my own unique mechanism
so<00:02:30.530> I'm<00:02:30.620> very<00:02:30.860> very<00:02:31.100> excited<00:02:32.860> now<00:02:33.860> this

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
so I'm very very excited now this

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.160 
so I'm very very excited now this
mechanism<00:02:34.400> isn't<00:02:34.670> actually<00:02:34.940> completely<00:02:35.900> of

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
mechanism isn't actually completely of

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.040 
mechanism isn't actually completely of
my<00:02:36.320> own<00:02:36.500> I've<00:02:36.680> inspired<00:02:37.540> by<00:02:38.540> some<00:02:38.870> other

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
my own I've inspired by some other

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.580 
my own I've inspired by some other
puzzles<00:02:39.650> that<00:02:39.710> have<00:02:39.950> existed<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:41.510> are<00:02:42.410> kind

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
puzzles that have existed that are kind

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.790 
puzzles that have existed that are kind
of<00:02:42.620> like<00:02:42.740> this<00:02:42.920> but<00:02:43.850> if<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:44.360> think<00:02:44.390> about<00:02:44.780> an<00:02:45.170> X

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
of like this but if you think about an X

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.440 
of like this but if you think about an X
cubed<00:02:46.340> for<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:48.500> might<00:02:48.650> be<00:02:48.800> able<00:02:48.890> to

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
cubed for you might be able to

00:02:49.450 --> 00:03:03.220 
cubed for you might be able to
understand<00:02:50.450> how<00:02:50.630> this<00:02:50.780> works<00:03:02.050> now<00:03:03.050> this

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
understand how this works now this

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.340 
understand how this works now this
puzzle<00:03:03.620> turns<00:03:03.800> very<00:03:04.130> very<00:03:04.520> well<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:06.080> outer

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
puzzle turns very very well the outer

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.760 
puzzle turns very very well the outer
corner<00:03:07.070> turns<00:03:07.280> are<00:03:07.430> extremely<00:03:08.000> smooth<00:03:08.360> and

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
corner turns are extremely smooth and

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.010 
corner turns are extremely smooth and
easy<00:03:09.770> to<00:03:10.010> turn<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.520> the<00:03:10.940> deep<00:03:11.120> cut<00:03:11.360> turns<00:03:11.690> are

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
easy to turn and the deep cut turns are

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.200 
easy to turn and the deep cut turns are
also<00:03:12.320> very<00:03:12.830> smooth<00:03:13.160> they're<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:13.760> little<00:03:13.970> bit

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
also very smooth they're a little bit

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.820 
also very smooth they're a little bit
stiffer<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:14.660> they<00:03:14.900> have<00:03:15.050> a<00:03:15.080> slight<00:03:15.500> tendency

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
stiffer and they have a slight tendency

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.470 
stiffer and they have a slight tendency
to<00:03:16.340> lock<00:03:16.640> up<00:03:18.280> but<00:03:19.280> due<00:03:19.460> to<00:03:19.490> so<00:03:19.880> much<00:03:20.060> internal

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
to lock up but due to so much internal

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.170 
to lock up but due to so much internal
complexity<00:03:21.080> in<00:03:21.170> this<00:03:21.320> puzzle<00:03:21.560> I'm<00:03:21.970> not<00:03:22.970> really

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
complexity in this puzzle I'm not really

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.290 
complexity in this puzzle I'm not really
surprised<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:23.930> be<00:03:23.990> honest<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.940> kind<00:03:26.240> of

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
surprised to be honest that kind of

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.480 
surprised to be honest that kind of
locking<00:03:26.660> up<00:03:26.780> is<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:27.020> be<00:03:27.110> expected<00:03:27.350> but<00:03:28.280> for

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
locking up is to be expected but for

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.310 
locking up is to be expected but for
what<00:03:28.520> it<00:03:28.820> is<00:03:28.850> this<00:03:29.240> turns<00:03:29.570> extremely

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
what it is this turns extremely

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:37.720 
what it is this turns extremely
extremely<00:03:30.860> well<00:03:35.500> so<00:03:36.500> I<00:03:36.830> couldn't<00:03:37.400> be<00:03:37.550> happier

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
extremely well so I couldn't be happier

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.810 
extremely well so I couldn't be happier

to be honest with this puzzle now this

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.210 
to be honest with this puzzle now this
puzzle<00:03:44.210> is<00:03:44.330> very<00:03:44.990> very<00:03:45.500> very<00:03:46.100> complex<00:03:46.580> inside

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220

this<00:03:49.220> puzzle<00:03:49.700> has<00:03:49.850> only<00:03:50.060> 80<00:03:50.390> outer<00:03:50.810> pieces

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
this puzzle has only 80 outer pieces

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.780 
this puzzle has only 80 outer pieces
that<00:03:51.530> are<00:03:51.620> visible<00:03:52.360> to<00:03:53.360> the<00:03:53.570> viewer<00:03:54.490> so<00:03:55.490> that's

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
that are visible to the viewer so that's

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.690 
that are visible to the viewer so that's
only<00:03:56.060> 80<00:03:56.750> pieces<00:03:57.110> and<00:03:57.470> this<00:03:58.010> puzzle<00:03:58.340> also<00:03:58.550> has

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
only 80 pieces and this puzzle also has

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.580 
only 80 pieces and this puzzle also has
one<00:03:58.910> of<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.120> lowest<00:03:59.420> visibility<00:04:00.350> factors

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
one of the lowest visibility factors

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.090 
one of the lowest visibility factors
ever<00:04:01.190> at<00:04:01.610> only<00:04:02.450> around<00:04:02.690> 15<00:04:03.230> points<00:04:03.680> seven

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
ever at only around 15 points seven

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.930 
ever at only around 15 points seven
percent<00:04:04.790> and<00:04:05.440> from<00:04:06.440> there<00:04:06.710> I<00:04:06.920> can<00:04:07.550> leave<00:04:07.700> it<00:04:07.820> to

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
percent and from there I can leave it to

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.610 
percent and from there I can leave it to
you<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.180> figure<00:04:08.360> out<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:08.870> number<00:04:09.020> of<00:04:09.320> the

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
you to figure out the number of the

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.970 
you to figure out the number of the
total<00:04:09.920> number<00:04:10.190> of<00:04:10.220> pieces<00:04:10.840> it's<00:04:11.840> a<00:04:12.110> lot<00:04:12.620> and

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
total number of pieces it's a lot and

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:30.149 
total number of pieces it's a lot and
trust<00:04:13.400> me<00:04:13.490> it's<00:04:13.730> well<00:04:14.180> over<00:04:14.660> 200<00:04:16.660> so<00:04:17.799> yeah

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:30.159 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:32.830 

this<00:04:31.159> puzzle<00:04:31.520> does<00:04:31.699> require<00:04:32.150> a<00:04:32.270> little<00:04:32.509> bit<00:04:32.659> of

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
this puzzle does require a little bit of

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.189 
this puzzle does require a little bit of
wiggling<00:04:33.080> sometimes<00:04:33.970> but<00:04:34.970> once<00:04:35.870> it's<00:04:36.050> aligned

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
wiggling sometimes but once it's aligned

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:42.309 
wiggling sometimes but once it's aligned
it<00:04:37.039> goes<00:04:37.280> very<00:04:37.520> very<00:04:37.669> smoothly<00:04:40.930> but<00:04:41.930> great

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:42.319 
it goes very very smoothly but great

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.399 
it goes very very smoothly but great
thing<00:04:42.620> is<00:04:42.830> there<00:04:43.759> are<00:04:43.789> no<00:04:44.080> misalignments<00:04:45.080> with

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:45.409 
thing is there are no misalignments with

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:48.249 
thing is there are no misalignments with
the<00:04:45.560> middle<00:04:45.800> layers<00:04:46.030> so<00:04:47.030> my<00:04:47.180> mechanism<00:04:47.750> works

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
the middle layers so my mechanism works

00:04:48.259 --> 00:05:01.570 
the middle layers so my mechanism works
very<00:04:48.590> very<00:04:48.740> well<00:04:59.409> this<00:05:00.409> puzzle<00:05:00.830> is<00:05:00.919> 55

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
very very well this puzzle is 55

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.070 
very very well this puzzle is 55
millimeters<00:05:02.090> to<00:05:02.240> an<00:05:02.330> edge<00:05:02.509> I<00:05:02.780> originally

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
millimeters to an edge I originally

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.619 
millimeters to an edge I originally
designed<00:05:03.500> it<00:05:03.860> at<00:05:04.039> a<00:05:04.310> 50<00:05:04.879> millimeter<00:05:05.060> to<00:05:05.539> an

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:05.629 
designed it at a 50 millimeter to an

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:07.360 
designed it at a 50 millimeter to an
edge<00:05:05.750> scale<00:05:06.110> but<00:05:06.379> I<00:05:06.530> soon<00:05:06.770> realized<00:05:07.250> that

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
edge scale but I soon realized that

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.180 
edge scale but I soon realized that
would<00:05:07.610> be<00:05:07.759> absurd<00:05:08.240> for<00:05:09.139> the<00:05:09.560> complexity<00:05:10.159> of

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
would be absurd for the complexity of

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.580 
would be absurd for the complexity of
the<00:05:10.370> puzzles<00:05:10.490> so<00:05:10.849> I<00:05:10.879> chose<00:05:11.210> a<00:05:11.270> 55<00:05:12.110> millimeter

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
the puzzles so I chose a 55 millimeter

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.649 
the puzzles so I chose a 55 millimeter
version<00:05:12.979> instead<00:05:13.310> and<00:05:13.520> this<00:05:14.330> is<00:05:14.449> actually

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:14.659 
version instead and this is actually

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:18.909 
version instead and this is actually
version<00:05:15.409> 2.5<00:05:16.539> the<00:05:17.539> version<00:05:17.930> 1<00:05:18.169> the<00:05:18.650> middle

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
version 2.5 the version 1 the middle

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.990 
version 2.5 the version 1 the middle
layer<00:05:19.039> misaligned<00:05:19.639> the<00:05:20.569> version<00:05:20.930> 2<00:05:21.199> it<00:05:22.129> worked

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
layer misaligned the version 2 it worked

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.769 
layer misaligned the version 2 it worked
but<00:05:23.930> there<00:05:24.830> were<00:05:25.069> some<00:05:25.400> issues<00:05:25.610> with<00:05:26.180> the

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:26.779 
but there were some issues with the

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:28.659 
but there were some issues with the
middle<00:05:27.349> delayer<00:05:27.740> just<00:05:27.949> sliding<00:05:28.370> around<00:05:28.520> a

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
middle delayer just sliding around a

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.209 
middle delayer just sliding around a
little<00:05:28.969> too<00:05:29.180> much<00:05:29.419> there<00:05:30.380> was<00:05:30.469> too<00:05:30.710> much<00:05:30.889> play

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:31.219 
little too much there was too much play

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:36.189 
little too much there was too much play
but<00:05:31.669> this<00:05:31.880> version<00:05:32.289> 2.5<00:05:33.289> is<00:05:33.620> just<00:05:34.120> amazing<00:05:35.199> I

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:36.199 
but this version 2.5 is just amazing I

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:38.469 
but this version 2.5 is just amazing I
call<00:05:36.770> it<00:05:36.800> 2.5<00:05:37.069> because<00:05:37.819> it's<00:05:37.969> really<00:05:38.029> the<00:05:38.240> same

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
call it 2.5 because it's really the same

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:39.730
