00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.020
 peking the most relevant elements of this new proposal that we launched 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.700
 market are on the one hand the device itself and on the other the 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.750
 show and curazao and that's where both are what we call internally 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.929
 user experience platform this means this 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:26.090
 the user experience platform seeks to provoke a smile in the 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.359
 end consumer through the software surprising him with something new that he does not 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.169
 I expected 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.719
 dubai may and another one in a really fun device use and 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:35.890
 simple 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.300
 power is eternal and you know what makes up the experience platform 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.540
 of the user good different elements is the device and something more than what 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.380
 makes it really unique this would achieve the meaning we've designed 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.870
 unique applications leveraging smart terminal capabilities 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.300
 that really unify both praise and communications 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.100
 in a single application surprisingly simple to use insisted on spa 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.020
 but that vision louis that in this subject 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.010
 we call these applications 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.340
 ta is to discuss means that exist you can see how impressive it is 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.630
 becomes the experience of using a mobile terminal when using them with your 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.750
 bet 26 was the basis of all this is to establish 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.070
 a good connection between the product and what consumers demand in the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.890
 present in secret but again referred to facts 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.810
 in this way social networks are integrated 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.390
 like facebook and twitter being also very easy to alternate between both p alex 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.670
 walsh experience also includes other communications 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.369
 like emails calls 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.110
 Text or multimedia messages 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.440
 all this is feasible because the applications are integrated within 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.850
 Of the device 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.659
 and thanks to the work done, the way in which the 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.760
 user interacts with the terminal ie the graphic form in which 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.320
 present communications are completely differentiating and unique 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.130
 like this is my country with these new sony ericsson products 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.340
 and specifically with hesperia x10 we are going to provide 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.660
 it's a graphic experience like you've never seen in the sector versions of the 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.840
 defense ni ericsson is a mass mahersa and that is the philosophy with which we have 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.010
 developed our products trying to give the best of us 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.040
 giving the possibility to the consumer 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.170
 to decide what use they want to give to our phones and offering them the 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.060
 perfect device for it this open-mindedness applies to everything 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.090
 what we do in sony ericsson we unite the new communities that are formed 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.879

 and we provide the perfect product and the best experience 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.979
 this is what we do in sony ericsson and it will be in the hands of our clients 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:45.869
 for the first time in the first quarter of 2010 photo flask 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:59.889
 this experience that is going to be the main product of the market in the 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.069
 first half of 2010 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.189
 great efforts are being made to provide a tool for 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.859
 entertainment adapted to modern life 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.779
 nowadays we all receive facebook updates poster 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:17.249
 our friends in addition to emails, text messages and other 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:21.730
 communications but you have to use too many applications to access 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:23.519
 this information 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.480
 walk now imagine get all the communications in a single window and that 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.120
 this one is 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.850
 emotive visual personal so that for example can be seen in the image of 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.249
 the person who is sending us a message 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.419
 little bit 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.639
 medias that shows you the multimedia content of your terminal 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:46.339
 in a very visual way on the desktop but also integrates content from 

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:51.169
 internet and that means that when listening to a song if you want to know something else 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.349
 about the artist the device will allow you with a single click to obtain 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.899
 more information and enjoy other alternatives instantly 

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:59.959
 entertainment 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.799
 seem to be legion another feature of this product is what 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.999
 that we call automatic face recognition for example we label a 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:13.849
 friend that appears in a photograph and we add a man 6 every time the 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.489
 Phone finds is clear in a photograph without the need to make 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.219
 no action will establish an automatic linkage after a 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:23.110
 brief romance 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.900
 so when I look for pictures of my friend the phone will show 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.379
 all your photos even those that have not been previously labeled 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:33.440
 the real 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.440
 it is an extremely useful and very surprising tool 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.490
 all this is based on a very powerful jaguar a disaster chip and where a 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.490
 gigabyte a 4-inch touch screen 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.210
 connection since 3com to 5 millimeters of a church 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.540
 It was this cello cellar if we read the press emery memory card sd mons hours 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.300
 after fleeing 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.490
 for sanÃ¡ 11 avn it's a shame to confess that I'm dying of desire for 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.100
 phone utilities but 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.770
 we will have to wait a bit we are all looking forward to using the new text and day 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:08.599
 x day 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:09.229
 thank you
