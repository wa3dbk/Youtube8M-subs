face<00:00:59.370> bolts<00:00:59.730> he<00:01:00.719> gave<00:01:00.840> me<00:01:00.930> some<00:01:01.050> information

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
face bolts he gave me some information

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.219 
face bolts he gave me some information
that<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.739> wasn't<00:01:01.949> aware<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.399> such<00:01:02.969> as<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.899> metal

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
that I wasn't aware of such as the metal

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.020 
that I wasn't aware of such as the metal
face<00:01:04.409> tools<00:01:04.769> were<00:01:05.010> heavier<00:01:05.430> than<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> metal

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
face tools were heavier than the metal

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.260 
face tools were heavier than the metal
face<00:01:06.180> ones<00:01:06.479> here<00:01:07.460> but<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.490> decided<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.119> go<00:01:09.240> for

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
face ones here but I decided to go for

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.990 
face ones here but I decided to go for
the<00:01:09.450> metal<00:01:09.630> face<00:01:09.780> ones<00:01:10.020> anyway<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:11.670> reason

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
the metal face ones anyway the reason

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.750 
the metal face ones anyway the reason
why<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.210> because<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:13.890> metal<00:01:14.130> face<00:01:14.310> tubes<00:01:14.580> may

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
why is because the metal face tubes may

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.539 
why is because the metal face tubes may
be<00:01:14.820> heavier<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.650> think<00:01:16.650> they're<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:18.770> 5<00:01:19.770> point

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
be heavier I think they're like 5 point

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.700 
be heavier I think they're like 5 point
something<00:01:21.330> grams<00:01:22.820> versus<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.630> one's<00:01:24.900> only

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
something grams versus this one's only

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.969 
something grams versus this one's only
like<00:01:25.830> four<00:01:26.250> point<00:01:26.520> something<00:01:29.060> yeah<00:01:30.060> well<00:01:30.979> but

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
like four point something yeah well but

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.340 
like four point something yeah well but
while<00:01:32.159> according<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.670> Kira's<00:01:33.450> daddy<00:01:33.689> checking

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
while according to Kira's daddy checking

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.160 
while according to Kira's daddy checking
out<00:01:34.439> his<00:01:34.560> page<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:35.070> some<00:01:35.189> information<00:01:35.460> I

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
out his page for some information I

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.270 
out his page for some information I
think<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.229> was<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.380> cure<00:01:37.530> daddy<00:01:37.829> yeah<00:01:38.100> he<00:01:38.189> had

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
think it was a cure daddy yeah he had

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.100 
think it was a cure daddy yeah he had
some<00:01:38.400> pretty<00:01:38.579> good<00:01:38.729> stuff<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.420> think<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.020> was

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
some pretty good stuff so I think I was

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.410 
some pretty good stuff so I think I was
checking<00:01:40.259> his<00:01:40.490> page<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:41.700> some<00:01:41.820> information

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
checking his page for some information

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.899 
checking his page for some information
and<00:01:42.600> some<00:01:42.659> respects<00:01:43.399> the<00:01:44.399> reason<00:01:44.640> why<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.759> went

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
and some respects the reason why I went

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.510 
and some respects the reason why I went
with<00:01:45.060> metal<00:01:45.450> face<00:01:45.630> ones<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.110> because<00:01:46.369> you<00:01:47.369> only

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
with metal face ones is because you only

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.539 
with metal face ones is because you only
get<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.000> 5<00:01:48.450> point<00:01:48.840> whatever<00:01:49.140> grams<00:01:49.890> weight<00:01:50.310> on

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
get the 5 point whatever grams weight on

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.160 
get the 5 point whatever grams weight on
the<00:01:50.729> metal<00:01:50.970> feast<00:01:51.149> whose<00:01:51.390> if<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.720> connect<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the metal feast whose if you connect the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.819 
the metal feast whose if you connect the
two<00:01:52.500> metal<00:01:52.979> pieces<00:01:53.159> together<00:01:53.399> such<00:01:54.240> as<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
two metal pieces together such as the

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:00.499 
two metal pieces together such as the
center<00:01:55.829> bolt<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.899> the<00:01:57.899> top<00:01:58.469> bolt<00:01:59.060> as<00:02:00.060> for

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
center bolt and the the top bolt as for

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.980 
center bolt and the the top bolt as for
this<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:01.079> get<00:02:01.549> four<00:02:02.549> points<00:02:02.820> something<00:02:03.270> grams

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
this you get four points something grams

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.990 
this you get four points something grams
or<00:02:04.170> whatever<00:02:04.409> but<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.219> get<00:02:05.369> them<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.640> both

or whatever but you get them on both
bolts<00:02:06.360> rather<00:02:06.960> than<00:02:07.229> just<00:02:07.979> one<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.280> them<00:02:08.429> so

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
bolts rather than just one of them so

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.660 
bolts rather than just one of them so
yeah<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.459> more<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.670> merrier<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:12.000> guess
