00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.609
 now it's finally back to mature games 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.230
 was a month that is the new cable was type 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.679
 ii abandoned with the last woman 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.009
 thirteenth than some to some views from 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.870
 said what I want this time 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.189
 to show a beautiful thing or 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.100
 how to create a modeling paste between 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:28.070
 the other very fragrant therefore soiled i 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.470
 blue a very soft modeling paste 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.520
 which is not dirty you see just greasy 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.750
 a little bit but there is a minimum of nothing 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.750
 who also salt pasta 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.870
 but the cool thing about this pasta is that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.690
 it hardens in the air so you can 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.260
 create your creations in that 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.980
 what do you want 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.610
 yes you don't put two minutes like the das 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.370
 color bold as roma it takes me 24 hours not 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.590
 at repayment period there is a heat 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.520
 commitment maybe it takes 15 from us though 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.060
 they want his hours do not be poor 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.030
 meal and let it dry as it should though 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.720
 see how beautiful elastic that beautiful 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.369
 color and you know what I created it with not 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.040
 got off the headline what I'm doing 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.020
 his team for the mullah with in 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.110
 name break not only with the maximum 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.259
 because otherwise I figure the shampoo in 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.259
 direct I shampoo then high 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:33.540
 honesty but with the balm the flour 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:38.640
 the oil and oh well to make it turn blue 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.650
 with acrylic colors I use these ones here 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.720
 I'm from the printing house, which of course is 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.439
 more effortless brand will certainly be dearer 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.710
 what can type 250 will be more or 4 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.970
 54 50 but maybe I am stupid had 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.649
 bought but sometimes really 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.350
 the use of the brain in shit 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.710
 anyway it is now I leave you to the tutorial for 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.549
 making this ball sentences 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.009
 ambiguous or the and then with this you can here 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.300
 create what you want and time 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.950
 inter hook is avoided by 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.380
 buy the movie that costs a fucking of 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.620
 making corn dough money 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.230
 however it requires other things that are 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.940
 more expensive salt dough that we have 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.780
 large lines of salt that do shit 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.070
 crowd and the tas that still costs in 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.450
 this in my opinion is the cheapest 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.640
 because the doses are I wrote the doses 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.170
 against it takes ok however you see it 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.500
 in a while because I wrote it in the video 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.920
 so I leave you to the video and I'm in 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.680
 remember blacks fall rich dino 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.600
 most famous of tanino are in the book of 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.990
 type linen in a love I will explain to you how 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.690
 let's proceed then first 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:56.410
 get a bowl to hold the 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.630
 all that you will mix and and the doses 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.400
 They are the following 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:05.820
 then 125 g of balsam these flour e 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.570
 they are 150 g of flour 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:14.800
 after which oil 30 g of oil 30 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.750
 milliliters of oil and nothing less 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.050
 you may have seen how you can 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:24.970
 put the balm into the artist 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.590
 container using a point brush for 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.050
 to overcome evil 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.760
 then add yourself to the clinic 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.290
 add me how much you want me more 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.820
 put more than one intense in i put 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.350
 even too much because I wanted to do it 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.590
 passing instead as you have seen it is 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.820
 came very dark so don't even put it 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.670
 stir well 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.200
 then add the flour no 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:51.390
 then add the oil first 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.390
 add the oil still this way once 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.459
 did this remix to incorporate 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:02.320
 better all the oil will see a pap 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:05.080
 udc woman is done this add the 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.910
 madonna st mosca add the flour 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.040
 not all of me because otherwise 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.050
 she becomes a crazy woman as the poop of the gods 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.459
 dogs when they are constipated those years 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.180
 object of a little mixed at a time 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.890
 add again and mix, ie not 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.479
 you can understand maybe a small box 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.620
 small you don't see but there is a bag that 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.050
 it continues to make me millennia 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.310
 and they jump over me then mix 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.250
 and stir at a certain point 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.260
 that she would go crazy and harder 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.060
 started to work which hands 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.360
 you can't create the atmosphere of course 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.400
 you have to get dirty with these things 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.840
 get dirty if you are sistine maybe 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.940
 how many homes you are trying 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.100
 advice to give you hands because the 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.990
 nice of these things 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:49.040
 get your hands dirty play with 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.870
 diego and that's it that's it 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.180
 done I recommend you remember to 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:57.199
 the one that does not even use not created does not 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.910
 It serves to create a wrap with 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.740
 film because I said otherwise 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.320
 they are regiments of the week if not a 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.610
 sphere so now seen if it is true if it has them 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.460
 then waste film in 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.120
 protect this type of volastra 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.120
