00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
really not that great so balanced me

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.050 
really not that great so balanced me
supertonic<00:02:31.390> body<00:02:31.840> wash<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.730> this<00:02:33.730> is<00:02:33.850> quite<00:02:34.030> a

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
supertonic body wash and this is quite a

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.330 
supertonic body wash and this is quite a
small<00:02:34.210> sample<00:02:34.810> for<00:02:35.560> balance<00:02:35.890> me<00:02:36.100> I<00:02:36.160> don't

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
small sample for balance me I don't

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.040 
small sample for balance me I don't
think<00:02:36.490> balance<00:02:36.760> means<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.210> very<00:02:37.420> expensive

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
think balance means and a very expensive
