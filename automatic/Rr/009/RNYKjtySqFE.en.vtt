00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.809
 hello dear friends today i am 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.240
 I would like to answer the question what is 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:21.360
 permanent resident status in Canada or 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.840
 English confident French 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.640
 president egggman 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.270
 difference of people having 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.000
 this status is under the citizens and often 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:39.679
 asked question whether permanent 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.149
 Canadian resident has the same 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:44.789
 opportunities to travel as simple 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.390
 Canadians i.e. having a map 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:52.980
 will become for can man can also 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.629
 also they use this card for 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.710
 to by star travel on 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.339
 the world and so what is the status of permanent 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.050
 Canadian residents are essentially creatures 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:08.010
 will give the same inhabitant the same 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:11.330
 Canadian citizen as well as full 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.370
 citizen yes with a few exceptions 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.010
 any exceptions a person who is not 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.340
 is a Canadian citizen does not have 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.340
 the rights 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.080
 borrow some state 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.970
 posts 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:33.580
 work on some some 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.280
 state companies as a rule 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.410
 people with permanent resident status 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.110
 not eligible to serve the Canadian army 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:45.250
 only canadian experience do citizens 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.600
 Canada together those citizens non citizens 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.360
 Canada ie permanent 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:54.430
 Canadian residents have the rights to work in 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:58.390
 police work in fire services and so 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:02.760
 further the president and canada has the right 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.720
 aims for all the same benefits 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.110
 Canadian system to us state 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:14.320
 such as free tuition free 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:17.920
 medicine the ability to take active 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.780
 participation in social life and so 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.670
 Further 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:28.090
 the first thing people do who come 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:31.210
 here to Canada they do they do or 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.990
 something happened the police blocked off 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.990
 the road 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.600
 and so I understand that such and such problems with 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:50.700
 it is not clear what it looks like this 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.569
 overlap here of all sorts of different 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.569
 places chips 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.129
 I want washed and so here's the first thing they do 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:04.000
 people are abiding in canada they 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:08.030
 they open to themselves 2 2 documents 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.340
 document 1 is a social card 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.310
 of insurance 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:18.500
 asus tell us which one gives 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:20.650
 opportunity to work pay 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.690
 taxes were as if on tax accounting 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.890
 without this card for legal work 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.709
 they won't take you 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.280
 only order only for the person and the second 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.209
 document 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.269
 this is a provincial card 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.489
 health insurance that is 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:40.700
 card that gives you access to 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:45.019
 all medical services are free 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:50.319
 will pay the province but again 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:54.440
 I want to make a reservation right away that there is 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:56.560
 obvious difference between more precisely differences 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.560
 there is 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.939
 services that are paid 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.829
 the government has services that are not 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:08.040
 paid by the government ie those 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:10.620
 services that are directly related 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.349
 with health life threatening there and so 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.690
 then they are not paid without talking 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.669
 regardless of the amount that is, if you forbid 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.530
 my gosh anybody there is cancer and so 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.560
 further it is all the same here dredge 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.910
 costly chemotherapy treatments there 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.180
 and so on this is huge money all this 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:33.750
 paid by the government 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:37.050
 However, all that concerns cosmetics Kirov 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.240
 surgery there and so on plastic 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.139
 Pit surgery mind is all for your 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.139
 own account that is 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.880
 the dentist is paying for it 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.889
 self there facelift 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.190
 increase in different parts of the body too 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.910
 self it is faceless insurance not 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.190
 covers 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:03.650
 and the last thing I want to say about 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:07.169
 PR permanent resident status that 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:10.410
 until a person gets on 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.210
 hands canadian passport on the world he 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:16.500
 travels in their national 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:19.020
 mat that is you have a pr card 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.660

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.210
 you have absolutely no advantages 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.669
 compared to your compatriots 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:30.210
 which you have no card except 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.710

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.020

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:38.039

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.530
 on hand there is a pr card they can on 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:42.870
 the basis of this pr card and its 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:47.419
 valid passport to enter 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.539

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.270
