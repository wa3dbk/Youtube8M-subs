00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.340 
being a playoff team here in Minnesota
how<00:01:32.850> does<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.150> process<00:01:33.390> begin<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.200> had

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
how does that process begin if you had

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.899 
how does that process begin if you had
any<00:01:34.530> conversations<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.430> had<00:01:35.520> either<00:01:35.640> there's

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
any conversations you had either there's

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.460 
any conversations you had either there's
your<00:01:36.150> head<00:01:36.270> still<00:01:36.479> spinning<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:36.990> all<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.350> I

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
your head still spinning with all this I

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.780 
your head still spinning with all this I
think<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:37.799> starts<00:01:38.070> with<00:01:38.130> some<00:01:38.369> relief<00:01:38.579> we

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
think this starts with some relief we

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.980 
think this starts with some relief we
first<00:01:39.090> have<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.270> start<00:01:39.540> with<00:01:39.630> some<00:01:39.780> believe

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
first have to start with some believe

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.060 
first have to start with some believe
make<00:01:40.170> sure<00:01:40.290> we<00:01:40.409> get<00:01:40.530> our<00:01:40.650> feet<00:01:40.799> wet<00:01:41.040> with

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
make sure we get our feet wet with

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.370 
make sure we get our feet wet with
experience<00:01:41.820> we're<00:01:42.030> playing<00:01:42.240> against<00:01:42.479> NBA

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
experience we're playing against NBA

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.380 
experience we're playing against NBA
and<00:01:43.619> then<00:01:43.920> also<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.310> keep<00:01:44.729> working<00:01:45.060> hard<00:01:45.090> in

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
and then also just keep working hard in

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.109 
and then also just keep working hard in
the<00:01:45.450> gym<00:01:45.659> we<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:46.020> great<00:01:46.350> mentor<00:01:46.820> for<00:01:47.820> me<00:01:48.000> it

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
the gym we have a great mentor for me it

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.520 
the gym we have a great mentor for me it
would<00:01:48.240> be<00:01:48.270> Kevin<00:01:48.689> Garnett<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.170> think<00:01:49.409> for

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
would be Kevin Garnett and I think for

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.410 
would be Kevin Garnett and I think for
more<00:01:49.740> time<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.159> it'd<00:01:50.280> be<00:01:50.310> Ricky<00:01:50.580> Rubio<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.390> I

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
more time so it'd be Ricky Rubio so I

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.749 
more time so it'd be Ricky Rubio so I
think<00:01:51.540> we<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> great<00:01:52.530> set<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:52.950> veterans

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
think we have a great set of veterans

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.880 
think we have a great set of veterans
ship<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.509> also<00:01:54.900> mentoring<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.500> we<00:01:55.619> could<00:01:55.770> be

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
ship and also mentoring that we could be

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.740 
ship and also mentoring that we could be
done<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.790> little<00:01:57.090> time<00:01:57.330> and<00:01:57.630> also

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
done and this little time and also

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.420 
done and this little time and also
putting<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.259> talent<00:01:58.680> together<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.100> think<00:01:59.220> we

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
putting the talent together I think we

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.219 
putting the talent together I think we
could<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.759> really<00:02:00.090> great<00:02:00.299> team<00:02:00.630> there<00:02:01.140> was

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
could have a really great team there was

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.350 
could have a really great team there was
a<00:02:01.259> joke<00:02:01.590> last<00:02:01.860> year<00:02:02.190> and<00:02:02.430> some<00:02:02.789> people<00:02:03.090> took<00:02:03.210> it

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
a joke last year and some people took it

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.359 
a joke last year and some people took it
seriously<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.960> maybe<00:02:04.140> Kentucky<00:02:04.770> could<00:02:05.280> have

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
seriously that maybe Kentucky could have

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.590 
seriously that maybe Kentucky could have
been<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> playoff<00:02:05.850> team<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.330> Eastern

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.020 
course I mean well you know we it would
do<00:02:56.130> well<00:02:56.310> for<00:02:56.430> all<00:02:56.549> of<00:02:56.579> us<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.880> was<00:02:56.940> a

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
do well for all of us it was a

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.520 
do well for all of us it was a
transition<00:02:57.510> period<00:02:57.630> especially<00:02:58.079> for<00:02:58.470> the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
transition period especially for the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.620 
transition period especially for the
freshman<00:02:58.859> last<00:02:59.010> year<00:02:59.190> because<00:02:59.910> we<00:03:00.120> had<00:03:00.329> came

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
freshman last year because we had came

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.479 
freshman last year because we had came
and<00:03:00.870> playing<00:03:01.109> mostly<00:03:01.440> about<00:03:01.680> 32<00:03:02.100> minutes<00:03:02.310> and

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
and playing mostly about 32 minutes and

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.250 
and playing mostly about 32 minutes and
night<00:03:02.670> 33<00:03:03.359> and<00:03:03.510> having<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.810> put<00:03:03.959> up<00:03:04.079> big

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
night 33 and having to put up big

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.830 
night 33 and having to put up big
numbers<00:03:04.320> for<00:03:04.680> w's<00:03:05.220> this<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.420> know<00:03:06.540> last<00:03:06.750> year

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
numbers for w's this you know last year

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.460 
numbers for w's this you know last year
was<00:03:07.049> different

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
was different

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.120 
was different
lesser<00:03:08.370> minutes<00:03:08.670> equals<00:03:09.150> more<00:03:09.299> W<00:03:09.690> so<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:10.560> think

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
lesser minutes equals more W so I think

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.620 
lesser minutes equals more W so I think
the<00:03:11.190> philosophy<00:03:11.340> has<00:03:11.760> changed<00:03:12.120> but<00:03:12.209> we<00:03:12.390> know

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
the philosophy has changed but we know

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.630 
the philosophy has changed but we know
exactly<00:03:12.989> what<00:03:13.320> we<00:03:13.410> need<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.709> do<00:03:13.859> and<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.430> think

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
exactly what we need to do and I think

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.740 
exactly what we need to do and I think
the<00:03:14.730> biggest<00:03:14.910> thing<00:03:15.120> that<00:03:15.299> you<00:03:15.390> take<00:03:15.600> away

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
the biggest thing that you take away

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.780 
the biggest thing that you take away
from<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.230> platoon<00:03:16.620> system<00:03:17.100> you<00:03:17.430> cannot

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
from that platoon system you cannot

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.759 
from that platoon system you cannot
start<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.299> game<00:03:18.480> cold<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:19.140> have<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:19.470> come<00:03:19.650> out

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
start the game cold you have to come out

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.740 
start the game cold you have to come out
hot<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.190> ready<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.519> play<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:21.329> that<00:03:21.480> could<00:03:21.630> be

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
hot and ready to play and that could be

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.599 
hot and ready to play and that could be
beneficial<00:03:21.900> for<00:03:22.320> you<00:03:22.620> because<00:03:22.829> it's<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.459> guy

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609
