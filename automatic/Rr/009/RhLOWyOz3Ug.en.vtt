00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
different I would imagine that if you

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.839 
different I would imagine that if you
pack<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.770> color<00:04:50.009> you'll<00:04:50.250> be<00:04:50.370> able<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.580> get<00:04:50.699> the

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
pack the color you'll be able to get the

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.339 
pack the color you'll be able to get the
same<00:04:51.030> as<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.330> finger<00:04:51.599> swatch<00:04:51.870> with<00:04:52.110> all<00:04:52.259> the

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
same as the finger swatch with all the

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:53.990 
same as the finger swatch with all the
glitters<00:04:52.650> and<00:04:52.680> everything<00:04:53.219> but<00:04:53.610> this<00:04:53.729> makes

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
glitters and everything but this makes

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.640 
glitters and everything but this makes
me<00:04:54.150> not<00:04:54.270> confident<00:04:54.840> that<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.110> glitters<00:04:55.409> will

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
me not confident that the glitters will

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.649 
me not confident that the glitters will
stay<00:04:56.069> it<00:04:56.310> looks<00:04:56.490> like<00:04:56.610> a<00:04:56.639> brassy<00:04:57.270> kind<00:04:57.539> of

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
stay it looks like a brassy kind of

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:00.140 
stay it looks like a brassy kind of
glitter<00:04:57.930> I've<00:04:58.800> a<00:04:59.370> feeling<00:04:59.729> that<00:04:59.849> those<00:04:59.969> would

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
glitter I've a feeling that those would

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.879 
glitter I've a feeling that those would
probably<00:05:00.210> fall<00:05:00.719> away<00:05:00.930> over<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:01.620> day<00:05:01.830> so

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
probably fall away over the day so
