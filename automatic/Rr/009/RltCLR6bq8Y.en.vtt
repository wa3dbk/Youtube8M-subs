00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.480
 is 

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.459
 theme this nokia 11 10 that they do not like 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.670
 the asterisk key the acerola 

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:13.210
 The technique closes and the key 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.029
 demo or the one above here on the left 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.390
 and we see that the solution would then be 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:21.310
 glass but then changed ever 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.030
 the glass change is complicated by the 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.160
 zone where is this same and the 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.170
 solution is very easy we just go 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.900
 to make a bridge so that the pulsation 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.079
 between the processor here we see that this 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.409
 the processor this line here in the 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:41.530
 that controls asterisk 0 numeral key 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:43.770
 left and the menu key here 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.130
 then let's observe 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.170
 then the pulsation enters from the 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.340
 keyboard from the keys that are 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.630
 failing 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:58.270
 of the numeral key 0 asterisk key 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.910
 right and right teak and menu key 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.370
 straight 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.100
 those pulsations arrive on this side and 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.900
 they go through the middle of lice and they pass 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.180
 each of the lines that go to the 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.400
 processor everything we do right now 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.890
 is to force the pulse to pass right 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.410
 do not enter by propellers but pass 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.420
 directly the processor and for that 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.640
 works the keys that we have failing 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.189
 let's grab the line that enters the 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.040
 processor that is this we are going to scrape 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.780
 here we are going to apply flush we are going to 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.600
 solder a cable quoted as we see it there 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.630
 and then let's drop it here 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.260
 part also because it keeps the 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.260
 part of outside 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.920
 let's drop here in the part of 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.920
 outside 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.170
 and now let's see that the phone 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.170
 works 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.520
 there we see asterisk 0 numeral 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.020
 in which the key we see that it does not work 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.820
 right now and the left key service 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.840
 del arauca professional technical service 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.840
