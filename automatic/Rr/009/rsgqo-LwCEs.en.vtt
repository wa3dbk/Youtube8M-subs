 today I have the pleasure of you 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.590
 find for a new gameplay on 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.270
 call of duty kid to a new video 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.650
 after a few days of absence from my 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.020
 part then for those who follow me on 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.460
 twitter and other social networks as well 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.710
 that on my live streaming to an all 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.030
 evenings besides listen I am well 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.890
 alive so why do I redo you 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.480
 still a video on call of duty kid 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.309
 this time I'm not live 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.070
 it's a gameplay commented after the fact 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.870
 as they say I am in eliminations 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.879
 confirmed on the containment map of the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.409
 again not like this housing here I am 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.409
 do not know if I 'm going to quote I'm playing 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:59.580
 with the silent m tarik by the way 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.780
 it's a very good class that I 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.519
 recommend to the part is now to 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.010
 the screen play this is a real 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.330
 happiness after I surely teach you 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.200
 nothing in any case me I'm doing very well 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.120
 well with them you'll see this 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.170
 gameplay is not too bad here 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.880
 despite having some campers 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.530
 as usual on call of duty ghost 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.890
 I think everyone is at 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.320
 current 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.909
 in any case, that's exactly why I 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.680
 you still do a video on this call 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.080
 of duty gosset right now I'm playing 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.420
 Verry much 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.890
 It's true that I left with 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.870
 a lot of disappointment on shoes 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.960
 this game already when it came out I did not 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.180
 at all appreciated there I confess it to you 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.620
 all in all transparency 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.910
 impartiality because me when I 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.180
 something to say clearly 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.190
 especially lately I say it I 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.200
 find it really good so here 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.640
 necessarily there is still the community that 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.840
 waste everything as usual a that I 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.860
 will not teach you anything about it 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.020
 but I tell you very honestly 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.340
 try it would have tried to finally after 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.640
 I will not force you either 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.810
 obviously since on this call of duty 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.060
 kid I noticed it needed when 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.810
 even a pretty good connection more than 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.400
 for the elders so that's it's a 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.280
 little bit the worry is to say that 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.050
 maybe I rediscover the game call 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.310
 of duty generally because 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.069
 I have a good connection if there is 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.859
 now I'm almost 30 mega 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.480
 So that's why I was before 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.819
 three mega I had her time to 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.379
 download a movie here finally I had 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.879
 unwanted disconnections 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.379
 maybe you will tell me that I 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.930
 rediscover call of duty at its fair 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.400
 value but in any case here I can 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.620
 tell you that I take a lot of 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.109
 pleasure these days I play only 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.510
 weapons- oriented has almost the mta x 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:38.069
 silent one can see my way of 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.569
 play a game play a little bit more 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.519
 thoughtful ie I'm watching 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.290
 well the crossing points as has by 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.870
 example 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.659
 I watch the tops as we say we're going 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.989
 say the roofs the floors the stairs 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.819
 etc. 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.939
 here I have another way of playing 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.620
 I approached the game differently from 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.150
 other call of duty 1 you remember 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.530
 modern warfare 2 we could go 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.340
 full center of the map end it was a 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.840
 little anything 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.970
 it's true that I'm not at all 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.739
 decerto competition player but I 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.310
 am adapted we will say here I am 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.319
 adapted to a new way of playing 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.189
 concretely that is closer to the 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.810
 staging of stealth too 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.230
 a clear and in any case it's wearing 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.060
 its fruits 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.500
 it's tight that now almost to 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.120
 all parties so I rage a lot 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.609
 attention i think those who me 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.139
 follow on my lives by the way can 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.230
 to testify I still rage a lot about 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.849
 this game but it's often because of the 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.010
 community quite often because of 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.329
 players who are new to the 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.370
 most on call of duty or so 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.659
 they started on black ops 2 they 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.129
 do not have these species of tic 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.689
 we had this way of playing very 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.760
 very old-fashioned arcade that we had 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:44.849
 that we had at the time precisely 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.699
 modern warfare 2 or even black ops 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.590
 first of the name after you know that for 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:51.659
 me what really changed is 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.340
 clearly modern warfare 3 that's to 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.229
 from this opus there according to me who have 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.400
 had a real change in the way of 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:04:00.690
 to play people and maybe also with 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.159
 with the advance of the competition 1 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.590
 necessarily because the players of the coup 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.669
 also adapts to the competition so they 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.319
 have another way of playing like I 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.819
 tell them so after that it's full 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.829
 different elements but in short all that 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.569
 to tell you that on this game in this 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.530
 moment I 'm doing more 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.780
 more 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.510
 big parts we'll say and I'm 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.040
 Proud enough of me here for once 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.389
 it's not often that I say it I'm 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.090
 quite proud of me in any case of my 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.590
 results on this game for now 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.540
 after i play on xbox one i stopped 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.710
 to play on the xbox 360 either because 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.270
 that being he is very very good too 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.910
 by the way late if you like call of 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.230
 duty once again small info 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.830
 also i have a new pc 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:40.560
 so I can now play games 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.120
 pc in higher resolution to close 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.320
 video rendering it's easier to do 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.780
 live streaming is easier 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.230
 for me so I put you my 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.419
 configuration it appears on the screen that 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.220
 costs around 800 and a few euros 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.020
 so you have to finally enjoy it 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.700
 enjoy especially consequences were 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.180
 balances one obviously so that's 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.860
 a config really balanced and that's it 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.720
 it comes from topachat I am very very 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.850
 happy with this configuration I'm going 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.970
 turn battlefield 4 into ultra and 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.979
 honestly I have no problem with 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.200
 high level power this is clearly 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.700
 I am quiet and it is true that 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.139
 one beats as you had seen in the 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.290
 little video it's because right now 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:22.710
 it's the fashion the videos setup 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:24.479
 I am equipped we will say to be 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.280
 quiet here to have no problem 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.860
 because it's true that my pc leaps it 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.229
 he has given up 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.490
 previous pc finally made the soul he walks 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.039
 again if you want to still work 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.229
 but it's really not the top 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.699
 we are going to say that finally he was coming to 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.830
 its limits and made me proud 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.960
 services 5 casually my good old pc 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.219
 and who had who had almost four 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.930
 three or four years old in the mouth 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:48.379
 who went after it on sony 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.060
 vegas live streaming even brief of 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.830
 hours and hours they were on 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.120
 almost all the time this pc and for 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.949
 400 euros I tell myself that in fact I 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.210
 my money is very well out there and 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.310
 that's why he made me proud 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.919
 services but now well we are 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:07.400
 placed in the state at the top step so 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:09.680
 with a gtx 770 already a core i5 4670 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.270
 so a quad core with 8 gigas of ram 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.520
 so that's perfect for what I 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.169
 do it's really ideal and I'm 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.669
 very happy for those that it 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.020
 interest I put you anyway 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.229
 the link of this config in the 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.229
 description 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.770
 so here we are, if not after, I'm not big 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.629
 else to tell you if it's 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.949
 compared to my future between 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:29.150
 quotes on youtube and ben that's 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:31.310
 always so uncertain because 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.650
 youtube is in the process of 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.599
 die slowly I feel like 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.460
 this is just my opinion but bomb to your 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:38.629
 good old jojo he is still there must 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.909
 not hesitate to ask me questions at 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:42.740
 follow me on twitter @ dorion line to 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:44.029
 jo that I invite you clear less harmful 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.409
 on these social networks 

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:48.860
 I really answer in more people 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:50.569
 possible and here I am present I 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.009
 I am let go I have a little bit of a path 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:53.300
 I do not want to repeat it every time 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:53.960
 but it's actually true I'm doing my 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.699
 little bit of way 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.949
 if you 're there, it's better 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:59.779
 is extremely fun and then and then 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:01.129
 that's what it does to me that's always 

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:04.069
 hot in the heart of seeing that bages and the 

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:06.080
 support despite it being simple 

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:07.460
 video game videos to the con because 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.680
 clearly that's it looking at you and a

 call of duty kid month to return a

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.620
 especially happy these new maps that 

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:53.779
