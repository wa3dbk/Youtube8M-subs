and give you an opportunity to kind of
work<00:03:56.440> on<00:03:56.680> a<00:03:56.770> little<00:03:57.220> bit<00:03:57.310> of<00:03:57.370> usually<00:03:57.670> being

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
work on a little bit of usually being

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.420 
work on a little bit of usually being
that<00:03:58.510> modal<00:03:58.990> I<00:03:59.410> started<00:03:59.830> that<00:03:59.890> pentatonic

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
that modal I started that pentatonic

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.150 
that modal I started that pentatonic
sequencing<00:04:00.970> in<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.180> middle<00:04:01.630> and<00:04:01.870> then<00:04:02.800> the

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
sequencing in the middle and then the

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.040 
sequencing in the middle and then the
modal<00:04:03.520> scale<00:04:03.760> sequencing<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.510> like<00:04:04.690> regular

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
modal scale sequencing the like regular

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.990 
modal scale sequencing the like regular
mixolydian<00:04:05.680> scale<00:04:05.920> sequencing<00:04:06.250> towards<00:04:06.850> the

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
mixolydian scale sequencing towards the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.750 
mixolydian scale sequencing towards the
end<00:04:07.180> it's<00:04:07.390> a<00:04:07.420> really<00:04:07.600> cool<00:04:07.720> idea<00:04:07.780> and<00:04:08.760> looks

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
end it's a really cool idea and looks

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.130 
end it's a really cool idea and looks
like<00:04:09.850> this<00:04:10.180> you<00:04:10.360> hear<00:04:10.540> all<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.750> time<00:04:10.780> like

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
like this you hear all the time like

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.770 
like this you hear all the time like
fusion<00:04:11.800> and<00:04:11.860> stuff<00:04:12.130> if<00:04:12.340> you<00:04:12.460> listen<00:04:12.760> to<00:04:12.790> on<00:04:13.660> a

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
fusion and stuff if you listen to on a

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.600 
fusion and stuff if you listen to on a
break<00:04:13.990> how<00:04:14.200> that<00:04:14.890> kind<00:04:15.070> of<00:04:15.100> stuff<00:04:15.310> Richie

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
break how that kind of stuff Richie

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.050 
break how that kind of stuff Richie

so<00:04:16.210> work<00:04:16.480> on<00:04:16.630> this<00:04:16.780> one<00:04:16.989> and<00:04:17.200> like<00:04:18.010> I<00:04:18.130> said<00:04:18.190> the

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
so work on this one and like I said the

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.030 
so work on this one and like I said the
tabs<00:04:18.640> here<00:04:18.850> for<00:04:19.180> you<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.680> one<00:04:20.680> more<00:04:20.799> time<00:04:20.980> for

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
tabs here for you and one more time for

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.340 
tabs here for you and one more time for
you<00:04:21.489> so<00:04:22.270> you<00:04:22.360> can<00:04:22.630> get<00:04:22.870> idea<00:04:23.110> of<00:04:23.170> what<00:04:23.260> it

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
you so you can get idea of what it

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:38.620 
you so you can get idea of what it
sounds<00:04:23.440> like<00:04:23.590> in<00:04:23.770> context

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.690 

you
