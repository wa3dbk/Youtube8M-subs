roller<00:03:59.250> coaster<00:03:59.340> is<00:03:59.819> estimated<00:04:00.599> to<00:04:00.629> go<00:04:00.840> about

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
roller coaster is estimated to go about

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.170 
roller coaster is estimated to go about
15<00:04:03.080> to<00:04:04.080> maybe<00:04:04.379> possibly<00:04:05.069> even<00:04:05.220> 20<00:04:05.730> miles<00:04:05.970> an

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
15 to maybe possibly even 20 miles an

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.930 
15 to maybe possibly even 20 miles an
hour<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.860> biggest<00:04:10.860> roller<00:04:11.280> coaster<00:04:11.790> and

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
hour and the biggest roller coaster and

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.219 
hour and the biggest roller coaster and
I've<00:04:12.090> ever<00:04:12.299> attempted<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.690> hope<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:16.049> first

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
I've ever attempted and I hope the first

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.360 
I've ever attempted and I hope the first
test<00:04:16.590> run<00:04:16.769> works<00:04:18.109> but<00:04:19.109> as<00:04:19.410> you<00:04:19.889> can<00:04:19.979> see<00:04:20.190> it's

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
test run works but as you can see it's

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.920 
test run works but as you can see it's
really<00:04:20.519> well<00:04:20.880> built<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.419> I<00:04:21.570> don't<00:04:21.750> think

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
really well built and I don't think

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.590 
really well built and I don't think
there's<00:04:22.139> going<00:04:22.290> to<00:04:22.380> be<00:04:22.410> any<00:04:22.500> problems<00:04:23.130> with<00:04:23.280> it

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
there's going to be any problems with it

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.640 
there's going to be any problems with it
all<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:25.050> cross<00:04:25.320> ties<00:04:25.680> are<00:04:26.010> measured<00:04:26.490> evenly

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
all the cross ties are measured evenly

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.080 
all the cross ties are measured evenly
so<00:04:28.650> when<00:04:28.770> you<00:04:28.860> put<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.160> rail<00:04:29.340> on<00:04:29.610> they'll<00:04:29.850> fit

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
so when you put the rail on they'll fit

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.860 
so when you put the rail on they'll fit
perfectly<00:04:30.630> I<00:04:32.810> have<00:04:33.810> TV<00:04:34.260> see<00:04:34.500> right<00:04:34.740> there<00:04:35.870> and

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
perfectly I have TV see right there and

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:44.230 
perfectly I have TV see right there and
here<00:04:37.229> I'll<00:04:37.350> show<00:04:37.380> you<00:04:41.449> put<00:04:42.449> it<00:04:42.570> on<00:04:42.660> right<00:04:42.930> there

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
here I'll show you put it on right there

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.960 
here I'll show you put it on right there
it's<00:04:45.240> pretty<00:04:45.510> even<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:48.889> more<00:04:49.889> PVC<00:04:50.490> down<00:04:50.669> there

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
it's pretty even and more PVC down there

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.320 
it's pretty even and more PVC down there
it's<00:04:51.360> an<00:04:51.510> extra<00:04:51.870> would<00:04:52.050> but
