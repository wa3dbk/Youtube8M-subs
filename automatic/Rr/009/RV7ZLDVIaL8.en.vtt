00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
the description for this program but

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.690 
the description for this program but
what<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.430> basically<00:03:00.520> is<00:03:01.000> is<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:05.100> free<00:03:06.100> antivirus

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
what it basically is is a free antivirus

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.020 
what it basically is is a free antivirus
spider<00:03:07.710> they<00:03:08.710> have<00:03:08.830> a<00:03:08.860> paid<00:03:09.160> version<00:03:09.430> which

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
spider they have a paid version which

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.840 
spider they have a paid version which
covers<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.390> lot<00:03:10.660> more<00:03:10.870> ground<00:03:11.080> but<00:03:11.470> I<00:03:11.740> think<00:03:12.730> the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
covers a lot more ground but I think the

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.050 
covers a lot more ground but I think the
Free<00:03:13.030> Edition<00:03:13.150> works<00:03:14.700> immensely<00:03:15.700> well<00:03:15.880> for

Free Edition works immensely well for
being<00:03:16.240> free<00:03:16.450> I<00:03:16.950> scanned<00:03:17.950> when<00:03:18.400> I<00:03:18.460> first<00:03:18.760> got<00:03:18.970> it

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
being free I scanned when I first got it

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.090 
being free I scanned when I first got it
and<00:03:19.210> it<00:03:19.360> saved<00:03:19.570> me<00:03:19.780> from<00:03:19.930> three<00:03:20.440> Trojan

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
and it saved me from three Trojan

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.450 
and it saved me from three Trojan
viruses<00:03:21.840> so<00:03:22.840> as<00:03:22.960> soon<00:03:23.290> as<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.560> get<00:03:23.680> this<00:03:23.860> scan

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
viruses so as soon as you get this scan

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.350 
viruses so as soon as you get this scan
now<00:03:25.800> and<00:03:26.800> one<00:03:26.950> thing<00:03:26.980> I<00:03:27.190> like<00:03:27.340> about<00:03:27.370> this<00:03:27.730> is

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
now and one thing I like about this is

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.390 
now and one thing I like about this is
down<00:03:28.630> here<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:29.410> can<00:03:29.590> choose<00:03:29.950> your

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
down here you can choose your

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.670 
down here you can choose your
sensitivity<00:03:31.060> low<00:03:31.300> priority<00:03:31.600> medium<00:03:32.440> priority

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
sensitivity low priority medium priority

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.030 
sensitivity low priority medium priority
and<00:03:33.190> high<00:03:33.700> priority<00:03:34.240> I<00:03:34.590> usually<00:03:35.590> put<00:03:35.770> my<00:03:35.800> not

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
and high priority I usually put my not

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.680 
and high priority I usually put my not
high<00:03:38.490> so<00:03:39.490> this<00:03:39.610> is<00:03:39.790> basically<00:03:40.240> just<00:03:40.360> going<00:03:40.600> to

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
high so this is basically just going to

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.800 
high so this is basically just going to
scan<00:03:40.930> through<00:03:41.140> your<00:03:41.290> entire<00:03:41.560> computer<00:03:41.860> and

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
get everything it needs and check

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.500 
get everything it needs and check
