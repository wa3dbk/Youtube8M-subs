your player around house heavily you

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.169 
your player around house heavily you
could<00:00:38.079> use<00:00:38.319> on<00:00:38.620> taverley<00:00:39.190> teleport<00:00:39.760> tablets

00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:40.179 
could use on taverley teleport tablets

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:42.689 
could use on taverley teleport tablets
but<00:00:40.960> those<00:00:41.170> will<00:00:41.469> cut<00:00:41.739> into<00:00:42.069> your<00:00:42.190> profit<00:00:42.550> per

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
make all your planks analogs and then

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:01.949 
make all your planks analogs and then
you'll<00:01:00.190> think<00:01:00.219> and<00:01:00.819> repeat<00:01:01.389> however<00:01:01.780> many

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:01.959 
you'll think and repeat however many

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:04.950 
you'll think and repeat however many
times<00:01:02.199> you<00:01:02.379> would<00:01:02.469> like<00:01:02.679> to<00:01:03.480> if<00:01:04.480> you'll<00:01:04.720> notice

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
times you would like to if you'll notice

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.040 
times you would like to if you'll notice
I'm<00:01:05.650> using<00:01:05.710> a<00:01:06.100> preset<00:01:06.730> option<00:01:07.540> to<00:01:07.810> just

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
I'm using a preset option to just

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.830 
I'm using a preset option to just
quickly<00:01:08.260> blood<00:01:08.620> all<00:01:08.800> my<00:01:08.950> logs<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:09.430> runes<00:01:09.840> and

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
quickly blood all my logs and runes and

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.510 
quickly blood all my logs and runes and
that<00:01:11.230> definitely<00:01:11.620> helps<00:01:11.980> speed<00:01:12.220> up<00:01:12.400> your

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
that definitely helps speed up your

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.280 
that definitely helps speed up your
troops<00:01:12.790> quite<00:01:13.060> a<00:01:13.090> bit<00:01:13.330> so<00:01:13.600> if<00:01:13.720> you<00:01:13.840> have<00:01:13.930> spares

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
troops quite a bit so if you have spares

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.380 
troops quite a bit so if you have spares
basing<00:01:14.950> your<00:01:14.980> presets<00:01:15.430> it<00:01:15.580> would<00:01:15.940> probably<00:01:16.120> be

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
basing your presets it would probably be

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.260 
basing your presets it would probably be
worth<00:01:16.570> doing<00:01:16.990> so<00:01:17.980> the<00:01:18.460> reason<00:01:18.730> I<00:01:18.820> primarily

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
worth doing so the reason I primarily

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.330 
worth doing so the reason I primarily
make<00:01:19.540> this<00:01:19.720> guide<00:01:19.990> is<00:01:20.230> just<00:01:20.650> the<00:01:20.950> fact<00:01:21.130> a<00:01:21.220> lot

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
make this guide is just the fact a lot

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.280 
make this guide is just the fact a lot
of<00:01:21.370> people<00:01:21.490> aren't<00:01:22.000> aware<00:01:22.180> of<00:01:22.660> the<00:01:23.110> fact

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
of people aren't aware of the fact

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.170 
of people aren't aware of the fact
there's<00:01:23.470> a<00:01:23.530> sawmill<00:01:23.860> operator<00:01:24.250> right<00:01:24.760> by<00:01:25.120> the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
there's a sawmill operator right by the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.150 
there's a sawmill operator right by the
temporary<00:01:25.690> house<00:01:25.840> portal<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.980> lot<00:01:27.130> of

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
temporary house portal and a lot of

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.920 
temporary house portal and a lot of
people<00:01:27.400> still<00:01:27.610> make<00:01:27.790> planks<00:01:28.390> over<00:01:28.750> at<00:01:28.840> the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
people still make planks over at the

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.320 
people still make planks over at the
sawmill<00:01:29.140> even<00:01:30.040> though<00:01:30.160> this<00:01:30.400> is<00:01:30.700> much<00:01:31.060> better

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
sawmill even though this is much better

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.960 
sawmill even though this is much better
so<00:01:32.290> I'm<00:01:32.500> not<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:32.770> most<00:01:32.920> efficient<00:01:33.490> person

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
so I'm not the most efficient person

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.360 
so I'm not the most efficient person
with<00:01:34.150> clicking<00:01:34.630> accurately<00:01:35.260> so<00:01:36.070> you<00:01:36.130> can

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
with clicking accurately so you can

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.310 
with clicking accurately so you can
obviously<00:01:36.490> still<00:01:37.360> do<00:01:37.480> it<00:01:37.600> faster<00:01:37.990> than<00:01:38.140> I'm

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
obviously still do it faster than I'm

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.040 
obviously still do it faster than I'm
doing<00:01:38.350> it<00:01:39.070> in<00:01:39.250> this<00:01:39.370> video

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
doing it in this video

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.360 
doing it in this video
average<00:01:41.050> though<00:01:41.290> is<00:01:41.530> you<00:01:41.740> can<00:01:41.770> probably<00:01:42.160> get

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
average though is you can probably get

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.700 
average though is you can probably get
up<00:01:42.400> to<00:01:42.580> about<00:01:42.700> 15<00:01:43.150> seconds<00:01:43.540> per<00:01:43.570> trip<00:01:44.050> and<00:01:44.290> 20

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
up to about 15 seconds per trip and 20

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.770 
up to about 15 seconds per trip and 20
seconds<00:01:45.070> per<00:01:45.100> trip<00:01:45.430> is<00:01:45.610> relatively<00:01:46.270> easy<00:01:46.630> to

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
seconds per trip is relatively easy to

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.450 
seconds per trip is relatively easy to
do<00:01:47.020> even

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
do even

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.840 
do even
with<00:01:47.700> not<00:01:48.000> too<00:01:48.210> much<00:01:48.360> focus<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.770> let's<00:01:50.460> take<00:01:50.820> a

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
with not too much focus so let's take a

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.630 
with not too much focus so let's take a
look<00:01:51.000> at<00:01:51.119> some<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.450> profit<00:01:52.020> from<00:01:52.229> this

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
look at some of the profit from this

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.399 
look at some of the profit from this
mahogany<00:01:53.640> logs<00:01:54.060> are<00:01:54.240> usually<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.690> bit<00:01:54.930> over<00:01:55.170> 500

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
mahogany logs are usually a bit over 500

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.149 
mahogany logs are usually a bit over 500
GP<00:01:56.220> and<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:57.000> plank<00:01:57.240> served<00:01:57.510> at<00:01:57.690> over<00:01:57.900> 2,500<00:01:58.770> GP

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
GP and the plank served at over 2,500 GP

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.899 
GP and the plank served at over 2,500 GP
so<00:02:00.090> you're<00:02:00.210> making<00:02:00.509> at<00:02:00.630> least<00:02:00.770> 500<00:02:01.770> GP<00:02:02.430> profit

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
so you're making at least 500 GP profit

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.760 
so you're making at least 500 GP profit
per<00:02:03.060> plank<00:02:03.360> once<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.810> pay<00:02:04.020> for<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.320> sawmill

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
per plank once you pay for the sawmill

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.820 
per plank once you pay for the sawmill
which<00:02:05.400> is<00:02:05.520> 1500<00:02:06.090> per<00:02:06.240> plank<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:07.440> since<00:02:07.740> we're

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
which is 1500 per plank so since we're

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.279 
which is 1500 per plank so since we're
making<00:02:07.890> twenty<00:02:08.340> six<00:02:08.550> planks<00:02:09.209> per<00:02:09.509> trip<00:02:09.810> we're

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
making twenty six planks per trip we're

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.410 
making twenty six planks per trip we're
making<00:02:10.560> around<00:02:10.739> thirteen<00:02:11.250> K<00:02:11.400> profit<00:02:11.910> per<00:02:12.090> trip

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
making around thirteen K profit per trip

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.650 
making around thirteen K profit per trip
and<00:02:12.630> then<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.350> spend<00:02:13.590> about<00:02:13.680> 300<00:02:14.550> GP<00:02:14.970> for<00:02:15.480> the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
and then you spend about 300 GP for the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.900 
and then you spend about 300 GP for the
log<00:02:15.840> room<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.350> ER<00:02:16.500> through<00:02:16.770> her<00:02:17.010> trip<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:17.850> you

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
log room and ER through her trip so you

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.280 
log room and ER through her trip so you
make<00:02:18.090> around<00:02:18.270> twelve<00:02:18.630> thousand<00:02:19.080> seven

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
make around twelve thousand seven

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.970 
make around twelve thousand seven
hundred<00:02:19.350> GP<00:02:19.920> per<00:02:20.130> trip<00:02:20.489> as<00:02:20.730> an<00:02:21.150> average<00:02:21.890> so<00:02:22.890> if

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
hundred GP per trip as an average so if

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.800 
hundred GP per trip as an average so if
you<00:02:23.070> can<00:02:23.250> consistently<00:02:23.820> do<00:02:24.030> fifteen<00:02:24.480> second

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
you can consistently do fifteen second

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.540 
you can consistently do fifteen second
trips<00:02:25.050> you'll<00:02:25.230> make<00:02:25.380> over<00:02:25.680> three<00:02:25.950> million<00:02:26.160> per

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
trips you'll make over three million per

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.550 
trips you'll make over three million per
hour<00:02:26.700> if<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:27.540> do<00:02:27.630> eighteen<00:02:28.019> second<00:02:28.350> trips

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
hour if you can do eighteen second trips

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.930 
hour if you can do eighteen second trips
will<00:02:28.709> make<00:02:28.830> about<00:02:29.040> two<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.430> half<00:02:29.459> million

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
will make about two and a half million

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.240 
will make about two and a half million
per<00:02:30.239> hour<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.750> if<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.350> do<00:02:31.590> twenty<00:02:31.950> second

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
per hour and if you do twenty second

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.520 
per hour and if you do twenty second
trips<00:02:32.519> you'll<00:02:32.730> make<00:02:32.880> about<00:02:33.090> 2.3<00:02:34.019> million<00:02:34.230> per

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
trips you'll make about 2.3 million per

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.000 
trips you'll make about 2.3 million per
hour

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
hour

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.850 
hour
so<00:02:35.280> overall<00:02:35.640> it's<00:02:35.940> pretty<00:02:36.330> good<00:02:36.660> GP<00:02:37.470> per<00:02:37.680> hour

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
so overall it's pretty good GP per hour

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.040 
so overall it's pretty good GP per hour
for<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.850> fact<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.330> requirements<00:02:39.930> for

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
for the fact that the requirements for

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.199 
for the fact that the requirements for
this<00:02:40.170> are<00:02:40.410> incredibly<00:02:40.860> low<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.910> highest

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
this are incredibly low the highest

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.759 
this are incredibly low the highest
requirement<00:02:42.840> didn't<00:02:43.080> solve<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.410> for<00:02:43.680> T

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
requirement didn't solve this for T

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.800 
requirement didn't solve this for T
magic<00:02:44.160> which<00:02:44.400> doesn't<00:02:44.940> take<00:02:44.970> too<00:02:45.300> long<00:02:45.330> again

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
magic which doesn't take too long again

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.780 
magic which doesn't take too long again
so<00:02:46.260> if<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.440> need<00:02:46.620> something<00:02:46.860> quick<00:02:47.160> make<00:02:47.580> some
