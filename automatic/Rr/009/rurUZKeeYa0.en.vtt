00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
that um hopefully that's not going to be

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.570 
that um hopefully that's not going to be
a<00:02:18.230> big<00:02:18.500> problem<00:02:18.880> but<00:02:19.880> be<00:02:20.599> one<00:02:20.959> is<00:02:21.230> going<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.340> be

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
a big problem but be one is going to be

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.030 
a big problem but be one is going to be
the<00:02:23.269> hi-hat<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:23.750> snare<00:02:23.989> I'm<00:02:24.530> sorry<00:02:24.860> the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
the hi-hat and snare I'm sorry the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.990 
the hi-hat and snare I'm sorry the
hi-hat<00:02:25.430> in<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.610> bass<00:02:25.790> drum<00:02:26.030> 1<00:02:26.920> B<00:02:27.920> 2<00:02:27.950> is<00:02:28.700> going

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
hi-hat in the bass drum 1 B 2 is going

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.470 
hi-hat in the bass drum 1 B 2 is going
to<00:02:29.180> be<00:02:29.299> the<00:02:29.510> hi-hat<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.530> bass<00:02:30.680> drum<00:02:30.890> again

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
to be the hi-hat and the bass drum again

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.530 
to be the hi-hat and the bass drum again
too<00:02:32.480> but<00:02:33.380> after<00:02:33.620> that<00:02:34.099> too<00:02:34.610> you're<00:02:35.150> going<00:02:35.420> to

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
too but after that too you're going to

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.440 
too but after that too you're going to
add<00:02:35.690> your<00:02:35.989> third<00:02:36.380> base<00:02:36.650> note<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:38.090> it's<00:02:38.269> going

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
add your third base note so it's going

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:51.039 
add your third base note so it's going
to<00:02:38.540> be<00:02:38.599> something<00:02:38.900> like<00:02:39.200> this<00:02:45.190> 133<00:02:49.360> 134<00:02:50.360> and

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
to be something like this 133 134 and

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.170 
to be something like this 133 134 and
it's<00:02:51.709> probably<00:02:52.040> best<00:02:52.549> to<00:02:52.670> practice<00:02:53.150> that

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
it's probably best to practice that

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.569 
it's probably best to practice that
second<00:02:53.930> um<00:02:54.370> once<00:02:55.370> you<00:02:55.459> feel<00:02:55.640> comfortable<00:02:55.670> with

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
second um once you feel comfortable with

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.930 
second um once you feel comfortable with
now<00:02:58.579> i'm<00:02:58.670> using<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:59.000> heel<00:02:59.180> down<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.900> do<00:03:00.079> this<00:03:00.940> you

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
now i'm using a heel down to do this you

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.150 
now i'm using a heel down to do this you
can<00:03:02.120> use<00:03:02.150> heal<00:03:02.510> up<00:03:02.750> heel<00:03:02.959> down<00:03:03.200> whatever<00:03:03.920> is

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
can use heal up heel down whatever is

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.190 
can use heal up heel down whatever is
most<00:03:04.310> comfortable<00:03:04.609> for<00:03:04.970> you<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.540> if<00:03:06.079> you're

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
not sure what that means you can check

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.330 
not sure what that means you can check

ok<00:03:23.980> back<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.010> that<00:03:25.280> be<00:03:25.870> it's<00:03:26.870> uh<00:03:27.049> it's<00:03:27.410> going<00:03:27.739> to

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
ok back to that be it's uh it's going to

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.289 
ok back to that be it's uh it's going to
sound<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:28.100> little<00:03:28.220> like<00:03:28.310> this<00:03:28.639> when<00:03:28.850> you<00:03:28.940> put<00:03:29.150> in

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
sound a little like this when you put in

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:45.490 
sound a little like this when you put in
the<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:30.290> snare<00:03:30.560> drum<00:03:30.920> so

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.750 

so<00:03:46.500> basically<00:03:46.890> that's<00:03:47.099> what<00:03:47.250> you're<00:03:47.459> looking

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
so basically that's what you're looking

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.420 
so basically that's what you're looking
to<00:03:47.790> do<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.290> that's<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.440> nice<00:03:49.620> beat<00:03:49.950> it<00:03:50.130> sounds

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
to do and that's a nice beat it sounds

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.420 
to do and that's a nice beat it sounds
pretty<00:03:50.670> cool<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.120> quicker<00:03:51.330> speeds<00:03:52.160> so<00:03:53.160> just

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
pretty cool and quicker speeds so just

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.400 
pretty cool and quicker speeds so just
practice<00:03:53.880> at<00:03:54.239> that<00:03:54.420> make<00:03:55.050> sure<00:03:55.080> you're

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
practice at that make sure you're

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.190 
practice at that make sure you're
counting<00:03:55.980> although<00:03:56.459> I<00:03:56.489> wasn't<00:03:56.849> during<00:03:57.209> that

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
counting although I wasn't during that

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.020 
counting although I wasn't during that
be<00:03:58.880> I'm<00:03:59.880> doing<00:04:00.300> it<00:04:00.390> in<00:04:00.480> my<00:04:00.599> head<00:04:01.640> so<00:04:02.640> I<00:04:02.670> just

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
be I'm doing it in my head so I just

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.880 
be I'm doing it in my head so I just
remember<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:03.390> count<00:04:03.599> it<00:04:03.840> truly<00:04:04.170> is<00:04:04.290> important

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
remember to count it truly is important

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.720 
remember to count it truly is important
and<00:04:05.090> as<00:04:06.140> you<00:04:07.140> practice<00:04:07.500> this<00:04:07.950> in<00:04:08.160> practice<00:04:08.370> in

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
and as you practice this in practice in

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.130 
and as you practice this in practice in
practice<00:04:09.239> that<00:04:09.360> you'll<00:04:09.540> be<00:04:09.660> able<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.930> do<00:04:10.110> a

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
practice that you'll be able to do a

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.160 
practice that you'll be able to do a
much<00:04:10.410> faster<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.580> really<00:04:11.790> sounds<00:04:12.239> cool<00:04:12.540> so

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
much faster and it really sounds cool so

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.040 
much faster and it really sounds cool so
keep<00:04:13.830> it<00:04:13.950> up
