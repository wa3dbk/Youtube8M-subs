boom<00:00:48.110> first<00:00:49.110> one<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.860> little<00:00:50.190> bit<00:00:50.280> rocket

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
boom first one a little bit rocket

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.780 
boom first one a little bit rocket
rocket<00:00:51.300> means<00:00:51.630> when<00:00:51.930> your<00:00:52.500> nose<00:00:52.980> goes<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.640> in

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
rocket means when your nose goes up in

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.120 
rocket means when your nose goes up in
the<00:00:53.820> air<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.270> your<00:00:54.420> tail<00:00:54.690> stays<00:00:55.020> down<00:00:55.350> and

the air but your tail stays down and

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.120 
the air but your tail stays down and
that's<00:00:56.640> obviously<00:00:57.120> not<00:00:57.210> ideal<00:00:57.600> because<00:00:58.130> you

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
that's obviously not ideal because you

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.260 
that's obviously not ideal because you
want<00:00:59.310> your<00:00:59.370> board<00:00:59.700> leveling<00:01:00.360> out<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.050> air

side<00:02:15.230> but<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.250> slow<00:02:17.120> motion<00:02:17.540> does<00:02:17.780> tell<00:02:18.200> all

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
side but the slow motion does tell all

side but the slow motion does tell all
so<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.490> work<00:02:19.820> you're<00:02:20.180> flicking<00:02:20.540> correctly<00:02:21.110> it

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
so you work you're flicking correctly it

so you work you're flicking correctly it
was<00:02:21.290> coming<00:02:21.680> off<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.010> nose<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.460> that<00:02:22.580> is

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
was coming off the nose and that is

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.700 
was coming off the nose and that is
super<00:02:23.000> important<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:24.140> other<00:02:24.290> thing<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:24.530> want

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
super important the other thing I want

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.050 
super important the other thing I want
to<00:02:24.740> point<00:02:24.830> out<00:02:25.070> about<00:02:25.310> this<00:02:25.490> is<00:02:25.670> look<00:02:25.790> at<00:02:25.910> my

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
to point out about this is look at my

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.690 
to point out about this is look at my
back<00:02:26.330> foot<00:02:26.630> my<00:02:27.320> back<00:02:27.530> foot<00:02:27.740> is<00:02:27.920> back<00:02:28.160> in<00:02:28.430> that

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
back foot my back foot is back in that

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.770 
back foot my back foot is back in that
pocket<00:02:29.080> that<00:02:30.080> is<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:31.010> very<00:02:31.880> important<00:02:32.570> about

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
pocket that is so very important about

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.080 
pocket that is so very important about
this<00:02:32.990> trick<00:02:33.260> I<00:02:33.380> cannot<00:02:33.830> even<00:02:34.130> begin<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.880> tell

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
this trick I cannot even begin to tell

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.280 
this trick I cannot even begin to tell
you<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.720> is<00:02:37.210> just<00:02:38.210> a<00:02:38.330> way<00:02:38.480> of<00:02:38.510> putting<00:02:39.170> your

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
you it is just a way of putting your

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.330 
you it is just a way of putting your
foot<00:02:39.470> back<00:02:39.680> there<00:02:39.950> that<00:02:40.130> helps<00:02:40.490> level<00:02:41.120> out<00:02:41.300> the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
foot back there that helps level out the

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.000 
foot back there that helps level out the
motion<00:02:43.340> from<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.820> pop<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.050> actual<00:02:45.620> flick

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
motion from the pop to the actual flick

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.400 
motion from the pop to the actual flick
of<00:02:46.190> your<00:02:46.310> front<00:02:46.550> foot<00:02:46.670> on<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.060> heel<00:02:47.330> flip<00:02:47.660> but

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
of your front foot on the heel flip but

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.570 
of your front foot on the heel flip but
the<00:02:48.530> other<00:02:48.560> thing<00:02:48.740> that<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.100> have<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:49.310> watch

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
the other thing that you have to watch

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.260 
the other thing that you have to watch
out<00:02:49.790> for<00:02:49.850> is<00:02:50.300> you<00:02:51.080> can<00:02:51.290> kind<00:02:51.530> of<00:02:51.970> flick<00:02:52.970> this

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
out for is you can kind of flick this

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.199 
out for is you can kind of flick this
trick<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.870> then<00:02:54.380> jump<00:02:54.709> forward<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.580> that's

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
trick and then jump forward and that's

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.540 
trick and then jump forward and that's
what<00:02:56.630> you're<00:02:56.780> doing<00:02:56.810> so<00:02:57.380> it's<00:02:57.980> like<00:02:58.160> if<00:02:58.340> you

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
what you're doing so it's like if you

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.729 
what you're doing so it's like if you
were<00:02:58.880> able<00:02:59.239> to<00:02:59.570> land<00:02:59.750> on<00:02:59.959> the<00:03:00.110> board<00:03:00.320> it<00:03:00.560> would

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
were able to land on the board it would

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.610 
were able to land on the board it would
be<00:03:00.860> just<00:03:01.160> your<00:03:01.489> heels<00:03:01.970> because<00:03:02.840> your<00:03:03.110> toes<00:03:03.380> are

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
be just your heels because your toes are

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.260 
be just your heels because your toes are
off<00:03:03.800> of<00:03:04.010> it<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:04.340> you're<00:03:04.489> coming<00:03:04.670> too<00:03:05.000> far

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
off of it and you're coming too far

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.600 
off of it and you're coming too far
forward<00:03:05.630> in<00:03:05.840> that<00:03:05.900> direction<00:03:06.440> so<00:03:07.310> this

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
forward in that direction so this

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.090 
forward in that direction so this
actually<00:03:07.850> comes<00:03:08.270> down<00:03:08.570> to<00:03:08.840> more<00:03:09.739> of<00:03:09.770> a<00:03:09.890> problem

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
actually comes down to more of a problem

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.090 
actually comes down to more of a problem
with<00:03:10.400> your<00:03:10.550> upper<00:03:11.060> body<00:03:11.390> so<00:03:12.320> what<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:12.739> have<00:03:12.770> to

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
with your upper body so what you have to

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.880 
with your upper body so what you have to
actually<00:03:13.250> do<00:03:13.610> is<00:03:13.790> before<00:03:14.110> you<00:03:15.110> pop<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.620> board

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
actually do is before you pop the board

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.150 
actually do is before you pop the board
you<00:03:16.580> have<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:16.910> be<00:03:17.030> set<00:03:17.390> up<00:03:17.420> in<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.780> certain

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
you have to be set up in a certain

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.130 
you have to be set up in a certain
motion<00:03:19.160> with<00:03:19.310> your<00:03:19.340> upper<00:03:19.760> body<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:20.330> it<00:03:20.900> means

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
motion with your upper body and it means

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.890 
motion with your upper body and it means
that<00:03:21.350> like<00:03:21.670> you're<00:03:22.670> going<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:22.970> bend<00:03:23.299> down<00:03:23.420> just

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
that like you're going to bend down just

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.720 
that like you're going to bend down just
like<00:03:24.019> you<00:03:24.170> normally<00:03:24.320> would<00:03:24.590> but<00:03:25.100> when<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:25.459> pop

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
like you normally would but when you pop

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.060 
like you normally would but when you pop
you're<00:03:26.180> going<00:03:26.480> to<00:03:26.600> be<00:03:26.780> more<00:03:27.350> as<00:03:27.560> if<00:03:27.620> you're

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
you're going to be more as if you're

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.190 
you're going to be more as if you're
going<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.310> jump<00:03:28.700> backwards<00:03:29.090> behind<00:03:29.660> you

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
going to jump backwards behind you

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.289 
going to jump backwards behind you
you're<00:03:30.799> not<00:03:30.920> going<00:03:31.340> to<00:03:31.670> actually<00:03:31.820> jump

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
you're not going to actually jump

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:33.699 
you're not going to actually jump
backwards<00:03:32.720> behind<00:03:32.870> you<00:03:33.170> but<00:03:33.320> that's<00:03:33.440> just

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
backwards behind you but that's just

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.770 
backwards behind you but that's just
kind<00:03:34.010> of<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.370> direction<00:03:34.850> that<00:03:35.330> you're<00:03:35.540> going

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
kind of the direction that you're going

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.110 
kind of the direction that you're going
to<00:03:35.900> pop<00:03:36.320> so<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:37.250> can<00:03:37.400> imagine<00:03:37.489> if<00:03:37.910> you<00:03:38.030> are

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
to pop so you can imagine if you are

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.449 
to pop so you can imagine if you are
standing<00:03:38.330> behind<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:39.290> skateboard<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:40.340> you

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
standing behind the skateboard and you

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.920 
standing behind the skateboard and you
put<00:03:40.640> your<00:03:40.670> back<00:03:40.940> foot<00:03:41.180> on<00:03:41.299> and<00:03:41.450> you<00:03:41.540> kicked<00:03:41.810> it

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
put your back foot on and you kicked it

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.979 
put your back foot on and you kicked it
forward<00:03:42.410> it<00:03:43.010> would<00:03:43.190> go<00:03:43.430> forward<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.780> whole

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
forward it would go forward the whole

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.229 
forward it would go forward the whole
idea<00:03:45.200> here<00:03:45.590> is<00:03:45.650> that<00:03:45.769> you<00:03:45.980> have<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.370> work<00:03:47.030> out

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
idea here is that you have to work out

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.289 
idea here is that you have to work out
how<00:03:47.570> to<00:03:47.630> get<00:03:47.900> the<00:03:48.110> board<00:03:48.530> more<00:03:49.310> in<00:03:49.519> front<00:03:50.060> of

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
how to get the board more in front of

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.340 
how to get the board more in front of
your<00:03:50.570> feet<00:03:51.040> or<00:03:52.040> ideally<00:03:53.000> obviously<00:03:53.780> right

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
your feet or ideally obviously right

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.770 
your feet or ideally obviously right
under<00:03:54.860> your<00:03:55.010> feet<00:03:55.150> so<00:03:56.150> you<00:03:56.239> have<00:03:56.360> to<00:03:56.450> work<00:03:56.600> out

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
under your feet so you have to work out

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.020 
under your feet so you have to work out
the<00:03:56.930> proper<00:03:57.410> balance<00:03:57.590> between<00:03:57.860> leaning<00:03:58.700> too

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
the proper balance between leaning too

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.990 
the proper balance between leaning too
far<00:03:59.060> back<00:03:59.570> not<00:04:00.470> far<00:04:00.920> back<00:04:01.160> far<00:04:01.459> enough<00:04:01.489> and

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
far back not far back far enough and

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.420 
far back not far back far enough and
leaning<00:04:02.330> forward<00:04:02.840> to<00:04:03.170> far<00:04:03.470> enough<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:03.920> by

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
leaning forward to far enough and by
