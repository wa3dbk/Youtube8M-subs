00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.420
 will be radiant 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.240
 - I consider that most of us want 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.270
 have a skin 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.640

 points that I will be giving you go of the 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.730
 hand does not have a specific order but 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.990
 There can not be I consider myself one without 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.710
 other 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.710
 and then let's move on 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.480
 I consider this one of the most 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.920
 important that I will mention them 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.370
 depending on the type of skin either 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.930
 mixed dry or sensitive fat is the 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.910
 product that you are going to be using 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.160
 it will not give the same result 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.770
 use a girl with oily skin 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.380
 use products 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.200
 and specific for dry skin that 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.540
 needs more humidification or recover 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.160
 those oils that your body does not produce 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:02.950
 naturally in contrast to oily skin 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.320
 produces them in excess and also of 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.930
 according to the age that we have a skin 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.090
 of a girl of 15 or 18 years old is not going to 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.910
 have the same needs or 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.670
 same problems as a lady of 40 or 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:19.180
 50 years young skin only needs a 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.450
 sunscreen market and cleaning nothing 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.300
 plus 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.520
 Instead a lady from 40 to 50 years and 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.930
 it has spots already has wrinkles already has 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.369
 skin without so much firmness 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.500
 so the needs are 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.450
 completely different is recommended 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.660
 use more specific products 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.780
 from 25 or 30 years since 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.210
 our skin reached the maximum 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.850
 development growth not before then the 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.390
 skin does not have as many problems as many 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.390
 needs 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.980
 no matter what type of skin you have 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.140
 you must moisturize or moisturize your skin 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.970
 some girls that have oily skin 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.280
 they have the belief that like their skin 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.320
 it produces fat plus they do not need 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.200
 increase hydrate it but this is 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.690
 completely false, even though 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.190
 they have fat on their skin you can see them 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:11.430
 he accepted nothing you notice them dry scaled and 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.090
 that is a symptom or sign that they are missing 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.010
 apply a moisturizer in addition if you are 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.800
 used to using base 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.250
 makeup is necessary to apply a 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.430
 increases before before so that the 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.230
 result is much better and the base is 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.650
 better case 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.780
 diffuses better on your skin and also not the 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.970
 going to absorb is going to stay in place 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.970
 and it's going to give you that coverage that you need 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.890
 and the exfoliants are a product that does not 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.770
 must be missing in our routine 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.410
 cleaning because they help to remove the 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.709
 dead cells that accumulate 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.840
 with the passage of time that they have left that 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.880
 freshness and shine to our skin it 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.950
 recommends doing exfoliation is between 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.290
 once a week or once every two 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.880
 weeks depending on the needs that 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.500
 go presenting your skin is not very 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.840
 I recommend doing more than one 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.850
 exfoliation in a week then you're going to be 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.920
 a counterproductive effect for your skin 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.920
 you are going to subtract it or you are going to remove it 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.470
 too many oils and what is going to do 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.030
 skin will try to wait for us 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.030
 producing even more fat 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.160
 the cleaning of our skin is something that 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.830
 we do every day we have 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.470
 made up or not and even more if we 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.630
 make up then in the night our 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.390
 skin is when it regenerates and absorbs 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.510
 everything that you have left in the 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.070
 skin and that society or some cream 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.440
 after having washed you so not 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.870
 you wanted labarthe and you left him the 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.610
 makeup or society your skin a day 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.830
 next you will be charged the bill 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.200
 and it's going to look off it's going to look 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.620
 life is going to look dull you're going to 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.360
 exit black spots by obstructing or 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.450
 granites then 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.640
 to prevent all that is better to wash 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.230
 face every day with some soap 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.230
 neutral some mild soap 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.960
 And finally it is advisable to give it a 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.690
 Delicate treatment to our face especially 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.910
 to the area of ​​our eyes that the skin is 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.220
 very thin, she is very sensitive and 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.080
 Wrinkle very easily is recommended 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.750
 use circular movements of 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.760
 center outward and upward and 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.640
 also in our neck to serve 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.850
 this to prevent our skin from losing 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.920
 firmness to hang us and also to 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.990
 Avoid wrinkles when they are drying their 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.770
 face do not rub it or the waist with the 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.640
 towel 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.050

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.240
 of moisture I let it dry alone 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.790
