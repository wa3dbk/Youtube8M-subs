no<00:00:37.020> question<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.469> my<00:00:37.500> mind<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.100> fight

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
no question in my mind that this fight

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.920 
no question in my mind that this fight
is<00:00:38.460> about<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.760> terrible<00:00:39.000> choices<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.780> the

I just don't see it strategically making
much<00:01:54.840> sense<00:01:54.869> ah<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.189> don't<00:01:56.369> think

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
much sense ah so you just don't think

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.530 
much sense ah so you just don't think
that<00:01:56.700> there<00:01:56.909> are<00:01:56.939> for<00:01:57.390> example<00:01:57.450> resources<00:01:58.439> or

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
that there are for example resources or

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.880 
that there are for example resources or
strategic<00:02:00.540> alliances<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.320> would<00:02:01.680> make

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
strategic alliances that would make

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.410 
strategic alliances that would make
sense<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.250> even<00:02:02.369> get<00:02:02.790> involved<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.329> that's

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
sense to even get involved and that's

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.289 
sense to even get involved and that's
really<00:02:03.659> what<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> US<00:02:04.170> cares<00:02:04.409> about<00:02:04.680> yeah<00:02:05.219> um<00:02:05.549> I

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
really what the US cares about yeah um I

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.320 
really what the US cares about yeah um I
also<00:02:06.719> think<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.740> mean<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.310> do<00:02:08.459> think<00:02:08.910> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
also think that I mean I I do think the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.390 
also think that I mean I I do think the
rebels<00:02:09.690> should<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:10.080> should<00:02:10.440> be<00:02:10.470> helped<00:02:10.890> more

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
rebels should be should be helped more

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
rebels should be should be helped more
than<00:02:11.459> they're<00:02:11.670> being<00:02:11.819> helped<00:02:12.060> now<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.180> think

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
than they're being helped now I think

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.790 
than they're being helped now I think
the<00:02:12.720> atrocities<00:02:13.290> of

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
the atrocities of

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.400 
the atrocities of
dictator<00:02:14.310> pretty<00:02:15.060> heinous<00:02:15.240> but<00:02:15.630> i<00:02:15.810> will<00:02:16.200> say

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
dictator pretty heinous but i will say

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.750 
dictator pretty heinous but i will say
that<00:02:16.440> what<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.860> US<00:02:17.130> should<00:02:17.160> be<00:02:17.430> worried<00:02:17.700> about

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
that what the US should be worried about

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.530 
that what the US should be worried about
is<00:02:18.180> who<00:02:18.810> ends<00:02:19.050> up<00:02:19.140> in<00:02:19.320> power<00:02:19.560> after<00:02:20.040> uh<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.510> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
is who ends up in power after uh the the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.710 
is who ends up in power after uh the the
coup<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.470> done<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.340> today<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:23.970> did<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.450> end

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
coup is done and today that did that end

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.360 
coup is done and today that did that end
the<00:02:24.930> time<00:02:25.170> would<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.560> make<00:02:25.770> sense<00:02:26.100> for<00:02:26.160> the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
the time would it make sense for the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.640 
the time would it make sense for the
u.s.<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.790> get<00:02:26.970> involved<00:02:27.480> if<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:28.230> in<00:02:28.350> order<00:02:28.500> to

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
u.s. to get involved if to in order to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.190 
u.s. to get involved if to in order to
have<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:29.220> say<00:02:29.790> as<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.300> know<00:02:30.390> influence<00:02:30.840> over

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
have a say as you know influence over

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.090 
have a say as you know influence over
who<00:02:31.530> ends<00:02:32.010> up<00:02:32.100> in<00:02:32.250> power<00:02:32.780> arm<00:02:33.780> well<00:02:34.560> that's<00:02:34.710> uh

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
who ends up in power arm well that's uh

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.460 
who ends up in power arm well that's uh
potentially<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:35.940> slippery<00:02:36.360> slope<00:02:36.630> uh<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.380> don't

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
potentially a slippery slope uh I don't

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.170 
potentially a slippery slope uh I don't
know<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:37.890> mean<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.280> don't<00:02:38.520> really<00:02:38.670> have<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.910> red

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
know I mean I don't really have a red

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.750 
know I mean I don't really have a red
line<00:02:39.450> i<00:02:39.480> think<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.260> uh<00:02:40.560> saying<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.580> red

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
line i think that uh saying that the red

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.960 
line i think that uh saying that the red
line<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.720> use<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.350> chemical<00:02:44.160> weapons<00:02:44.190> is

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
line is the use of chemical weapons is

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.820 
line is the use of chemical weapons is
basically<00:02:45.780> saying<00:02:46.050> that<00:02:46.170> it's<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.470> red<00:02:46.620> line

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
basically saying that it's a red line

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.310 
basically saying that it's a red line
for<00:02:46.860> humanitarian<00:02:47.820> reasons<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.660> at<00:02:49.140> that

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
for humanitarian reasons and at that

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.650 
for humanitarian reasons and at that
point<00:02:49.620> uh<00:02:49.920> then<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.730> certainly<00:02:51.210> becomes

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
point uh then it certainly becomes

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.480 
point uh then it certainly becomes
hypocritical<00:02:52.380> because<00:02:52.500> look<00:02:52.890> at<00:02:52.980> all<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.190> the

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
hypocritical because look at all of the

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.250 
hypocritical because look at all of the
plot<00:02:53.760> x<00:02:53.940> we<00:02:54.210> could<00:02:54.390> have<00:02:54.480> gotten<00:02:54.660> involved<00:02:54.960> for

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
plot x we could have gotten involved for

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.020 
plot x we could have gotten involved for
humanitarian<00:02:55.950> reasons<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.580> we<00:02:56.730> didn't

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
humanitarian reasons that we didn't

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.910 
humanitarian reasons that we didn't
because<00:02:57.330> there<00:02:57.480> wasn't<00:02:57.660> also<00:02:58.200> some<00:02:58.440> resource

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
because there wasn't also some resource

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.160 
because there wasn't also some resource
or<00:02:59.490> strategic<00:03:00.360> alliance<00:03:00.840> though<00:03:00.990> i<00:03:01.050> don't

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
or strategic alliance though i don't

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.100 
or strategic alliance though i don't
think<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:01.740> fact<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.000> reason<00:03:03.480> not<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.990> get

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
think that fact is a reason not to get

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.350 
think that fact is a reason not to get
involved<00:03:04.440> in<00:03:04.830> one<00:03:05.100> particular<00:03:05.820> case<00:03:06.090> now

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
involved in one particular case now

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.840 
involved in one particular case now
certainly<00:03:07.020> it's<00:03:07.680> unlikely<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.610> US

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
certainly it's unlikely that the US

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.190 
certainly it's unlikely that the US
would<00:03:09.000> get<00:03:09.150> involved<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:09.600> every<00:03:09.840> case<00:03:09.990> i'm

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
would get involved in every case i'm

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.780 
would get involved in every case i'm
just<00:03:10.380> concerned<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.250> lot<00:03:11.460> of<00:03:11.580> people

something uh in this case for
humanitarian<00:03:23.070> reasons<00:03:23.100> i<00:03:23.550> would<00:03:23.700> say<00:03:23.940> that

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
humanitarian reasons i would say that

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.270 
humanitarian reasons i would say that
what<00:03:24.959> lewis<00:03:25.230> is<00:03:25.380> saying<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.800> probably<00:03:26.160> a

what lewis is saying is probably a

what lewis is saying is probably a
factor<00:03:26.760> here<00:03:27.060> i<00:03:27.209> would<00:03:27.959> expect<00:03:28.050> an

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
factor here i would expect an

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.920 
factor here i would expect an
