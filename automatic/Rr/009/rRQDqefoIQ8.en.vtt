00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
have the river that some areas the river

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.880 
have the river that some areas the river
was<00:01:24.540> freezing<00:01:24.930> up<00:01:25.049> some<00:01:25.229> areas<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.650> creeks

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
was freezing up some areas of the creeks

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.010 
was freezing up some areas of the creeks
froze<00:01:26.820> up<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.299> have<00:01:27.420> all<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.630> ice<00:01:27.780> that

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
froze up so you have all the ice that

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.170 
froze up so you have all the ice that
came<00:01:28.170> into<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.829> river<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.520> top<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.030> that

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
came into the the river on top of that

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.420 
came into the the river on top of that
the<00:01:30.420> dam<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.659> doing<00:01:31.110> control<00:01:31.439> releases<00:01:32.250> which

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the dam is doing control releases which

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.490 
the dam is doing control releases which
is<00:01:32.579> stirring<00:01:32.939> up<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.150> mud<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.049> sediment

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
is stirring up the mud and the sediment

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.920 
is stirring up the mud and the sediment
so<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.979> intake<00:01:35.430> system<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:36.329> pulls<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.780> water

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
so the intake system it pulls the water

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.170 
so the intake system it pulls the water
that<00:01:37.530> are<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.829> island<00:01:38.040> creek<00:01:38.189> bridge<00:01:38.430> into
