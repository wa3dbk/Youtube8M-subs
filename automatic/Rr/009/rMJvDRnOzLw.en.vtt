and i sees epically failing here pretty

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.329 
and i sees epically failing here pretty
self-explanatory<00:01:03.650> we<00:01:04.650> ought<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.769> both<00:01:05.040> too

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
self-explanatory we ought to both too

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.280 
self-explanatory we ought to both too
sticky<00:01:05.610> through<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.030> hole<00:01:06.270> here<00:01:06.299> let's

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
sticky through this hole here let's

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.810 
sticky through this hole here let's
start<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.650> gotta<00:01:07.799> try<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.010> follow<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.520> middle

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
start you gotta try to follow the middle

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.670 
start you gotta try to follow the middle
line<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.270> then<00:01:09.360> make<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> jump<00:01:09.900> off<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.229> top<00:01:10.439> on

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
line and then make a jump off the top on

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.390 
line and then make a jump off the top on
the<00:01:10.860> antenna<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:12.360> do<00:01:12.570> get<00:01:13.070> say<00:01:14.070> if<00:01:14.340> you

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
the antenna if you do get say if you

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.679 
the antenna if you do get say if you
pass<00:01:15.500> to<00:01:16.500> first<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.400> first<00:01:17.640> obstacle<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.450> on

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
pass to first the first obstacle and on

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.140 
pass to first the first obstacle and on
your<00:01:18.869> second<00:01:19.710> obstacle<00:01:19.979> which<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.549> going<00:01:21.090> to

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
your second obstacle which is going to

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.460 
your second obstacle which is going to
make<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.299> through<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.630> rocks<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.110> under<00:01:22.290> 10

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
make it through the rocks in under 10

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.760 
make it through the rocks in under 10
seconds

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
seconds

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.279 
seconds
then<00:01:24.759> you<00:01:25.000> can<00:01:25.180> forge<00:01:25.479> ball<00:01:25.719> back<00:01:25.960> or<00:01:26.170> whatever

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
then you can forge ball back or whatever

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.020 
then you can forge ball back or whatever
I<00:01:26.500> don't<00:01:26.560> care<00:01:26.740> actually<00:01:27.700> if<00:01:27.789> I'm<00:01:27.909> playing

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
I don't care actually if I'm playing

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.490 
I don't care actually if I'm playing
force<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.750> whole<00:01:28.899> making<00:01:29.109> it<00:01:29.259> through<00:01:29.409> in

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
force the whole making it through in

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.929 
force the whole making it through in
under<00:01:29.740> 10<00:01:29.920> seconds<00:01:30.310> doesn't<00:01:30.609> really<00:01:30.670> matter

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
under 10 seconds doesn't really matter

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.660 
under 10 seconds doesn't really matter
but<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.780> one<00:01:31.960> rule<00:01:32.229> is<00:01:32.439> you<00:01:32.560> can't<00:01:32.590> if<00:01:33.280> you

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
but the one rule is you can't if you

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.399 
but the one rule is you can't if you
want<00:01:33.880> you<00:01:34.030> can<00:01:34.179> jump<00:01:34.450> off<00:01:34.630> of<00:01:34.659> this<00:01:34.899> passageway

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
want you can jump off of this passageway

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:36.929 
want you can jump off of this passageway
and<00:01:35.530> get<00:01:35.740> straight<00:01:35.979> to<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.189> end<00:01:36.369> but<00:01:36.700> you're

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
and get straight to the end but you're

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.929 
and get straight to the end but you're
not<00:01:37.000> allowed<00:01:37.119> to<00:01:37.240> do<00:01:37.420> that<00:01:37.600> that's<00:01:38.170> cheating

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
not allowed to do that that's cheating

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.919 
not allowed to do that that's cheating
but<00:01:39.939> ride<00:01:40.240> your<00:01:40.450> Mongoose<00:01:40.840> along<00:01:41.200> here<00:01:41.679> and

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
but ride your Mongoose along here and

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.840 
but ride your Mongoose along here and
it's<00:01:43.929> a<00:01:44.020> ghost<00:01:44.289> and<00:01:44.740> watch<00:01:44.950> him<00:01:45.130> epically<00:01:45.579> fail

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
it's a ghost and watch him epically fail

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.940 
it's a ghost and watch him epically fail
the<00:01:46.060> easiest<00:01:46.569> jump<00:01:46.810> ever<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.659> again<00:01:50.560> i'm<00:01:50.799> not

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
the easiest jump ever but again i'm not

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.169 
the easiest jump ever but again i'm not
quite<00:01:51.130> sure<00:01:51.159> if<00:01:51.310> he's<00:01:51.549> planning<00:01:51.700> on<00:01:51.850> doing<00:01:52.090> if

skill I mean the jumps you had to be

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.470 
skill I mean the jumps you had to be
able<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:17.019> do<00:03:17.169> the<00:03:17.290> jobs<00:03:18.030> this<00:03:19.030> is<00:03:19.150> probably<00:03:19.359> the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
able to do the jobs this is probably the

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.300 
able to do the jobs this is probably the
closest<00:03:19.900> do<00:03:20.049> is<00:03:20.169> to<00:03:20.349> lock<00:03:20.590> right<00:03:20.859> here<00:03:21.099> writing

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
closest do is to lock right here writing
