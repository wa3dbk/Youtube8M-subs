00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.020 

so<00:03:24.460> now<00:03:24.580> we<00:03:24.640> can<00:03:24.940> adjust<00:03:25.390> our<00:03:26.050> website<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:27.790> the

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
so now we can adjust our website to the

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.000 
so now we can adjust our website to the
size<00:03:28.270> of<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.840> slideshow<00:03:29.110> I'm<00:03:29.830> just<00:03:30.010> gonna

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
size of the slideshow I'm just gonna

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.309 
size of the slideshow I'm just gonna
quickly<00:03:31.760> adjust<00:03:32.750> this<00:03:32.900> by<00:03:33.620> eye

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.680 

and<00:03:37.829> now<00:03:37.980> when<00:03:38.159> we<00:03:38.189> go<00:03:38.459> into<00:03:38.579> preview

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.210 

the<00:03:43.140> slideshow<00:03:43.440> will<00:03:43.830> be<00:03:43.950> in<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.160> proper<00:03:44.400> spot

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.970 

so<00:03:48.820> making<00:03:49.090> this<00:03:49.360> box<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:50.470> size<00:03:50.740> of<00:03:50.890> the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
so making this box the size of the

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.250 
so making this box the size of the
slideshow<00:03:51.220> isn't<00:03:51.820> required<00:03:52.150> but<00:03:52.570> it<00:03:53.110> will

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
slideshow isn't required but it will

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.010 
slideshow isn't required but it will
make<00:03:53.470> design<00:03:54.010> much<00:03:54.340> easier<00:03:54.760> and<00:03:55.060> that's

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
make design much easier and that's

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.580 
make design much easier and that's
basically<00:03:56.440> how<00:03:56.560> you<00:03:56.710> add<00:03:57.040> Picasa<00:03:58.470> using<00:03:59.470> the

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
basically how you add Picasa using the

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.180 
basically how you add Picasa using the
HTML<00:04:00.280> code<00:04:00.610> fragment
