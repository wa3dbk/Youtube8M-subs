like you know such a severe injury that

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.220 
like you know such a severe injury that
I<00:02:17.370> couldn't<00:02:17.910> they<00:02:18.570> didn't<00:02:18.810> know<00:02:18.900> if<00:02:18.990> I<00:02:19.080> was

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
I couldn't they didn't know if I was

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.560 
I couldn't they didn't know if I was
gonna<00:02:19.380> play<00:02:19.860> again<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.340> just<00:02:20.910> had<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.450> know<00:02:21.510> a

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
gonna play again I just had a you know a

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.710 
gonna play again I just had a you know a
fracture<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.230> my<00:02:22.850> fibula<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.120> last<00:02:24.270> time<00:02:24.480> and

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
fracture and my fibula the last time and

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.480 
fracture and my fibula the last time and
I<00:02:25.200> think<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:25.590> everybody<00:02:25.800> recovers<00:02:26.340> from

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
I think that everybody recovers from

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.060 
I think that everybody recovers from
that<00:02:26.700> so<00:02:26.970> that's<00:02:27.720> why<00:02:27.840> why<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.650> was<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:28.980> little

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
that so that's why why I was a little

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.400 
that so that's why why I was a little
upset<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:30.030> know<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.840> part<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.140> didn't

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
upset and I know the part I didn't

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.560 
upset and I know the part I didn't
understand<00:02:31.800> that<00:02:31.920> much<00:02:32.100> but<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:32.670> know<00:02:33.240> in<00:02:33.480> the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
understand that much but I know in the

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.870 
understand that much but I know in the
first<00:02:33.690> few<00:02:33.990> months<00:02:34.110> I<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:35.250> wasn't<00:02:35.580> me<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.700> I

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
first few months I it wasn't me I I

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.180
