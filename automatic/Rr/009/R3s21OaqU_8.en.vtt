00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.570
 we are called every game to play 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.610
 to win 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.980
 this is the goal and we prepare ourselves in 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.660
 this sense we knew today to face 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.010
 a bari who beat Brescia 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.810
 beat the Sienna beat the pescara 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.670
 in the last game the team that is 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.800
 fast secure and closes the spaces well e 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.090
 restarts with great speed and skill e 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.390
 a team that has been playing together for longer 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.760
 years 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.369
 today we had to do one necessarily 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.079
 great performance unfortunately we wanted 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.399
 leave strong but have some wrong 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.230
 too much support in the first half e 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.129
 this has created us too much 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.350
 apprehension 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.300
 we have lost the patterns of circumvention 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.800
 on the external things I had 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.620
 prepared we asked insistently 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.239
 to go around this 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.680
 wall that appeared in the phase of 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.719
 not possession so we had to be more 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.629
 unfortunately, some fast and able 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.980
 too much support has created us some 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.699
 lack of serenity and this should not 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.109
 to happen 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.180
 we still had some chances 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.800
 in the first half then in the interval ci 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.000
 we are called a little something the boys are 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.339
 they did a great job 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.680
 Performance of the second half we 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.909
 we have produced arrembanti 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.970
 we have come close to the advantage 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.530
 then after several situations we are there 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.229
 you got pity about this ball 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.150
 thrown out there is a carom with a eurogol 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.650
 of social galanum matches that there 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.090
 Captain own goal by 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.280
 opponents but this is also part of the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.619
 uncertain of the moments of the season can 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.060
 no it happens that yes it happens but 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.490
 the important thing is that the team has 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.380
 resumed playing hammering we have 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.320
 changed something on the outside in the middle 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.930
 to the field to try to have to force 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.180
 further from competition and good guys 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.159
 who have entered and but the spirit that has 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.570
 put the team to the bottom and then 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.180
 still taking the lead 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.490
 is to show that we want there 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.509
 we believe we definitely have to work 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.159
 now above all we are 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.420
 catching up some players we still have 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.280
 growth margins because some 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.140
 boy obviously a little further back 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.380
 having been away from the fields for 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.149
 physical problems and must recover 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.280
 better nail polish though 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.130
 we are working on and with this 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.590
 mentality this spirit we must e 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.690
 let them show Pauline is a boy what 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.280
 unfortunately we counted a lot 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.180
 unfortunate he took as a bad 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.730
 blow to the rib not easy intervention 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.190
 in a nice ugly against the trapani that 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.290
 it cost the fracture lesion to 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.650
 rib and kept it off for several 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.629
 months 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.280
 and clear that for a guy like him who 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.900
 he was playing he was having the right one 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.560
 continuity was coming into the right 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.470
 condition 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.790
 it was an incredible blow too 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.720
 why see the comrades who play 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.129
 they make goals 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.690
 and you're out is never easy 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.160
 especially for a young guy like 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.349
 he is particularly happy today 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.080
 happy because he is a boy on whom 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.060
 we are working on is resuming the 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.209
 right spirit the right nail polish and me 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.250
 I hope this goal can be a 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.379
 good omen for your continuation e 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.379
 ours because we have some arrows in 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.120
 more to pull from the bow even if they are 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.349
 regretted angry today because 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.909
 I did not like the admonition 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.830
 the admonition of lafferty because certain 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.090
 errors and we can not grant them 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.400
 to the others we face a game 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.379
 difficult important on a warm field 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.840
 such as this has the 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.780
 this one has and lose players like this 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.120
 it is not a thing I like and therefore 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.709
 so we will talk about it in 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.090
 week then the whole team grew up 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.769
 in speed in 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.290
 ball transmission speed of 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.030
 going to always search for the computer 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.260
 let's say quality wrong with less 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.410
 supports and this has meant that 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.599
 maybe we could be more incisive but 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.250
 I always prepare two matches a first 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.489
 game in a way but I always keep 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.810
 some arrows to the bow to be able to then 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.420
 to be able to change it because otherwise 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.310
 risk of being inferiority 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.769
 numerical of not having the possibility then 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.299
 when the opponents maybe more passes the 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.030
 more time they can drop a bit like 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.530
 intensity because they obviously start with 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.120
 shoot all the best wishes 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.099
 opponents and then slowly making it 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.810
 it is clear that spaces can open up and 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.310
 it is clear that you must be there at that moment 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.680
 have some more arrows and be able to 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.930
 force to go even more to attack 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.000
 matches to take them to your side 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.200
 we are very happy though 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.610
 let's look immediately at the next engagement 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.739
 because a team is waiting for us 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.500
 difficult game very difficult on 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.319
 a very difficult field for her for the 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.540
 its conformation because it is synthetic 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.280
 but very very particular and difficult 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.959
 so we'll have to get ready in the week 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.000
 consequently this is part of a little 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.490
 every team that plays with this 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.570
 worry with this pressure and it's clear 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.139
 that when you leave with the best 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.639
 auspices wins but it is not so but it is not 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.990
 so because it wasn't for juve 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.270
 it was not for other noble teams 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.620
 who went to b b of torino that there 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.450
 took four years to return to 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.340
 serie a see bologna see other teams 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:43.050
 we can the list is very long in 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:45.120
 this sense and therefore this must be done 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.620
 pressure to understand but at the same time 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.760
 go there especially go to work 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.360
 above with 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.850
 slightest possible light mentality 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.230
 without having these things taken away from 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.130
 head going into the field because then 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:01.290
 field if you go with an excessive short 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.580
 anxiety and this makes you a little wrong 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.840
 the more we must always have 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.880
 a high density possession speed of 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.590
 possession in this is clear that the 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.180
 precision then becomes fundamental 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.010
 serenity has become a component 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.900
 also important, however, is that 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.460
 we have reacted to this too 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.460
 situation and we turned it over
