00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.859
 hello gangsters with you panda today 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.360
 us fight zeus of against here soon by the way 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.400
 I would immediately quarrel with geiba 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.929
 because I don't know why but he did 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.580
 tuskar of balls are so long 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.440
 so long they gather and ring 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.060
 here still shines on your screen this 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.830
 just impossible any fool has time 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.630
 this ball to escape the same way 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.180
 the problem is lately observed and 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.010
 heaven spoke again shaker like you 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.560
 you throw her and she flies almost immediately to 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.340
 a delay of several milliseconds may 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.619
 play but 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.820
 a bad joke with a shaker the same of 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.980
 tuskar he has this ball 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.960
 rolls so long it is impossible 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.230
 watch this on the tuskar of team also 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.690
 played an invoker who didn't quite understand 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.700
 what he needs to do seems and 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.070
 I did not pump for a long time 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.539
 the last skill that is in communication 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.489
 no spells are not cast the Lord 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.350
 of this we even scared to talk in the same 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.250
 the team were zeus and pugna and pugna 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.090
 It goes well perhaps Zeus 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.890
 the only good option for zeus 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.739
 it would be either scared or outworld devourer 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.290
 which could restore mana there 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.270
 pugna closes in by the way 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.340
 cast into astral and zeus and just wild 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.290
 consider their opponents 0 can not 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.930
 forget about the fact that 4 ulta zeus is 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.080
 very strong practically on respawn 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.909
 can kill well tuskar tenacious but if 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.490
 they bought a clock maybe they would have 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.830
 everything is much better yet not pipe 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.600
 not thin not even the cheapest clock for 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.460
 five hundred fifty gold 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.869
 no one bought therefore they are very much 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.390
 president of magical damage and did not have 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.710
 almost no chance to be honest 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.600
 before tusk was playing much 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.970
 more interesting because the balls rolled quickly 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.710
 the game was more dynamic now i'm not 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.390
 I understand this bug or correctly done on 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.610
 but what if it is properly done porridge 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.710
 wrong but nevertheless i really don't 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.570
 I liked the new system of balls therefore 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.390
 tuskar and looked very insecure and 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.920
 weakly the very beginning of zeus began 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.630
 dominate everything until the end it 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.460
 continued with the advent of ultsessno 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.140
 the game has become even simpler the only negative 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.820
 the fact that some guys specifically 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.009
 waiting for the creator of the last devesa 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.020
 to compose but it is on their conscience 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.460
 ok guys thanks for watching 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.189
