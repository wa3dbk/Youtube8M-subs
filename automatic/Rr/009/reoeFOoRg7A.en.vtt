output that stuff is expensive let's

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.749 
output that stuff is expensive let's
take<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.789> closer<00:00:30.210> look<00:00:30.359> at<00:00:30.750> what<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:30.990> got<00:00:31.759> well

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
lights the output is 300 Watts but in

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.869 
lights the output is 300 Watts but in
energy<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.879> only<00:00:42.090> uses<00:00:42.450> 68<00:00:43.440> watts<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.250> it's

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
energy it only uses 68 watts and it's

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.680 
energy it only uses 68 watts and it's
good<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.510> ten<00:00:45.870> thousand<00:00:46.559> hours<00:00:47.690> lasts

this<00:01:20.460> light<00:01:20.670> bulb<00:01:20.970> takes<00:01:21.420> 68<00:01:22.049> watts<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.560> energy

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
this light bulb takes 68 watts of energy

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.850 
this light bulb takes 68 watts of energy
versus<00:01:25.430> 240-watt<00:01:27.799> neon<00:01:28.799> bulbs<00:01:29.490> which<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.090> 80

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
versus 240-watt neon bulbs which is 80

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.520 
versus 240-watt neon bulbs which is 80
it<00:01:31.860> lights<00:01:32.250> up<00:01:32.490> my<00:01:32.549> old<00:01:32.970> garage<00:01:33.390> really<00:01:34.229> bright
