00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
guess in a sense this is very similar to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.059 
guess in a sense this is very similar to
the<00:01:47.810> one<00:01:47.929> in<00:01:47.959> black<00:01:48.229> ops<00:01:48.410> 2<00:01:48.530> that<00:01:48.770> had<00:01:48.920> like

put<00:01:54.410> on<00:01:54.530> any<00:01:54.709> attachments<00:01:55.340> because<00:01:55.429> you<00:01:55.640> have

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
put on any attachments because you have

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.249 
put on any attachments because you have
to<00:01:55.880> use<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.090> m16<00:01:56.569> with<00:01:56.599> those<00:01:56.989> two

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
to use the m16 with those two

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.020 
to use the m16 with those two
attachments<00:01:57.860> you<00:01:57.890> get<00:01:58.099> it<00:01:58.220> so<00:01:58.670> with<00:01:58.940> that

going to have no attachments on it so

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.790 
going to have no attachments on it so
that's<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.450> downfall<00:02:02.720> so<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:03.200> can't<00:02:03.530> put<00:02:03.679> on

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
that's the downfall so you can't put on

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.770 
that's the downfall so you can't put on
a<00:02:03.830> suppressor<00:02:04.340> or<00:02:04.369> anything<00:02:04.759> so<00:02:05.479> it's<00:02:05.509> going

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
a suppressor or anything so it's going

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.180 
a suppressor or anything so it's going
to<00:02:05.869> stay<00:02:06.020> like<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.440> way<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.679> is<00:02:06.800> right<00:02:07.129> now

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
to stay like the way it is right now

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.850 
to stay like the way it is right now
also<00:02:08.149> another<00:02:08.360> downside<00:02:08.690> is<00:02:09.140> you<00:02:09.319> cannot<00:02:09.679> use

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
also another downside is you cannot use

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.860 
also another downside is you cannot use
any<00:02:10.099> first<00:02:10.429> perk<00:02:10.670> besides<00:02:11.060> bling<00:02:11.390> since<00:02:11.720> you

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
like what they're doing I like how the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.340 
like what they're doing I like how the
game<00:02:39.740> is<00:02:39.950> now<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.430> like<00:02:41.360> how<00:02:41.870> they're<00:02:42.080> adding

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
game is now I like how they're adding

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.750 
game is now I like how they're adding
all<00:02:42.470> this<00:02:42.590> stuff<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.070> I<00:02:43.340> think<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.640> reason

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
all this stuff and I think the reason

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.340 
all this stuff and I think the reason
why<00:02:43.940> they<00:02:44.060> chose<00:02:44.210> extended<00:02:44.630> magazine<00:02:44.960> shotgun

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
why they chose extended magazine shotgun

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.800 
why they chose extended magazine shotgun
is<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.800> think<00:02:46.130> you<00:02:46.670> cannot<00:02:47.060> use<00:02:47.180> those<00:02:47.390> combos

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
is I think you cannot use those combos

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.050 
is I think you cannot use those combos
normally<00:02:48.380> or<00:02:48.500> maybe<00:02:48.710> you<00:02:48.860> can<00:02:49.130> don't<00:02:49.730> quote<00:02:49.880> me

on<00:02:50.090> this<00:02:50.210> but<00:02:50.360> I<00:02:50.930> think<00:02:51.080> why<00:02:51.320> they<00:02:51.440> chose<00:02:51.650> them

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
on this but I think why they chose them

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.740 
on this but I think why they chose them
is<00:02:52.070> also<00:02:52.610> who<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.880> fuck<00:02:53.060> is<00:02:53.180> gonna<00:02:53.330> run<00:02:53.570> that

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
is also who the fuck is gonna run that

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.900 
is also who the fuck is gonna run that
honestly<00:02:54.560> who<00:02:55.100> is<00:02:55.250> gonna<00:02:55.370> run<00:02:55.610> those<00:02:55.760> two

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
honestly who is gonna run those two
