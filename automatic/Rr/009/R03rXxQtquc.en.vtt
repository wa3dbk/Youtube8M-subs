 are the saf fields of the diocese of Verona 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.480
 a campofontana a time to have fun 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.519
 between dances and games but also for 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.949
 to share in the care duties of 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.230
 home and above all to think about 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.600
 relationships with others and with God 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.050
 an experience that allows a young person 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.630
 to look around for a while to open 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.119
 also its own horizon to do 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.980
 experience of a church that goes to 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.130
 beyond their own parish of the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.160
 universal church which is beautiful that it is 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.129
 lively that which opens relationships that 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.710
 helps young people look to watch a 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.020
 little further than one's nose 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.260
 must understand who as a Syrian with i 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.520
 parents with their friends with god and for 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.620
 then take flight and that's what 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.039
 we want to get as a result and 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.610
 problems Thursday we project towards 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.010
 the future 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.780
 the first 2 weeks are dedicated to 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.699
 middle school kids and then space a 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.040
 four camps for teenagers per 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.229
 a summer of knowledge 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.310
 of oneself of the others opening of the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.080
 discovery of god 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.229
 what you see in the background the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.700
 hill of silence where the thing 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.590
 fundamental is not actually in 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.350
 silence machines silence you can 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.720
 meet in the silence the boys of the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.210
 fields know they meet the gentleman 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.549
 go meet the priests who are 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.860
 devote period week to listen to them 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.490
 to receive their confessions 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.130
 confidences what they want from the heart 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.020
 to truly tell both priests and 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.659
 ladies a little those on which we aim 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.000
 to postpone working here and then 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.500
 send the boys back home as they can 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.630
 bring home what they lived 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.049
 that not everything remains here in Campofontana 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.479
 because it wouldn't make sense 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.890
 we focus so much on the animators that they are 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.049
 a reference point for these 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.820
 guys because then they won't have us not 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.979
 there will be a house in Campofontana la 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.520
 but the family will have their lives and 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.520
 their experiences
