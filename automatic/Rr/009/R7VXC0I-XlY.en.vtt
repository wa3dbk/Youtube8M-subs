00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
existing stomach and I tell people it's

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.110 
existing stomach and I tell people it's
really<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.050> size<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.440> your<00:01:13.470> thumb<00:01:13.940> that<00:01:14.940> is

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
the amount of food that you take we also

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.790 
the amount of food that you take we also
rearrange<00:01:20.850> your<00:01:21.210> intestines<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.620> this

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
rearrange your intestines so that this

pouch empties directly into the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.110 
pouch empties directly into the
intestines<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.610> induces

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
intestines and that it induces

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.930 
intestines and that it induces
malabsorption<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.500> maybe<00:01:29.070> more<00:01:29.370> than<00:01:29.430> fifty

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
malabsorption so maybe more than fifty

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.370 
malabsorption so maybe more than fifty
percent<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.420> what<00:01:30.540> you're<00:01:30.690> taking<00:01:31.050> is<00:01:31.140> not

going to be absorbed

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.109 
going to be absorbed
the<00:01:34.289> gastric<00:01:34.829> bypass<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.609> one<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.880> three
