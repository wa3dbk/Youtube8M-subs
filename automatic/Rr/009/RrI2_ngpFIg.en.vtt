so<00:00:01.709> I<00:00:02.100> wanted<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.700> try<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:03.060> demonstrate<00:00:03.240> how<00:00:03.810> to

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
so I wanted to try to demonstrate how to

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.749 
so I wanted to try to demonstrate how to
set<00:00:04.170> up<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.620> pluggable<00:00:05.069> wireless<00:00:05.609> audio

set up the pluggable wireless audio

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.390 
set up the pluggable wireless audio
adapter<00:00:06.390> because<00:00:07.350> it's<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.710> little<00:00:07.919> tricky<00:00:08.280> and

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
adapter because it's a little tricky and

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.000 
adapter because it's a little tricky and
always<00:00:08.900> associating<00:00:09.900> wireless<00:00:10.290> devices<00:00:10.620> can

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
always associating wireless devices can

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.160 
always associating wireless devices can
be<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.160> bit<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.550> problem<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:12.120> in<00:00:12.660> particular

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
be a bit of a problem and in particular

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.990 
be a bit of a problem and in particular
this<00:00:13.349> device<00:00:13.710> has<00:00:14.190> some<00:00:14.460> buttons<00:00:14.790> that

this device has some buttons that
perform<00:00:15.389> multiple<00:00:15.780> functions<00:00:16.199> so<00:00:16.609> wanted<00:00:17.609> to

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
perform multiple functions so wanted to

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.580 
perform multiple functions so wanted to
walk<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.000> through<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.240> process<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:19.439> here's

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
association in place so this is after

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.580 
association in place so this is after
here<00:01:24.030> when<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.330> plugged<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.409> see

here when it's plugged in you can see

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.410 
here when it's plugged in you can see
that<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.220> speed<00:01:26.520> at<00:01:26.640> which<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.939> led<00:01:27.240> is

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
that that the speed at which that led is

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.120 
that that the speed at which that led is
blinking<00:01:27.479> that's<00:01:28.020> kind<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.350> its<00:01:28.500> normal<00:01:28.710> mode

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
blinking that's kind of its normal mode

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.399 
blinking that's kind of its normal mode
now<00:01:29.909> after<00:01:30.270> we<00:01:30.360> press<00:01:30.659> down<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.049> button<00:01:31.380> to

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.120 
now let's take a look at
here<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.220> windows<00:02:10.930> to<00:02:11.930> plug<00:02:12.800> my<00:02:12.950> house

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
packing so i actually have use of my

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.810 
packing so i actually have use of my
mouse<00:02:15.370> let's<00:02:16.370> look<00:02:16.610> at<00:02:17.090> windows<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.410> see<00:02:18.820> what

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
mouse let's look at windows to see what

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.040 
mouse let's look at windows to see what
this<00:02:19.970> might<00:02:20.180> look<00:02:20.210> like<00:02:20.450> from<00:02:21.260> an<00:02:21.500> audio

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
this might look like from an audio

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.660 
this might look like from an audio
perspective<00:02:24.050> so<00:02:24.710> I'm<00:02:24.800> opening<00:02:25.130> up<00:02:25.220> control

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
perspective so I'm opening up control

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.380 
perspective so I'm opening up control
panel<00:02:26.500> hardware<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.650> sound<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.390> opening

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
panel hardware and sound and opening

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.490 
panel hardware and sound and opening
sound<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:30.400> so<00:02:31.400> here<00:02:32.120> is<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.810> speakers

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
sound and so here is the speakers

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.200 
sound and so here is the speakers

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.480 
associated with the scenic wireless
audio<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:36.350> can<00:02:36.470> see<00:02:36.650> right<00:02:36.680> now<00:02:36.920> it's

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
audio and you can see right now it's

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.820

this is one of the other things that can
go<00:02:39.860> wrong<00:02:40.010> here<00:02:40.550> this<00:02:41.150> is<00:02:41.330> currently<00:02:41.690> not<00:02:41.930> the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
default had been stuck with so now we're

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.750 
default had been stuck with so now we're
going<00:03:11.030> to<00:03:11.090> click<00:03:11.630> on<00:03:11.780> speakers<00:03:12.260> there<00:03:12.530> or<00:03:13.430> on

going to click on speakers there or on
the<00:03:13.940> wireless<00:03:14.480> audio<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:15.590> then<00:03:15.860> I'm<00:03:15.950> going<00:03:16.190> to

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
the wireless audio and then I'm going to

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.540 
the wireless audio and then I'm going to
just<00:03:18.010> open<00:03:19.010> windows<00:03:19.280> media<00:03:19.550> player<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:21.550> we're

let's<00:03:30.590> hope<00:03:30.800> that<00:03:30.860> they've<00:03:31.250> got<00:03:31.460> a<00:03:33.520> something

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
let's hope that they've got a something

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.750 
let's hope that they've got a something
default<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.780> now<00:03:36.130> you<00:03:37.130> can<00:03:37.310> hear<00:03:37.460> the<00:03:37.580> sound

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
default so now you can hear the sound

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.280 
default so now you can hear the sound
coming<00:03:38.090> out<00:03:38.270> through<00:03:38.480> these<00:03:38.630> speakers<00:03:39.020> these

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
coming out through these speakers these

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.320 
coming out through these speakers these
speakers<00:03:39.500> are<00:03:39.680> not<00:03:39.980> connected<00:03:40.550> via<00:03:40.730> wires<00:03:41.000> to

speakers are not connected via wires to

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.360 
speakers are not connected via wires to
the<00:03:41.360> slacked<00:03:41.660> off<00:03:41.810> at<00:03:42.020> all<00:03:42.170> they're<00:03:42.830> connected

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
the slacked off at all they're connected

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.810 
the slacked off at all they're connected
only<00:03:43.550> through<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.930> wireless<00:03:45.800> control<00:03:46.490> panel

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
only through the wireless control panel

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.010 
only through the wireless control panel
here<00:03:46.970> so<00:03:47.120> I'm<00:03:47.180> going<00:03:47.330> to<00:03:47.360> go<00:03:47.450> here<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:47.840> turn

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
here so I'm going to go here and turn

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.620 
here so I'm going to go here and turn
down<00:03:48.080> the<00:03:48.350> volume<00:03:48.820> so<00:03:49.820> that's<00:03:50.000> not<00:03:50.210> talking

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
down the volume so that's not talking

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.840 
down the volume so that's not talking
over<00:03:50.870> me<00:03:50.900> you<00:03:51.830> notice<00:03:52.100> something<00:03:52.310> else<00:03:52.580> that

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
over me you notice something else that

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.580 
over me you notice something else that
when<00:03:53.000> it's<00:03:53.150> playing<00:03:53.450> audio<00:03:53.810> successfully<00:03:54.470> the

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
when it's playing audio successfully the

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.070 
when it's playing audio successfully the
LED<00:03:54.980> has<00:03:55.190> gone<00:03:55.400> from<00:03:55.670> that<00:03:55.880> slow<00:03:56.270> lazy<00:03:56.600> blink

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
LED has gone from that slow lazy blink

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
LED has gone from that slow lazy blink
to<00:03:57.500> solid<00:03:57.980> now<00:03:58.160> so<00:03:58.700> on<00:03:59.090> both<00:03:59.330> sides<00:03:59.660> so<00:04:00.350> you'll

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
to solid now so on both sides so you'll

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.580 
to solid now so on both sides so you'll
only<00:04:01.340> see<00:04:01.670> that<00:04:01.850> led<00:04:02.150> get<00:04:02.450> solid<00:04:02.750> when<00:04:03.290> audio

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
only see that led get solid when audio

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.650 
only see that led get solid when audio
is<00:04:03.770> actually<00:04:04.130> playing<00:04:04.310> over<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.150> USB<00:04:05.510> audio

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
is actually playing over the USB audio

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.740 
is actually playing over the USB audio
devices<00:04:06.190> one<00:04:07.190> of<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.430> common<00:04:08.000> problems<00:04:08.690> that

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
devices one of the common problems that

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.500 
devices one of the common problems that
can<00:04:08.989> happen<00:04:09.459> when<00:04:10.459> you're<00:04:10.580> pairing<00:04:10.970> isn't<00:04:11.330> and

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
can happen when you're pairing isn't and

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.530 
can happen when you're pairing isn't and
it<00:04:11.570> didn't<00:04:11.840> happen<00:04:11.989> to<00:04:12.170> me<00:04:12.260> but<00:04:13.190> when<00:04:14.180> you<00:04:14.270> hold

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
it didn't happen to me but when you hold

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.530 
it didn't happen to me but when you hold
down<00:04:14.840> this<00:04:15.110> button<00:04:15.530> here<00:04:15.560> to<00:04:16.400> pair<00:04:16.760> because<00:04:17.419> we

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
down this button here to pair because we

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.120 
down this button here to pair because we
hold<00:04:17.750> down<00:04:17.930> both<00:04:18.200> of<00:04:18.230> these<00:04:18.470> at<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.709> same<00:04:18.799> time

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
hold down both of these at the same time

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.430 
hold down both of these at the same time
to<00:04:19.280> pair<00:04:19.519> them<00:04:19.669> that's<00:04:20.510> also<00:04:20.959> a<00:04:20.989> similar

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
to pair them that's also a similar

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.210 
to pair them that's also a similar
function<00:04:21.709> to<00:04:22.130> mute<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.790> audio<00:04:23.770> this<00:04:24.770> is<00:04:24.950> also

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
function to mute the audio this is also

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.640 
function to mute the audio this is also
the<00:04:25.370> volume<00:04:25.940> rocker<00:04:25.970> so<00:04:26.870> if<00:04:26.990> I<00:04:27.080> kind<00:04:27.320> of<00:04:27.410> press

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
the volume rocker so if I kind of press

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.920 
the volume rocker so if I kind of press
it<00:04:27.830> over<00:04:28.040> to<00:04:28.160> one<00:04:28.340> side<00:04:28.370> I<00:04:29.060> could<00:04:29.630> end<00:04:29.780> up

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
it over to one side I could end up

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.280 
it over to one side I could end up
pairing<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.590> devices<00:04:31.130> but<00:04:31.370> at<00:04:31.490> the<00:04:31.580> same<00:04:31.820> time

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
pairing the devices but at the same time

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.659 
pairing the devices but at the same time
turning<00:04:33.290> my<00:04:33.410> volume<00:04:33.650> off<00:04:34.010> and<00:04:34.280> then<00:04:34.370> I<00:04:34.460> think

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
turning my volume off and then I think

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.120 
turning my volume off and then I think
oh<00:04:34.820> boy<00:04:35.210> they<00:04:35.360> didn't<00:04:35.630> pair<00:04:35.810> successfully<00:04:36.470> so

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
oh boy they didn't pair successfully so

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.040 
oh boy they didn't pair successfully so
another<00:04:37.400> thing<00:04:37.520> to<00:04:37.790> do<00:04:37.970> when<00:04:38.330> once<00:04:38.810> you've

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
another thing to do when once you've

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.680 
another thing to do when once you've
paired<00:04:39.680> them<00:04:39.890> is<00:04:40.070> look<00:04:40.790> at<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.030> volume<00:04:41.240> plus

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
paired them is look at the volume plus

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.170 
paired them is look at the volume plus
here<00:04:41.990> and<00:04:42.200> actually<00:04:42.979> bump<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.580> volume<00:04:43.940> up<00:04:44.090> a

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
here and actually bump the volume up a

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.610 
here and actually bump the volume up a
little<00:04:44.390> bit<00:04:44.510> just<00:04:44.690> to<00:04:44.840> make<00:04:45.020> sure<00:04:45.050> that<00:04:45.500> you

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
little bit just to make sure that you

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.830 
little bit just to make sure that you
didn't<00:04:45.890> by<00:04:46.040> accident<00:04:46.669> you<00:04:47.270> know<00:04:47.390> touch<00:04:47.630> the

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
didn't by accident you know touch the

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.730 
didn't by accident you know touch the
rocker<00:04:48.080> and<00:04:48.410> turn<00:04:48.950> the<00:04:49.100> volume<00:04:49.460> off<00:04:50.500> so<00:04:51.500> again

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
rocker and turn the volume off so again

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.070 
rocker and turn the volume off so again
pairing<00:04:52.700> is<00:04:52.820> pretty<00:04:53.090> easy<00:04:53.270> I<00:04:53.630> might<00:04:53.960> are

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
pairing is pretty easy I might are

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.900 
pairing is pretty easy I might are
holding<00:04:54.350> down<00:04:54.470> the<00:04:54.620> buttons<00:04:54.950> pay<00:04:55.460> attention

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
holding down the buttons pay attention

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.320 
holding down the buttons pay attention
to<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.180> LEDs<00:04:56.710> slow<00:04:57.710> lazy<00:04:58.040> blink<00:04:58.520> means<00:04:59.000> that

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
to the LEDs slow lazy blink means that

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.240 
to the LEDs slow lazy blink means that
they're<00:04:59.870> just<00:05:00.140> in<00:05:00.260> a<00:05:00.350> normal<00:05:00.620> mode<00:05:00.919> they're

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
they're just in a normal mode they're

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.680 
they're just in a normal mode they're
not<00:05:01.400> playing<00:05:01.669> back<00:05:01.970> anything<00:05:02.300> and<00:05:02.600> they're

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
not playing back anything and they're

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.409 
not playing back anything and they're
not<00:05:02.840> pairing<00:05:03.350> the<00:05:04.070> quicklinks<00:05:04.640> mean<00:05:05.240> that

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
not pairing the quicklinks mean that

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.510 
not pairing the quicklinks mean that
they<00:05:05.600> are<00:05:05.990> trying<00:05:06.350> to<00:05:06.470> find<00:05:06.830> their<00:05:07.040> pair<00:05:07.280> and

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
they are trying to find their pair and

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.180 
they are trying to find their pair and
the<00:05:08.300> solid<00:05:08.660> LED<00:05:09.020> means<00:05:09.290> that<00:05:09.800> they<00:05:09.919> should<00:05:10.100> be

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
the solid LED means that they should be

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.830 
the solid LED means that they should be
playing<00:05:10.430> back<00:05:10.640> successfully<00:05:11.270> so<00:05:11.479> if<00:05:11.570> you<00:05:11.660> see

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
playing back successfully so if you see

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.170 
playing back successfully so if you see
the<00:05:11.930> solid<00:05:12.290> LED<00:05:12.680> and<00:05:12.890> that<00:05:13.520> nothing<00:05:13.820> else<00:05:13.970> is

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
the solid LED and that nothing else is

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.850 
the solid LED and that nothing else is
playing<00:05:14.419> well<00:05:14.750> maybe<00:05:14.990> your<00:05:15.200> speakers<00:05:15.590> are<00:05:15.710> off

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
playing well maybe your speakers are off

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.830 
playing well maybe your speakers are off
or<00:05:16.040> something<00:05:16.370> you<00:05:16.970> can<00:05:17.150> in<00:05:17.240> fact<00:05:17.270> see<00:05:17.660> there

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
or something you can in fact see there

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.930 
or something you can in fact see there
when<00:05:18.020> it<00:05:18.110> stopped<00:05:18.350> playing<00:05:18.680> these<00:05:18.979> LEDs<00:05:19.729> went

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
when it stopped playing these LEDs went

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.170 
when it stopped playing these LEDs went
back<00:05:20.120> to<00:05:20.300> them

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
back to them

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.970 
back to them
okay<00:05:22.180> so<00:05:22.240> that's<00:05:22.630> the<00:05:22.840> basic<00:05:23.230> pairing<00:05:23.620> with

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
okay so that's the basic pairing with

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
okay so that's the basic pairing with
the<00:05:24.190> pluggable<00:05:24.730> wireless<00:05:25.240> USB<00:05:25.660> audio<00:05:25.810> adapter
