at that ok my dogs barking and what I'm
going<00:05:18.310> to<00:05:18.430> do<00:05:18.580> is<00:05:18.789> I'm<00:05:18.910> just<00:05:18.940> going<00:05:19.150> to<00:05:19.360> pull

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
going to do is I'm just going to pull

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.550 
going to do is I'm just going to pull
out<00:05:19.930> like<00:05:20.320> this<00:05:20.729> instead<00:05:21.729> of<00:05:21.849> pulling<00:05:22.060> down

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
out like this instead of pulling down

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:32.219 
out like this instead of pulling down
really<00:05:23.560> slow<00:05:29.550> and<00:05:30.550> you<00:05:31.060> can<00:05:31.240> see<00:05:31.479> that<00:05:31.510> creates

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
really slow and you can see that creates

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:52.210 
really slow and you can see that creates
a<00:05:32.440> really<00:05:32.830> beautiful<00:05:33.130> curl

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.980 

okay<00:05:52.730> so<00:05:52.790> this<00:05:53.030> is<00:05:53.180> what<00:05:53.300> the<00:05:53.420> curl<00:05:53.720> should

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
okay so this is what the curl should

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.840 
okay so this is what the curl should
look<00:05:54.140> like<00:05:54.170> right<00:05:54.530> now<00:05:54.710> really<00:05:55.550> soft<00:05:56.030> and

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
look like right now really soft and

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.070 
look like right now really soft and
that's<00:05:58.850> a<00:05:58.970> bit<00:05:59.150> should<00:05:59.330> look<00:05:59.480> like<00:05:59.510> and<00:05:59.990> then

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
that's a bit should look like and then

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.930 
that's a bit should look like and then
we're<00:06:00.380> going<00:06:00.500> to<00:06:00.620> take<00:06:00.740> piece<00:06:01.490> offers<00:06:01.880> a

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
we're going to take piece offers a

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.910 
we're going to take piece offers a
little<00:06:02.060> brush<00:06:02.270> again<00:06:02.570> all<00:06:03.260> right<00:06:03.740> I<00:06:05.920> remember

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
these are going to hold a little bit

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.700
