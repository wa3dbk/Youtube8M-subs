it was very responsive and professional
he<00:00:28.830> certainly<00:00:29.220> seems<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> decent<00:00:29.939> enough

turn out he the judge saw through that

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.350 
turn out he the judge saw through that
and<00:00:45.480> he<00:00:45.660> maintained<00:00:46.500> bail<00:00:46.770> as<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.670> current<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
and he maintained bail as it current and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.410 
and he maintained bail as it current and
in<00:00:48.660> its<00:00:48.840> current<00:00:49.079> status<00:00:49.410> rather<00:00:49.829> than

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
in its current status rather than

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.299 
in its current status rather than
increasing<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.890> loss<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.969> weapons<00:00:55.309> okay

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
increasing it to a loss of weapons okay

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.639 
increasing it to a loss of weapons okay
so<00:00:56.789> overall<00:00:57.090> just<00:00:57.809> go<00:00:57.989> worse<00:00:58.230> or<00:00:58.440> better<00:00:58.559> than

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
so overall just go worse or better than

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.959 
so overall just go worse or better than
you<00:00:58.800> guys<00:00:58.829> up<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.309> would<00:00:59.460> probably<00:01:00.859> about
