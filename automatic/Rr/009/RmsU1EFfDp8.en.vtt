00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello everyone at the microphone Borisenko and 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.790
 rope today we have an unusual shape 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.040
 which we run together with 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.929
 colleagues log house felling lesson term in 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.300
 this review is talking about trade but also by 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.030
 elliott waves for completely different 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.760
 I will give the analysis thought it would be interesting so 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.560
 we start with rake hacks 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.900
 including the euro dollar and 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.320
 present price has formed a double 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.140
 level selection + 1 8 and trying to break through 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.720
 mark 8 eighths go beyond the zone 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.460
 overbought if later rnyh 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.020
 can be fixed rather than not super 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.210
 trends then surely 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.430
 the sea further decline of the Varyag market 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.770
 marks four eighths if the market can 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.200
 break this mark too later 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.660
 probably a deeper decline in the market and 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.370
 breakdown of summer lows but as we see 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.739
 on the four-hour chart on the side 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.050
 levels coincides with daily schedules and 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.600
 price is still trading a little higher 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.090
 8 eighths after minimum target 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.010
 favors level 6 eighths if from him 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.870
 still we see how it will be this 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.789
 will the tank regain growth well and 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.979
 right back if a pro 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.100
 god on mark then in that case you can 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.560
 push decline markets 4 8 conclusion just 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.780
 trade fair right I head penal servitude 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.580
 pyramid could build yoke of hare 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.830
 since and also gave rise after 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.930
 the end of the triangle I thought it would be 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.119
 the market grow in the fifth wave so it came out 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.009
 for reasons of limiting mani 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.170
 management is also a banal shortage 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.330
 time at the time I could not build 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.759
 such a beautiful pyramid of choice in 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.770
 work immediately six deals to buy 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.509
 stop here already in such a fat plus and 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.040
 Subsequently, Igor expects growth to 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.840
 mark 88 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.000
 but most likely in the future his demos 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.310
 It was a given level and the stronger he was 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.180
 will be the deeper will be the next 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.549
 correction 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.500
 interesting situation on the cross Australian 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.840
 Japanese Yen where probably completed 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.479
 market correction formed bot mark 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.229
 five eighth consequences expect scrapping 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.270
 level 88 them further work + 2 8 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.670
 what hi hi rebuild level indication 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.229
 on the graph whether interest us wave 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.640
 point of view since I have everywhere 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.920
 waves are immediately visible 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.290
 we have here clearly the completion of the ascendant 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.660
 momentum and completed some correction 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.250
 made up of triples and likely pressed 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.290
 new level are formed western 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.650
 boost up and earlier addon cross 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.900
 not 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.360
 examined but most likely I will turn it on 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.670
 in their reviews because but the track can 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.920
 come out extremely righteous since after 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.840
 the end of the pulse for correction 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.129
 it will be possible to enter purchase 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.290
 already the third wave 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.689
 but such thoughts are on the waves on the chart 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.909
 Murray levels another interesting cross 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.519
 world view point of view here occurred 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.980
 rebound from level 4 of the eighth it is with us 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.840
 pounds rank and subsequently on tried 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.390
 get stuck overbought but not 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.790
 It turned out the bulls of the first time and the market 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.099
 went into the correction traded under the mark 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.260
 88 them altogether despite the fact that he is not 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.670
 super mystery formed bear cross 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.700
 resumption is later likely 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.769
 growth and breakdown mark + 2 8 that 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.989
 overheated rebuild indicators on 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.970
 graphics moreover you can build 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.560
 bychu Wolfe Waves then we have to 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.170
 get here is a kind of 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.629
 these are the lower generatrix lines of the model and here 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.629
 its upper part also if we 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.609
 build a line at points 24 then we will exit 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.530
 that this line converges from the bottom 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.780
 generating line of the model that is given 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.090
 potter can be considered classic but by 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.859
 elliott waves this growth looks like 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.690
 some impulses on the probable 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.090
 completes and downward correction 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.099
 taking the form of a possible zigzag in 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.319
 Further, most likely we see another 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.720
 momentum up here and so wave 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.639
 express analysis well here 's another worldly 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.319
 pyramid as igor explained to me along the way 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.329
 this height last nails on 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.949
 but on the flute some protein was added 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.409
 close girlfriend he has three left 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:42.150
 bottom deals and the correct after all 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.389
 returned to the market opened the fourth 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.310
 local targets favors level 88 them a 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.470
 stop for all trades below 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.540
 lines of the daily super trend in general 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.940
 considering the strength of the current trend is quite 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.370
 probable breakdown of the mark 8 8 whether they 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.680
 further movement up the market 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.959
 over time, oil continues to grow and buy 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.519
 not only me but including igor and in 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.560
 hereafter if we exit the line from the line 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.049
 four hours super delight will get 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.389
 Probably further growth as tags 8 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.669
 eighths well, and then from her quite 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:14.250
 the beginning of the correction is possible if we leave 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:16.289
 out of this level here's an example of counter 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.930
 trend trading probably by index 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:21.229
 dhows there will be 88 mm marks and 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.610
 the beginning of the correction is likely later 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.469
 Minimum goal is level 6 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.100
 eighths but it is possible that he will 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:29.620
 broken and then take 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.510
 further decline in the market level of 48 of them 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.430
 In general, yes, waiting is consistent with 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.680
 waves or where is the end 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.000
 current standing impulse man 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.680
 second wave correction 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.210
 however, he does not plan to file 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.340
 since trading for a correction 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.770
 quite risky occupation we 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.780
 go to the Japanese candles in front of us 4 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.790
 hour schedule where gold continues 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.890
 bear trend development earlier 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.930
 descended from will be window level exactly 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.670
 it was a signal of market decline 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.590
 present we got a model 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.240
 choruses that the person indicated correction 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.370
 which may already last some 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.440
 time along with that further likely 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.430
 the resumption of movement is the price that specifying 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.350
 here is the indicator 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.690
 this is a graph of 3 linear breakouts as well 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.400
 our rivers notice that stop by 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.200
 the transaction is located above the window level 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.280
 as try to cross out everything 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.900
 sellers plans 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.510
 but let's see the current one 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.070
 overlap on candlesticks on 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.020
 euro dollar and since there also 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.360
 ends correction matures 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.520
 interesting troit in terms of Japanese 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.590
 candles so open the last reviews 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.600
 thick and in front of us 4 hour schedule 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.160
 euro dollar and where it is clear that the correction 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.470
 started after the formation of models 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.360
 tweezers and again with tweezers and got 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.190
 start local correction 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.050
 if we turn to the hourly chart then 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.180
 see that the correction is still 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.950
 window level resistance also lines 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.290
 moving average later on 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.150
 if the following levels are selected then 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.760
 it will be possible to start a new round 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.070
 the decline in porsche flour is interesting and the euro 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.260
 funk &amp; ti znaesh 3 hourly chart in 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.750
 present thin directed upwards and 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.120
 the market is trading gradually moving up 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.280
 up within the cloud between the ruler 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.530
 June is alkane on this graph in front 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.910
 we formed a golden cross and therefore 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.400
 quite logical deal to buy 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.380
 spade below the cloud 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.900
 since this line may have 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.670
 support price colleague volovik alexander 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.980
 bulls pays attention to the fact that 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.140
 franc formed zah 1 pulse up 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.150
 that it is not clear what it is not 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.220
 senior wave level i.e. 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.840
 to be both a wave and the first wave 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.790
 it is likely that later we 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.930
 got already completed zigzag in the wave 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.760
 there were two 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.910
 and the price is almost a little bit not reached 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.340
 68 percent of that 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:35.290
 impulse later in rating impulsively 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.390
 growth and minimum goals favors 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.580
 one hundred percent mark again 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.370
 gaining momentum as well as pay 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.040
 attention and then 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.800
 though that is formed in front of us too and here 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.080
 lower bound and draw the upper now 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.570
 the border of this model except 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.340
 built 24 it is clear that the line is 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.830
 This model converge and you can 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.870
 recognize the classic as a whole rather 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.669
 in total we will see growth at least over here 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.380
 and then if we come out a target breakdown 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:02.270
 line within the wolf wave too in such 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.370
 case you can wait for a deeper 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:08.290
 market promotion up all good 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.290
 day i am righteous trades yet
