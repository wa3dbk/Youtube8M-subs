the tools to look at this at a regional
level<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.510> look<00:02:54.750> if<00:02:54.900> there's<00:02:55.140> spatial<00:02:55.860> trends

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
contamination study that I looked at

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.440 
contamination study that I looked at
what<00:03:06.270> we<00:03:06.420> found<00:03:06.720> is<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:08.000> systems<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.240> have

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
what we found is that systems that have

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.600 
what we found is that systems that have
higher<00:03:09.780> percentages<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:10.650> Latinos<00:03:11.340> have

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
higher percentages of Latinos have

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.320 
higher percentages of Latinos have
higher<00:03:11.820> nitrate<00:03:12.420> levels<00:03:12.830> and<00:03:13.830> in<00:03:14.340> particular

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
higher nitrate levels and in particular

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.780 
higher nitrate levels and in particular
after<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.230> control<00:03:16.560> for<00:03:16.770> size<00:03:16.980> it's<00:03:17.460> in<00:03:17.640> the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
after you control for size it's in the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.260 
after you control for size it's in the
small<00:03:18.090> systems<00:03:18.660> where<00:03:18.990> we<00:03:19.020> see<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.530> biggest

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
small systems where we see the biggest

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.310 
small systems where we see the biggest
relationship<00:03:21.270> the<00:03:21.480> biggest<00:03:21.780> correlation

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
relationship the biggest correlation

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.370 
relationship the biggest correlation
between<00:03:22.440> percent<00:03:23.040> Latino<00:03:23.460> and<00:03:24.380> nitrate

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
between percent Latino and nitrate

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.560 
between percent Latino and nitrate
levels<00:03:25.710> so<00:03:25.920> those<00:03:26.280> small<00:03:26.520> systems<00:03:27.150> is<00:03:27.420> where

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
levels so those small systems is where

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.780 
levels so those small systems is where
you<00:03:27.720> see<00:03:27.930> like<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.620> strongest<00:03:29.130> effect<00:03:29.280> of

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
you see like the strongest effect of

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.740 
you see like the strongest effect of
being<00:03:30.390> sort<00:03:30.870> of<00:03:31.820> highly<00:03:32.820> Latino<00:03:33.240> community

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
being sort of highly Latino community

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.750 
being sort of highly Latino community
you<00:03:34.170> see<00:03:34.440> evidence<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.920> you'll<00:03:35.130> have<00:03:35.310> higher

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
you see evidence that you'll have higher

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.140 
you see evidence that you'll have higher

done<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:02.710> said<00:04:02.920> okay<00:04:03.220> let's<00:04:03.430> take<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.880> state

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
done is said okay let's take the state

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.270 
done is said okay let's take the state
ax<00:04:04.360> that's<00:04:04.810> meant<00:04:05.050> for<00:04:05.260> a<00:04:05.290> regulatory<00:04:05.800> purpose

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
ax that's meant for a regulatory purpose

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.190 
ax that's meant for a regulatory purpose
and<00:04:06.670> let's<00:04:06.910> look<00:04:07.120> at<00:04:07.240> it<00:04:07.480> to<00:04:07.750> see<00:04:07.900> if<00:04:07.990> it<00:04:08.110> can

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
and let's look at it to see if it can

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.260 
and let's look at it to see if it can
estimate<00:04:08.530> exposure<00:04:09.100> in<00:04:09.490> the<00:04:09.640> community<00:04:10.090> and

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
estimate exposure in the community and

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.420 
estimate exposure in the community and
then<00:04:10.960> let's<00:04:11.290> let's<00:04:11.740> estimate<00:04:12.070> what<00:04:12.400> the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
then let's let's estimate what the

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.520 
then let's let's estimate what the
demographics<00:04:13.150> are<00:04:13.330> of<00:04:13.540> water<00:04:13.780> systems<00:04:14.290> and

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
demographics are of water systems and

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.259 
demographics are of water systems and
let's<00:04:14.770> see<00:04:14.980> what's<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:15.820> relationship

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
let's see what's the relationship

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.530 
let's see what's the relationship
between<00:04:16.980> demographics<00:04:17.980> and<00:04:18.280> exposure<00:04:18.640> so

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
between demographics and exposure so

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.690 
between demographics and exposure so
like<00:04:20.019> from<00:04:20.260> my<00:04:20.410> perspective<00:04:20.769> if<00:04:21.489> you're
