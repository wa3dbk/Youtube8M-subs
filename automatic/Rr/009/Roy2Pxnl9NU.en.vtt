00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.129
 good morning dear viewers so what 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.349
 start sowing tomatoes are you ready and i 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:16.290
 quite ready here is true of course if 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.200
 empty packs but every year I buy 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.150
 new varieties and hybrids every year and then 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.309
 and two and three years in a row 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.680
 trial and because one year is difficult 

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:26.250
 understand what that is capable of this 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.890
 plant 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.099
 it means in my hands of course just 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.050
 wealth and never throw away packs 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.300
 Well, at least 2-3 years exactly 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.550
 guard because if suddenly there from 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.440
 turned out to be super as good and we can not 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.870
 remember even the name is the same 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.630
 wrong totally tomatoes are here 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.500
 beef tomatoes large fruit eat hothouse 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.280
 there is a street 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.860
 a lot of them and having tried everything 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.590
 what do you like to see first 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.160
 tastes sweat quantity to which 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.440
 can you give this plant of course 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.720
 keep yourself if it is a grade then 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.820
 naturally you can collect seeds 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.340
 if this is a hybrid then you can rub it with 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.909
 a bit lately i'm very often 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.600
 I hear when they ask and have a broody 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:19.109
 kusha no kusha just disappeared disappeared 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.719
 for example, such a wonderful tomato 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:23.939
 caspar and you just discontinued 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:27.990
 It seems that Klusha also went to the 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.700
 same dear but instead of klushi I understand you 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.429
 why is she listening because she is small 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.439
 she is only there 30 35 centimeters of height 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:38.189
 it is not very decent tomatoes 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.170
 and a lot of them as well, replace 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.439
 please listen for example to linda 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.380
 Anew Russia at the General, they also do not 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.060
 tall and their tomatoes 300 350 grams 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.310
 maybe you will like them well 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.569
 try it because it’s still early 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.120
 this is our beginning of March 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:58.740
 but for now we have February now 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:01.350
 15 February 16 we sow tomatoes for greenhouses 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.870
 please read carefully on the packs 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.860
 what is written on the back 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:10.680
 written in Russian and in a picture on 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.140
 here is drawn and growing from well 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.160
 the truth is not written how much it grow 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.180
 will be well considering that he is to them 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.650
 determinate that is, you do not have 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.180
 growth restrictions 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.880
 since the bodies will be long that is infinitely 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.800
 our task is to grow it at home to such 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.370
 states that he was two flowery in 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.740
 brush 1 is not enough 2 to the first of June 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.410
 try 15 February 16th wonderful 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.110
 ibex and sow ect and you won't 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.520
 to hurt the plant will not hurt the framework 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.520
 when you will open on your posture and 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.830
 leaves and tomatoes will be quite a lot 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.530
 we need to have time to form on the plant 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.610
 at least 8 fruit brushes 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:57.750
 then it’s a bucket if it’s 6 it’s not 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.550
 bucket and remember that they are not such tomatoes 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.660
 complex as it seems to us only to do 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:06.510
 We need all well and correctly on the place 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.989
 as the seedlings grow, I'll 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.170

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.250
