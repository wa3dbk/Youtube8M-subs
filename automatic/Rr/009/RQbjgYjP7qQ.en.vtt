still had the one stick control and they

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.490 
still had the one stick control and they
had<00:02:59.769> released<00:03:00.099> um<00:03:00.430> I<00:03:01.150> believe<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:01.959> week<00:03:02.230> or<00:03:02.379> two

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
had released um I believe a week or two

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.890 
had released um I believe a week or two
ago<00:03:02.650> or<00:03:03.189> a<00:03:03.250> couple<00:03:03.579> weeks<00:03:03.700> ago<00:03:03.819> anyway<00:03:04.239> that

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
ago or a couple weeks ago anyway that

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.849 
ago or a couple weeks ago anyway that
they<00:03:05.049> were<00:03:05.109> doing<00:03:05.469> a<00:03:05.590> dual<00:03:06.069> stick<00:03:06.400> control

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
they were doing a dual stick control

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.099 
they were doing a dual stick control
like<00:03:08.859> MX<00:03:09.219> vs<00:03:09.519> atv<00:03:09.639> games<00:03:10.180> have<00:03:10.449> are<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.930> newer

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
like MX vs atv games have are the newer

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.890 
like MX vs atv games have are the newer
ones<00:03:11.439> they<00:03:11.620> have<00:03:11.650> anyway<00:03:12.189> so<00:03:12.909> it<00:03:13.659> would<00:03:13.810> have

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
ones they have anyway so it would have

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.539 
ones they have anyway so it would have
been<00:03:13.989> nice<00:03:14.199> if<00:03:14.230> they<00:03:14.709> had<00:03:14.739> included<00:03:15.340> some

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
been nice if they had included some

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.149 
been nice if they had included some
whips<00:03:15.790> or<00:03:16.209> scrubs<00:03:16.659> in<00:03:16.840> there<00:03:17.049> and<00:03:17.620> they<00:03:17.859> didn't

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 
whips or scrubs in there and they didn't

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.149 
whips or scrubs in there and they didn't
do<00:03:18.280> that<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:18.699> I<00:03:18.790> have<00:03:19.389> to<00:03:19.540> wonder<00:03:19.689> why<00:03:20.049> I<00:03:20.439> think

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
do that and I have to wonder why I think

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.629 
do that and I have to wonder why I think
also<00:03:21.430> what<00:03:21.969> should<00:03:22.209> add<00:03:22.449> a<00:03:22.900> benefit<00:03:23.500> as<00:03:23.709> if<00:03:23.889> the

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
also what should add a benefit as if the

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.459 
also what should add a benefit as if the
person<00:03:25.030> that<00:03:25.060> made<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.959> gameplay<00:03:26.439> was

with me you can I don't really care but
you<00:04:24.430> know<00:04:24.550> it<00:04:24.909> I<00:04:25.300> think<00:04:25.810> for<00:04:26.199> what<00:04:26.349> people<00:04:26.650> have

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
you know it I think for what people have

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.249 
you know it I think for what people have
asked<00:04:27.159> for<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:27.669> don't<00:04:28.509> think<00:04:28.719> it's<00:04:28.840> quite<00:04:29.020> all

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
asked for I don't think it's quite all

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.529 
asked for I don't think it's quite all
there<00:04:29.469> maybe<00:04:29.770> yeah<00:04:30.639> that's<00:04:30.849> just<00:04:30.940> that's<00:04:31.360> just

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
there maybe yeah that's just that's just

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.270 
there maybe yeah that's just that's just
me<00:04:31.810> I'm<00:04:32.139> definitely<00:04:32.560> going<00:04:32.860> to<00:04:32.979> get<00:04:33.070> it<00:04:33.190> when

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
me I'm definitely going to get it when

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.240 
me I'm definitely going to get it when
it<00:04:33.370> comes<00:04:33.430> out<00:04:33.699> though<00:04:33.909> so<00:04:34.740> you<00:04:35.740> know<00:04:35.860> just

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
it comes out though so you know just

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.570 
it comes out though so you know just
because<00:04:36.400> I<00:04:36.550> like<00:04:37.090> a<00:04:37.120> new<00:04:37.330> game<00:04:37.570> um<00:04:38.580> especially

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
because I like a new game um especially

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.330 
because I like a new game um especially
a<00:04:39.789> new<00:04:39.849> motocross<00:04:40.449> game<00:04:40.690> so<00:04:40.990> I<00:04:41.260> can't<00:04:42.070> wait

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
a new motocross game so I can't wait

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.719 
a new motocross game so I can't wait
until

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
until

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.029 
until
Mark's<00:04:42.909> 28th<00:04:43.449> you<00:04:44.199> know<00:04:44.319> that's<00:04:44.499> all<00:04:44.620> I<00:04:44.770> think

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
Mark's 28th you know that's all I think

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:46.110 
Mark's 28th you know that's all I think
that's<00:04:45.159> where<00:04:45.279> all<00:04:45.430> I<00:04:45.580> can<00:04:45.729> really<00:04:45.819> say<00:04:45.969> about

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
that's where all I can really say about

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.200 
that's where all I can really say about
it<00:04:46.449> at<00:04:46.569> the<00:04:46.659> moment<00:04:47.189> I<00:04:48.189> thought<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.789> gameplay

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
it at the moment I thought the gameplay

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.399 
it at the moment I thought the gameplay
would<00:04:49.539> be<00:04:49.689> a<00:04:49.719> little<00:04:50.110> bit<00:04:50.439> more<00:04:51.839> better<00:04:52.839> maybe

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
would be a little bit more better maybe

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:56.189 
would be a little bit more better maybe
the<00:04:54.009> bike<00:04:54.159> sounds<00:04:54.520> didn't<00:04:54.759> sound<00:04:54.909> too<00:04:54.999> bad<00:04:55.199> if

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
the bike sounds didn't sound too bad if

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.049 
the bike sounds didn't sound too bad if
you<00:04:56.680> listen<00:04:57.039> closely<00:04:57.159> throughout<00:04:57.819> the<00:04:57.939> whole

00:04:58.049 --> 00:04:58.059 
you listen closely throughout the whole

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:00.450 
you listen closely throughout the whole
video<00:04:58.240> you<00:04:58.419> can<00:04:58.779> you<00:04:59.499> can<00:04:59.650> kind<00:04:59.889> of<00:04:59.949> hear<00:05:00.249> the

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
video you can you can kind of hear the

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.820 
video you can you can kind of hear the
bike<00:05:00.669> a<00:05:00.939> little<00:05:01.120> bit<00:05:01.360> so<00:05:02.319> I<00:05:02.349> guess<00:05:02.559> that's<00:05:02.740> a

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
bike a little bit so I guess that's a

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.719 
bike a little bit so I guess that's a
good<00:05:02.979> thing<00:05:04.559> you<00:05:05.559> know<00:05:05.680> I<00:05:05.710> can't<00:05:05.979> really<00:05:06.099> think

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
good thing you know I can't really think

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.369 
good thing you know I can't really think
of<00:05:06.909> too<00:05:07.120> much<00:05:07.240> else<00:05:07.479> to<00:05:07.569> say<00:05:07.659> other<00:05:07.990> than<00:05:08.139> the

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
of too much else to say other than the

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.309 
of too much else to say other than the
rider<00:05:08.620> movements<00:05:09.249> it's<00:05:09.849> just<00:05:10.210> not<00:05:10.300> quite<00:05:11.080> what

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:11.319 
rider movements it's just not quite what

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:13.619 
rider movements it's just not quite what
I<00:05:11.349> like<00:05:11.699> but<00:05:12.699> yeah<00:05:12.819> I<00:05:12.849> hope<00:05:13.029> hopefully<00:05:13.360> you
