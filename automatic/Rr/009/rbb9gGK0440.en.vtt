transform<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.740> 16<00:01:37.740> steps<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:39.030> let's<00:01:39.630> go<00:01:39.840> ahead

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
transform in 16 steps so let's go ahead

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.830 
transform in 16 steps so let's go ahead
unpack<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.860> jump<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.340> take<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> closer<00:01:42.090> look<00:01:42.270> now

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840
