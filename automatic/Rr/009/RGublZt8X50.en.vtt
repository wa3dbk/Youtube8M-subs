coming into the key upturn but over the

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.099 
coming into the key upturn but over the
last<00:01:21.590> 13<00:01:22.069> weeks<00:01:22.279> we've<00:01:22.579> seen<00:01:22.609> just<00:01:23.119> a<00:01:23.270> slight

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:24.109

increase in table wine sales about 11
percent<00:01:26.529> which<00:01:27.529> doesn't<00:01:27.889> sound<00:01:28.069> like<00:01:28.340> a<00:01:28.369> lot

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
percent which doesn't sound like a lot

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:29.649 
percent which doesn't sound like a lot
but<00:01:28.639> again<00:01:28.969> we're<00:01:29.119> covering<00:01:29.389> a<00:01:29.509> lot<00:01:29.630> of

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
but again we're covering a lot of

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:30.760 
but again we're covering a lot of
different<00:01:29.990> channels<00:01:30.350> and<00:01:30.469> we'll<00:01:30.560> talk<00:01:30.709> a

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
different channels and we'll talk a

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.319 
different channels and we'll talk a
little<00:01:30.950> bit<00:01:31.159> later<00:01:31.340> about<00:01:31.459> how<00:01:31.670> those<00:01:31.969> differ

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
little bit later about how those differ

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.839 
little bit later about how those differ
channel<00:01:33.170> by<00:01:33.259> channel<00:01:33.709> the<00:01:34.340> other<00:01:34.459> thing<00:01:34.729> which

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:34.849 
channel by channel the other thing which

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:36.580 
channel by channel the other thing which
I<00:01:34.969> think<00:01:34.999> it's<00:01:35.299> important<00:01:35.779> to<00:01:35.869> mention<00:01:36.319> is

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
I think it's important to mention is

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.879 
I think it's important to mention is
that<00:01:36.619> because<00:01:36.920> Nielsen<00:01:37.520> measures<00:01:37.849> sales<00:01:38.149> in

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:38.889 
that because Nielsen measures sales in

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:42.190 
that because Nielsen measures sales in
125<00:01:39.889> different<00:01:40.130> categories<00:01:40.880> over<00:01:41.869> sixty

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
125 different categories over sixty

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.629 
125 different categories over sixty
percent<00:01:42.319> of<00:01:42.560> those<00:01:42.679> categories<00:01:42.889> are<00:01:43.310> actually

00:01:43.629 --> 00:01:43.639 
percent of those categories are actually

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:45.279 
percent of those categories are actually
in<00:01:43.729> decline<00:01:44.149> so<00:01:44.479> to<00:01:44.539> have<00:01:44.689> a<00:01:44.749> category<00:01:45.259> that's

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
in decline so to have a category that's

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.099 
in decline so to have a category that's
actually<00:01:45.799> growing<00:01:46.069> is<00:01:46.490> more<00:01:46.999> of<00:01:47.149> a<00:01:47.179> minority

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 
actually growing is more of a minority

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.499 
actually growing is more of a minority
rather<00:01:48.560> than<00:01:48.770> rather<00:01:49.130> than<00:01:49.429> the<00:01:49.579> rule<00:01:49.729> so<00:01:50.479> I

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
rather than rather than the rule so I

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.969 
rather than rather than the rule so I
think<00:01:50.599> that's<00:01:50.840> worthwhile<00:01:51.229> to<00:01:51.619> always<00:01:51.829> look

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
think that's worthwhile to always look

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.449 
think that's worthwhile to always look
at<00:01:52.099> things<00:01:52.310> on<00:01:52.429> a<00:01:52.459> relative<00:01:52.939> basis<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:55.310> other

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
at things on a relative basis the other

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.699 
at things on a relative basis the other
thing<00:01:55.729> is<00:01:55.759> it's<00:01:56.719> really<00:01:56.840> important<00:01:57.349> to<00:01:57.380> dig

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:57.709 
thing is it's really important to dig

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:59.169 
thing is it's really important to dig
down<00:01:57.859> a<00:01:57.919> little<00:01:58.279> deeper<00:01:58.399> into<00:01:58.789> the<00:01:58.909> numbers

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
down a little deeper into the numbers

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:00.519 
down a little deeper into the numbers
and<00:01:59.389> see<00:01:59.509> where<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.749> growth<00:01:59.899> is<00:02:00.049> coming<00:02:00.259> from

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:00.529 
and see where the growth is coming from

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:02.679 
and see where the growth is coming from
and<00:02:00.709> where<00:02:00.829> it's<00:02:00.950> not<00:02:01.130> coming<00:02:01.399> from<00:02:01.489> so<00:02:02.479> when

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
and where it's not coming from so when

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.089 
and where it's not coming from so when
we<00:02:02.779> look<00:02:02.929> at<00:02:03.079> this<00:02:03.200> for<00:02:03.409> instance<00:02:03.469> by<00:02:03.799> price

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099 
we look at this for instance by price

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:06.609 
we look at this for instance by price
point<00:02:04.429> we<00:02:04.669> see<00:02:04.849> two<00:02:05.119> major<00:02:05.389> price<00:02:06.349> point

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
significant part of the growth one is

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.550 
significant part of the growth one is
the<00:02:10.970> three<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.300> six<00:02:11.569> dollar<00:02:11.780> price<00:02:12.080> range<00:02:12.380> and

segment<00:02:19.250> that's<00:02:19.550> contributing<00:02:20.150> growth<00:02:20.330> is<00:02:20.540> a

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
segment that's contributing growth is a

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.270 
segment that's contributing growth is a
nine<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:21.020> twelve<00:02:21.230> dollar<00:02:21.440> segments<00:02:21.950> of<00:02:22.040> wines

case<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.550> former<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.150> if<00:02:26.210> we<00:02:26.270> go<00:02:26.390> back<00:02:26.540> to

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
case of the former so if we go back to

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.360 
case of the former so if we go back to
the<00:02:26.840> three<00:02:27.020> to<00:02:27.140> six<00:02:27.380> dollars<00:02:27.770> segment<00:02:28.220> it's

the three to six dollars segment it's
not<00:02:28.520> just<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.090> 750<00:02:29.690> ml<00:02:29.840> bottle<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.830> growth<00:02:31.100> is

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
not just the 750 ml bottle so growth is

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.400 
not just the 750 ml bottle so growth is

maybe a bit early and so I wouldn't say
it's<00:03:19.550> a<00:03:19.610> trend<00:03:19.850> yet<00:03:20.060> we're<00:03:20.330> starting<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:20.750> see<00:03:20.810> a

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
volume wasn't too far behind so it was

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.439 
volume wasn't too far behind so it was
still<00:05:00.289> up<00:05:00.590> above<00:05:00.860> the<00:05:01.039> zero<00:05:01.250> line<00:05:01.490> just

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
still up above the zero line just

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.240 
still up above the zero line just
marginally<00:05:02.960> behind<00:05:03.349> but<00:05:03.770> there<00:05:03.979> was<00:05:04.069> growth

on both value and volume and again we'll

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.249 
on both value and volume and again we'll
probably<00:05:07.580> talk<00:05:08.419> about<00:05:08.690> a<00:05:08.720> little<00:05:08.870> bit<00:05:09.020> later

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
probably talk about a little bit later

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.320
