00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
the pop shuvit and kick look together to

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.350 
the pop shuvit and kick look together to
see<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> varial<00:00:41.219> flip<00:00:41.460> before<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.030> get<00:00:42.210> into

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
see a varial flip before you get into

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.950 
see a varial flip before you get into
the<00:00:42.600> 360<00:00:43.200> flip<00:00:43.430> because<00:00:44.430> it's<00:00:45.120> going<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.840> be<00:00:45.930> a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the 360 flip because it's going to be a

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.720 
the 360 flip because it's going to be a
lot<00:00:46.289> easier<00:00:46.590> because<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.250> don't<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.610> do

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
lot easier because you don't have to do

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.529 
lot easier because you don't have to do
that<00:00:47.879> full<00:00:48.180> 360<00:00:48.870> rotation<00:00:49.879> cool<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.090> let's<00:00:51.120> see

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
that full 360 rotation cool so let's see

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.200 
that full 360 rotation cool so let's see
where<00:00:51.870> we're<00:00:52.020> at<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.789> one<00:00:54.000> you

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
where we're at on this on that one you

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.119 
where we're at on this on that one you
just<00:00:54.329> kind<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.629> toss<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.170> board<00:00:55.410> away<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
just kind of toss the board away in and

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.950 
just kind of toss the board away in and
shot<00:00:57.090> out<00:00:57.120> too<00:00:57.510> far<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.870> front<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:59.780> hmm

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
shot out too far in front of it hmm

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.049 
shot out too far in front of it hmm

okay so you are popping it it is getting
the<00:01:03.210> full<00:01:03.480> 360<00:01:03.870> flip<00:01:04.500> rotation<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:06.030> that

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the full 360 flip rotation but on that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.030 
the full 360 flip rotation but on that
one<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.900> board<00:01:07.140> landed<00:01:07.500> upside<00:01:07.830> down

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
one the board landed upside down

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.000 
one the board landed upside down
obviously<00:01:08.640> which<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.850> no<00:01:09.150> good<00:01:09.740> so<00:01:10.740> let's<00:01:10.890> see

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
obviously which is no good so let's see

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.050 
obviously which is no good so let's see
what<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.220> got<00:01:11.400> here<00:01:12.710> alright<00:01:13.770> not<00:01:14.070> too<00:01:14.820> bad

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
what we got here alright not too bad

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.450 
what we got here alright not too bad
you're<00:01:15.479> getting<00:01:15.750> fairly<00:01:16.049> close<00:01:16.430> again<00:01:17.430> I

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
you're getting fairly close again I

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.700 
you're getting fairly close again I
really<00:01:17.909> really<00:01:18.270> want<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.720> do<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> varial

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
really really want you to do the varial

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.710 
really really want you to do the varial
flip<00:01:20.009> I'm<00:01:20.280> not<00:01:20.430> sure<00:01:20.640> if<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.909> do<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.509> that

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
flip I'm not sure if you do have that

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.050 
flip I'm not sure if you do have that
trick<00:01:22.020> or<00:01:22.259> not<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.460> didn't<00:01:23.670> show<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.850> to

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
trick or not but you didn't show it to

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.410 
trick or not but you didn't show it to
me<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.360> I'm<00:01:24.450> assuming<00:01:24.720> not<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:26.970> yeah<00:01:27.270> we

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
me so I'm assuming not and then yeah we

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.450 
me so I'm assuming not and then yeah we
just<00:01:27.689> got<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> we<00:01:28.380> got<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.680> increase<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.220> board

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
just got a we got to increase the board

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.370 
just got a we got to increase the board
control<00:01:29.820> before<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.240> get<00:01:30.479> into<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> 360<00:01:31.350> flip

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
control before you get into the 360 flip

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.289 
control before you get into the 360 flip
so<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.920> definitely<00:01:32.070> got<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.520> take<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.880> back<00:01:32.909> to

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
so you definitely got to take it back to

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.569 
so you definitely got to take it back to
the<00:01:33.540> varial<00:01:33.990> flip<00:01:34.229> but<00:01:35.009> once<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.549> that

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
the varial flip but once you do that

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.460 
the varial flip but once you do that
what<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.150> really<00:01:36.479> want<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.290> want

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
kickflip because the board's not getting

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.600 
kickflip because the board's not getting
that<00:02:36.090> full<00:02:36.390> kickflip<00:02:36.870> rotation<00:02:37.590> now<00:02:38.519> the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
that full kickflip rotation now the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.490 
that full kickflip rotation now the
second<00:02:39.090> thing<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:39.349> practicing<00:02:40.349> was

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
second thing that practicing was

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.900 
second thing that practicing was
stepping<00:02:40.860> off<00:02:40.980> your<00:02:41.190> back<00:02:41.340> foot<00:02:41.580> is<00:02:41.730> going<00:02:41.849> to

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
stepping off your back foot is going to

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.080 
stepping off your back foot is going to
do<00:02:42.150> for<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.599> is<00:02:42.980> it's<00:02:43.980> just<00:02:44.130> going<00:02:44.819> to
