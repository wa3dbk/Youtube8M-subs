00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:04.150
 for completeness of the victory information than the construction of the 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:09.210
 central biogas is creating conflicting opinions between citizenship and are 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.110
 of association committees to express their concerns 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.189
 regarding the issue of the establishments and the real effects because the 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.830
 territory but now we return to the heart of the problem concerning the plants a 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.429
 biogas that use crops and vegetables and also zootechnic fluents and that based 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.410
 the current regulations are classified as facilities for the treatment of 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.690
 waste also the ministry of agricultural policies is working since 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.590
 From a regulatory point of view, to improve the situation, we hear about it 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.440
 paolo ammassare del mipaaf 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.440
 Our goal to make sites 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.090
 digestate and digestate plants are not considered plants of 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.580
 waste treatment 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.580
 so this is our say let's be true by anticipating where we want next 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.090
 arrive 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.570
 our problem and that goal summer we are a crock pot 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.190
 because the legislation we are dealing with is a norm of a 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.320
 site of community derivation 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.930
 we clearly have no particular ability to influence directives 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:20.870
 Community 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.280
 we have a limited capacity to influence the legislative glitches of 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.800
 reference of the community legislation 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.360
 therefore villa is an extremely summary environmental text 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.880
 and therefore 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.740
 this is a bit the situation we find ourselves sedating in this 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.740
 let's say paul getty's fight weakness 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.820
 having said this what is the normative instrument we are looking for 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.230
 use to carry on the supply chain 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.390
 the decree of 7 April 2006 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.300
 video setup elena is that lcd and i go to the environmental single text of 99 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.690
 let's start talking about the legislative decree 152 99 first single text 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.680
 environment that gave kuna agricultural policy ministry 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.049
 delegation for use 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:09.859
