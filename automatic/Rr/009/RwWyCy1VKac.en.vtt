00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.710 
tray whatever if you have just line it
with<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.130> silicon<00:02:17.670> then<00:02:18.150> if<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.480> have

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
with a silicon then if you have

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.720 
with a silicon then if you have
otherwise<00:02:19.170> just<00:02:19.530> spray<00:02:19.800> some<00:02:19.830> cooking<00:02:20.370> oil<00:02:20.520> on

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
otherwise just spray some cooking oil on

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.260 
otherwise just spray some cooking oil on
it<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.770> just<00:02:22.770> use<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.190> cooking<00:02:23.580> spray<00:02:23.880> I<00:02:23.910> have

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
it I just use this cooking spray I have

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.390 
it I just use this cooking spray I have
from<00:02:24.720> Pam<00:02:24.960> so<00:02:25.740> just<00:02:25.980> try<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.250> on<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:28.400> spray

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
from Pam so just try it on it and spray

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.540 
from Pam so just try it on it and spray
this<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:30.420> put<00:02:30.630> this<00:02:30.810> like<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.560> batter<00:02:31.920> sort<00:02:32.340> of

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
this just put this like a batter sort of

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.460 
this just put this like a batter sort of
on<00:02:33.030> this

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.440 

so<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.590> would<00:02:40.769> be<00:02:40.890> like<00:02:41.069> a<00:02:41.099> chocolate<00:02:41.459> fudge<00:02:41.849> so

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
so it would be like a chocolate fudge so

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.259 
so it would be like a chocolate fudge so
we<00:02:43.080> need<00:02:43.319> to<00:02:43.500> refrigerate<00:02:43.890> for<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.670> for<00:02:44.970> around

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
we need to refrigerate for it for around

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.070 
we need to refrigerate for it for around
two<00:02:45.629> hours<00:02:45.950> until<00:02:46.950> it's<00:02:47.459> like<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.730> solid<00:02:48.300> hard

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
two hours until it's like a solid hard

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.970 
two hours until it's like a solid hard
and<00:02:49.379> then<00:02:49.890> we<00:02:50.040> will<00:02:50.160> cut<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.400> into<00:02:50.700> shapes<00:02:51.980> so

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
and then we will cut it into shapes so

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.780 
and then we will cut it into shapes so
here<00:02:53.190> everything<00:02:53.459> goes<00:02:54.090> together<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:55.790> there

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
here everything goes together and there

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.530 
here everything goes together and there
