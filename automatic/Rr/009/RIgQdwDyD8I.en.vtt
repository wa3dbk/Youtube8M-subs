interesting<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.210> me<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.930> actually<00:00:52.710> go<00:00:53.129> out

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
interesting to me is I actually go out

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.540 
interesting to me is I actually go out
and<00:00:53.370> try<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.699> find<00:00:54.030> common<00:00:54.870> household<00:00:55.550> items

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
and try to find common household items

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.270 
and try to find common household items
and<00:00:56.969> repurpose<00:00:57.780> them<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.649> whatever<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.039> need

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
and repurpose them to do whatever I need

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.860 
and repurpose them to do whatever I need
to<00:00:59.309> do<00:01:00.289> you<00:01:01.289> actually<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:01.829> yours<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:03.480> mop

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
to do you actually have yours is a mop

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.580 
to do you actually have yours is a mop
handle<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:05.280> extendable<00:01:06.470> so<00:01:07.470> you're

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
handle and it's extendable so you're

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.649 
handle and it's extendable so you're
just<00:01:07.710> kind<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.920> turn<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.400> pull<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.240> get<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
just kind of turn it pull it get it to

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.960 
just kind of turn it pull it get it to
the<00:01:09.750> height<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:09.960> want<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:13.729> screw<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.820> back

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
the height you want and screw it back

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.450 
the height you want and screw it back
into<00:01:15.180> place

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.310 

so<00:01:20.460> that's<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> kind<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.030> shot<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.570> would<00:01:22.170> get

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
so that's the kind of shot you would get

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.289 
so that's the kind of shot you would get
you'll<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.590> here<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.399> actually<00:01:26.670> put<00:01:27.289> some

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
you'll see here that I actually put some

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.819 
you'll see here that I actually put some
foam<00:01:30.299> insulation<00:01:30.659> about<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> one-inch<00:01:31.500> foam

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
foam insulation about a one-inch foam

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.130 
foam insulation about a one-inch foam
insulation<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.520> handle<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.840> helps

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
insulation on the handle and that helps

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.080 
insulation on the handle and that helps
it<00:01:34.320> fit<00:01:34.590> into<00:01:34.770> rod<00:01:35.250> holders<00:01:35.729> real<00:01:36.509> snug<00:01:38.060> so<00:01:39.060> I

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
it fit into rod holders real snug so I

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.569 
it fit into rod holders real snug so I
thought<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.539> pretty<00:01:39.929> uh<00:01:40.020> pretty<00:01:41.210> badass

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
thought this is pretty uh pretty badass

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.850 
thought this is pretty uh pretty badass
first<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.939> I'll<00:01:45.689> probably<00:01:45.929> still<00:01:46.320> keep<00:01:46.590> this

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
first and I'll probably still keep this

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.499 
first and I'll probably still keep this

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.110 
from 30 inches to 60 inches you'll see
here<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.329> um<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.810> rigged<00:02:49.440> this<00:02:49.650> up<00:02:49.829> as<00:02:50.010> well<00:02:50.280> so

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
here that um I rigged this up as well so

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.190 
here that um I rigged this up as well so
this<00:02:51.239> is<00:02:51.359> the<00:02:51.480> traditional<00:02:56.720> rod<00:02:57.720> holder<00:02:58.079> that

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
this is the traditional rod holder that

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.550 
this is the traditional rod holder that
points<00:02:58.590> straight<00:02:58.829> up

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
points straight up

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.250 
points straight up
this<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.950> flush<00:03:02.310> flush<00:03:03.300> mount<00:03:03.630> rod<00:03:03.840> holder

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
this is the flush flush mount rod holder

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.370 
this is the flush flush mount rod holder
which<00:03:04.890> is<00:03:04.920> at<00:03:05.130> an<00:03:05.250> angle<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:06.080> that<00:03:07.080> kind<00:03:07.320> of

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
which is at an angle and that kind of

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.320 
which is at an angle and that kind of
gives<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.830> a<00:03:08.250> better<00:03:09.240> shot<00:03:09.660> overall<00:03:11.330> you

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
gives you a a better shot overall you

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.920 
gives you a a better shot overall you
can<00:03:12.450> actually<00:03:12.630> capture<00:03:12.990> more<00:03:13.440> with<00:03:13.710> that<00:03:14.930> so

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
can actually capture more with that so

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.560 
can actually capture more with that so
now<00:03:17.000> I've<00:03:18.000> got<00:03:18.150> these<00:03:18.390> two<00:03:18.710> items<00:03:19.710> here<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.570> I
