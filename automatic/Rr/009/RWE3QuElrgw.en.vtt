00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
all right I'm going to try a 0 to 1800

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.200 
all right I'm going to try a 0 to 1800
trunk<00:00:03.870> run<00:00:04.110> sensors<00:00:04.710> there<00:00:04.890> Mike<00:00:07.160> voltmeters

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
trunk run sensors there Mike voltmeters

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.580 
trunk run sensors there Mike voltmeters
clamp<00:00:09.210> meter<00:00:09.450> 2<00:00:09.840> volt<00:00:10.050> meters<00:00:10.349> because<00:00:12.590> reads

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
clamp meter 2 volt meters because reads

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.090 
clamp meter 2 volt meters because reads
the<00:00:13.740> same<00:00:14.630> yeah<00:00:15.830> frequencies<00:00:16.830> 49<00:00:17.310> Hertz

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
the same yeah frequencies 49 Hertz

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.720 
the same yeah frequencies 49 Hertz
hopefully<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.130> can<00:00:21.050> get<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.320> down<00:00:22.740> with<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
hopefully I can get this down with the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:34.580 
hopefully I can get this down with the
camera<00:00:26.269> okay<00:00:27.269> let's<00:00:27.689> try<00:00:27.840> it

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.910 

Oh<00:00:37.370> fifty<00:00:38.370> point<00:00:38.700> one<00:00:38.970> five<00:00:39.470> that's<00:00:40.470> gonna<00:00:40.740> be

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
Oh fifty point one five that's gonna be

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:55.560 
Oh fifty point one five that's gonna be
way<00:00:41.070> under<00:00:50.059> twenty<00:00:51.059> three<00:00:51.300> point<00:00:51.690> six

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.959 

23.6

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
23.6

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:04.389 
23.6
sixty<00:00:58.780> point<00:00:59.019> eight

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:08.349 

it's<00:01:05.079> 1434<00:01:06.549> so<00:01:07.549> I<00:01:07.579> know<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:08.000> next<00:01:08.210> volume

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:08.359 
it's 1434 so I know the next volume

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:10.389 
it's 1434 so I know the next volume
click<00:01:08.689> is<00:01:08.810> like<00:01:08.960> 500<00:01:09.500> watts<00:01:09.679> which<00:01:10.009> kind<00:01:10.310> of

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
click is like 500 watts which kind of

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.139 
click is like 500 watts which kind of
sucks<00:01:10.960> so<00:01:11.960> I<00:01:12.409> don't<00:01:13.009> know<00:01:13.100> how<00:01:13.399> much<00:01:13.579> how<00:01:13.939> well

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
sucks so I don't know how much how well

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.649 
sucks so I don't know how much how well
that's<00:01:14.420> gonna<00:01:14.539> be<00:01:15.429> so

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.819 

let's<00:01:19.659> try<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:19.840> next<00:01:19.990> one<00:01:20.289> justice

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.380 

I'm<00:01:24.220> gonna<00:01:24.369> go<00:01:24.490> off<00:01:24.640> a<00:01:24.670> frequency<00:01:25.240> though

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
I'm gonna go off a frequency though

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.840 
I'm gonna go off a frequency though
because

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.310 

because<00:01:28.450> I<00:01:28.480> can

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
because I can

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.640 
because I can
all<00:01:30.530> right<00:01:30.800> so<00:01:31.100> fifty<00:01:31.700> point<00:01:32.630> one<00:01:32.840> five<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:33.560> we

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
all right so fifty point one five so we

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.749 
all right so fifty point one five so we
had

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
had

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:47.490 
had
I<00:01:34.789> try<00:01:35.299> to<00:01:35.360> go<00:01:35.509> up<00:01:35.630> with<00:01:36.490> okay

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:02:00.100 

fifty<00:01:48.500> point<00:01:48.740> eight<00:01:48.950> eight<00:01:57.880> over<00:01:59.110> twenty

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
fifty point eight eight over twenty

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:10.380 
fifty point eight eight over twenty
seven<00:02:00.560> point<00:02:00.710> four

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:18.580 

just<00:02:11.390> over<00:02:13.360> 1850<00:02:14.709> so<00:02:16.660> that's<00:02:17.660> all<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:17.870> can<00:02:18.050> do

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
just over 1850 so that's all I can do

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:27.690 
just over 1850 so that's all I can do
my<00:02:18.950> guess<00:02:19.190> is<00:02:19.220> about<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:19.700> fifty<00:02:20.150> point<00:02:20.420> eight

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.660 

all<00:02:28.700> right<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:29.300> I<00:02:29.330> did<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.599> fifty<00:02:30.349> to<00:02:30.380> one<00:02:30.770> past

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
all right so I did a fifty to one past

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.280 
all right so I did a fifty to one past
weekend<00:02:32.090> at<00:02:32.270> Midwest<00:02:32.569> has<00:02:32.690> field<00:02:32.900> finals

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
weekend at Midwest has field finals

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.229 
weekend at Midwest has field finals
doing<00:02:33.530> this<00:02:33.680> so<00:02:33.950> I'm<00:02:34.459> just<00:02:34.550> gonna<00:02:34.670> see<00:02:34.819> how<00:02:34.849> far

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
doing this so I'm just gonna see how far

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.040 
doing this so I'm just gonna see how far
down<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.569> am<00:02:35.930> today<00:02:37.300> after<00:02:38.300> doing<00:02:38.599> that<00:02:38.690> NS

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
down I am today after doing that NS

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.350 
down I am today after doing that NS
field<00:02:39.319> thing<00:02:39.650> just<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.130> calibrate<00:02:40.819> everything

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
field thing just to calibrate everything

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.780 
field thing just to calibrate everything
um<00:02:42.310> let's<00:02:43.310> just<00:02:43.430> check<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.120> out<00:02:45.069> 50<00:02:46.069> Hertz<00:02:46.340> is

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
um let's just check it out 50 Hertz is

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.870 
um let's just check it out 50 Hertz is
the<00:02:47.360> frequency<00:02:47.660> that<00:02:48.230> I<00:02:48.260> do<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.560> at<00:02:48.849> usually<00:02:49.849> I

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
the frequency that I do it at usually I

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.670 
the frequency that I do it at usually I
have<00:02:50.000> people<00:02:50.209> on<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:50.989> but<00:02:51.349> that's<00:02:51.470> only

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
have people on it so but that's only

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.800 
have people on it so but that's only
worth<00:02:51.830> like<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.040> couple<00:02:52.310> tenths<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.660> will

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
worth like a couple tenths so I will

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:06.850 
worth like a couple tenths so I will
just<00:02:53.959> give<00:02:54.110> it<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.230> shot

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:19.260 

Oh<00:03:10.210> way<00:03:11.210> down<00:03:11.420> 51<00:03:12.170> 3-1<00:03:13.720> okay<00:03:14.720> that<00:03:15.470> sucks

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.230 

I<00:03:19.390> lost<00:03:19.870> my<00:03:19.990> remote<00:03:20.320> when<00:03:20.530> I<00:03:20.560> did<00:03:20.800> that<00:03:20.980> I<00:03:21.250> had

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
I lost my remote when I did that I had

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:30.070 
I lost my remote when I did that I had
to<00:03:22.420> roll<00:03:22.570> it<00:03:22.720> back

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.540 

probably<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.230> least<00:03:31.440> smooth<00:03:31.920> video<00:03:32.340> I've

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
probably the least smooth video I've

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.800 
probably the least smooth video I've
ever<00:03:32.730> made<00:03:32.880> in<00:03:33.060> my<00:03:33.209> life

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
ever made in my life

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.610 
ever made in my life
okay<00:03:34.650> sooo<00:03:36.920> 24.9

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.979 

that's<00:03:41.160> way<00:03:41.430> down<00:03:41.849> I<00:03:42.090> think<00:03:42.150> usually<00:03:42.690> what

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
that's way down I think usually what

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.940 
that's way down I think usually what
it's<00:03:43.110> at<00:03:43.310> 24.9

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
it's at 24.9

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.520 
it's at 24.9
and<00:03:46.060> seventy<00:03:47.060> four<00:03:47.240> point<00:03:47.540> eight<00:03:47.660> use<00:03:47.930> well<00:03:48.319> no

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
and seventy four point eight use well no

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.740 
and seventy four point eight use well no
actually<00:03:48.709> that's<00:03:49.010> about<00:03:49.160> right

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.480 

1860

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
1860

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.620 
1860
gosh<00:03:56.090> this<00:03:56.900> camera<00:03:58.330> 1860<00:03:59.330> you<00:03:59.450> can't

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
gosh this camera 1860 you can't

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.990

at<00:04:05.510> 1850<00:04:06.470> at<00:04:06.680> Midwest<00:04:07.100> us<00:04:07.220> feel<00:04:07.370> finals<00:04:07.819> I<00:04:07.940> did

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
at 1850 at Midwest us feel finals I did

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.690 
at 1850 at Midwest us feel finals I did
