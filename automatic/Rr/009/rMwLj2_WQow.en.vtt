00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050
 very good 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.500
 5 campaign because online is not yet 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.940
 it works and well you are asking me 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.010
 by twitter all that you are 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.990
 following day by day what is happening 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.849
 with psn and xbox live servers 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.260
 because they are not working good and good 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.730
 come to comment some things to the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.930
 Extremadura a little bit but I want you 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.210
 Look out because the truth is that 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.560
 we are all very crazy among the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.900
 hackers who are attacking those who have 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.430
 let attack king.com 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.429
 gifted premium accounts and everything 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.199
 is getting involved let's see first 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.620
 I want to tell you that lisa de square 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.690
 ok is not attacking for now the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.969
 playstation network and xbox servers 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.070
 live according to them are not attacking this 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.690
 tomorrow without filter that they had returned to 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.270
 attack but they say in a 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.829
 interview that have not come back to dock 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.120
 then we have no proof of whether they are 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.329
 returning to attack the playstation 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.010
 network and those of xbox live or yes or no 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.719
 it does not really negotiate that it does not 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.579
 are attacking or 100 lie that what 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.579
 they are attacking and they lie in total 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.800
 what happens that king.com as you already know 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.630
 yesterday gave away 3,000 account to the group of 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.150
 liza square 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.010
 valued at a lot each account is worth 100 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.350
 dollars imagine 350 the more 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.520
 lottery then he said if he left 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.550
 to attack xbox and psn I would give them three 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.050
 thousand accounts but if he attacked again he 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.480
 he removed the 3,000 accounts worth 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.850
 that I doubt very much that you ready to adapt 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.670
 attack again then what is it that 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.190
 happens there were so many attacks that 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.190
 they put the psn and xbox servers 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.470
 live invoiced servers vouchers 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.380
 to saturate the servers with an attack 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.060
 since from you go away from two as 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.380
 you want to call him, what they do is 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.540
 they have to reset the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.940
 servers and they have to configure of 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.100
 again then the font engineers and 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.380
 they are supposedly fixing what is worth 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.170
 We do not know if casting the 24 hours are 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.880
 eight hours or are 14 hours fixing 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.680
 they have already stopped and until tomorrow they do not 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.300
 they are going to fix what they do 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.610
 we know that right now we are without 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.009
 connection is valid on the 27th and three of the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.600
 tomorrow we are offline and we do not know 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.000
 when will we return what we can 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.270
 know is that he will come back very soon and what 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.220
 what 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.959
 and I have come to know is that they have 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.750
 removed the snow they have removed the snow 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.980
 in playstation3 it was working and 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.599
 now it seems to have stopped working 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.550
 also playstation3 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.800
 they may be configuring the 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.200
 engineers a few new servers are 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.120
 configuring a new ip or they will be 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.220
 doing something that is not going for them anymore 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.590
 are in maintenance can be also 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.110
 that has attacking again and is another 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.239
 group to try to get other things 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.099
 for example azÃ³n and who want to tell you 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.810
 look, we want a million 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.519
 dollars supposedly worth this 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.569
 news is not real where I'm putting 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.980
 I an example 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.840
 we want a million dollars we already know 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.670
 attack or what is what we are 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.500
 doing because the truth is and is not 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.849
 saying nothing on his official website 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.799
 they said this morning or this afternoon 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.690
 that I think they received new 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.849
 attacks but liza which is saying 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.489
 that is not anonymous has told him to analyze 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.500
 square that was mind by means to 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.049
 that they do not attack anymore and they say that we 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.790
 ok then the thing is leaving 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.040
 the hands we call simply 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.540
 he enrolled and without xbox live they are 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.700
 saying by twitter for and you think that 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.190
 They should reward us with something 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.200
 good what we have play station 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.550
 the playstation club should 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.140
 reward not for sure what to say 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.790
 because we lost 23 days of 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.440
 playstation plus there are people who 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.540
 they buy for 15 days there are people who 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.460
 they buy for 30 days and they do not have a year 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.100
 bought then those 15 days if you 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.090
 they lose 33 days they have less then no 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.070
 It does what they will do to 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.720
 reward vouchers I do not know if what he says 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.400
 that the sock for those who do not 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.050
 they were able to use then they are going to have 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.120
 when I return to reset in the 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.880
 online mode collection what it says 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.890
 we see also is that they are trying to 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.200
 fix it but there is not an exact date 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.610
 to tell us it already works in all 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.220
 the platforms or works now 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.200
 playstation3 lawsuits are four not to the 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.070
 bear in the morning and I can climb last 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.660
 playstation plus video would not you got 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.570
 in lawsuits over sectors but to 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.640
 playstation plus was not going in my region 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.170
 in Spain then what it means 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.280
 that we fixing what has 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.870
 past that they have not finished it 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.780
 fix why or why they have returned 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.700
 to attack or because they have returned to 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.800
 engineers is to say look 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.599
 here we will fix things 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.459
 until the guilty parties do not leave 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.230
 let's re -open made so that 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.850
 stop the consequences or we are going to 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.600
 try to change the servers to 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.940
 that is a minor antipirate anti anti 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.889
 attacks I do not know how to call it okay but yes 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.050
 that we do not know when the 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.729
 online mode I hope tomorrow is worth 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.650
 although it is very complicated that tomorrow 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.290
 come back because those attack me is very 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.520
 very strong and as reported liza which 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.680
 yesterday the attack was likely successful 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.100
 let's say like this he succeeded because they came 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.900
 cables marine cables about a 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.400
 marine internet cables and says almost 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.860
 Maybe they are the connection and not the 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.790
 they can cut one I say they have there 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.220
 it is understood 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.810
 themselves that there is a company with a 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.229
 group slide which is attacking 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.479
 to the same and another and another group that are 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.220
 trying not to attack and enter 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.200
 he is carrying all the codfish and 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.120
 we are both without play station online 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.889
 It's so good until I can 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.050
 tell by twitter I will tell you 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.120
 all all all the information that 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.340
 I'll have what I'll tell you if you continue 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.080
 I'll tell you if they do not keep attacking 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.400
 as for now they say they are not 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.830
 attacking because the year is an interview 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:24.090
 for a web page I think it's called 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.440
 bbc or a news from the us I do not know now what 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.970
 I'm going to search and I'll put it in the 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.690
 description in case you want to read it and 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.770
 they say then that they are not and are not 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.060
 and so he is saying yes they are 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.639
 clarifying what is worth but supposedly 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.040
 They are arranging the servers to use 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.510
 square you've already stopped worth oil good 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.370
 but I like the information you already know 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.169
 the favorite jce share it with you 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.340
