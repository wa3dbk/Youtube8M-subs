00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.059
 What does this team want to distinguish in the new season? 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.630
 a lot of talent and a lot of playful talent percent 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.449
 very different 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.010
 Attacking players many different offensive players 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.910
 below, hopefully, the same compactness percentage is similar 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.940
 Compact seminar in the past season 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.380
 we can not compare because this song is a different one this year 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.460
 We'll never know how and create this song from last year 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.190
 Santander's opponents would have played their opponents 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.140
 changed 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.360
 That's why the last song is the last song so they've been checked for a long time 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.010
 and Uncle the only thing we can possibly take there is this one 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.500
 Claim constantly 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.280
 to stay with you 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.410
 to have high requirements 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.890
 and to go to the limit in this constancy 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.920
 We also try to inject this team together and there 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.700
 Let's hope we set the standards 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.170
 the applicants can confirm 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.650
 There is a special surprise for the training camps 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.030
 I'm always the TUM before percent of each investigation against one 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.190
 essential things 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.850
 in this backpack 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.260
 to give nets to confirm the story of the whole time 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.150
 Semmer surprise is the wrong word but I am very pleased with the process 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.500
 from the way the team here this most intense phase of the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.850
 So preparation has gone through 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.540
 incredibly powerful 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.540
 very attentive 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.820
 Performance Tests Reasonableness and resilience really at the highest limit 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.940
 and always drives with a laugh 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.300
 the rooms with HÃ¼fner 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.480
 hopefully positive mood and sensitivities 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.730
 the botched was very much fun and the female i just looked 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.260
 a big surprise 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.470
 but still you get positive out of the crisis 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.729
 who did not take me for granted 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.089
 the team has to integrate new players to the morning 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:14.369
 that succeeded 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:16.609
 the tens note that not bad 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.809
 The day-to-day dealings that have been too much Nazi 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:23.749
 Feature was everything works much less because on the one hand, the existing group 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:26.239
 b 90 has resumed 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.189
 for another, the new players are very quick to insert here Adriaanse too 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.219
 have always been there 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.579
 one must very quickly find one very harmonious with one another very much 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.869
 performance-oriented the ambitious one with each other 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:42.939
 and loved ones can be pushy good feeling if you are the last one 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.059
 Subtleties so on 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:47.019
 someone very good feeling from the baptism
