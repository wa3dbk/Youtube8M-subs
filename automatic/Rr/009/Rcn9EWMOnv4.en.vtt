00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.040
 hey I'm mobile is supposed to go something 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.360
 we really have the transformer 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.790
 p300 that's the thing we used to do 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.560
 already out of the database of the FC 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.090
 rummaged had which we therefore already 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.610
 times pictures were available that is a 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.250
 new yoga style design so we have 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.230
 here a kind of yes, we almost say 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.029
 Ultrabook but clearly heavier 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.009
 and with a normal hard drive too 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.329
 when needed so the device should be relatively 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.920
 to be cheap 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.540
 and what you can do here is like at 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.520
 A yoga one can complete the display 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.489
 fold over though it's a 13.3 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.989
 inch notebook acts the whole thing 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.820
 to a large extent of aluminum we 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.039
 So here we have aluminum we have on 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.780
 the cover aluminum feels right 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.690
 high quality to the bottom exists 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.420
 However, from plastic the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.890
 planer weighs in at a total of 175 kilograms 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.390
 significantly more than in the ultra book 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.710
 normally it would weigh even 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.719
 a 15 inch version 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.579
 that is of course even harder 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.790
 but we limit ourselves here 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.159
 the 13 3 we have an intel core here 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.350
 i7 in with good performance is likely 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.530
 that then be and there is one 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.080
 nvidia gt 820 m graphics unit 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.000
 So you have an additional card installed it 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.090
 gives eight gigabytes of RAM and 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.740
 a ssd with 128 bit or just one 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.360
 normal hard drive that can go up 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.220
 up to a terabyte 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.270
 To say knock the battery has 50 watts 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.190
 hours should be a right 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.810
 but we can achieve a good running time 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.640
 I'll take a look around that again 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.040
 still very important to mention, of course 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.210
 this is a full hd panel we are 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.909
 So have 13 3 inches and 1920 x 1080 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.829
 pixel resolution 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.210
 We watched a lot to make it 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.679
 the whole time or us 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.380
 first catch the camera up here 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.060
 of which would have a front camera are the 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.229
 keyboard has one as the normal size 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.329
 one knows already from other than 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.789
 Ultrabooks The trackpad is amazing 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:01.280
 big what we all is a relative 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.959
 wider stripes below the display 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.060
 Of course we will not have any time 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.340
 to expect so far also touch panel 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.379
 but now let's get around 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.150
 the cover up here as I said 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.370
 aluminum and on the sides there are 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.860
 a power connection of course the full 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.140
 size hdmi port two usb 3.0 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.879
 Connections headphones off comes to it 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.510
 otherwise not farther on the front 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.950
 these three leds up here for 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.569
 power supply battery status and 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.040
 of course tested and on the left 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.500
 side there is the one and 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.680
 turn off the volume rocker one 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.780
 Windows even start a full reason 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.609
 size sd card reader then another 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.790
 normal usb port so in 2 0 rounds 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:42.650
 no victory and that's it on the ground sees 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.980
 that nothing is exchanged here 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.400
 can 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.849
 So it remains closed the device 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.890
 as I said 175 kilo not necessarily 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.450
 It should also be easy soon 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.459
 Germany will be to have then 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.010
 probably I would guess so from the 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.360
 600 500 600 euro go because it is 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.500
 a very consumer oriented 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.030
 i was studying roland on the computex 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.480
 2014 company bury but you that we 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.950
 you liked then give us free 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.599
 subscribe to the channel of course and still 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.769
 to get more videos to computex and 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.769
 I'll see you again soon post on
