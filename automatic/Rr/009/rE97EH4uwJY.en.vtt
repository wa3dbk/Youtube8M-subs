today is called free Pratt and it was
created<00:00:37.200> by<00:00:37.320> secret<00:00:37.800> schnitzel<00:00:38.219> now<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:39.090> know

there<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:40.079> map<00:00:40.290> called<00:00:40.620> regret<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:42.149> Halo<00:00:42.540> 5

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
there is a map called regret in Halo 5

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.810 
there is a map called regret in Halo 5
this<00:00:43.440> map<00:00:43.649> was<00:00:43.800> named<00:00:44.070> before<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.700> was

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
this map was named before that was

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.389 
this map was named before that was
announced<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.660> I'm<00:00:45.780> sure<00:00:46.050> schnitzel<00:00:46.590> regrets

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
announced and I'm sure schnitzel regrets

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.510 
announced and I'm sure schnitzel regrets
that<00:00:48.059> map<00:00:48.899> name<00:00:49.170> now<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.800> might<00:00:50.039> change<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
that map name now it might change in the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.000 
that map name now it might change in the
future<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:51.329> anyways<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:52.140> map<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.379> actually

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
future but anyways this map is actually

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.569 
future but anyways this map is actually
inspired<00:00:53.250> by<00:00:53.570> part<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.289> halo<00:00:55.890> 2<00:00:56.129> campaign

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
inspired by part of the halo 2 campaign

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.450 
inspired by part of the halo 2 campaign
mission<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.239> same<00:00:57.449> name<00:00:57.800> where<00:00:58.800> you're

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
mission of the same name where you're

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.369 
mission of the same name where you're
fighting<00:01:00.000> hunters<00:01:00.480> right<00:01:00.719> before<00:01:01.020> getting<00:01:01.289> on

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
fighting hunters right before getting on

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.009 
fighting hunters right before getting on
the<00:01:01.440> big<00:01:01.949> gondola<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.420> you'll<00:01:03.660> see<00:01:03.870> that

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the big gondola and you'll see that

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.649 
the big gondola and you'll see that
inspiration<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.830> top<00:01:05.100> mid<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:05.939> not<00:01:06.119> really<00:01:06.450> in

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
inspiration in top mid but not really in

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.880 
inspiration in top mid but not really in
the<00:01:06.689> layout<00:01:07.020> it's<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.950> visual<00:01:08.340> thing<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
the layout it's just a visual thing and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.410 
the layout it's just a visual thing and
speaking<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.040> layout<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.700> rather

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
speaking of the layout it's rather

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.000 
speaking of the layout it's rather
straightforward<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.409> map<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.830> works

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
straightforward on this map but it works

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.999 
straightforward on this map but it works
really<00:01:14.310> really<00:01:14.640> nicely<00:01:15.150> for<00:01:16.110> capture<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
really really nicely for capture the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.420 
really really nicely for capture the
flag<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:18.049> the<00:01:19.580> layout<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.759> basically<00:01:21.720> a

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
flag and the layout is basically a

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.550 
flag and the layout is basically a
semicircular<00:01:23.430> ring<00:01:24.330> surrounding<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.290> central

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
semicircular ring surrounding a central

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.859 
semicircular ring surrounding a central
platform<00:01:26.030> but<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> interesting<00:01:27.450> thing<00:01:27.840> is

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
platform but the interesting thing is

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.200 
platform but the interesting thing is
that<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.259> whole<00:01:28.650> net<00:01:28.860> has<00:01:29.189> two<00:01:29.640> vertical

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
that the whole net has two vertical

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.660 
that the whole net has two vertical
levels<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.780> there<00:01:31.740> are<00:01:31.829> lots<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.189> cool<00:01:32.430> ways

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
levels and there are lots of cool ways

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.270 
levels and there are lots of cool ways
to<00:01:32.700> get<00:01:33.479> between<00:01:33.689> these<00:01:34.049> levels<00:01:34.290> there's<00:01:34.950> lots

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
to get between these levels there's lots

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.880 
to get between these levels there's lots
of<00:01:35.930> variation<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.409> ways<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.740> can

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
of variation in the ways you can

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.750 
of variation in the ways you can
traverse<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
traverse the

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.390 
traverse the
so<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.690> flags<00:01:39.990> are<00:01:40.230> in<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.680> tops<00:01:40.980> of<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
so the flags are in the tops of the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.660 
so the flags are in the tops of the
bases<00:01:41.790> right<00:01:41.970> across<00:01:42.530> from<00:01:43.530> each<00:01:43.710> other<00:01:43.890> with

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
bases right across from each other with

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.760 
bases right across from each other with
the<00:01:45.060> central<00:01:45.840> platform<00:01:46.050> right<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.620> between

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
the central platform right in between

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.130 
the central platform right in between
them<00:01:47.190> and<00:01:47.340> top<00:01:48.180> mid<00:01:48.480> is<00:01:48.720> actually<00:01:49.110> very

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
them and top mid is actually very

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.590 
them and top mid is actually very
exposed<00:01:49.830> location<00:01:50.610> but<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.120> fastest

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
exposed location but it's the fastest

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.840 
exposed location but it's the fastest
way<00:01:51.630> between<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.230> flags<00:01:52.440> bottom<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.640> much

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
way between the flags bottom it is much

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.690 
way between the flags bottom it is much
safer<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> longer<00:01:55.740> way<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.160> get<00:01:56.400> between

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
safer but is a longer way to get between

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.850 
safer but is a longer way to get between
the<00:01:56.880> flags<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.390> then<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> ring<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.530> also<00:01:58.830> a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
the flags and then the ring is also a

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.310 
the flags and then the ring is also a
longer<00:01:59.220> way<00:01:59.340> between<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.790> flags<00:01:59.970> but<00:02:00.300> you<00:02:01.110> can

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
longer way between the flags but you can

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.080 
longer way between the flags but you can
actually<00:02:01.650> pick<00:02:01.800> up<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:01.980> sniper<00:02:02.370> rifle<00:02:02.790> along

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
actually pick up the sniper rifle along

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.850 
actually pick up the sniper rifle along
there<00:02:03.300> which<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.480> very<00:02:03.870> powerful<00:02:04.110> on<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.650> map

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
there which is very powerful on this map

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.850 
there which is very powerful on this map
and<00:02:05.070> get<00:02:05.700> some<00:02:05.940> good<00:02:06.090> sight<00:02:06.390> lines<00:02:06.530> across<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
and get some good sight lines across the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.100 
and get some good sight lines across the
rest<00:02:08.040> of<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.250> map<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:09.030> there's<00:02:09.540> lots<00:02:09.810> of

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
rest of the map so there's lots of

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.620 
rest of the map so there's lots of
variety<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.070> how<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.400> can<00:02:11.730> attack<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.210> bases

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
variety and how you can attack the bases

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.600 
variety and how you can attack the bases
you'll<00:02:13.170> get<00:02:13.260> some<00:02:13.470> awesome<00:02:14.190> games<00:02:14.220> that

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
you'll get some awesome games that

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.120 
you'll get some awesome games that
capture<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.000> flag<00:02:15.210> on<00:02:15.450> here<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:16.410> like<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:17.070> said

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
capture the flag on here so like I said

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.860 
capture the flag on here so like I said
the<00:02:17.370> sniper<00:02:17.730> rifle<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.210> located<00:02:18.660> in<00:02:18.840> the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
the sniper rifle is located in the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.950 
the sniper rifle is located in the
center<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.770> Ring<00:02:19.950> on<00:02:20.190> top<00:02:20.670> at<00:02:20.970> top<00:02:21.600> gold

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
center of the Ring on top at top gold

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.140 
center of the Ring on top at top gold
which<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:22.980> actually<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.460> top<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.880> length

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
which is actually the top of a length

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.050 
which is actually the top of a length
the<00:02:25.020> over<00:02:25.650> shield<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.190> located<00:02:26.670> right<00:02:26.850> in<00:02:26.910> the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
the over shield is located right in the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.500 
the over shield is located right in the
middle<00:02:27.240> of<00:02:27.390> top<00:02:27.870> mid<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.970> like<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.090> said<00:02:30.150> that

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
middle of top mid and like I said that

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.660 
middle of top mid and like I said that
area<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:30.930> very<00:02:31.020> exposed<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.190> over<00:02:32.459> shield

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
area is very exposed so that over shield

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.610 
area is very exposed so that over shield
is<00:02:32.820> definitely<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.690> big<00:02:33.870> risk<00:02:34.140> versus<00:02:34.500> reward

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
is definitely a big risk versus reward

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.699 
is definitely a big risk versus reward
thing<00:02:35.160> there<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.610> then<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:36.810> bottom<00:02:37.290> mid<00:02:37.500> we

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
thing there and then in bottom mid we

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.150 
thing there and then in bottom mid we
have<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.280> active<00:02:38.790> camouflage<00:02:39.030> located<00:02:39.990> and

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
have the active camouflage located and

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.760 
have the active camouflage located and
these<00:02:41.160> three<00:02:41.550> pickups<00:02:41.820> are<00:02:42.240> all<00:02:42.600> on<00:02:42.959> static

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
these three pickups are all on static

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.820 
these three pickups are all on static
weapon<00:02:44.070> timers<00:02:44.430> as<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:45.270> showed<00:02:45.600> in<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:46.290> tutorial

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
weapon timers as I showed in a tutorial

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.060 
weapon timers as I showed in a tutorial
a<00:02:47.100> couple<00:02:47.459> weeks<00:02:47.850> ago<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.890> they're<00:02:49.890> all

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
a couple weeks ago and they're all

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.560 
a couple weeks ago and they're all
really<00:02:50.310> important<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:50.940> contest<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.450> they're

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
really important to contest and they're

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.390 
really important to contest and they're
all<00:02:51.690> really<00:02:51.900> useful<00:02:52.470> for<00:02:52.800> when<00:02:52.890> you're<00:02:53.100> trying

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
all really useful for when you're trying

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
all really useful for when you're trying
to<00:02:53.550> push<00:02:53.850> in<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.540> get<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.410> enemy<00:02:55.680> flag<00:02:55.980> and

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
to push in and get the enemy flag and

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.610 
to push in and get the enemy flag and
when<00:02:57.420> you're<00:02:57.570> playing<00:02:57.810> flag<00:02:58.170> there<00:02:58.410> are<00:02:58.500> some

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
when you're playing flag there are some

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.199 
when you're playing flag there are some
really<00:02:58.739> cool<00:02:59.010> jumps<00:02:59.519> on<00:02:59.670> here<00:02:59.850> so<00:03:00.060> there's

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
really cool jumps on here so there's

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.699 
really cool jumps on here so there's
already<00:03:00.390> a<00:03:00.600> bunch<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.930> cool<00:03:01.080> jumps<00:03:01.410> on<00:03:01.530> here

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
already a bunch of cool jumps on here

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.570 
already a bunch of cool jumps on here
the<00:03:02.489> map<00:03:02.670> kind<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.300> has<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:04.470> bridge<00:03:04.980> works<00:03:05.250> 5

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
the map kind of has a bridge works 5

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.759 
the map kind of has a bridge works 5
similar<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.300> lockout<00:03:06.690> or<00:03:06.750> guardian<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.470> some

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
similar to lockout or guardian in some

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.430 
similar to lockout or guardian in some
ways<00:03:07.950> it's<00:03:08.220> very<00:03:08.660> loosely<00:03:09.660> similar<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.320> those

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
ways it's very loosely similar to those

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.640 
ways it's very loosely similar to those
maps<00:03:10.769> so<00:03:11.670> there<00:03:12.269> are<00:03:12.300> lots<00:03:12.630> of<00:03:12.810> cool<00:03:13.019> jumps<00:03:13.410> but

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
maps so there are lots of cool jumps but

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.050 
maps so there are lots of cool jumps but
with<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.160> flag<00:03:14.459> there's<00:03:14.760> some<00:03:14.910> more

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
with the flag there's some more

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.060 
with the flag there's some more
interesting<00:03:15.570> ones<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:15.870> can<00:03:16.019> do<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.680> if<00:03:16.920> you

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
interesting ones you can do so if you

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.610 
interesting ones you can do so if you
jump<00:03:17.370> out<00:03:17.580> of<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.910> windows<00:03:18.360> in<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.989> bases<00:03:19.440> you

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
jump out of the windows in the bases you

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.979 
jump out of the windows in the bases you
can<00:03:19.650> actually<00:03:20.060> throw<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.300> flag<00:03:21.540> in<00:03:21.780> midair

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
can actually throw the flag in midair

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.830 
can actually throw the flag in midair
and<00:03:22.320> land<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:23.130> on<00:03:23.280> top<00:03:23.610> mid<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.269> if<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.570> do<00:03:24.720> it

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
and land it on top mid and if you do it

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.449 
and land it on top mid and if you do it
just<00:03:24.870> right<00:03:25.140> you<00:03:25.320> won't<00:03:25.800> fall<00:03:26.070> into<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.430> water

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
just right you won't fall into the water

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.960 
just right you won't fall into the water
and<00:03:26.790> die<00:03:26.970> when<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:28.050> do<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.410> but<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.730> can

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
and die when you do that but you can

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.750 
and die when you do that but you can
actually<00:03:30.959> throw<00:03:31.830> it<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.160> land<00:03:32.519> on<00:03:32.670> the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
actually throw it and land on the

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.300 
actually throw it and land on the
platform<00:03:33.180> below<00:03:33.600> go<00:03:33.930> through<00:03:34.200> bottom<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.739> but

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
platform below go through bottom it but

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.160 
platform below go through bottom it but
that<00:03:35.610> sort<00:03:35.880> of<00:03:35.970> thing<00:03:36.030> really<00:03:36.360> encourages<00:03:37.019> you

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
that sort of thing really encourages you

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.750 
that sort of thing really encourages you
to<00:03:37.200> work<00:03:37.440> with<00:03:37.620> your<00:03:37.739> team<00:03:37.800> to<00:03:38.220> pull<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.489> flag

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
to work with your team to pull the flag

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.400 
to work with your team to pull the flag
because<00:03:39.030> obviously<00:03:39.239> just<00:03:39.750> throwing<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.170> flag

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
because obviously just throwing the flag

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.100 
because obviously just throwing the flag
up<00:03:40.590> there<00:03:40.800> by<00:03:41.010> yourself<00:03:41.540> with<00:03:42.540> no<00:03:42.570> one<00:03:42.930> there

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
up there by yourself with no one there

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.570 
up there by yourself with no one there
to<00:03:43.140> grab<00:03:43.739> it<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.130> run<00:03:44.340> it

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
to grab it and run it

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.240 
to grab it and run it
back<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.760> your<00:03:44.850> base<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.690> not<00:03:46.140> going<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.410> do<00:03:47.100> you

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
back to your base is not going to do you

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.130 
back to your base is not going to do you
any<00:03:47.280> good<00:03:47.520> so<00:03:48.240> there's<00:03:48.510> lots<00:03:48.690> of<00:03:48.930> cool

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
any good so there's lots of cool

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.820 
any good so there's lots of cool
strategies<00:03:49.710> therefore<00:03:50.160> flag<00:03:50.600> and<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:52.380> map<00:03:52.590> is

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
strategies therefore flag and the map is

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.520 
strategies therefore flag and the map is
just<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.400> really<00:03:53.940> great<00:03:54.210> map<00:03:54.510> especially<00:03:55.290> this

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
just a really great map especially this

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.700 
just a really great map especially this
stage<00:03:55.920> in<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.250> game<00:03:56.930> for<00:03:57.930> just<00:03:58.380> being<00:03:58.560> a

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
stage in the game for just being a

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.710 
stage in the game for just being a
really<00:03:58.950> straightforward<00:03:59.640> map<00:04:00.300> that<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:00.540> can

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
really straightforward map that you can
