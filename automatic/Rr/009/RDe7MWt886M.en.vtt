just the monkey ball fanatic I think out

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.370 
just the monkey ball fanatic I think out
of<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.790> hundreds<00:01:29.330> of<00:01:29.450> monkey<00:01:29.780> ball<00:01:29.930> stages

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
of the hundreds of monkey ball stages

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.410 
of the hundreds of monkey ball stages
invented<00:01:30.920> they<00:01:31.400> could<00:01:31.610> use<00:01:31.730> a<00:01:31.760> few<00:01:32.120> of<00:01:32.240> them

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
invented they could use a few of them

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.720 
invented they could use a few of them
for<00:01:32.630> a<00:01:32.660> stage<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:33.230> have<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.860> actual<00:01:34.370> monkeys

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
for a stage and have the actual monkeys

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.130 
for a stage and have the actual monkeys
roll<00:01:34.970> onto<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.300> playing<00:01:35.510> field<00:01:35.810> every<00:01:35.990> once

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
roll onto the playing field every once

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.050 
roll onto the playing field every once
in<00:01:36.260> a<00:01:36.350> while<00:01:36.410> and<00:01:36.770> have<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.340> stage<00:01:37.550> tilt<00:01:37.880> like

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
in a while and have the stage tilt like

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.420 
in a while and have the stage tilt like
in<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.270> real<00:01:38.390> game<00:01:38.690> woohoo<00:01:39.560> island<00:01:40.070> this

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.160 
in the real game woohoo island this
would<00:01:40.610> be<00:01:40.700> perfect<00:01:41.090> that<00:01:41.120> Nizar<00:01:41.600> added<00:01:41.930> into

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
would be perfect that Nizar added into

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.930 
would be perfect that Nizar added into
the<00:01:42.260> game<00:01:42.440> you<00:01:42.710> could<00:01:43.130> travel<00:01:43.430> around<00:01:43.640> the
