fundamentals correctly I'm gold should
be<00:01:08.909> much<00:01:09.150> higher<00:01:09.420> do<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.110> still<00:01:10.380> stand<00:01:10.560> by

be much higher do you still stand by
that<00:01:10.890> well<00:01:11.549> sure<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> reason<00:01:12.150> why<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.420> say<00:01:12.720> a

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
that well sure the reason why I say a

that well sure the reason why I say a
surprises<00:01:13.500> don't<00:01:13.619> reflect<00:01:13.950> fundamentals<00:01:14.610> is

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
surprises don't reflect fundamentals is

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.120 
surprises don't reflect fundamentals is
because<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> Federal<00:01:15.330> Reserve<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:16.130> actively

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
because the Federal Reserve is actively

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.130 
because the Federal Reserve is actively
engaged<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.000> market<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.509> right<00:01:18.960> now

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
engaged in the market and right now

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.810 
engaged in the market and right now
we're<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.409> stage<00:01:19.710> where<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.520> lame

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
we're the stage where we have a lame

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.580 
we're the stage where we have a lame
duck<00:01:21.060> fat<00:01:21.330> share<00:01:21.600> we<00:01:21.990> don't<00:01:22.200> really<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
duck fat share we don't really have the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.010 
duck fat share we don't really have the
new<00:01:22.890> fetcher<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.520> there<00:01:23.700> yet<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:24.720> can't

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
new fetcher in there yet and so we can't

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.120 
new fetcher in there yet and so we can't
really<00:01:25.080> price<00:01:25.470> anything<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:26.040> that

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
really price anything in that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.730 
really price anything in that
environment<00:01:26.540> and<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.229> gold

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
environment and and and and gold

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.310 
environment and and and and gold
ultimately<00:01:29.400> will<00:01:29.880> do<00:01:30.060> well<00:01:30.270> once<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.200> get

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
ultimately will do well once we get

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.200 
ultimately will do well once we get
economic<00:01:31.829> growth<00:01:32.040> because<00:01:32.670> then<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.060> will

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
economic growth because then it will

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.760 
economic growth because then it will
become<00:01:33.329> apparent<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.350> cannot<00:01:34.619> afford

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
become apparent that we cannot afford

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.530 
become apparent that we cannot afford
positive<00:01:35.460> real<00:01:35.610> rates<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.450> this

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
positive real rates and so we on this

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.960 
positive real rates and so we on this
environment<00:01:37.049> right<00:01:37.200> now<00:01:37.380> we<00:01:37.950> are<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.430> folks

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
environment right now we are the folks

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.010 
environment right now we are the folks
who<00:01:39.060> bought<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.420> because<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> christ

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
who bought it because of the christ

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.810 
who bought it because of the christ
years<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:41.009> folks<00:01:41.250> who<00:01:41.400> think<00:01:41.430> there's

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
years on out the folks who think there's

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.219 
years on out the folks who think there's
inflation<00:01:42.090> they<00:01:42.329> are<00:01:42.390> not<00:01:42.479> quite<00:01:42.689> yet<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.020> gold

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
inflation they are not quite yet in gold

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.840 
inflation they are not quite yet in gold
and<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> nicer<00:01:44.100> environment<00:01:44.399> where

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
and so it's a nicer environment where

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.960 
and so it's a nicer environment where
you<00:01:44.909> can<00:01:45.030> accumulate<00:01:45.329> some<00:01:45.600> gold<00:01:45.780> axel<00:01:46.970> where

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
you can accumulate some gold axel where

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.219 
you can accumulate some gold axel where
do<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.119> think<00:01:48.329> all<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.689> headed<00:01:49.020> from<00:01:49.170> here

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
do you think all this headed from here

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.920 
do you think all this headed from here
now<00:01:49.590> for<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.009> within<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> next<00:01:50.399> six<00:01:50.640> months

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
now for it within the next six months

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.870 
now for it within the next six months
well<00:01:52.250> predictions<00:01:53.250> are<00:01:53.310> difficult<00:01:53.640> when<00:01:53.759> they

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
well predictions are difficult when they

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.810 
well predictions are difficult when they
relate<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.540> future<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:56.070> had<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.520> lot

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
relate to the future but you had a lot

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.819 
relate to the future but you had a lot
of<00:01:56.850> leveraging<00:01:57.390> gold<00:01:57.600> because<00:01:57.869> 12<00:01:58.110> gold<00:01:58.680> went

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
of leveraging gold because 12 gold went

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.380 
of leveraging gold because 12 gold went
up<00:01:58.890> for<00:01:59.070> 12<00:01:59.219> years<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.520> row<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.060> clearly

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
up for 12 years in a row and so clearly

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.270 
up for 12 years in a row and so clearly
even<00:02:01.020> as<00:02:01.110> gold<00:02:01.320> recovers<00:02:01.860> there<00:02:02.040> will<00:02:02.159> be

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
even as gold recovers there will be

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.950 
even as gold recovers there will be
those<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.549> as<00:02:02.939> they<00:02:03.090> break<00:02:03.329> even<00:02:03.659> they'll<00:02:03.750> go

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
those that as they break even they'll go

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.149 
those that as they break even they'll go
out<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.380> going<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.530> take<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> while<00:02:04.979> for

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
out so it's going to take a while for

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.039 
out so it's going to take a while for
goal<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.579> come<00:02:05.759> back<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:06.450> at<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.630> same<00:02:06.810> time<00:02:06.990> I

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
goal to come back but at the same time I

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.389 
goal to come back but at the same time I
wouldn't<00:02:07.350> be<00:02:07.439> surprised<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.920> see<00:02:07.950> gold<00:02:08.250> at

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
wouldn't be surprised to see gold at

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.369 
wouldn't be surprised to see gold at
1,500<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.970> year<00:02:09.000> from<00:02:09.239> now<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.899> axel<00:02:10.289> you

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
1,500 a year from now and axel you

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.559 
1,500 a year from now and axel you
mentioned<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.800> Fed<00:02:11.099> before<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.849> offline<00:02:12.420> we

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
mentioned the Fed before and offline we

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.320 
mentioned the Fed before and offline we
were<00:02:12.660> saying<00:02:12.930> how

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
were saying how

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.270 
were saying how
actually<00:02:13.720> think<00:02:13.960> that<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.500> tune<00:02:14.980> and

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
actually think that the the tune and

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.130 
actually think that the the tune and
tone<00:02:15.610> might<00:02:15.850> change<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.270> bit<00:02:16.450> with<00:02:16.570> Yellin<00:02:16.930> come

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
tone might change a bit with Yellin come

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.960 
tone might change a bit with Yellin come
in<00:02:17.290> coming<00:02:17.740> in<00:02:17.860> can<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.010> explain<00:02:18.310> well

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
in coming in can you explain well

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.720 
in coming in can you explain well
because<00:02:19.330> Bernanke<00:02:20.070> had<00:02:21.070> all<00:02:21.340> these<00:02:21.490> different

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
because Bernanke had all these different

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.000 
because Bernanke had all these different
programs<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:22.480> ended<00:02:23.020> up<00:02:23.140> with<00:02:23.410> an<00:02:23.500> employment

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
programs and ended up with an employment

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.370 
programs and ended up with an employment
target<00:02:24.370> now<00:02:24.820> Janet<00:02:25.270> Yellen<00:02:25.600> starts<00:02:26.110> with<00:02:26.290> an

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
target now Janet Yellen starts with an

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.020 
target now Janet Yellen starts with an
unemployment<00:02:26.740> target<00:02:27.250> and<00:02:27.430> she<00:02:27.700> had<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.820> very

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
unemployment target and she had a very

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.190 
unemployment target and she had a very
different<00:02:28.180> mindset<00:02:28.600> one<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.900> things<00:02:29.080> she

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
different mindset one of the things she

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.230 
different mindset one of the things she
says<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.620> we<00:02:29.770> go<00:02:30.100> back<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.580> normal<00:02:30.910> Fed

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
says is we go back to a normal Fed

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.880 
says is we go back to a normal Fed
policy<00:02:31.420> once<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.110> economy<00:02:32.560> is<00:02:32.620> back<00:02:32.770> to

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
policy once the economy is back to

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.470 
policy once the economy is back to
normal<00:02:33.190> well<00:02:33.460> that's<00:02:33.640> impossible<00:02:33.820> because

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
normal well that's impossible because

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.200 
normal well that's impossible because
you<00:02:34.990> cannot<00:02:35.350> price<00:02:35.680> risk<00:02:36.040> properly<00:02:36.700> if<00:02:36.850> you

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
you cannot price risk properly if you

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.820 
you cannot price risk properly if you
flood<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.480> market<00:02:37.690> with<00:02:37.840> liquidity<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:38.680> we'll

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
flood the market with liquidity so we'll

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.560 
flood the market with liquidity so we'll
continue<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.400> be<00:02:39.490> in<00:02:39.550> this<00:02:39.610> environment<00:02:39.850> Janet

continue to be in this environment Janet

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.300 
continue to be in this environment Janet
Yellen<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:40.960> going<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.200> be<00:02:41.290> very<00:02:41.440> willing<00:02:41.770> to

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
Yellen is going to be very willing to

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.160 
Yellen is going to be very willing to
try<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:42.640> fix<00:02:42.940> fiscal<00:02:43.450> problems<00:02:43.750> with<00:02:43.840> monetary

try to fix fiscal problems with monetary

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.110 
try to fix fiscal problems with monetary
policy<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.130> neon<00:02:45.400> cesare<00:02:45.730> changed

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120
