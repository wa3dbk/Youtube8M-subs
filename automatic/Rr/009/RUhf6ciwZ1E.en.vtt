be for your pet dog at home sort of

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.260 
be for your pet dog at home sort of
thing<00:01:24.369> with<00:01:25.369> red<00:01:25.550> bulls<00:01:25.790> what<00:01:26.060> you<00:01:26.150> really

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
thing with red bulls what you really

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.760 
thing with red bulls what you really
want<00:01:26.509> to<00:01:26.570> have<00:01:26.720> as<00:01:26.900> little<00:01:27.050> hands-on<00:01:27.560> as

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.490 
want to have as little hands-on as
possible<00:01:28.369> so<00:01:28.970> it's<00:01:29.780> not<00:01:29.930> one<00:01:30.110> of<00:01:30.140> those<00:01:30.290> things

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
possible so it's not one of those things

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.380 
possible so it's not one of those things
where<00:01:30.740> it's<00:01:30.979> easy<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.729> get<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:31.880> hold<00:01:31.970> of<00:01:32.210> for

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
where it's easy to get a hold of for

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.300 
where it's easy to get a hold of for
every<00:01:32.600> day<00:01:32.780> take<00:01:33.259> a<00:01:33.290> good<00:01:33.530> look<00:01:33.590> at<00:01:33.979> it<00:01:34.009> and

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
every day take a good look at it and

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.460 
every day take a good look at it and
that<00:01:34.460> sort<00:01:34.729> of<00:01:34.759> thing<00:01:34.869> it's<00:01:35.869> basically<00:01:36.229> up<00:01:36.350> to

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
that sort of thing it's basically up to

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.529 
that sort of thing it's basically up to
the<00:01:36.680> keepers<00:01:37.070> to<00:01:37.430> really<00:01:37.970> monitor<00:01:38.119> her

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
the keepers to really monitor her

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.420 
the keepers to really monitor her
closely<00:01:38.690> from<00:01:39.170> a<00:01:39.289> distance<00:01:39.740> as<00:01:39.950> well<00:01:40.130> as<00:01:40.280> we

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
closely from a distance as well as we

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.850 
closely from a distance as well as we
can<00:01:40.700> through<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.509> exhibit

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860
