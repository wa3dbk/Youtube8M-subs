hello<00:00:02.460> everybody<00:00:03.000> this<00:00:03.270> is<00:00:03.830> video<00:00:04.830> of<00:00:05.450> SSO

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
hello everybody this is video of SSO

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:17.359 
hello everybody this is video of SSO
cell<00:00:08.580> testing<00:00:09.740> using<00:00:11.750> simple<00:00:12.920> PWM<00:00:16.369> suggested

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
cell testing using simple PWM suggested

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.240 
cell testing using simple PWM suggested
by<00:00:17.580> making<00:00:18.060> hydrogen<00:00:20.689> the<00:00:21.689> ethical<00:00:22.199> cell<00:00:22.470> I'm

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
by making hydrogen the ethical cell I'm

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:33.620 
by making hydrogen the ethical cell I'm
using<00:00:25.010> standstill<00:00:26.119> 316l<00:00:31.040> 6x6<00:00:32.040> inch<00:00:32.630> positive

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
using standstill 316l 6x6 inch positive

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.650 
using standstill 316l 6x6 inch positive
and<00:00:33.870> negative<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:35.399> water<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.969> only<00:00:36.239> tap

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
and negative and the water is only tap

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:45.580 
and negative and the water is only tap
water<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.930> PWM<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:41.780> using<00:00:42.780> 555<00:00:43.530> timer<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.309> 5

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
water the PWM is using 555 timer and 5

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:58.330 
water the PWM is using 555 timer and 5
ir<00:00:46.590> f<00:00:47.070> 5m<00:00:47.700> MOSFET

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.479 

the<00:00:59.340> power<00:00:59.579> supply<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:01.760> am<00:01:02.760> neither<00:01:04.250> okay

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the power supply and am neither okay

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:22.430 
the power supply and am neither okay
now<00:01:06.240> let's<00:01:06.570> turn<00:01:06.810> on

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:31.170 

look<00:01:23.850> now<00:01:24.850> it's<00:01:25.180> producing<00:01:25.840> bubbles<00:01:29.910> as<00:01:30.910> I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
look now it's producing bubbles as I

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.980 
look now it's producing bubbles as I
turn<00:01:31.620> the<00:01:32.620> potentiometer<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.720> gas

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
turn the potentiometer the gas

00:01:34.990 --> 00:02:10.469 
turn the potentiometer the gas
production<00:01:35.350> is<00:01:35.830> more

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:29.000 

it<00:02:10.990> draws<00:02:11.550> only<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:15.790> em<00:02:17.310> yeah<00:02:18.310> it's<00:02:18.700> about<00:02:18.940> 2m

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:41.250 

it's<00:02:30.010> not<00:02:30.220> hot

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.410 

maybe<00:02:42.010> in<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.400> next<00:02:42.510> testing<00:02:44.760> I'm<00:02:45.760> going<00:02:46.269> to

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
maybe in the next testing I'm going to

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:55.530 
maybe in the next testing I'm going to
check<00:02:46.659> the<00:02:46.870> gas<00:02:47.080> protection<00:02:53.849> okay<00:02:54.849> thank<00:02:55.450> you

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
check the gas protection okay thank you

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.560 
check the gas protection okay thank you
for<00:02:55.930> watching
