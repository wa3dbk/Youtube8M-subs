guide and then they basically get a free
look<00:01:49.950> at<00:01:50.070> Al<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.430> then<00:01:50.970> they<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.299> potentially

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
look at Al and then they can potentially

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.539 
look at Al and then they can potentially
use<00:01:51.840> their<00:01:52.290> fetch<00:01:52.500> fetch<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.950> away<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.430> then

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
use their fetch fetch it away and then

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.060 
use their fetch fetch it away and then

three<00:02:20.860> here<00:02:21.220> yeah<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:22.060> mean<00:02:22.450> basically<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:24.250> the

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
three here yeah I mean basically the the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.790 
three here yeah I mean basically the the
idle<00:02:24.970> on<00:02:25.120> against<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.600> lot<00:02:25.780> of<00:02:25.930> matchups<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.620> do

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
idle on against a lot of matchups you do

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.110 
idle on against a lot of matchups you do
want<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.040> play<00:02:27.160> it<00:02:27.310> on<00:02:27.370> turn<00:02:27.580> two<00:02:27.760> but<00:02:27.790> then

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
want to play it on turn two but then

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.120 
want to play it on turn two but then
there's<00:02:28.330> some<00:02:28.510> matchups<00:02:28.930> like<00:02:29.110> say<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.950> burr

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
there's some matchups like say the burr

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.950 
there's some matchups like say the burr
mirror<00:02:30.490> where<00:02:30.730> maybe<00:02:31.090> you'd<00:02:31.240> rather<00:02:31.420> try<00:02:31.930> to

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
mirror where maybe you'd rather try to

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.540 
mirror where maybe you'd rather try to
get<00:02:32.200> rid<00:02:32.380> of<00:02:32.410> their<00:02:32.620> creatures<00:02:32.980> first<00:02:33.190> and

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
get rid of their creatures first and

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.280 
get rid of their creatures first and
then<00:02:33.940> play<00:02:34.090> your<00:02:34.240> idol<00:02:34.390> on<00:02:34.630> later<00:02:34.870> in<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.170> game

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
then play your idol on later in the game

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.360 
then play your idol on later in the game
because<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.650> don't<00:02:35.800> want<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:35.980> do<00:02:36.100> your<00:02:36.250> so

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
because you don't want to do your so

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.580 
because you don't want to do your so
much<00:02:36.670> damage<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.300> yourself<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.290> can<00:02:38.440> be<00:02:38.560> a

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
much damage to yourself so it can be a

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.080 
much damage to yourself so it can be a
turn<00:02:38.800> to<00:02:38.980> play<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.310> costs<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.610> be<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.760> three<00:02:39.970> or

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
turn to play it costs to be a three or

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.520 
turn to play it costs to be a three or
four<00:02:40.410> play<00:02:41.410> searing<00:02:42.280> blaze<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:44.080> basically

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
four play searing blaze it basically

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.260 
four play searing blaze it basically
just<00:02:44.650> depends<00:02:45.220> how<00:02:45.250> early<00:02:45.760> your<00:02:45.910> opponents

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
just depends how early your opponents

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.880 
just depends how early your opponents

have creatures again some decks like say

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.470 
have creatures again some decks like say
you're<00:02:48.010> playing<00:02:48.190> against<00:02:48.460> win<00:02:48.670> against<00:02:49.180> Ron

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
you're playing against win against Ron

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.630 
you're playing against win against Ron
they're<00:02:50.200> not<00:02:50.350> going<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.530> have<00:02:50.740> that<00:02:50.950> warm<00:02:51.190> they

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
they're not going to have that warm they

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.550 
they're not going to have that warm they
may<00:02:51.790> play<00:02:51.970> their<00:02:52.360> worm<00:02:52.510> Cora<00:02:52.780> engine<00:02:53.290> on<00:02:53.410> turn

may play their worm Cora engine on turn
four<00:02:53.860> and<00:02:54.070> then<00:02:54.760> all<00:02:54.940> of<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.120> sudden<00:02:55.390> you're

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
four and then all of a sudden you're

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.970 
four and then all of a sudden you're
searing<00:02:55.870> blazing<00:02:56.230> them<00:02:56.350> out<00:02:56.470> then<00:02:56.680> because

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
searing blazing them out then because

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.640 
searing blazing them out then because
they<00:02:57.070> don't<00:02:57.220> have<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.370> creature<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.840> lightning

they don't have a creature and lightning

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.890 
they don't have a creature and lightning
bolt<00:02:59.890> you<00:03:00.400> know<00:03:00.490> it<00:03:00.820> just<00:03:01.209> basically<00:03:01.420> comes

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
bolt you know it just basically comes

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.600 
bolt you know it just basically comes
after<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.380> creatures<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.890> bird<00:03:03.040> spells<00:03:03.340> come

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
after the creatures the bird spells come

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.800 
after the creatures the bird spells come
after<00:03:03.820> they're<00:03:03.940> just<00:03:04.060> one<00:03:04.180> of<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:04.330> best<00:03:04.480> cards

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
after they're just one of the best cards

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.449 
after they're just one of the best cards
in<00:03:04.990> the<00:03:05.140> history<00:03:05.440> of<00:03:05.470> magic<00:03:05.650> yeah<00:03:06.160> basically

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
in the history of magic yeah basically

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.130 
in the history of magic yeah basically
and<00:03:06.940> I<00:03:07.000> think<00:03:07.360> I<00:03:07.450> don't<00:03:07.600> want<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.840> grave<00:03:07.990> I

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
and I think I don't want to the grave I

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.060 
and I think I don't want to the grave I
was<00:03:08.230> probably<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.500> card<00:03:08.650> if<00:03:08.709> people<00:03:08.950> haven't

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
was probably a card if people haven't

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.100 
was probably a card if people haven't
played<00:03:09.400> with<00:03:09.550> it<00:03:09.730> or<00:03:10.060> haven't<00:03:10.390> played<00:03:10.570> modern

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
played with it or haven't played modern
