the<00:00:00.690> architects<00:00:01.469> scale<00:00:01.920> enables<00:00:02.730> you<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.000> draw

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
the architects scale enables you to draw

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.200 
the architects scale enables you to draw
big<00:00:03.959> things<00:00:04.410> small<00:00:04.950> while<00:00:05.430> keeping<00:00:05.970> them

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
big things small while keeping them

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.290 
big things small while keeping them
proportionately<00:00:07.170> accurate<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.250> has<00:00:08.610> six

proportionately accurate it has six
sides<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.260> five<00:00:10.710> of<00:00:11.010> them<00:00:11.309> have<00:00:11.700> two<00:00:12.179> scales

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
sides and five of them have two scales

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.349 
sides and five of them have two scales
each<00:00:13.320> on<00:00:14.040> them<00:00:15.049> one<00:00:16.049> scale<00:00:16.680> runs<00:00:17.250> from<00:00:17.789> left<00:00:18.180> to

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
each on them one scale runs from left to

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.320 
each on them one scale runs from left to
right<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.619> other<00:00:19.830> scale<00:00:20.369> runs<00:00:20.789> from

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
right and the other scale runs from

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.130 
right and the other scale runs from
right<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.660> left<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.619> one<00:00:23.340> scale<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.210> twice<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
right to left and one scale is twice the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.580 
right to left and one scale is twice the
size<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.279> other<00:00:26.720> let's<00:00:27.720> look<00:00:28.109> at<00:00:28.349> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
size of the other let's look at the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.269 
size of the other let's look at the
quarter<00:00:29.130> inch<00:00:29.429> scale<00:00:30.029> it's<00:00:30.510> written<00:00:31.500> like

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
quarter inch scale it's written like

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:41.990 
quarter inch scale it's written like
this<00:00:38.780> one<00:00:39.780> quarter<00:00:40.290> inch<00:00:40.530> equals<00:00:41.219> one<00:00:41.579> foot

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
this one quarter inch equals one foot

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.310 
this one quarter inch equals one foot
and<00:00:42.270> what<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.110> means<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.600> every<00:00:45.600> quarter

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
and what it means is that every quarter

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.049 
and what it means is that every quarter
inch<00:00:46.730> increment<00:00:48.890> represents<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.250> real-life

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
inch increment represents one real-life

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.389 
inch increment represents one real-life
foot<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.590> draw<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.550> line<00:00:54.079> that<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.469> five<00:00:55.949> feet

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
foot so to draw a line that is five feet

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.510 
foot so to draw a line that is five feet
long<00:00:56.760> at<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.570> quarter<00:00:58.050> inch<00:00:58.289> scale<00:00:58.739> you'd

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
long at the quarter inch scale you'd

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.900 
long at the quarter inch scale you'd
start<00:01:00.030> at<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.359> zero<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.199> count<00:01:01.980> one<00:01:02.399> two

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
start at the zero and count one two

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.200 
start at the zero and count one two
three<00:01:03.949> four<00:01:04.949> five<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.330> there<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> line<00:01:08.210> five

three four five and there is a line five
feet<00:01:09.720> long<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.400> way<00:01:11.610> you'd<00:01:12.240> write<00:01:12.600> that

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
feet long and the way you'd write that

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.240 
feet long and the way you'd write that
in<00:01:13.290> proper<00:01:14.000> architectural<00:01:15.000> format<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:16.250> five

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
in proper architectural format is five

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.899 
in proper architectural format is five
foot<00:01:17.759> -<00:01:18.680> zero<00:01:19.680> inches<00:01:21.439> now<00:01:22.439> looking<00:01:23.040> over<00:01:23.220> here

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
foot - zero inches now looking over here

foot - zero inches now looking over here
at<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:25.710> eighth<00:01:26.640> inch<00:01:27.180> scale<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:28.829> see

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
at the eighth inch scale you can see

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.039 
at the eighth inch scale you can see
it's<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.759> lot<00:01:29.970> smaller<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> five<00:01:32.220> foot<00:01:32.640> line

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
it's a lot smaller so a five foot line

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.270 
it's a lot smaller so a five foot line
starting<00:01:34.049> at<00:01:34.200> zero<00:01:34.880> would<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:36.150> one<00:01:36.600> two<00:01:37.140> three

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
starting at zero would go one two three

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.560 
starting at zero would go one two three
four<00:01:38.280> five<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.329> would<00:01:39.659> be<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.619> long<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:42.270> have

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
four five it would be that long you have

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.160 
four five it would be that long you have
all<00:01:42.869> these<00:01:43.170> different<00:01:44.070> scales<00:01:44.579> because<00:01:45.570> not

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
all these different scales because not

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.870 
all these different scales because not
all<00:01:46.470> items<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.640> be<00:01:47.880> drawn<00:01:48.210> at<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.960> same<00:01:49.259> scale

we'll draw it two feet long so we start

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.640 
we'll draw it two feet long so we start
here<00:02:37.760> want<00:02:38.760> at<00:02:39.210> zero<00:02:39.780> one<00:02:41.300> two<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.630> there's<00:02:43.470> a

line two feet long now what if we wanted

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.530 
line two feet long now what if we wanted
to<00:02:47.340> draw<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:48.060> six<00:02:48.690> inches<00:02:49.400> long<00:02:50.400> two<00:02:50.910> feet<00:02:51.180> six

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
well that is what the subdivided scale

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.110 
well that is what the subdivided scale
is<00:02:59.190> for<00:02:59.780> every<00:03:00.780> scale<00:03:01.320> has<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:01.950> bunch<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.610> marks

from<00:03:41.430> zero<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:42.300> six<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.710> it<00:03:44.670> would<00:03:44.880> be<00:03:45.090> written

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
from zero to six and it would be written

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:54.800 
from zero to six and it would be written
like<00:03:46.320> this<00:03:48.620> two<00:03:49.620> foot<00:03:50.220> -<00:03:51.080> six<00:03:52.080> inches<00:03:53.810> you

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
like this two foot - six inches you

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.290 
like this two foot - six inches you
wouldn't<00:03:55.170> write<00:03:55.470> two<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.100> a<00:03:56.190> half<00:03:56.460> feet<00:03:56.880> like

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
wouldn't write two and a half feet like

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.260 
wouldn't write two and a half feet like
this<00:03:59.450> because<00:04:00.450> that's<00:04:00.780> unclear<00:04:01.970> that<00:04:02.970> could

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
this because that's unclear that could

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:11.690 
this because that's unclear that could
be<00:04:03.450> interpreted<00:04:03.960> as<00:04:05.600> this<00:04:09.740> two<00:04:10.740> foot<00:04:11.070> half<00:04:11.430> an

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
be interpreted as this two foot half an

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.730 
be interpreted as this two foot half an
inch<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.210> that's<00:04:12.330> the<00:04:12.600> proper<00:04:12.900> way<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.260> write

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
inch and that's the proper way to write

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.940 
inch and that's the proper way to write
that<00:04:14.130> you<00:04:14.430> also<00:04:15.300> wouldn't<00:04:15.900> write<00:04:16.260> two<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:16.859> a

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
that you also wouldn't write two and a

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.420 
that you also wouldn't write two and a
half<00:04:17.220> feet<00:04:17.640> like<00:04:18.060> this<00:04:19.010> because<00:04:20.010> you<00:04:20.190> don't

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
half feet like this because you don't

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.470 
half feet like this because you don't

start at the zero one two three and if
we<00:05:02.280> wanted<00:05:02.670> to<00:05:02.730> add<00:05:03.060> nine<00:05:03.690> inches<00:05:04.320> to<00:05:04.620> that

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
we wanted to add nine inches to that

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.960 
we wanted to add nine inches to that
we've<00:05:05.400> come<00:05:05.790> here<00:05:06.210> to<00:05:06.540> the<00:05:06.570> zero<00:05:07.160> three<00:05:08.160> six

we've come here to the zero three six
nine<00:05:09.890> and<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:12.030> way<00:05:12.210> that<00:05:12.630> would<00:05:12.990> be<00:05:13.020> written

nine and the way that would be written

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:22.640 
nine and the way that would be written
would<00:05:14.490> be<00:05:15.680> three<00:05:16.680> feet<00:05:17.220> -<00:05:18.380> nine<00:05:19.490> inches<00:05:21.650> now

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
would be three feet - nine inches now

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.650 
would be three feet - nine inches now
let's<00:05:22.980> take<00:05:23.280> a<00:05:23.310> look<00:05:23.700> at<00:05:24.210> the<00:05:24.720> true<00:05:25.020> scale<00:05:26.660> the

let's take a look at the true scale the

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.740 
let's take a look at the true scale the
true<00:05:27.990> scale<00:05:28.580> you<00:05:29.580> know<00:05:29.700> what<00:05:29.850> let<00:05:30.030> me<00:05:30.060> get<00:05:30.480> rid

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
true scale you know what let me get rid

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.530 
true scale you know what let me get rid
of<00:05:30.780> some<00:05:31.530> of<00:05:31.560> these<00:05:31.950> first<00:05:32.730> get<00:05:33.180> them<00:05:33.330> out<00:05:33.420> of

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
of some of these first get them out of

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.700 
of some of these first get them out of
the<00:05:33.630> way<00:05:34.340> the<00:05:35.340> true<00:05:35.640> scale<00:05:36.150> is<00:05:36.570> what<00:05:37.110> we<00:05:37.350> call

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
the way the true scale is what we call

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.430 
the way the true scale is what we call
the<00:05:38.160> ruler<00:05:38.730> that<00:05:39.030> is<00:05:39.750> it<00:05:40.140> is<00:05:41.000> the<00:05:42.050> one<00:05:43.050> inch

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
the ruler that is it is the one inch

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.110 
the ruler that is it is the one inch
equals<00:05:43.950> one<00:05:44.850> inch<00:05:45.240> scale<00:05:46.430> each<00:05:47.430> of<00:05:47.820> these

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
equals one inch scale each of these

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.650 
equals one inch scale each of these
increments<00:05:49.280> represents<00:05:50.280> an<00:05:50.430> inch<00:05:50.670> and<00:05:51.000> is<00:05:51.450> an

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
increments represents an inch and is an

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
increments represents an inch and is an
inch<00:05:51.870> it<00:05:52.200> says<00:05:52.950> 16<00:05:53.730> because<00:05:54.420> each<00:05:54.660> inch<00:05:54.990> has

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
inch it says 16 because each inch has

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.630 
inch it says 16 because each inch has
been<00:05:56.040> divided<00:05:56.490> into<00:05:57.060> 16<00:05:57.630> pieces<00:05:57.950> so<00:05:58.950> this<00:05:59.190> is<00:05:59.400> 1

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
been divided into 16 pieces so this is 1

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:08.360 
been divided into 16 pieces so this is 1
16<00:06:00.300> to<00:06:00.960> 16<00:06:01.590> or<00:06:01.950> 1/8<00:06:03.050> 3/16<00:06:04.050> for<00:06:04.680> 16<00:06:05.370> or<00:06:05.900> 1/2<00:06:06.980> so<00:06:07.980> if

16 to 16 or 1/8 3/16 for 16 or 1/2 so if
you<00:06:08.700> wanted<00:06:09.150> to<00:06:09.210> draw<00:06:09.690> a<00:06:10.020> line<00:06:10.410> that<00:06:10.890> was<00:06:11.550> 3/4

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
you wanted to draw a line that was 3/4

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.940 
you wanted to draw a line that was 3/4
of<00:06:12.540> an<00:06:12.900> inch<00:06:13.050> long

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
of an inch long

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:22.600 
of an inch long
you'd<00:06:14.310> start<00:06:14.730> here<00:06:15.390> and<00:06:16.850> end<00:06:19.520> right<00:06:20.520> about
