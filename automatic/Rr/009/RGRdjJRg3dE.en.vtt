because<00:02:10.720> I've<00:02:10.899> been<00:02:11.080> waiting<00:02:11.440> for<00:02:11.470> this<00:02:11.850> I<00:02:13.050> did

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
because I've been waiting for this I did

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.110 
because I've been waiting for this I did
try<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.350> beta<00:02:14.680> version<00:02:14.860> i<00:02:15.340> think<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:15.700> was<00:02:15.850> and

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.150 
try the beta version i think it was and
I<00:02:16.510> now<00:02:16.720> I'm<00:02:16.870> another<00:02:17.320> hour<00:02:17.560> thinking<00:02:17.800> about<00:02:18.130> I

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
I now I'm another hour thinking about I

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.760 
I now I'm another hour thinking about I
think<00:02:18.640> this<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:18.820> actually<00:02:19.270> a<00:02:19.690> version<00:02:20.470> for<00:02:20.500> a

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
think this is actually a version for a

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.620 
think this is actually a version for a
develop<00:02:21.220> of<00:02:21.400> down<00:02:22.060> at<00:02:22.270> XDA<00:02:22.660> over<00:02:23.530> at<00:02:23.650> XDA<00:02:24.630> so

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.720 
and I won't go into that don't want to
say<00:06:11.610> something<00:06:11.670> I<00:06:12.090> you<00:06:12.930> know<00:06:13.050> you<00:06:13.800> know<00:06:13.980> so

everything is working I'm guessing

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.630 
everything is working I'm guessing
because<00:06:20.070> this<00:06:20.400> is<00:06:20.550> not<00:06:20.760> the<00:06:21.300> official<00:06:22.640> the

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
because this is not the official the

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:30.350 
because this is not the official the
official<00:06:24.560> would<00:06:25.560> equal<00:06:25.860> official<00:06:29.360> samsung

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
official would equal official samsung

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.960 
official would equal official samsung

example on the Nexus virginal
gingerbread<00:06:40.020> when<00:06:40.200> you<00:06:40.320> when<00:06:40.830> you<00:06:40.860> pull<00:06:41.580> down

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
gingerbread when you when you pull down

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.770 
gingerbread when you when you pull down
on<00:06:42.120> the<00:06:42.180> on<00:06:42.990> the<00:06:43.350> menu<00:06:43.980> or<00:06:44.220> in<00:06:44.820> settings<00:06:45.360> there

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
is like a shiny green color I think and

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.940 
is like a shiny green color I think and
it<00:06:48.480> doesn't<00:06:48.750> let<00:06:48.870> you<00:06:48.960> put<00:06:49.140> it<00:06:49.230> down<00:06:49.410> this<00:06:49.620> much

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:49.950 
it doesn't let you put it down this much

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.390 
it doesn't let you put it down this much
obviously<00:06:50.850> at<00:06:51.000> the<00:06:51.090> bottom<00:06:51.420> it's<00:06:51.630> the<00:06:51.780> same<00:06:52.400> so

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 
obviously at the bottom it's the same so

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.270 
obviously at the bottom it's the same so
everything<00:06:53.970> is<00:06:54.210> definitely<00:06:54.750> working<00:06:55.190> let<00:06:56.190> me

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280
