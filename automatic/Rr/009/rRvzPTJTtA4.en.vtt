00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
farm the farm produces wheat which I

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.599 
farm the farm produces wheat which I
need<00:02:29.840> for<00:02:30.109> the<00:02:30.170> production<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.680> food<00:02:30.890> the

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
need for the production of food the

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.099 
need for the production of food the
first<00:02:31.880> woodcutters<00:02:32.540> hut<00:02:32.720> has<00:02:32.959> been

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
first woodcutters hut has been

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.770 
first woodcutters hut has been
constructed<00:02:33.739> what<00:02:34.519> I<00:02:34.549> can<00:02:34.760> do<00:02:34.910> now<00:02:35.120> is<00:02:35.150> send

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
constructed what I can do now is send

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.170 
constructed what I can do now is send
several<00:02:36.170> workers<00:02:36.560> in<00:02:36.859> there<00:02:37.220> just<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.910> be<00:02:38.030> more

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
several workers in there just to be more

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.720 
several workers in there just to be more
productive<00:02:38.359> and<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:39.319> produce<00:02:39.500> more<00:02:39.920> faster

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.000 

what<00:02:43.730> I'm<00:02:43.850> building<00:02:44.180> now<00:02:44.329> is<00:02:44.600> an<00:02:44.870> or<00:02:45.109> quarry<00:02:45.709> I

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
what I'm building now is an or quarry I

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.949 
what I'm building now is an or quarry I
just<00:02:46.519> happen<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:46.910> know<00:02:47.239> that<00:02:47.269> there's<00:02:47.660> iron

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
just happen to know that there's iron

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.930 
just happen to know that there's iron
ore<00:02:48.200> down<00:02:48.440> there<00:02:48.709> so<00:02:49.069> I'll<00:02:49.190> position<00:02:49.639> an<00:02:49.730> or

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
ore down there so I'll position an or

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.690 
ore down there so I'll position an or
quarry<00:02:50.269> around<00:02:50.810> there<00:02:51.049> and<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.890> final<00:02:52.280> basic

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
quarry around there and the final basic

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.190 
quarry around there and the final basic
building<00:02:52.909> is<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.540> stone<00:02:53.780> quarry

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
building is the stone quarry

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.930 
building is the stone quarry
I'll<00:02:56.200> place<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.830> down<00:02:57.069> here<00:02:57.459> where<00:02:57.790> I<00:02:57.819> can

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
I'll place that down here where I can

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.820 
I'll place that down here where I can
quarry<00:02:58.420> stone<00:03:00.330> so<00:03:01.330> now<00:03:01.659> I<00:03:01.690> see<00:03:02.170> I<00:03:02.200> only<00:03:02.379> have

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
quarry stone so now I see I only have

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.009 
quarry stone so now I see I only have
two<00:03:03.099> workers<00:03:03.400> left<00:03:03.819> available<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.540> me<00:03:04.690> to

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
two workers left available to me to

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.330 
two workers left available to me to
generate<00:03:05.500> new<00:03:05.709> ones<00:03:05.950> I<00:03:06.220> need<00:03:06.610> to<00:03:06.760> build<00:03:06.970> houses

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
generate new ones I need to build houses

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.750 
generate new ones I need to build houses
so<00:03:09.340> I'll<00:03:09.580> place<00:03:09.849> a<00:03:09.879> house<00:03:10.180> here<00:03:10.629> and<00:03:11.760> once

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
so I'll place a house here and once

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.670 
so I'll place a house here and once
again<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.360> worker<00:03:13.569> goes<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.230> town<00:03:14.440> hall

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
again the worker goes to the town hall

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.520 
again the worker goes to the town hall
picks<00:03:15.370> up<00:03:15.549> resources<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.330> then<00:03:16.870> runs<00:03:17.140> over<00:03:17.500> to

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
picks up resources and then runs over to

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.589 
picks up resources and then runs over to
construct<00:03:18.099> the<00:03:18.220> building<00:03:18.370> so<00:03:19.000> now<00:03:19.209> I'm

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
construct the building so now I'm

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.780 
construct the building so now I'm
effectively<00:03:20.200> producing<00:03:20.709> all<00:03:20.860> four<00:03:21.340> basic

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
effectively producing all four basic

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.780 
effectively producing all four basic
goods<00:03:22.030> as<00:03:23.019> an<00:03:23.410> additional<00:03:23.860> building<00:03:24.280> I<00:03:24.400> can

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
goods as an additional building I can

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.210 
goods as an additional building I can
also<00:03:24.940> build<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.599> market<00:03:25.959> at<00:03:26.379> the<00:03:26.709> market<00:03:27.069> I

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
also build the market at the market I

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.580 
also build the market at the market I
can<00:03:27.519> sell<00:03:27.760> goods<00:03:28.030> on<00:03:28.329> the<00:03:28.780> one<00:03:28.959> hand<00:03:29.140> to

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
can sell goods on the one hand to

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.770 
can sell goods on the one hand to
generate<00:03:30.010> gold<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.910> additional<00:03:31.390> resource

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780

require something at short notice that I

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.089 
require something at short notice that I
can't<00:03:40.390> or<00:03:40.629> don't<00:03:40.989> want<00:03:41.109> to<00:03:41.379> produce<00:03:41.560> so

upgraded<00:04:03.849> in<00:04:04.329> three<00:04:04.750> stages<00:04:05.019> each<00:04:05.590> time

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
upgraded in three stages each time

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.339 
upgraded in three stages each time

unlocking new building options and
improved<00:04:08.799> buildings<00:04:09.359> so<00:04:10.359> now<00:04:10.510> I<00:04:10.540> can<00:04:10.690> see<00:04:11.049> that

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
improved buildings so now I can see that

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.170 
improved buildings so now I can see that
my<00:04:11.349> town<00:04:11.650> hall<00:04:11.950> has<00:04:12.160> been<00:04:12.340> upgraded<00:04:12.790> its

are<00:04:15.459> new<00:04:15.609> building<00:04:16.030> options<00:04:16.419> available<00:04:16.720> to<00:04:16.959> me

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
are new building options available to me

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.270 
are new building options available to me
this<00:04:19.299> now<00:04:19.599> also<00:04:19.870> allows<00:04:20.320> me<00:04:20.530> to<00:04:20.650> upgrade<00:04:20.859> the
