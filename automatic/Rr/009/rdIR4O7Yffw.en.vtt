 What a picture of seven judges football painted picture everyday 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.219
 Objects would like to pass through on these paintings 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:19.599
 Magnifying glass looks at every little detail becomes visible dapd 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:28.679
 banal things from the life of the Berlin artist often serve as models 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.660
 It takes Willi Wirtz around one month for each of his large format 

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:36.070
 Pictures 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.850
 already put above all the leadership young-reyer 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.160
 No, therefore, where the object ceased to be the stall but rather 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.230
 will be the location 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.320
 and I am challenged as a viewer 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.120
 Percent went in the head to connect

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.100
 of all the process of painting, of course, it works best in alone 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.430
 his Berlin studio gives him the peace he needs to be creative 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.770
 the numbers for themselves 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.200
 this means 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.180
 when I go to work 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.170
 then I have, so to speak, free 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.170
 that's the way they work b 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.690

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.260
 Behrami will be topics 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.850
 Reality and perception 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.930
 through the magnified representation and the picture of a toilet paper 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.930
 Scooter to the art object 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.440

 the head lid here the original made René Würz 2005 meanwhile 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.319
 his works are traded up to 32 thousand euros 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:14.240
 if she knows here in the morning you can see so much in his pictures 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.220
 you can walk around them and you can see them from all sides and then 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.909

 The 43-year-old has many inspirations in many places 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:49.459
 he is fascinated by objects with traces of use that make up a story 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.329
 tell 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.700
 the finma some successes in series 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.700
 interesting objects 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.489
 when she moved 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:03.869
 formerly unemployed 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:06.799
 something surprisingly improved 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.219
 that is obviously ready 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:11.159

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.560
 Frame for his pictures he builds himself the size picture of spontaneously filed 

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:25.689

 make changes in three weeks, the trumpet image should be ready 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.109
 the last feel good 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.989

 my goal of myself 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.099
 and I have not counted it for very likely 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:54.129
 Also rare there may be some that may be hundreds 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.739
 René Wirtz will certainly also paint these reflections and thus the view 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.140
 back to everyday objects long ago
