that pentax sony and our ones aren't
making<00:01:00.480> really<00:01:01.320> good<00:01:01.739> cameras<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.609> i<00:01:02.879> would

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
making really good cameras and i would

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.230 
making really good cameras and i would
say<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.329> they<00:01:03.690> are<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.989> fact<00:01:04.019> sony<00:01:04.409> sensors

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
say that they are in fact sony sensors

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.899 
say that they are in fact sony sensors
are<00:01:06.240> usually<00:01:06.810> ones<00:01:07.229> which<00:01:07.439> are<00:01:07.560> used<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.400> lot

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
are usually ones which are used in a lot

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.760 
are usually ones which are used in a lot
of<00:01:08.970> Nikon<00:01:09.420> cameras<00:01:09.869> as<00:01:09.990> well<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.320> Nick<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.650> is

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
of Nikon cameras as well so Nick on is

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.250 
of Nikon cameras as well so Nick on is
using<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.700> same<00:01:12.030> sensor<00:01:12.510> technology<00:01:13.080> as

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
using the same sensor technology as

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.700 
using the same sensor technology as
Sonny<00:01:14.240> sometimes<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.689> think<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:16.170> Nick<00:01:16.500> on

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
Sonny sometimes we think that Nick on

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.100 
Sonny sometimes we think that Nick on
are<00:01:16.860> doing<00:01:17.040> their<00:01:17.220> own<00:01:17.250> little<00:01:18.240> tweaks<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
are doing their own little tweaks to the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.080 
are doing their own little tweaks to the
sensor<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.830> maybe<00:01:20.009> changing<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.790> way<00:01:20.880> that

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
sensor and maybe changing the way that

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.270 
sensor and maybe changing the way that
you<00:01:21.270> kind<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.630> get<00:01:22.439> information<00:01:23.070> off<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
you kind of get information off the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.219 
you kind of get information off the
sensor<00:01:23.880> which<00:01:24.030> makes<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.630> little<00:01:25.049> bit

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
sensor which makes it a little bit

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.039 
sensor which makes it a little bit
better<00:01:25.490> nobody<00:01:26.490> really<00:01:26.670> knows<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.540> companies

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
better nobody really knows the companies

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.590 
better nobody really knows the companies
don't<00:01:28.290> really<00:01:28.439> talk<00:01:28.619> about<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:29.040> but<00:01:29.600> there's

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
don't really talk about it but there's

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.899 
don't really talk about it but there's
have<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> couple<00:01:31.650> reasons<00:01:31.799> like<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.100> would<00:01:32.700> say

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
have a couple reasons like I would say

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.950 
have a couple reasons like I would say
is<00:01:33.090> if<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.810> was<00:01:34.340> Nikon<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.640> Canon<00:01:35.750> two<00:01:36.750> big

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
is if it was Nikon and Canon two big

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.950 
is if it was Nikon and Canon two big
boys<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:38.520> next<00:01:38.820> one<00:01:38.939> after<00:01:39.090> them<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.600> would

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
boys the next one after them I would

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.639 
boys the next one after them I would
definitely<00:01:40.110> see<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.770> sunny<00:01:41.549> now<00:01:42.060> sunnis

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
definitely see is sunny now sunnis

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.120 
definitely see is sunny now sunnis
cameras<00:01:43.649> are<00:01:43.799> badass<00:01:44.930> no<00:01:45.930> doubt<00:01:46.140> about<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.439> and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
cameras are badass no doubt about it and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.120 
cameras are badass no doubt about it and
a<00:01:47.520> lot<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.850> their<00:01:48.360> SLR<00:01:49.200> lenses<00:01:49.680> at<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> broader

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
a lot of their SLR lenses at the broader

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.149 
a lot of their SLR lenses at the broader
are<00:01:51.259> fantastic<00:01:52.259> there's<00:01:52.560> no<00:01:52.740> question<00:01:52.920> about

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
are fantastic there's no question about

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.219 
are fantastic there's no question about
that<00:01:53.250> as<00:01:53.490> well<00:01:53.579> there's<00:01:54.329> been<00:01:54.659> specifically

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
that as well there's been specifically

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.260 
that as well there's been specifically
made<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.860> most<00:01:56.070> modern<00:01:56.490> camera<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.149> it's

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
made for the most modern camera so it's

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.670 
made for the most modern camera so it's
not<00:01:57.360> something<00:01:57.810> coming<00:01:58.140> into<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.530> market

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
not something coming into the market

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
cameras and lenses and having to figure

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.709 
cameras and lenses and having to figure
out<00:02:04.409> what<00:02:04.770> do<00:02:04.860> we<00:02:04.920> do<00:02:05.100> here<00:02:05.700> pretty<00:02:06.240> much<00:02:06.329> come

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
cameras top or I can see there's no a

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.850 
cameras top or I can see there's no a
huge<00:04:02.150> option<00:04:02.480> in<00:04:02.540> their<00:04:02.660> lenses<00:04:03.019> and<00:04:03.290> their

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
huge option in their lenses and their

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.020 
huge option in their lenses and their
lenses<00:04:04.160> are<00:04:04.310> not<00:04:05.209> cheap<00:04:05.630> either<00:04:05.870> I'm<00:04:07.030> so

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
lenses are not cheap either I'm so

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.920 
lenses are not cheap either I'm so
there's<00:04:08.269> 24<00:04:09.230> to<00:04:09.410> 70<00:04:10.030> okay<00:04:11.030> so<00:04:11.090> Carl<00:04:11.450> Zeiss<00:04:11.660> lens

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
there's 24 to 70 okay so Carl Zeiss lens

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.520 
there's 24 to 70 okay so Carl Zeiss lens
1460<00:04:14.930> pounds<00:04:15.380> the<00:04:16.010> nikon<00:04:16.459> equivalent<00:04:17.180> is<00:04:17.530> 1250

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
1460 pounds the nikon equivalent is 1250

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.020 
1460 pounds the nikon equivalent is 1250
so<00:04:18.620> there's<00:04:18.739> about<00:04:18.859> 200<00:04:19.310> pound<00:04:19.489> gap

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
so there's about 200 pound gap

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.779 
so there's about 200 pound gap
difference<00:04:20.479> there<00:04:20.690> and<00:04:21.130> if<00:04:22.130> you're<00:04:22.610> wanting

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
difference there and if you're wanting

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.350 
difference there and if you're wanting
there's<00:04:23.360> 72<00:04:23.930> 300

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
there's 72 300

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.129
