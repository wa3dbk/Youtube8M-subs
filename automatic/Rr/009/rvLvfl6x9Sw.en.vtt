00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.060
 artist 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:15.929
 where you can sit at home 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.980
 this one had broken the spell 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.480
 that has been heard a few times 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.529
 we sell 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.079
 but that she has not resumed for a long time 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.079
 ergo twelve homes is the band 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.899
 has placed the ball at his new employer 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.270
 best 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.570
 it's about a 58 year old woman 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.700
 make use of existing models and why 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.220
 for example also ford at a railroad 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.570
 what do you find at 2 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.590
 and the ball disappeared the event for consultation 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.190
 the others in the first race of the World Cup 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.190
 the alcoholic book fair 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.070
 and studied drawing on the computer at level 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.350
 that means something like social attack 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.760
 but it is actually more than sufficient 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.180
 it is four times too long and with that it is, after all, an inch shorter 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.660
 the other solution 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.660
 45 minutes after rest in which she's mother 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.800
 I think so 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.800
 he uses a little hard to reach 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.850
 I have a little bit 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.330
 the eye on tomorrow 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
 the man on and CV can also be used as a heavy experience 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.120
 sony has these 20 moving boxes fit into it 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.780
 twenty standard hatch bell 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.540
 to fit and easy 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.910
 and then you also make room 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.380
 these actually run more space on this 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.490
 then on or there will be four years 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.890
 or I like him too if you don't 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.890
 only those are much more expensive 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.479
 it was 6 percent less 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:13.819
 we want next 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.439
 would yield there 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.509
 he was released i can't say yet 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:21.759
 He was linked to a win over the five-year period 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:24.649
 away with the first round he really tracks 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:26.139
 hillen gets out 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.549
 the accommodation from the front 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.549
 he picks up because 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:38.109
 larger major car products 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.109
 background works 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:51.800
 what strikes 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.669
 9 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:57.409
 the zwitser roger federer third in direct control but good on the skin 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.409
 be received 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.499
 it's about life 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:10.839
 violence against gays 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:13.839
 that is why it is very relieved to breathe 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.650
 The test is won by the German and CV 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.409
 looks a bit boring but neat 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.379
 just have it operated in your stomach to be desired 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.290
 this is how the buttons found each other on this expensive blackline version 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.609
 standard is way too low 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.399
 and to operate the radio 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:36.039
 you almost need baby fingers 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.429
 the handlebar is adjustable in height 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:40.499
 this time 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:43.500
 also supports place blacklight performed 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.959
 the 40,000 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.709
 190 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.709
 for utrecht friday during these two years ago 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.709
 on the lookout in 1955 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.849
 That is a very difficult remains 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.629
 blowing up dust 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.759
 messages about a possible departure to date 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.549
 we are waiting what really works this is the art site on the pole 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:12.510
 it is not coming 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.579
 how many familiar 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:19.209
 The best-selling existing home comes you would almost think the Dutch 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.120
 car is 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.120
 what you have there is very much value for money 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:28.529
 to answer the question at the beginning 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:31.089
 I am doing very well there 7 days a year
