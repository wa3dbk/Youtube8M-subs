00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.960
 It changes music for example color 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.310

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.650
 sony 14 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:40.469

 behind black silk although there then why 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.940
 ballet 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.219
 the system is very simple let's get it here 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.290
 china plates to get the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.450
 that a plate that will be the base of the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.060
 cd and a card in place the reader will 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.220
 staying up here does not matter much to 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.140
 distance only matters even if the laser 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.659
 play the cd right 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.000
 well I'll do it here with two more songs 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.259
 You can be doing it the way you do. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.380
 Whatever you want, how many songs do you 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.799
 I'm going to take a risk that in the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.590
 truth is going to be a plate a plate 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.570
 traffic here it circulates small goes 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.920
 serve as we want 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.630
 It's good that two traffic signs then 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:42.750
 Let's go from haiti to haiti 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.790
 simple already pick up a hands-on you can 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.740
 to mark a show well will show the laser 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.320
 we will mark that only the type of 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.100
 cholera in that one will show why he 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.680
 is taking 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.689
 Let's put a video here so the 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.659
 distance you can regulate 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.200
 you want to put 50 patients who are 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.899
 50 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.969
 so table with another city some 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.619
 clients then for each each disk takes 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.140
 to choose a color then put it on 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.690

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.560
 outlet 2 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:02.220
 after this despite of inconstant value 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.500

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.790
 values ​​will be the colors here that the 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.349

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.510
 put two discs will only weigh 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.400
 two values ​​if placed on four disks 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.470
 4 values ​​and so on a little to 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.629
 two values ​​then the first value goes 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.280
 be the red color is represented by the 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:24.989
 vector 285 00 is that rg and b 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.359
