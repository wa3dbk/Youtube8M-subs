00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:37.300 
headache if you notice I barely use them
in<00:01:34.250> my<00:01:34.369> videos<00:01:34.959> this<00:01:35.959> one<00:01:36.229> is<00:01:36.349> just<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:36.649> creamy

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
in my videos this one is just so creamy

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.059 
in my videos this one is just so creamy
it<00:01:37.610> glides<00:01:37.819> on<00:01:38.239> right<00:01:39.229> over<00:01:39.679> all<00:01:39.709> the

00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:40.069 
it glides on right over all the

imperfections<00:01:40.399> in<00:01:41.030> my<00:01:41.179> lip<00:01:41.420> line<00:01:41.660> because<00:01:42.500> I

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
imperfections in my lip line because I

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.949 
imperfections in my lip line because I
don't<00:01:42.770> really<00:01:43.009> have<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.459> super<00:01:43.940> defined<00:01:44.509> lip

00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:44.959 
don't really have a super defined lip

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:47.260 
don't really have a super defined lip
line<00:01:45.170> so<00:01:45.560> liners<00:01:45.950> were<00:01:46.190> always<00:01:46.550> hard<00:01:46.849> for<00:01:46.940> me

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
line so liners were always hard for me

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.690 
line so liners were always hard for me
but<00:01:47.810> this<00:01:47.959> one<00:01:48.170> is<00:01:48.349> really<00:01:48.709> great<00:01:48.979> for<00:01:49.399> shaping

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
but this one is really great for shaping

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.270 
but this one is really great for shaping
and<00:01:50.149> lining<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.750> lips<00:01:50.899> it's<00:01:51.229> just<00:01:51.500> easy<00:01:51.920> to

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
and lining the lips it's just easy to

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.880 
and lining the lips it's just easy to
use<00:01:52.459> so<00:01:53.390> I'm<00:01:53.479> not<00:01:53.660> doing<00:01:53.899> anything<00:01:54.140> really

special<00:01:55.399> as<00:01:55.550> far<00:01:55.759> as<00:01:55.970> shaping<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.569> lip<00:01:56.720> lines

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:56.959 
special as far as shaping the lip lines

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.520 
special as far as shaping the lip lines

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
I hate when lip glosses are really

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.480 
I hate when lip glosses are really
sticky<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.260> like<00:02:37.410> your<00:02:37.560> hair<00:02:37.800> gets<00:02:38.070> caught<00:02:38.310> in

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
sticky and like your hair gets caught in

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.220 
sticky and like your hair gets caught in
them<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:38.850> it's<00:02:38.940> just<00:02:39.030> all<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.390> mess

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
them and it's just all a mess

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.140 
them and it's just all a mess
what<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.770> really<00:02:41.070> love<00:02:41.280> about<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.670> lip<00:02:41.910> gloss

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
what I really love about this lip gloss

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.540 
what I really love about this lip gloss
is<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.570> it's<00:02:42.720> nice<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.320> satiny<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.190> smooth

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
is that it's nice and satiny and smooth

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.330 
is that it's nice and satiny and smooth
and<00:02:45.260> last<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:46.410> not<00:02:46.500> least<00:02:46.740> this<00:02:46.980> step<00:02:47.190> is

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
and last but not least this step is

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.160 
and last but not least this step is
really<00:02:47.580> optional<00:02:48.240> if<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.450> want<00:02:48.570> like<00:02:48.990> a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
really optional if you want like a
