00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
thought I'd just go through this kind of

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.910 
thought I'd just go through this kind of
technique<00:00:36.820> so<00:00:37.060> literally<00:00:37.570> just<00:00:37.750> applying<00:00:38.680> it

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
technique so literally just applying it

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.650 
technique so literally just applying it
to<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.160> vase<00:00:39.960> I'm<00:00:40.960> not<00:00:41.170> being<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:43.510> know

covering on and it's kind of covered
everything<00:02:12.000> but<00:02:12.620> let's<00:02:13.620> just<00:02:13.800> go<00:02:13.920> in<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.370> do<00:02:14.460> a

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
everything but let's just go in and do a

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.700 
everything but let's just go in and do a
bit<00:02:14.700> more<00:02:15.410> they<00:02:16.410> go<00:02:16.560> directly<00:02:16.950> under<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.400> eyes

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
bit more they go directly under the eyes

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.420 
bit more they go directly under the eyes
and<00:02:19.710> I<00:02:19.800> go<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> bit<00:02:20.070> more<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.520> nose<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:22.530> a

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
and I go a bit more in the nose and a

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.120 
and I go a bit more in the nose and a
bit<00:02:23.640> more<00:02:24.350> from<00:02:25.350> my<00:02:25.500> forehead<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.390> chin<00:02:27.390> and

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
bit more from my forehead and chin and

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.580 
bit more from my forehead and chin and
again<00:02:29.130> I've<00:02:29.400> hardly<00:02:29.820> used<00:02:30.090> any<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:30.600> make

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
again I've hardly used any of this make

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.760 
again I've hardly used any of this make
sure<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.400> sponge<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.240> damp<00:02:33.750> still<00:02:34.200> if

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
sure that the sponge is damp still if

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.800 
sure that the sponge is damp still if
not<00:02:35.100> reapply<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.620> rewedding<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:38.180> just<00:02:39.180> blend

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
not reapply it rewedding and just blend

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.870 
not reapply it rewedding and just blend
out<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.200> does<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.770> know<00:02:43.890> there<00:02:44.460> is<00:02:44.610> sort

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
out and it does you know there is sort

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.510 
out and it does you know there is sort
of<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:46.620> general<00:02:46.980> rule<00:02:47.160> when<00:02:47.400> you're

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
of a the general rule when you're

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.580 
of a the general rule when you're
playing<00:02:47.760> foundation<00:02:48.240> is<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.480> blend<00:02:48.690> down<00:02:48.960> but

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
playing foundation is to blend down but

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.650 
playing foundation is to blend down but
does<00:02:49.800> just<00:02:50.040> because<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.580> tiny<00:02:50.880> hairs<00:02:51.240> on

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
does just because of the tiny hairs on

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.750 
does just because of the tiny hairs on
the<00:02:52.140> face<00:02:52.380> they<00:02:52.890> tend<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.190> look<00:02:53.340> better<00:02:53.550> when

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
the face they tend to look better when

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.500 
the face they tend to look better when
they<00:02:53.850> sit<00:02:54.120> down<00:02:54.650> again<00:02:55.650> just<00:02:56.390> finishing<00:02:57.390> this

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
they sit down again just finishing this

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:05.220 
they sit down again just finishing this
off<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.980> going<00:02:59.130> under<00:02:59.430> my<00:02:59.550> eyes

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.790 

just<00:03:06.230> under<00:03:06.410> there<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.620> bit<00:03:06.830> more

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.680 

so<00:03:11.370> they<00:03:11.520> have<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.060> this<00:03:12.300> is<00:03:12.480> how<00:03:12.630> you

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
so they have it and this is how you

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.620 
so they have it and this is how you
would<00:03:12.960> apply<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:14.030> really<00:03:15.030> sort<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.390> full

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
would apply a really sort of full

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.450 
would apply a really sort of full
coverage<00:03:15.990> foundation<00:03:16.710> and<00:03:17.330> actually<00:03:18.330> I<00:03:18.360> think

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
coverage foundation and actually I think

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.220 
coverage foundation and actually I think
because<00:03:20.460> I<00:03:20.760> talked<00:03:20.940> about<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.780> do<00:03:21.930> need<00:03:22.080> to

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
because I talked about it you do need to

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.170 
because I talked about it you do need to
set<00:03:22.470> foundation<00:03:23.130> so<00:03:23.310> this<00:03:23.550> is<00:03:23.700> going<00:03:23.820> to<00:03:23.880> show

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
set foundation so this is going to show

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.030 
set foundation so this is going to show
you<00:03:24.240> actually<00:03:25.140> how<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.320> set<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.800> and<00:03:25.920> we're

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
you actually how to set it and we're

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.680

how you kind of get that look of having
almost<00:04:19.770> no<00:04:20.190> pores<00:04:20.670> because<00:04:21.150> you're<00:04:21.299> actually

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
almost no pores because you're actually

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.850 
almost no pores because you're actually
pushing<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.770> product<00:04:23.010> into<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.640> skin<00:04:23.790> okay

face can look overly matte and overly
flat<00:05:42.210> and<00:05:42.449> that's<00:05:42.569> not<00:05:42.779> something<00:05:42.990> that<00:05:43.710> is

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
flat and that's not something that is

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.909 
flat and that's not something that is
you<00:05:45.180> know<00:05:45.210> interface<00:05:45.840> our<00:05:46.229> faces<00:05:46.590> aren't

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
you know interface our faces aren't

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.040 
you know interface our faces aren't
naturally<00:05:47.430> that<00:05:47.580> matte<00:05:47.879> they<00:05:48.479> do<00:05:48.539> tend<00:05:49.020> to

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
naturally that matte they do tend to

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.290 
naturally that matte they do tend to
have<00:05:49.169> some<00:05:49.409> form<00:05:49.620> of<00:05:49.710> shine<00:05:49.919> to<00:05:49.949> it<00:05:50.189> so<00:05:50.819> it<00:05:51.180> is

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
have some form of shine to it so it is

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.209 
have some form of shine to it so it is
better<00:05:51.539> sometimes<00:05:51.840> to<00:05:52.229> pick<00:05:52.409> a<00:05:52.620> little<00:05:52.889> bit<00:05:53.069> of

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:53.219 
better sometimes to pick a little bit of

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:54.890 
better sometimes to pick a little bit of
powder<00:05:53.490> that<00:05:53.669> has<00:05:53.789> just<00:05:54.000> a<00:05:54.090> small<00:05:54.449> amount<00:05:54.689> of

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
powder that has just a small amount of

powder that has just a small amount of
shimmer<00:05:55.289> or<00:05:55.560> shine<00:05:55.590> in<00:05:56.069> it<00:05:56.159> just<00:05:56.759> to<00:05:56.909> sort<00:05:57.150> of

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
shimmer or shine in it just to sort of

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.089 
shimmer or shine in it just to sort of
put<00:05:57.419> some<00:05:57.599> life<00:05:57.779> back<00:05:58.020> in<00:05:58.169> your<00:05:58.289> face<00:05:58.469> and<00:05:58.949> that
