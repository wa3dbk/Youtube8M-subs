00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 very good at all good bones those that 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.509
 you follow me on twitter you saw that yesterday 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.980
 I was releasing a lot of good bile 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.840
 you live, I was not being honest with 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.240
 you and good has arrived a moment 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.940
 in which youtube did not fill me anymore 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.240
 she's not that excited anymore 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.490
 this and I think leaving it the same would be 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.090
 exaggerate because it will surely end 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.949
 coming back but I think I 'm going to leave it 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.890
 during a season for a year 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.590
 for six months I do not know anything because 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.989
 see I'm very grateful it's worth the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.880
 people who are supporting but good I do not know 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.980
 I am a person who has tried 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.510
 innovate in some aspects in some 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.579
 I'm not the god here 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.739
 the originality and much less that is 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.539
 done I do very ordinary videos but 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.940
 within the currents that are try 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.590
 be original and I see that still not 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.440
 this channel is not taking off 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.270
 always ends up triumphing just like the typical 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.340
 what everyone does 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.460
 and even though I also do those things 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.020
 I like to do things my style and still 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.230
 Well, it does not take off 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.060
 so well look, I do not think it's 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.420
 drop the world because stream or leave 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.260
 youtube I do not think anything strange happens 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.000
 thank you who have been there 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.500
 because good we have taken 40 thousand 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.490
 subscribers although the videos only the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.250
 tend to see 10,000 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.170
 it's not a big percentage but good at 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.299
 least there are people who continue to support me 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.520
 thanks to all of you who have 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:28.479

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.820

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.740

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.070
 you know what I have been working on 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.689
 working in the morning and in the afternoon all 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.090
 the days we do not have time for youtube 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.270
 practically and well I am disappointed 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.270

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.459

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.500
 see you in the future I hope not 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:58.500
 too far until later gamers 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.590
 sigh 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.070

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.440

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.080

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.030
 better which fell on 15 change from 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.190
 channel that ends there is a skin of 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.470
 parody until the serious takes so the 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.600
 laugh I like all blondes all do not 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.160
 the fortune teller is different and it may be that 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.080
 the best day of the week also 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.740

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.740
