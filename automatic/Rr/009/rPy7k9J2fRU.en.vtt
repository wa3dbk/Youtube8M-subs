hotel for example has a lot of aspects
and<00:01:13.890> we<00:01:14.100> invent<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> hotel<00:01:15.090> type<00:01:15.390> which<00:01:15.600> is

and we invent the hotel type which is
which<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.049> typically<00:01:17.150> corridor<00:01:18.150> stacked<00:01:18.540> on

which is typically corridor stacked on
top<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.900> each<00:01:19.110> other<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:20.009> wanted<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.400> bring

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
top of each other we wanted to bring

top of each other we wanted to bring
this<00:01:20.729> area<00:01:21.000> will<00:01:21.150> tell<00:01:21.390> more<00:01:21.659> into<00:01:22.079> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
this area will tell more into the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.920 
this area will tell more into the
relationship<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.790> an<00:01:23.909> urban<00:01:24.090> condition<00:01:24.780> that

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
relationship to an urban condition that

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.890 
relationship to an urban condition that
occupy<00:01:25.409> hotel<00:01:25.799> room<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:26.900> occupying

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
occupy hotel room is like I'm occupying

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.780 
occupy hotel room is like I'm occupying
a<00:01:28.079> house<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> city<00:01:28.860> along<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.189> street<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
a house in the city along the street the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.340 
a house in the city along the street the
idea<00:01:30.060> was<00:01:30.180> developed<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.780> hotel<00:01:31.140> should

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
idea was developed that the hotel should

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.190 
idea was developed that the hotel should
actually<00:01:31.530> be<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.040> kind<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.689> continuous<00:01:33.689> loop<00:01:34.020> of

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
actually be a kind of continuous loop of

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.109 
actually be a kind of continuous loop of
helix<00:01:34.590> where<00:01:34.920> you'll<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.430> basically<00:01:35.820> walk

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
helix where you'll be basically walk

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.240 
helix where you'll be basically walk
along<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> quarries<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:37.860> if<00:01:38.009> you're<00:01:38.189> in

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
along the quarries like as if you're in

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.480 
along the quarries like as if you're in
the<00:01:38.369> street

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
the street

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.240 
the street
the<00:01:41.510> i-beam<00:01:42.510> project<00:01:43.020> I've<00:01:43.320> been<00:01:43.380> utterly<00:01:44.100> a

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
the i-beam project I've been utterly a

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.210 
the i-beam project I've been utterly a
for<00:01:44.549> new<00:01:44.850> media<00:01:45.000> art<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:46.590> was<00:01:46.740> important<00:01:47.190> to

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
for new media art it was important to

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.980 
for new media art it was important to
understand<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.790> media<00:01:48.090> arts<00:01:48.420> does<00:01:48.780> not

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
understand that media arts does not

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.790 
understand that media arts does not
require<00:01:50.060> walls<00:01:51.060> like<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> convention<00:01:52.380> museum

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
require walls like a convention museum

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.020 
require walls like a convention museum
where<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.100> hang<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.460> painting<00:01:53.909> but

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
where you hang a painting but

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.420 
where you hang a painting but
projections<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.960> be<00:01:55.110> unbolted<00:01:55.500> floors<00:01:56.100> and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
projections can be unbolted floors and

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.060 
projections can be unbolted floors and
this<00:01:57.060> idea<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.450> seamlessness<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.409> continuity

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
this idea of seamlessness and continuity

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.639 
this idea of seamlessness and continuity
of<00:01:59.100> space<00:01:59.430> so<00:02:00.270> we<00:02:00.450> developed<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.380> floor

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
of space so we developed this the floor

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.320 
of space so we developed this the floor
the<00:02:01.979> wall<00:02:02.190> and<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.820> ceiling<00:02:03.000> being

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
the wall and the ceiling being

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.910 
the wall and the ceiling being
continuous<00:02:03.899> surface<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.530> therefore<00:02:04.830> you

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
continuous surface and therefore you

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.410 
continuous surface and therefore you
have<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.159> kind<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.399> soft<00:02:05.670> edges<00:02:06.119> in<00:02:06.270> this

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
have this kind of soft edges in this

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.380 
have this kind of soft edges in this
museum<00:02:10.370> we<00:02:11.370> were<00:02:11.550> sort<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:11.910> asked<00:02:12.300> to

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
museum we were sort of asked to

extremely different locations the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.979 
extremely different locations the
context<00:03:35.700> for<00:03:35.820> each<00:03:35.910> project<00:03:36.239> is<00:03:36.570> so<00:03:36.750> different

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
context for each project is so different

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.500 
context for each project is so different
that<00:03:37.260> it<00:03:37.560> also<00:03:37.799> you<00:03:38.340> know<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.640> starting<00:03:39.269> point

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
that it also you know the starting point

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.030 
that it also you know the starting point
is<00:03:39.690> quite<00:03:39.989> different<00:03:40.440> every<00:03:40.650> time

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
is quite different every time

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.229 
is quite different every time
sometimes<00:03:42.040> it's<00:03:42.250> very<00:03:42.489> clear<00:03:42.730> one<00:03:42.939> has<00:03:43.090> an

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
sometimes it's very clear one has an

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.929 
sometimes it's very clear one has an
idea<00:03:43.569> that<00:03:43.629> seems<00:03:44.409> to<00:03:44.590> be<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:45.069> right<00:03:45.219> idea<00:03:45.609> and

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:45.939 
idea that seems to be the right idea and

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.839 
idea that seems to be the right idea and
other<00:03:46.180> times<00:03:46.480> it's<00:03:46.750> sort<00:03:47.109> of<00:03:47.170> a<00:03:47.769> lot<00:03:48.700> of

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
other times it's sort of a lot of

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.270 
other times it's sort of a lot of
analysis<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:49.870> kind<00:03:50.290> of<00:03:50.409> experimentation

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
analysis and kind of experimentation

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.059 
analysis and kind of experimentation
that's<00:03:52.000> required<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.719> get<00:03:53.409> to<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.650> right<00:03:53.769> song

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
that's required to get to the right song

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.589 
that's required to get to the right song
we<00:03:54.310> also<00:03:54.459> we<00:03:54.790> probably<00:03:55.150> need<00:03:55.329> to<00:03:55.359> eliminate

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
we also we probably need to eliminate

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.649 
we also we probably need to eliminate
these<00:03:56.019> anger<00:03:56.500> pieces<00:03:56.890> as<00:03:57.040> well<00:03:57.299> recently<00:03:58.299> we

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 
these anger pieces as well recently we

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.349 
these anger pieces as well recently we
were<00:03:58.780> asked<00:03:59.139> to<00:03:59.859> participate<00:04:00.639> a<00:04:00.969> competition

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
were asked to participate a competition

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.869 
were asked to participate a competition
