00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
from South America and has just just

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.510 
from South America and has just just
excellent<00:01:45.180> tasting<00:01:45.570> meds<00:01:46.070> so<00:01:47.070> those<00:01:47.250> are<00:01:47.369> all

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
excellent tasting meds so those are all

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.249 
excellent tasting meds so those are all
great<00:01:47.700> nuts<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.570> use<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.110> can

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
great nuts that you can use and you can

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.630 
great nuts that you can use and you can
you<00:01:49.409> can<00:01:49.439> grow<00:01:49.799> with<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.100> methods<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.520> I'm

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
you can grow with the methods that I'm

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.789 
you can grow with the methods that I'm
going<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.850> describe<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.479> video<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.649> you

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
going to describe in this video and you

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.920 
going to describe in this video and you
can<00:01:52.920> get<00:01:53.100> these<00:01:53.220> nuts<00:01:53.520> from<00:01:53.880> local<00:01:54.659> trees

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
can get these nuts from local trees

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.499 
can get these nuts from local trees
that's<00:01:55.770> probably<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.189> best<00:01:56.399> because<00:01:57.390> these

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
that's probably the best because these

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.149 
that's probably the best because these
are<00:01:57.659> trees<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:57.960> have<00:01:58.320> been<00:01:58.350> adapted<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.950> your

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
are trees that have been adapted to your

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.980 
are trees that have been adapted to your
area<00:01:59.490> or<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.180> could<00:02:00.299> buy<00:02:00.450> them<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.810> here's<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
area or you could buy them and here's a

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.359 
area or you could buy them and here's a
few<00:02:01.170> different<00:02:01.439> sources<00:02:01.590> where<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.100> can<00:02:02.219> get

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
few different sources where you can get

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.399 
few different sources where you can get
them<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.700> u.s.<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.930> want<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.170> keep<00:02:04.290> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
them in the u.s. you want to keep the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.399 
them in the u.s. you want to keep the
seeds<00:02:05.040> kind<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.369> cool<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:06.030> moist<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:07.020> not<00:02:07.079> dry

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
seeds kind of cool and moist and not dry

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.869 
seeds kind of cool and moist and not dry
them<00:02:07.560> out<00:02:07.710> some<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.280> seeds<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.759> get

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
them out some of the seeds that you get

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.479 
them out some of the seeds that you get
from<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.119> supermarket<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:10.170> walnuts<00:02:10.679> have

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
from a supermarket like walnuts have

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.140 
from a supermarket like walnuts have
been<00:02:11.700> dried<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.390> want<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.660> get<00:02:12.750> them

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
been dried so you want to get them

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.729 
been dried so you want to get them
in<00:02:13.299> the<00:02:13.390> state<00:02:13.599> that<00:02:13.750> they<00:02:13.900> fell<00:02:14.110> off<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.409> tree

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.170 

okay<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:17.860> next<00:02:18.040> step<00:02:18.099> is<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.489> prepare<00:02:18.640> the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
okay the next step is to prepare the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.210 
okay the next step is to prepare the
soil<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.079> thing<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.379> remember<00:02:20.409> here<00:02:21.189> is

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
soil and the thing to remember here is

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.690 
soil and the thing to remember here is
that<00:02:21.400> we<00:02:21.790> are<00:02:21.819> mimicking<00:02:22.599> forest<00:02:23.200> soil<00:02:23.700> for

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
that we are mimicking forest soil for

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.860 
that we are mimicking forest soil for
these<00:02:24.819> pots<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.299> we're<00:02:25.510> going<00:02:25.599> to<00:02:25.659> put<00:02:25.780> the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
these pots that we're going to put the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.380 
these pots that we're going to put the
nuts<00:02:26.049> into<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:27.310> want<00:02:27.489> to<00:02:27.549> have<00:02:27.670> forest<00:02:28.150> soil

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
nuts into we want to have forest soil

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.690 
nuts into we want to have forest soil
not<00:02:28.720> garden<00:02:29.620> soil<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.159> difference<00:02:30.519> is

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
not garden soil and the difference is

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.369 
not garden soil and the difference is
that<00:02:30.730> we<00:02:31.060> want<00:02:31.239> something<00:02:31.510> very<00:02:31.540> high<00:02:31.900> carbon

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
that we want something very high carbon

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.110 
that we want something very high carbon
very<00:02:32.590> high<00:02:32.769> fungal<00:02:33.280> content<00:02:33.760> that's<00:02:33.939> where

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
very high fungal content that's where

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.309 
very high fungal content that's where
the<00:02:34.209> trees<00:02:34.420> are<00:02:34.450> going<00:02:34.659> to<00:02:34.720> be<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.900> happiest

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
the trees are going to be the happiest

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.559 
the trees are going to be the happiest
in<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.069> need<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.280> base<00:02:36.519> that<00:02:36.849> can<00:02:37.209> be<00:02:37.359> leaf

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
in so you need a base that can be leaf

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.509 
in so you need a base that can be leaf
mulch<00:02:37.900> or<00:02:38.230> peat<00:02:38.680> moss<00:02:38.829> again<00:02:39.189> something<00:02:39.430> very

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
mulch or peat moss again something very

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.240 
mulch or peat moss again something very
high<00:02:39.819> carbon<00:02:40.269> you<00:02:40.840> want<00:02:41.019> to<00:02:41.109> sand<00:02:41.439> you

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
high carbon you want to sand you

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.160 
high carbon you want to sand you
typically<00:02:42.579> add<00:02:42.700> sand<00:02:43.000> for<00:02:43.299> drainage<00:02:43.659> and<00:02:44.079> then

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
typically add sand for drainage and then

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.420 
typically add sand for drainage and then
we're<00:02:44.260> going<00:02:44.349> to<00:02:44.409> add<00:02:44.530> an<00:02:44.650> inoculant<00:02:45.159> to<00:02:45.310> get

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
we're going to add an inoculant to get

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.770 
we're going to add an inoculant to get
the<00:02:45.549> right<00:02:45.700> mix<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.060> microbial<00:02:46.540> life

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
the right mix of microbial life

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.710 
the right mix of microbial life
especially<00:02:47.079> fungal<00:02:48.000> fungal<00:02:49.000> activity<00:02:49.120> and

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
especially fungal fungal activity and

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.020 
especially fungal fungal activity and
forest<00:02:50.470> soil<00:02:50.680> is<00:02:50.889> really<00:02:51.099> the<00:02:51.310> best<00:02:51.459> for<00:02:51.730> them

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
forest soil is really the best for them

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.819 
forest soil is really the best for them
so<00:02:52.629> let's<00:02:52.780> go<00:02:52.870> ahead<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:53.109> demonstrate<00:02:53.260> this

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
so let's go ahead and demonstrate this

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.979 
so let's go ahead and demonstrate this
we're<00:02:54.670> going<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.819> start<00:02:54.940> off<00:02:55.269> as<00:02:55.480> we<00:02:55.599> mentioned

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
we're going to start off as we mentioned

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.770 
we're going to start off as we mentioned
with<00:02:56.170> leaf<00:02:56.560> mulch<00:02:56.889> and<00:02:57.730> this<00:02:57.909> is<00:02:58.030> just<00:02:58.239> a<00:02:58.359> big

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
with leaf mulch and this is just a big

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.720 
with leaf mulch and this is just a big
pile<00:02:59.019> leaves<00:02:59.379> that<00:02:59.590> you<00:02:59.650> set<00:02:59.950> out<00:03:00.099> for<00:03:00.310> a<00:03:00.370> year

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
pile leaves that you set out for a year

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.610 
pile leaves that you set out for a year
or<00:03:00.819> two<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.750> let<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:02.049> decay<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:02.500> that's

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
or two and let it decay and that's

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.470 
or two and let it decay and that's
really<00:03:02.859> the<00:03:02.980> best<00:03:03.159> of<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.400> best<00:03:03.549> if<00:03:04.239> you<00:03:04.329> don't

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
really the best of the best if you don't

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.330 
really the best of the best if you don't
have<00:03:04.569> that<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:04.900> can<00:03:04.930> use<00:03:05.170> peat<00:03:05.379> moss<00:03:05.560> now

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
have that you can use peat moss now

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.000 
have that you can use peat moss now
we're<00:03:06.489> going<00:03:06.579> to<00:03:06.639> add<00:03:06.790> some<00:03:07.030> sand<00:03:07.409> to<00:03:08.409> improve

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
we're going to add some sand to improve

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.410 
we're going to add some sand to improve
drainage<00:03:09.280> so<00:03:09.670> that<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.909> water<00:03:10.090> flows<00:03:10.299> through

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
drainage so that the water flows through

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.020 
drainage so that the water flows through
and<00:03:10.870> after<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:11.829> we're<00:03:12.280> going<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.459> be<00:03:12.579> adding

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
and after that we're going to be adding

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.039 
and after that we're going to be adding
and<00:03:13.239> inoculant

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
and inoculant

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.170

so<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.620> forest<00:03:14.980> soil<00:03:15.280> as<00:03:15.459> I<00:03:15.549> mentioned<00:03:15.970> is<00:03:16.060> the

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
so the forest soil as I mentioned is the

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.089 
so the forest soil as I mentioned is the
best<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.629> best<00:03:16.659> go<00:03:17.590> ahead<00:03:17.739> and<00:03:17.859> put<00:03:17.949> some

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
best the best go ahead and put some

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.280 
best the best go ahead and put some
forest<00:03:18.430> soil<00:03:18.669> in<00:03:18.879> to<00:03:19.120> include<00:03:19.690> input<00:03:20.169> the

right microbial life into this into this
mixture<00:03:24.069> I'm<00:03:24.819> going<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.120> go<00:03:25.180> ahead<00:03:25.299> and<00:03:25.480> just

mixture I'm going to go ahead and just

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:26.849 
mixture I'm going to go ahead and just
to<00:03:25.720> increase<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.139> diversity<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.650> because<00:03:26.829> I

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
to increase the diversity and because I

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.259 
to increase the diversity and because I
have<00:03:27.160> it<00:03:27.310> I<00:03:27.430> went<00:03:27.790> ahead<00:03:27.849> and<00:03:28.030> put<00:03:28.150> some

have it I went ahead and put some

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.080 
have it I went ahead and put some
compost<00:03:28.799> some<00:03:29.799> my<00:03:29.889> own<00:03:30.010> compost<00:03:30.519> in<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:31.000> then

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
compost some my own compost in and then

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.990 
compost some my own compost in and then
also<00:03:31.269> Burma<00:03:31.690> compost<00:03:32.260> or<00:03:32.500> worm<00:03:32.680> compost<00:03:33.280> again

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
root health of these nut trees here I'm

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.259 
root health of these nut trees here I'm
going<00:03:41.949> to<00:03:42.040> put<00:03:42.159> some<00:03:42.310> wood<00:03:42.519> ash<00:03:42.729> in<00:03:42.970> you<00:03:43.120> don't

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
going to put some wood ash in you don't

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:44.580 
going to put some wood ash in you don't
have<00:03:43.359> to<00:03:43.479> do<00:03:43.629> that<00:03:43.810> that's<00:03:43.989> just<00:03:44.109> my<00:03:44.290> fireplace

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
have to do that that's just my fireplace

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.619 
have to do that that's just my fireplace
and<00:03:45.129> then<00:03:45.579> just<00:03:45.729> to<00:03:45.819> fluff<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:46.180> up<00:03:46.239> a<00:03:46.389> little

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
and then just to fluff it up a little

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.119 
and then just to fluff it up a little
again<00:03:46.870> another<00:03:47.049> optional<00:03:47.650> one<00:03:47.799> I'm<00:03:47.979> putting

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
again another optional one I'm putting

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.710 
again another optional one I'm putting
some<00:03:48.370> wood<00:03:48.579> shavings<00:03:49.000> in<00:03:49.180> again<00:03:49.479> something

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
some wood shavings in again something

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.589 
some wood shavings in again something
very<00:03:49.840> high<00:03:50.709> carbon<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.459> then<00:03:52.090> you<00:03:52.180> stir<00:03:52.389> it<00:03:52.419> up

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
very high carbon and then you stir it up

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.559 
very high carbon and then you stir it up
and<00:03:53.440> then<00:03:53.889> you're<00:03:54.010> ready<00:03:54.099> to<00:03:54.220> go<00:03:54.430> so<00:03:54.639> that's

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
and then you're ready to go so that's

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.390 
and then you're ready to go so that's
the<00:03:55.870> soil<00:03:56.169> that's<00:03:56.470> kind<00:03:56.739> of<00:03:56.799> preparing<00:03:57.220> the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
the soil that's kind of preparing the

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.240 
the soil that's kind of preparing the
soil<00:03:57.639> and<00:03:58.540> then<00:03:58.750> you<00:03:58.840> go<00:03:58.989> ahead<00:03:59.109> and<00:03:59.650> put<00:04:00.220> that

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
soil and then you go ahead and put that

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.330 
soil and then you go ahead and put that
soil<00:04:00.609> into<00:04:00.909> pots<00:04:01.229> and<00:04:02.229> the<00:04:02.769> pots<00:04:03.069> it's

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
soil into pots and the pots it's

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.059 
soil into pots and the pots it's
important<00:04:03.729> to<00:04:03.790> think<00:04:03.940> about<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:05.530> deep<00:04:05.829> is

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
important to think about that deep is

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.979 
important to think about that deep is
more<00:04:06.489> important<00:04:06.970> than<00:04:07.090> wide<00:04:07.359> when<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.810> roots

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
more important than wide when the roots

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.420 
more important than wide when the roots
come<00:04:08.169> out<00:04:08.319> of<00:04:08.440> these<00:04:08.530> trees<00:04:08.799> they<00:04:08.979> go<00:04:09.069> straight

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
come out of these trees they go straight

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.619 
come out of these trees they go straight
down<00:04:09.609> or<00:04:09.849> when<00:04:09.940> they<00:04:10.000> come<00:04:10.180> out<00:04:10.239> of<00:04:10.359> the<00:04:10.419> Nets

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
down or when they come out of the Nets

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.240 
down or when they come out of the Nets
they<00:04:10.780> go<00:04:10.900> straight<00:04:11.199> down<00:04:11.440> they<00:04:11.889> really<00:04:12.159> don't

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
they go straight down they really don't

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.490 
they go straight down they really don't
go<00:04:12.400> out<00:04:12.549> much<00:04:12.720> so<00:04:13.720> you<00:04:13.810> need<00:04:13.930> some<00:04:14.079> really<00:04:14.379> kind

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
go out much so you need some really kind

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.560 
go out much so you need some really kind
of<00:04:14.590> deep<00:04:14.799> pots<00:04:15.069> and<00:04:15.430> you<00:04:16.120> can<00:04:16.239> use<00:04:16.359> your<00:04:16.449> own

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
of deep pots and you can use your own

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.899 
of deep pots and you can use your own
pots<00:04:16.840> just<00:04:17.109> make<00:04:17.289> sure<00:04:17.409> they're<00:04:17.560> deep<00:04:17.909> there's

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:18.909 
pots just make sure they're deep there's

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:21.420 
pots just make sure they're deep there's
also<00:04:19.120> some<00:04:19.389> good<00:04:19.590> commercial<00:04:20.590> pots<00:04:20.949> available

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
get these pots and then you see the Nets

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.420 
get these pots and then you see the Nets
you<00:04:37.570> plant<00:04:37.870> them<00:04:38.080> in<00:04:38.230> late<00:04:38.710> autumn<00:04:38.889> typically

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
you plant them in late autumn typically

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.120 
you plant them in late autumn typically
a<00:04:39.460> lot<00:04:39.820> of<00:04:39.910> these<00:04:40.000> nuts<00:04:40.210> need<00:04:40.950> weathering<00:04:41.950> over

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
to germinate the spring you typically

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.629 
to germinate the spring you typically
put<00:04:46.960> soil<00:04:47.200> over<00:04:47.530> it's<00:04:47.800> around<00:04:48.070> 3<00:04:48.370> to<00:04:48.490> 5

put soil over it's around 3 to 5
centimeters<00:04:49.270> or<00:04:49.419> about<00:04:49.450> 1<00:04:49.780> to<00:04:49.900> 2<00:04:50.050> inches<00:04:50.080> deep

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
centimeters or about 1 to 2 inches deep

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.040 
centimeters or about 1 to 2 inches deep
so<00:04:50.889> that's<00:04:51.639> seeding<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.030> nuts<00:04:52.360> and<00:04:52.810> we<00:04:52.900> go<00:04:52.990> to

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
so that's seeding the nuts and we go to

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.090 
so that's seeding the nuts and we go to
the<00:04:53.169> next<00:04:53.380> step<00:04:53.620> you're<00:04:53.770> going<00:04:53.919> to<00:04:53.980> go<00:04:54.040> ahead

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
the next step you're going to go ahead

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.830 
the next step you're going to go ahead
and<00:04:54.250> grow<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.639> trees<00:04:54.940> you<00:04:55.480> want<00:04:55.600> to<00:04:55.660> keep<00:04:55.720> the

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
and grow the trees you want to keep the

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.680 
and grow the trees you want to keep the
soil<00:04:56.020> moist<00:04:56.200> but<00:04:56.710> not<00:04:56.860> not<00:04:57.100> overly<00:04:57.460> wet

protected from squirrels from birds and

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.700 
protected from squirrels from birds and
these<00:05:01.900> trees<00:05:02.169> should<00:05:02.320> be<00:05:02.350> ready<00:05:02.620> to

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
these trees should be ready to

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.000 
these trees should be ready to
transplant<00:05:03.280> in<00:05:03.700> autumn<00:05:04.600> of<00:05:04.810> the<00:05:05.320> first<00:05:05.560> year

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
transplant in autumn of the first year

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.650 
transplant in autumn of the first year
so<00:05:06.310> that<00:05:06.520> same<00:05:06.760> year<00:05:07.000> that<00:05:07.030> you've<00:05:07.300> planted

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
so that same year that you've planted

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.920 
so that same year that you've planted
them<00:05:07.810> or<00:05:08.740> that<00:05:09.280> same<00:05:09.460> season<00:05:09.760> so<00:05:10.660> then<00:05:10.840> you

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
them or that same season so then you

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.379 
them or that same season so then you
transplant<00:05:11.530> those<00:05:11.760> trees<00:05:12.760> and<00:05:13.060> you<00:05:13.120> do<00:05:13.240> that

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
transplant those trees and you do that

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:14.879 
transplant those trees and you do that
typically<00:05:13.780> when<00:05:13.930> they're<00:05:14.080> you<00:05:14.440> want<00:05:14.620> to<00:05:14.710> do<00:05:14.800> it

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
typically when they're you want to do it

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.560 
typically when they're you want to do it
when<00:05:15.040> they're<00:05:15.160> dormant<00:05:15.490> so<00:05:15.970> after<00:05:16.240> the<00:05:16.330> leaves

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
when they're dormant so after the leaves

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.440 
when they're dormant so after the leaves
have<00:05:16.840> fallen<00:05:17.250> that's<00:05:18.250> a<00:05:18.370> good<00:05:18.580> late<00:05:18.790> autumn<00:05:19.030> or

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
have fallen that's a good late autumn or

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.600 
have fallen that's a good late autumn or
early<00:05:19.900> spring<00:05:20.050> if<00:05:20.500> you<00:05:20.590> have<00:05:20.860> a<00:05:20.889> very<00:05:21.310> hard

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
early spring if you have a very hard

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.000 
early spring if you have a very hard
winter<00:05:22.110> you<00:05:23.110> might<00:05:23.260> not<00:05:23.410> want<00:05:23.560> to<00:05:23.620> transplant

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
winter you might not want to transplant

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.710 
winter you might not want to transplant
right<00:05:24.310> in<00:05:24.430> the<00:05:24.490> coldest<00:05:24.850> coldest<00:05:25.210> months<00:05:25.540> but

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
right in the coldest coldest months but

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.050 
right in the coldest coldest months but
maybe<00:05:25.870> on<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.200> edges<00:05:26.560> of<00:05:26.650> that<00:05:26.700> and<00:05:27.700> again

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
maybe on the edges of that and again

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.090 
maybe on the edges of that and again
we're<00:05:28.180> trying<00:05:28.300> to<00:05:28.479> mimic<00:05:28.600> forest<00:05:29.080> soil<00:05:29.350> so<00:05:29.680> you

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
we're trying to mimic forest soil so you

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.650 
we're trying to mimic forest soil so you
know<00:05:30.220> you<00:05:30.280> can<00:05:30.490> surround<00:05:30.880> those<00:05:31.150> trees<00:05:31.450> with

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
know you can surround those trees with

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.719 
know you can surround those trees with
woody<00:05:31.930> mulch<00:05:32.229> and<00:05:32.530> then<00:05:33.039> you<00:05:33.130> need<00:05:33.280> to<00:05:33.340> protect

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
woody mulch and then you need to protect

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.670 
woody mulch and then you need to protect
them<00:05:33.910> depends<00:05:34.600> on<00:05:34.660> the<00:05:34.810> the<00:05:34.840> conditions<00:05:35.560> in

them depends on the the conditions in
your<00:05:35.770> area<00:05:36.220> you<00:05:36.400> might<00:05:36.850> need<00:05:37.030> to<00:05:37.120> protect<00:05:37.390> them

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
your area you might need to protect them

your area you might need to protect them
from<00:05:37.660> drought<00:05:37.930> you<00:05:38.110> may<00:05:38.229> need<00:05:38.350> to<00:05:38.470> water<00:05:38.650> and

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
from drought you may need to water and

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.290

summer months rodents will often sneak

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.540 
summer months rodents will often sneak
in<00:05:43.300> and<00:05:43.630> eat<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.080> inner<00:05:44.200> bark<00:05:44.470> of<00:05:44.590> your<00:05:45.220> trees

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
in and eat the inner bark of your trees

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.790 
in and eat the inner bark of your trees
they'll<00:05:45.820> ring<00:05:46.000> them<00:05:46.180> and<00:05:46.330> kill<00:05:46.840> them<00:05:46.870> so

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
they'll ring them and kill them so

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.320 
they'll ring them and kill them so

that's what the milk container is for

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.090 
that's what the milk container is for
the<00:05:49.539> milk<00:05:49.750> carton<00:05:50.050> here<00:05:50.229> is<00:05:50.320> for<00:05:50.590> some<00:05:50.890> kind<00:05:51.070> of

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
the milk carton here is for some kind of

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.060 
the milk carton here is for some kind of
protection<00:05:51.460> you<00:05:51.610> put<00:05:51.850> around<00:05:52.030> it<00:05:52.210> a<00:05:52.390> deer<00:05:53.229> can

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
protection you put around it a deer can

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.430 
protection you put around it a deer can
eat<00:05:54.160> the<00:05:54.250> tops<00:05:54.460> and<00:05:54.820> weeds<00:05:55.720> and<00:05:55.900> grass<00:05:56.139> can

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
eat the tops and weeds and grass can

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.260 
eat the tops and weeds and grass can
overtake<00:05:56.740> these<00:05:56.979> trees<00:05:57.220> so<00:05:57.430> some<00:05:58.000> things<00:05:58.030> to

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
overtake these trees so some things to

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.640 
overtake these trees so some things to
think<00:05:58.479> about<00:05:58.539> when<00:05:58.810> you<00:05:58.900> transplant<00:05:59.410> and<00:05:59.560> how

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
think about when you transplant and how

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.129 
think about when you transplant and how
to<00:05:59.710> take<00:05:59.889> care<00:05:59.950> of<00:06:00.250> them<00:06:00.370> so<00:06:01.330> that's<00:06:01.570> it<00:06:01.900> in

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:02.139 
to take care of them so that's it in

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.260 
to take care of them so that's it in
terms<00:06:02.320> of<00:06:02.470> starting<00:06:02.710> nuts<00:06:03.010> from<00:06:03.340> seed<00:06:03.729> I<00:06:04.060> hope

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
terms of starting nuts from seed I hope

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.850 
terms of starting nuts from seed I hope
it<00:06:04.389> goes<00:06:04.539> well<00:06:04.810> so<00:06:05.139> let<00:06:05.320> us<00:06:05.350> know<00:06:05.560> how<00:06:05.590> it<00:06:05.800> goes
