00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.860
 the roller coasters are creations of use 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.320
 of entertainment for the public in 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.180
 general when they feel a need or 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.829
 they are presented with a feeling of wanting 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.230
 feel is an ibex experience 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.120
 of these mechanical creations were 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.010
 created for those people who 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.559
 they want to experience a feeling of 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.109
 risk due to the great heights that 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.420
 these take and the forces that are exerted 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:50.420
 in each person in this mounted in 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.299
 any roller coaster but like in the 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.489
 world and people with new ideas and some 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:58.129
 they earn a title deranged ideas 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.559
 and terrifying then to anyone who has his 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.170
 100% judgment would you think of designing 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.179
 such an apparatus so that many people 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.970
 who wish death carry it out 

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:10.069
 but according to the creator this is so that 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.780
 the people who want to use it 

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:17.350
 die with style and elegance 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.690
 euthanasia koster is a roller coaster that 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.250
 by its name seeks to make a NATO 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.920
 towards people who want to ride 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.380
 this homicidal attraction for those who do not 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.299
 NATO know this, so it is an action u 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.610
 omission that accelerates the death of a 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.710
 patient always evicted with his 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.320
 consent with the intention of 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.970
 avoid suffering and pain euthanasia 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.030
 is associated with the end of life without 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.700
 suffering its equivalence would be botana 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.320
 effective and passive euthanasia 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.350
 respectively, they are also used 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.890
 almost synonymous qualifications 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.200
 of positive and negative respectively 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.429
 direct euthanasia ahead of time 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.810
 of death in case of illness 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:01.119
 incurable this in turn has two forms 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.159
 active is to cause the death of 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.080
 a direct mode can be resorted to 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.800
 drugs that overdose generate 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.720
 deadly passive effects are omitted it 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.630
 suspends the processing of a process not 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.330
 zoo determined for example a 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.610
 bronchopneumonia by feeding by 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.260
 any way with which it rushes 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.439
 at the end of life 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.720
 Death default direct euthanasia 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.730
 is what is verified when they are made 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.739
 with therapeutic intent and 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.810
 procedures that can produce 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.209
 death as a side effect by 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.760
 example the administration of analgesics 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.950
 narcotics to calm the pains the 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.349
 themselves with the indirect effect and not 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.140
 sought cause state decline 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.750
 of conscience and possible abbreviation of 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.540
 intention survived here the intention 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.909
 certainly not shortening life but 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.950
 alleviate suffering and the other is a 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:56.360
 predictable consequence but not 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.520
 persecuted 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.070
 Now that we know it's an out and as 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.320
 We already know fully what you do 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.970
 coastal euthanasia and it's time to 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.910
 speak directly about it 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.610
 homicidal mountain the design starts with a 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.160
 very angled ascent from 510 meters up 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.500
 the top which would take two minutes in 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.670
 reached for a train of 24 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.470
 passengers hence its descent of 510 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.890
 meters would take the train at a speed 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.230
 of 360 kilometers an hour near your 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.120
 limit speed before flattening if 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.070
 take speed towards the first of your 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.350
 seven investments slightly and clot today 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.360
 Each investment would have a diameter 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.370
 smaller than the previous one for 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.290
 inflict an acceleration of 10 times the 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.690
 seriousness to passengers while the 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.970
 train loses speed after a turn 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.709
 sharp to the right the train would enter 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.990
 on the straight where the 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.880
 unloading and loading of passengers 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.860
 euthanasia cost in terms of 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.590
 passengers through cerebral hypoxia 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.900
 prolonged or insufficient supply of 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.540
 oxygen to the brain the seven inversions 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.760
 of the walk would infringe ten times the 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.890
 seriousness to his passengers during 60 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.710
 seconds causing related symptoms 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.200
 with the forces that starting with a 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.780
 increasingly gray vision going through 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.180
 vision tunnel until a syncope caused 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.910
 by black vision the force that is a 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.770
 measure of strength a measure in entitled 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.720
 acceleration is based on the 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.520
 acceleration that would produce gravity 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.640
 of any object in conditions 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.710
 ideal an acceleration is of a g is 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.460
 generally considered as equal to 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.900
 standard gravity is to say that it is in 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.600
 9.81 meters in seconds squared 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.509
 the force that for an object is 0 g 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.850
 in any environment without gravity but 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:44.949
 a free fall or a satellite orbiting 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.990
 on earth it would be a ga any 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.300
 stationary object on the surface of 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.960
 the land at sea level apart from this 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.949
 the forces that can be greater than 1 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.650
 depending on the tolerance of a 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.449
 individual passenger to the forces that the 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.699
 first second investment would cause 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.919
 cerebral anoxia causing the 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.930
 passengers are brain dead 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.550
 the following investments would serve 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.320
 as an insurance against survival 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.780
 unintentional passenger 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.430
 particularly robust until 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.740
 moment of the NATO towards costs continues 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.570
 being a prototype designed and has not been 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.300
 created in no center for its usefulness 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.310
 but he gave them that in his own opinion the 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.810
 world does not need more death apparatuses 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.449
 even to avoid a pain in 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.539
 diseases for that continue to exist 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:31.950
 traditional euthanasia leaves your 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:35.190
 opinion in the comment box 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.420
 I'm 615 and I hope you forget it was from 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.940
 you like it 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.820
 do not forget to subscribe and leave a 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.080
 little hand up I hope you have fun 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.080
 the park you visit 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.860
