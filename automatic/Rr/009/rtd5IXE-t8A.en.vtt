00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
the next big phase of British amps came

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.749 
the next big phase of British amps came
in<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.000> late<00:02:02.150> 60s<00:02:02.690> a<00:02:02.950> little<00:02:03.950> more<00:02:04.100> gain<00:02:04.340> still

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
in the late 60s a little more gain still

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.880 
in the late 60s a little more gain still
not<00:02:04.970> incredibly<00:02:05.509> dirty<00:02:05.750> but<00:02:06.080> big<00:02:06.320> sounds<00:02:06.770> that

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
not incredibly dirty but big sounds that

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.440 
not incredibly dirty but big sounds that
you're<00:02:07.009> familiar<00:02:07.190> with<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:08.119> that<00:02:08.300> you'll

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
you're familiar with and that you'll

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.330 
you're familiar with and that you'll
find<00:02:08.690> on<00:02:08.840> channel<00:02:09.319> 2<00:02:09.530> so<00:02:09.860> when<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.069> hit<00:02:10.160> your

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
find on channel 2 so when you hit your

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.460 
find on channel 2 so when you hit your
foot<00:02:10.489> switch<00:02:10.759> you<00:02:11.390> see<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.720> red<00:02:11.900> light<00:02:11.930> come

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
foot switch you see the red light come

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.559 
foot switch you see the red light come
on<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:13.130> means<00:02:13.430> you're<00:02:13.610> on<00:02:13.700> channel<00:02:14.150> 2<00:02:14.300> which

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
on that means you're on channel 2 which

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.120 
on that means you're on channel 2 which
means<00:02:14.840> you're<00:02:15.110> in<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.290> late<00:02:15.440> sixties<00:02:15.920> of<00:02:16.040> the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
means you're in the late sixties of the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:33.580 
means you're in the late sixties of the
early<00:02:16.430> seventies

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.050 

so<00:02:34.590> there<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:34.800> go<00:02:35.450> channel<00:02:36.450> 3<00:02:37.730> it's<00:02:38.730> sort<00:02:39.000> of

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
so there you go channel 3 it's sort of

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.030 
so there you go channel 3 it's sort of
the<00:02:39.540> mid-seventies<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.380> forward<00:02:40.770> right

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
the mid-seventies and forward right

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.860 
the mid-seventies and forward right
before<00:02:41.400> we<00:02:41.520> got<00:02:41.670> into<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:41.940> heavy<00:02:42.180> metal<00:02:42.540> amps

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
before we got into the heavy metal amps

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.960 
before we got into the heavy metal amps
and<00:02:43.020> so<00:02:43.560> when<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.770> hit<00:02:43.890> channel<00:02:44.340> hit<00:02:44.819> the

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
and so when you hit channel hit the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.490
