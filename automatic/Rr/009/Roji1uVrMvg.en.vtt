00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.029 
make sure I have it in the center from
that<00:00:15.150> dot<00:00:15.450> we're<00:00:15.780> going<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.139> make<00:00:16.320> some

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
that dot we're going to make some

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.660 
that dot we're going to make some
straight<00:00:17.460> lines<00:00:17.730> down<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.920> I<00:00:19.920> would<00:00:20.220> say<00:00:20.550> an

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
straight lines down and I would say an

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.599 
straight lines down and I would say an
upside-down<00:00:21.090> V<00:00:21.510> shape

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
upside-down V shape

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.070 
upside-down V shape
now<00:00:23.609> we're<00:00:23.820> going<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.090> follow<00:00:24.359> along<00:00:24.600> those

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
now we're going to follow along those

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.089 
now we're going to follow along those
lines<00:00:26.060> with<00:00:27.060> another<00:00:27.420> V<00:00:27.720> shape<00:00:28.080> that's<00:00:28.890> going

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
lines with another V shape that's going

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.450 
lines with another V shape that's going
to<00:00:29.369> be<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> roof<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.090> our<00:00:30.480> schoolhouse<00:00:31.460> we're

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
moving down we are going to make some

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.370 
moving down we are going to make some
straight<00:01:50.840> lines<00:01:51.110> down<00:01:54.009> and<00:01:56.020> then<00:01:57.020> we're<00:01:57.200> going

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
straight lines down and then we're going

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.200 
straight lines down and then we're going
to<00:01:57.470> close<00:01:57.979> those<00:01:58.399> straight<00:01:58.850> lines<00:01:58.880> up<00:02:01.210> with

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
to close those straight lines up with

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.710 
to close those straight lines up with
another<00:02:02.539> straight<00:02:02.899> line<00:02:03.820> let's<00:02:04.820> make<00:02:05.119> a<00:02:05.149> door

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
another straight line let's make a door

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.020 
another straight line let's make a door
so<00:02:06.380> that's<00:02:06.560> just<00:02:06.920> another<00:02:07.159> series<00:02:08.000> of

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
so that's just another series of

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.920 
so that's just another series of
straight<00:02:08.539> lines<00:02:09.640> so<00:02:10.640> find<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.300> middle<00:02:11.540> and

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
straight lines so find the middle and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.080 
straight lines so find the middle and
then<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:12.410> make<00:02:12.590> some<00:02:12.890> straight<00:02:13.250> lines<00:02:13.519> and

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
then you make some straight lines and

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.130 
then you make some straight lines and
then<00:02:15.050> you<00:02:15.230> close<00:02:15.800> them<00:02:16.100> up<00:02:16.280> at<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.550> top

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.780 

let's<00:02:21.070> put<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.400> window<00:02:21.850> up<00:02:22.060> here<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:23.700> think<00:02:24.700> the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
let's put a window up here I think the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.290 
let's put a window up here I think the
circle<00:02:25.270> would<00:02:25.390> look<00:02:25.600> nice<00:02:25.840> with<00:02:26.580> some<00:02:27.580> panes

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
circle would look nice with some panes

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.330 
circle would look nice with some panes
inside<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:30.930> then<00:02:31.930> maybe<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.530> same<00:02:32.890> put<00:02:33.310> a

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
inside and then maybe the same put a

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.980 
inside and then maybe the same put a
window<00:02:34.200> on<00:02:35.200> your<00:02:35.230> door<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:38.130> then<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.990> little

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
window on your door and then a little

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.030 
window on your door and then a little
handle<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:41.770> you<00:02:41.860> can<00:02:42.070> get<00:02:42.250> in<00:02:43.380> now<00:02:44.380> coming<00:02:44.770> down

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
handle so you can get in now coming down

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.130 
handle so you can get in now coming down
from<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:46.630> door<00:02:46.959> you<00:02:47.770> can<00:02:48.010> make<00:02:48.190> some<00:02:48.459> steps

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
from the door you can make some steps

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.510 
from the door you can make some steps
you<00:02:50.140> can<00:02:50.290> make<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.470> pathway<00:02:51.190> it's<00:02:51.700> up<00:02:52.270> to<00:02:52.450> you

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
you can make a pathway it's up to you

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.250 
you can make a pathway it's up to you
let's<00:02:54.520> make<00:02:54.820> a<00:02:54.850> couple<00:02:55.150> more<00:02:55.480> windows<00:02:55.930> on<00:02:56.110> the

rectangle and then two lines in the

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.729 
rectangle and then two lines in the
middle<00:03:09.750> now<00:03:10.750> what<00:03:10.930> I<00:03:10.959> like<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.260> do<00:03:11.500> for<00:03:11.680> my

switch it out keep going until you get
to<00:03:45.049> the<00:03:45.230> bottom<00:03:45.470> and<00:03:46.209> make<00:03:47.209> sure<00:03:47.659> you<00:03:47.810> don't<00:03:47.989> go

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
to the bottom and make sure you don't go

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.420 
to the bottom and make sure you don't go
over<00:03:48.739> your<00:03:48.769> windows<00:03:50.590> don't<00:03:51.590> go<00:03:51.829> over<00:03:52.220> your

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
over your windows don't go over your

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.520 
over your windows don't go over your
doors<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:55.209> they<00:03:56.209> don't<00:03:56.420> have<00:03:56.629> to<00:03:56.810> be<00:03:56.930> perfect

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
doors and they don't have to be perfect

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.619 
doors and they don't have to be perfect
actually<00:03:58.010> I<00:03:58.040> think<00:03:58.220> it<00:03:58.519> looks<00:03:58.700> better<00:03:59.000> if<00:03:59.390> it's

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
actually I think it looks better if it's

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.380 
actually I think it looks better if it's
not<00:03:59.870> perfect<00:04:00.670> because<00:04:01.670> it<00:04:01.879> will<00:04:02.030> look<00:04:02.209> like

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
not perfect because it will look like

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.020 
not perfect because it will look like
you<00:04:02.629> did<00:04:02.900> it<00:04:03.049> and<00:04:03.379> that's<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.519> really<00:04:04.700> neat

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
you did it and that's the really neat

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.690 
you did it and that's the really neat
thing<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:08.480> we<00:04:08.659> just<00:04:08.900> keep<00:04:09.109> going<00:04:09.379> until<00:04:09.980> we

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
thing and we just keep going until we

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.819 
thing and we just keep going until we
hit<00:04:10.849> the<00:04:11.060> bottom<00:04:13.239> just<00:04:14.239> like<00:04:14.569> that<00:04:14.840> there's

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829
