00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.130 
other words we as human beings have
become<00:02:09.319> overly<00:02:10.129> dependent<00:02:10.310> on<00:02:11.140> our

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
become overly dependent on our

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.530 
become overly dependent on our
smartphones<00:02:12.620> right<00:02:13.370> if<00:02:13.550> you<00:02:13.700> lose<00:02:13.940> sight<00:02:14.239> of

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
smartphones right if you lose sight of

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.839 
smartphones right if you lose sight of
your<00:02:15.379> phone<00:02:15.620> for<00:02:15.860> just<00:02:16.099> a<00:02:16.190> minute<00:02:16.459> you<00:02:16.610> start

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
your phone for just a minute you start

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.220 
your phone for just a minute you start
freaking<00:02:17.120> out<00:02:17.269> you<00:02:17.450> start<00:02:17.659> calling<00:02:17.989> it<00:02:18.110> you

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
freaking out you start calling it you

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.780 
freaking out you start calling it you
start<00:02:18.440> running<00:02:18.560> around<00:02:18.770> your<00:02:19.040> house<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:20.680> so

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
start running around your house and so

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.860 
start running around your house and so
that's<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.970> reason<00:02:23.120> why

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
that's the reason why

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.350 
that's the reason why
we<00:02:24.500> thought<00:02:24.739> of<00:02:24.920> inverting<00:02:25.879> the<00:02:26.000> two<00:02:26.150> rules

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
we thought of inverting the two rules

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.650 
we thought of inverting the two rules
right<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:26.870> instead<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:29.000> phone<00:02:29.300> being<00:02:29.540> the

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
right so instead of the phone being the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.380 
right so instead of the phone being the
master<00:02:30.080> we<00:02:30.680> have<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.340> SmartWatch<00:02:31.819> the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
master we have the SmartWatch the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.119 
master we have the SmartWatch the

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
and when you're running low on battery

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:47.920 
and when you're running low on battery
you<00:02:46.280> can<00:02:46.430> connect<00:02:46.819> the<00:02:46.940> hub<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.569> screen

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
you can connect the hub to the screen

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.140 
you can connect the hub to the screen
device<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.530> siphon<00:02:49.250> across<00:02:49.549> some<00:02:49.790> extra
