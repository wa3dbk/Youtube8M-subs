00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.200
 titans duel that for the first time in 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.969
 the story starts 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.950
 in the city of riohacha in the 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:13.430
 department of the guajira we observe 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.009
 the cyclists at the starting site 178 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.219
 Realists participating in this edition 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:22.369
 of the classic rcn a terrain totally 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:24.619
 plain with a lot of wind fortunately 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.590
 the weather was not a temperature 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:32.110
 very high was somewhat opaque and that therefore 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:35.990
 he was in favor of the realists of the 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.659
 caravan of the classic rcn we observe the 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.330
 main group that then initially 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.349
 calm march several escape attempts 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.959
 that did not happen because there were many 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:50.090
 interests at stake on behalf of 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:52.099
 different branded equipment for example 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.399
 there we see the armed forces army 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:58.929
 national who was trying a small attack 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.220
 but that he quickly controlled the group 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.380
 remember that the previous year Camilo 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.420
 Gómez was the champion and this year 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.130
 he is in the team formesan bogotá humana 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.440
 and it is what 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.800
 defend that type until finally 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.630
 gave way to the escape of the day integrated by 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.910

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.920
 minutes on the main lot that 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:58.910

 quite charming landscapes the 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.110
 attraction of the days could be 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.780
 say and it was that half the way 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.610

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.060
 we are precisely watching the step 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.880

 it made precisely the return marked 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.510
 100 kilometers and already back then the 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.050
 group began to react from different 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.900
 teams put their men to 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.690

 they started working to cut 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.569
 quickly that difference and so it 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.450
 got

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.140
 wind was also very difficult what 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.440
