and<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.570> game<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:35.060> your<00:01:36.060> your<00:01:36.990> lawn<00:01:37.320> you

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
and in this game is your your lawn you

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.249 
and in this game is your your lawn you
can<00:01:37.799> launch<00:01:38.070> yourself<00:01:38.220> with<00:01:39.210> what<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.930> cannon

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
can launch yourself with what the cannon

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.590 
can launch yourself with what the cannon
where<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.159> tap<00:01:41.369> on<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.579> cannon<00:01:41.939> it's

where you can tap on the cannon it's
constantly<00:01:43.079> moving<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:43.950> going<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.189> be<00:01:44.280> a

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
constantly moving so it's going to be a

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.219 
constantly moving so it's going to be a
bit<00:01:44.430> harder<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.840> just<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.020> first

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
bit harder and this is just the first

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.100 
bit harder and this is just the first
level<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.920> seems<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.280> bit<00:01:47.399> easy<00:01:47.930> your<00:01:48.930> aim<00:01:49.079> is

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
level so it seems a bit easy your aim is

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.760 
level so it seems a bit easy your aim is
to<00:01:49.350> reach<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:50.280> goal<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:51.090> banana<00:01:51.750> right<00:01:52.020> there

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
to reach the goal the banana right there

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.030 
to reach the goal the banana right there
and<00:01:53.329> collect<00:01:54.329> as<00:01:54.570> much<00:01:54.720> bananas<00:01:55.680> as<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.890> can

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
and collect as much bananas as you can

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.090 
and collect as much bananas as you can
in<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.340> process<00:02:00.350> once<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:01.680> come<00:02:01.829> well

in the process once you can come well
once<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:02.969> complete<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.360> level<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.750> will<00:02:03.869> show

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
once you complete the level it will show

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.959 
once you complete the level it will show
you<00:02:04.079> like<00:02:04.469> how<00:02:04.500> many<00:02:05.100> banners<00:02:05.640> you've

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.230 
you like how many banners you've
collected<00:02:06.210> on<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
collected on the

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
environment in each world and there's a

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.340 
environment in each world and there's a
whole<00:03:24.790> new<00:03:24.970> set<00:03:25.150> of<00:03:25.180> levels<00:03:25.480> in<00:03:25.810> each<00:03:25.930> world<00:03:26.140> as

whole new set of levels in each world as

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.050 
whole new set of levels in each world as
well<00:03:27.540> basically<00:03:29.070> right<00:03:30.070> now<00:03:30.220> like<00:03:30.609> the<00:03:30.760> new

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
well basically right now like the new

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.270 
well basically right now like the new
thing<00:03:31.299> about<00:03:31.630> this<00:03:31.840> world<00:03:32.079> and<00:03:32.470> this<00:03:32.739> level<00:03:33.130> is

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
thing about this world and this level is

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.490 
thing about this world and this level is
that<00:03:33.880> there<00:03:34.390> is<00:03:34.450> more<00:03:34.630> than<00:03:34.750> one<00:03:34.810> cannon<00:03:35.350> now

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
that there is more than one cannon now

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.250 
that there is more than one cannon now
in<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.769> game<00:03:35.920> so<00:03:36.489> it<00:03:37.000> gets<00:03:37.510> a<00:03:37.660> bit<00:03:37.690> more

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
in the game so it gets a bit more

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.140 
in the game so it gets a bit more
challenging<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:38.890> harder<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.489> get<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.060> the

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
challenging and harder to get to the

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.819 
challenging and harder to get to the
goal<00:03:40.329> which<00:03:40.840> is<00:03:41.079> which<00:03:41.380> keeps<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:41.769> fun<00:03:41.950> name

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
goal which is which keeps it fun name
