00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
lands in the door of the plane which is

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.490 
lands in the door of the plane which is
a<00:00:44.559> quite<00:00:45.460> good<00:00:45.730> for<00:00:45.940> cuz<00:00:46.210> it's<00:00:46.390> um<00:00:46.629> got<00:00:47.320> high

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
traffic in domination if you start you

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.350 
traffic in domination if you start you
run<00:00:50.019> to<00:00:50.170> see<00:00:50.409> you'll<00:00:50.949> be<00:00:51.129> capping<00:00:51.550> see<00:00:51.940> I<00:00:51.970> think

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
run to see you'll be capping see I think

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.750 
run to see you'll be capping see I think
while<00:00:52.540> you<00:00:52.629> throw<00:00:52.839> and<00:00:53.140> then<00:00:53.290> from<00:00:54.159> be<00:00:54.460> flag

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
while you throw and then from be flag

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.149 
while you throw and then from be flag
they<00:00:55.000> run<00:00:55.210> into<00:00:55.390> it<00:00:55.750> and<00:00:56.019> yeah<00:00:56.680> so<00:00:56.860> it<00:00:56.979> lands
