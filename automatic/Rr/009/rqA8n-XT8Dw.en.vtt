00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.090
 d-block yo people from doomaargamen nice 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.160
 that you all look at again 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.929
 this new video here on my 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.170
 game channel doomaargamen I am welcome you 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.449
 at a minigame called and dare sweet and 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.060
 quite frankly i seriously have none 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.800
 idea what to do in this minigame 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.300
 it 's seemingly crack and I don't know 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.189
 whether I am one and now with and no I am myself 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.660
 no return martens new people dear 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.000
 and apparently you have one 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.710
 and pierced turning you have one and the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.079
 teleport something with you that you 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.000
 Skye Bar and the rest can detect it 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.309
 I seriously have no idea where this is 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.540
 minigame only runs he looked 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.739
 very nice and very much 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.390
 People love but a minigame 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.809
 see it play once so I thought why 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.239
 not 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.070
 lary chronic and the letter go 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.020
 and so far I think it's one 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.879
 nice mini I have really serious yet 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.449
 always no idea what to do if I do 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.370
 be very honest 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.809
 allez i like it very much look me 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.550
 have the idea that everyone actually 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.170
 just one and thin and that's just you 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.120
 only see yourself as normal 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.289
 player at least that's what i think i think 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.579
 meat can take what I have now 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.309
 caught 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.020
 oh top sport I think I have a triple shot 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.510
 but what i think i think we are 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.189
 just everyone like normal how that we do 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.770
 see everyone as and human and all that 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.030
 and and and themselves as a normal PC because me 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.140
 have the idea that too and and and the one 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.390
 you see actually just runs 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.770
 individual player then it appears in 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.240
 at least on and so far I think 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.650
 it's a very funny mini-game for them 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.240
 working week you just have to try the and 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.500
 the human or the player's to get out 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.450
 get through 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.340
 yes with snowballs actually like you 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.020
 can see go but that somewhat free 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.369
 good or I also see that in the circle 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.900
 shot I don't know if I can do that 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.520
 pick it up because I've already picked it up 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.170
 have not picked it up I can pick it up 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.610
 I have to go against spin that is possible someday 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.110
 have to jump into it then you can 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.640
 it turned out to be just winning oh 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.320
 he teleports the sande stage it can 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.909
 I think I can also fool you 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.590
 how he teleports himself every time 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.030
 they got smarter by that is one 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.680
 ship crafting big shot I want that too 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.680
 but this is apparently in idea 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.140
 where you everyone you what I want us 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.770
 first rider you fucking serious white 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.119
 now 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.950
 the very first time I have this one 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.340
 military play in my entire life 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.140
 without any 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.240
 now what i am doing i end up as 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.189
 First you know as a this mini game 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.850
 is boys girls later as a 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.319
 play a game 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.420
 ok boys girls we are one again 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.430
 new game joined by and the love and me 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.080
 think it's a really cool mini game 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.610
 I seriously not at first 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.120
 Expect it to be so cool 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.769
 to play 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.290
 apparently all and the people are you 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.120
 see also room waiter players only where you 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.319
 of course they and people see the same thing 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.940
 applies to the players who the if and 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.200
 dementia the cinema also as one and the 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.970
 people from this one is actually free 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.860
 simple you just have to try to all 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.690
 and undermine mankind through 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.700
 of snowball set up throw there 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.720
 at the same time you can also leave yourself 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.880
 teleport 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.829
 just as naive as to think so far 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.030
 I really enjoyed playing 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.220
 I have to try as much as possible 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.690
 get hold of power-ups and that 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.280
 so i can do it by just being dani 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.500
 power to pick it up where I session 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.670
 lie and I enjoy it yes guys 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.349
 and girls i really hate it 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.849
 nice mini game and I happen to see it there 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.840
 again shit i live at the power your 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.700
 but apparently someone is grabbing 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.720
 otherwise quite fast today but meus 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.099
 So the idea is just not you 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.720
 must try as many power-ups as possible 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.220
 to address the medes and the 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.780
 human or not really the medes 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.519
 and man but your opponents do not 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.049
 so that I think is one 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.370
 bit the whole idea of ​​and the muscle 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.049
 at the same time you also have one 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.940
 or eyes and in your inventory when 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.470
 So you seemingly take yourself everywhere 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.420
 could teleport to it in principle too 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.709
 is very painful and I see see there 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.569
 me again no oh no shit me 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.579
 then teleport myself in the right place 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.019
 only unfortunately I just pressed the 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.519
 which means w key on my keyboard 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.150
 just a step forward 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.310
 put 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.989
 shit boys and girls pokémons girls 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.760
 we are again spawned in a new one 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.590
 sign and this time I'm going right away 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.060
 look around her in the hope that 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.500
 I can find a few of those power-ups 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.660
 what they powered are real 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.919
 hugely handy to have the first time 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.209
 when I play this sign that was too 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.680
 really the first time in a whole life 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.569
 that I play it but also the time 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.459
 first time a this episode what he 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.959
 somewhat pretty logical mike but then 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.370
 I grabbed a lot of those power-ups 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.470
 on through so on one or another 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.609
 way really much better than that it went 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.720
 previous jar g and that has 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.459
 probably just the fact 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.750
 that with those power-ups you are professional 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.010
 can shoot balls at the same time 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.299
 so I'm going to see if I will 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.109
 maybe some power-ups too 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.120
 get hold of 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.470
 i seriously don't know we already ipowerup themselves 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.209
 that will be a bit tomorrow 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.530
 randomly distributed throughout the folder 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.060
 but eh I'll want at least equally 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.379
 look if I find them I'm going to 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.400
 of course grab the same because those things 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.689
 are just very handy 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.129
 to have almost honest in it so go 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.230
 just walk around of course 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:18.579
 I have to keep a good watch out and 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.169
 otherwise I naturally do not fall what what I 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.820
 just wanted to say ok let's continue 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.979
 to the next game but apparently 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.979
 I still live I could not 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.850
 seriously okay i go the eyes of and the 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.380
 no longer use when I am at all 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.669
 becomes plateau I am using that from 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.960
 now just invite now I am there 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.090
 just literally died 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.830
 okay us girls let 's hope powder 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.479
 this time just a tad better holes 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.310
 it just got that it just went 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.660
 also not very bad or something like that 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.550
 and I just have to be careful 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.320
 when I use my eyes or through 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.400
 the us I help myself to the death 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.320
 in holly of course not the intention 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.060
 make sure i am just very sorry 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.740
 good at watching that I just go 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.250
 try to remove all and the people from me 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.050
 to hold 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.130
 what actually just boring player 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.660
 You probably know that too 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.830
 in the beginning i actually thought it 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.210
 just a kind of single player 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.099
 minigame bots where the have come 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.330
 try to get as much of that one as possible 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:05.530
 killing people 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.270
 apparently it is really just one 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.530
 multiplayer minigame and you see the 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.150
 players as and the human being which means you 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.680
 actually thinks it is real and the 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.090
 create humanity in it and all of whole 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.380
 original mini games i didn't have 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.770
 expect that one day they would play a mini-game 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.990
 to make 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.460
 Perry yes yes a kind of no big 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.410
 shot I'll have a big shot or something 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.970
 like that oh well fun in everyone 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.169
 case no power effective even though the 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.639
 apparently so neat power 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.050
 I did not even through to the other 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.280
 but it was apparently so I go 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.840
 certain things would not go there 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.220
 teleporting I never saw anyone like that 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.180
 try and even though it did not 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.770
 the right way so that 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.630
 died so I just watch out 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.310
 what risks I take and I watch 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.020
 also good for which I am taking my risks 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.460
 take it for power I am not going too 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.409
 take a big risk 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.880
 buckaroo i have a big shot now and i 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:44.590
 still don't know what it is but me 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.940
 will be able to use anywhere 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.539
 I see some power there the light that 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.250
 Besides 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.570
