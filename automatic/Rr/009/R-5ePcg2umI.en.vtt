there but up so but I just a bush you
just<00:05:48.370> if<00:05:48.460> you<00:05:48.580> take<00:05:49.360> up<00:05:49.510> a<00:05:49.600> secondary<00:05:49.900> then

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
just if you take up a secondary then

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.120 
just if you take up a secondary then
then<00:05:52.870> the<00:05:52.930> class<00:05:53.110> is<00:05:53.230> just<00:05:53.380> way<00:05:53.830> better<00:05:53.980> in

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
then the class is just way better in

00:05:54.130 --> 00:06:01.740 
then the class is just way better in
just<00:05:55.030> way<00:05:55.150> better<00:05:55.330> already<00:05:59.310> bottom<00:06:00.630> since<00:06:01.630> I

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
just way better already bottom since I

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.030 
just way better already bottom since I
have<00:06:01.900> a<00:06:01.930> couple<00:06:02.230> of<00:06:02.350> minutes<00:06:02.440> left<00:06:02.770> and<00:06:02.920> I

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.420 
haven't basically talked about the class

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.420 
haven't basically talked about the class
and<00:06:04.570> he<00:06:04.660> sorta<00:06:05.020> class<00:06:05.320> in<00:06:05.560> this<00:06:05.680> part<00:06:06.220> of<00:06:06.280> the

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
and he sorta class in this part of the

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.720 
and he sorta class in this part of the
video<00:06:06.640> and<00:06:07.210> how<00:06:07.360> he<00:06:07.420> set<00:06:07.630> it<00:06:07.720> up<00:06:08.100> I<00:06:09.100> was<00:06:09.610> just

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
video and how he set it up I was just

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.010 
video and how he set it up I was just
gonna<00:06:09.820> be<00:06:10.030> thinking<00:06:10.300> I<00:06:10.360> would<00:06:10.420> would<00:06:10.900> be

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
gonna be thinking I would would be

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.420 
gonna be thinking I would would be
talking<00:06:11.290> about<00:06:11.380> a<00:06:11.530> little<00:06:11.770> bit<00:06:11.920> on<00:06:12.070> what<00:06:12.130> I

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
talking about a little bit on what I

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.860 
talking about a little bit on what I
think<00:06:12.730> about<00:06:12.760> black<00:06:13.060> ops<00:06:13.090> do<00:06:13.300> so<00:06:13.450> far

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
think about black ops do so far

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.320 
think about black ops do so far
boy<00:06:15.260> I<00:06:15.650> think<00:06:16.100> it's<00:06:16.250> a<00:06:16.340> pretty<00:06:16.490> good<00:06:16.820> game<00:06:17.030> i

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
boy I think it's a pretty good game i

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.010 
boy I think it's a pretty good game i
like<00:06:17.690> i<00:06:18.020> love<00:06:18.590> how<00:06:18.980> balanced<00:06:19.730> it<00:06:19.850> is<00:06:20.020> they

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
like i love how balanced it is they

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.410 
like i love how balanced it is they
really<00:06:21.170> did<00:06:21.530> a<00:06:21.590> great<00:06:21.740> job<00:06:21.920> balancing<00:06:22.310> it<00:06:22.760> so

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:23.420 
really did a great job balancing it so

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:24.790 
really did a great job balancing it so
far<00:06:23.660> it's<00:06:23.720> also<00:06:23.930> they<00:06:24.170> don't<00:06:24.320> do<00:06:24.440> like<00:06:24.620> black

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
far it's also they don't do like black

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.930 
far it's also they don't do like black
ops<00:06:24.980> one<00:06:25.100> day<00:06:25.190> I'd<00:06:25.250> rather<00:06:25.400> try<00:06:25.670> to<00:06:25.730> balance

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
ops one day I'd rather try to balance

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.820 
ops one day I'd rather try to balance
out<00:06:26.300> a<00:06:26.330> gun<00:06:26.570> and<00:06:26.630> every<00:06:27.080> gun<00:06:27.230> fells<00:06:27.500> like<00:06:27.620> the

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
out a gun and every gun fells like the

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.190 
out a gun and every gun fells like the
same<00:06:28.040> I<00:06:28.390> haven't<00:06:29.390> had<00:06:29.450> a<00:06:29.510> problem<00:06:29.750> yet<00:06:29.990> I<00:06:30.140> still

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
same I haven't had a problem yet I still

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.860 
same I haven't had a problem yet I still
think<00:06:30.650> like<00:06:30.860> the<00:06:31.640> guns<00:06:31.880> still<00:06:32.270> feel<00:06:32.720> a<00:06:32.750> little

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
think like the guns still feel a little

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.320 
think like the guns still feel a little
saying<00:06:33.260> just<00:06:33.530> look<00:06:33.710> there<00:06:33.950> UAV<00:06:34.340> UVs<00:06:34.940> is<00:06:35.090> just

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
saying just look there UAV UVs is just

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.900 
saying just look there UAV UVs is just
like<00:06:35.480> a<00:06:36.280> ground<00:06:37.280> war<00:06:37.400> it's<00:06:37.580> pretty<00:06:38.030> good<00:06:39.850> as<00:06:40.850> a

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910 
like a ground war it's pretty good as a

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.180 
like a ground war it's pretty good as a
damn<00:06:41.270> like<00:06:41.960> a<00:06:41.990> balance<00:06:42.380> of<00:06:42.440> shit<00:06:42.650> but<00:06:42.980> it's

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
damn like a balance of shit but it's

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.590 
damn like a balance of shit but it's
just<00:06:43.340> like<00:06:43.490> that's<00:06:43.700> kind<00:06:44.090> of<00:06:44.180> like<00:06:44.270> over

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
just like that's kind of like over

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.060 
just like that's kind of like over
bounds<00:06:44.900> but<00:06:44.990> the<00:06:45.080> whole<00:06:45.200> the<00:06:45.290> guns<00:06:45.470> all<00:06:45.650> feel

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
bounds but the whole the guns all feel

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.820 
bounds but the whole the guns all feel
the<00:06:46.190> same<00:06:46.220> I<00:06:46.610> mean<00:06:46.940> like<00:06:47.540> the<00:06:47.960> mp7<00:06:48.200> feet<00:06:48.710> is

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
the same I mean like the mp7 feet is

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.630 
the same I mean like the mp7 feet is
different<00:06:49.130> from<00:06:49.850> the<00:06:50.000> pd<00:06:50.650> pdw-57<00:06:51.650> and<00:06:52.310> the

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:52.640 
different from the pd pdw-57 and the

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.880 
different from the pd pdw-57 and the
vector<00:06:53.090> and<00:06:53.450> write<00:06:53.660> hey<00:06:53.780> I<00:06:53.810> just<00:06:53.960> have<00:06:54.320> so<00:06:54.500> bad

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:54.890 
vector and write hey I just have so bad

00:06:54.890 --> 00:07:00.190 
vector and write hey I just have so bad
luck<00:06:55.070> with<00:06:55.190> a<00:06:55.250> guy<00:06:55.400> with<00:06:56.470> worms<00:06:57.470> nothing<00:06:59.200> and

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.200 
luck with a guy with worms nothing and

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:07.750 
luck with a guy with worms nothing and
every<00:07:00.890> so<00:07:01.580> I<00:07:02.470> am<00:07:03.940> as<00:07:04.940> I<00:07:05.120> was<00:07:05.210> saying<00:07:05.240> that<00:07:06.760> but

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:07.760 
every so I am as I was saying that but

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.120 
every so I am as I was saying that but
uh<00:07:07.820> the<00:07:08.690> whole<00:07:08.780> thing<00:07:08.990> advanced<00:07:09.290> stuff<00:07:09.800> it's

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.130 
uh the whole thing advanced stuff it's

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.830 
uh the whole thing advanced stuff it's
pretty<00:07:10.700> good<00:07:11.030> confirm<00:07:12.250> but<00:07:13.250> a<00:07:13.450> big<00:07:14.450> problem

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 
pretty good confirm but a big problem

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.600 
pretty good confirm but a big problem
that<00:07:14.960> a<00:07:14.990> lot<00:07:15.080> of<00:07:15.290> people<00:07:15.350> have<00:07:15.620> is<00:07:15.860> to<00:07:16.070> like<00:07:16.280> and

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:16.610 
that a lot of people have is to like and

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.390 
that a lot of people have is to like and
we<00:07:16.850> like<00:07:17.480> I<00:07:18.200> also<00:07:18.380> heard<00:07:18.560> hit<00:07:18.890> detection<00:07:19.070> I

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 
we like I also heard hit detection I

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.560 
we like I also heard hit detection I
really<00:07:19.610> think<00:07:19.790> that<00:07:19.940> a<00:07:19.970> fit<00:07:20.180> detection<00:07:20.480> is

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:20.570 
really think that a fit detection is

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.510 
really think that a fit detection is
actually<00:07:20.810> better<00:07:21.050> again<00:07:21.380> war<00:07:21.560> machine<00:07:21.890> for

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:22.520 
actually better again war machine for

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.550 
actually better again war machine for
the<00:07:22.550> lag<00:07:22.970> is<00:07:23.210> of<00:07:23.420> course<00:07:23.630> a<00:07:23.810> big<00:07:23.960> problem<00:07:24.380> here

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 
the lag is of course a big problem here

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.310 
the lag is of course a big problem here
and<00:07:24.740> again<00:07:25.640> I<00:07:25.940> think<00:07:26.600> there's<00:07:26.750> some<00:07:26.900> problems

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:27.320 
and again I think there's some problems

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.090 
and again I think there's some problems
when<00:07:27.440> like<00:07:27.920> when<00:07:27.950> the<00:07:28.160> game<00:07:28.310> launches<00:07:29.800> so<00:07:30.800> just

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:31.100 
when like when the game launches so just

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.650 
when like when the game launches so just
like<00:07:31.220> when<00:07:31.340> it<00:07:31.430> launches<00:07:31.730> its<00:07:31.790> just<00:07:32.090> a<00:07:32.270> bunch

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:32.660 
like when it launches its just a bunch

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.300 
like when it launches its just a bunch
of<00:07:32.750> problems<00:07:32.960> with<00:07:33.200> it<00:07:33.500> but<00:07:33.920> because<00:07:33.980> they

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:34.310 
of problems with it but because they

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.300 
of problems with it but because they
hopefully<00:07:34.760> always<00:07:35.180> launch<00:07:35.420> arm<00:07:35.950> not<00:07:36.950> finished

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:37.310 
hopefully always launch arm not finished

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.220 
hopefully always launch arm not finished
product<00:07:37.640> it<00:07:37.790> always<00:07:38.120> let<00:07:38.300> it<00:07:38.720> needs<00:07:38.930> a<00:07:39.080> couple

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:39.230 
product it always let it needs a couple

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.110 
product it always let it needs a couple
of<00:07:39.380> months<00:07:39.800> with<00:07:40.040> pastors<00:07:40.490> and<00:07:40.670> stuff<00:07:40.850> to

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 
of months with pastors and stuff to

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.360 
of months with pastors and stuff to
actually<00:07:41.390> become<00:07:41.780> a<00:07:41.930> finished<00:07:42.830> product<00:07:43.070> and

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:43.370 
actually become a finished product and

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.580 
actually become a finished product and
that<00:07:43.480> is<00:07:44.480> always<00:07:44.900> something<00:07:45.170> that's<00:07:45.350> a<00:07:45.560> bit

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:45.590 
that is always something that's a bit

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.080 
that is always something that's a bit
everything<00:07:46.130> but<00:07:46.370> you<00:07:46.610> know<00:07:46.700> we<00:07:46.790> should<00:07:46.940> get

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.090 
everything but you know we should get

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.420 
everything but you know we should get
used<00:07:47.300> to<00:07:47.390> be<00:07:47.450> brought<00:07:47.600> down<00:07:47.750> but<00:07:48.080> I'm<00:07:48.430> yep
