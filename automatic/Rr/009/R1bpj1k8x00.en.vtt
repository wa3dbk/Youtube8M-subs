00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
bottom that the cross or the grooves

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.789 
bottom that the cross or the grooves
it's<00:01:26.490> like<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> breach<00:01:27.659> like<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.320> lettering

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799

and<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.850> pulls<00:01:30.119> back<00:01:30.390> because<00:01:30.810> most<00:01:31.380> number

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
and it pulls back because most number

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.560 
and it pulls back because most number
two<00:01:31.890> sections<00:01:32.490> what<00:01:32.729> we'll<00:01:32.939> all<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.299> pole<00:01:33.479> all

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
two sections what we'll all the pole all

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.560 
two sections what we'll all the pole all
the<00:01:33.630> way<00:01:33.750> down<00:01:34.850> doesn't<00:01:35.850> run<00:01:36.000> parallel

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the way down doesn't run parallel

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.990 
the way down doesn't run parallel
slightly<00:01:36.930> gets<00:01:37.110> wider<00:01:37.380> now<00:01:38.009> wage<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
slightly gets wider now wage on the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.170 
slightly gets wider now wage on the
bottom<00:01:39.979> I'll<00:01:40.979> show<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.220> simply<00:01:41.759> put<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.090> on
