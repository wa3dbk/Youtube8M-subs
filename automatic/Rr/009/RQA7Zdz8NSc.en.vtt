battle<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.069> collector<00:02:20.730> units<00:02:21.560> anyways<00:02:22.560> so

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
battle of the collector units anyways so

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.720 
battle of the collector units anyways so
looks<00:02:24.840> like<00:02:24.950> identity<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:26.069> zealous<00:02:26.400> ghana's

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
looks like identity of zealous ghana's

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.880 
looks like identity of zealous ghana's
gasta<00:02:27.209> be<00:02:27.510> sooo<00:02:27.690> getting<00:02:27.959> a<00:02:28.019> quick<00:02:28.260> expansion

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
gasta be sooo getting a quick expansion

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.240 
gasta be sooo getting a quick expansion
there<00:02:29.069> this<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.030> low-key<00:02:30.510> too<00:02:30.690> by<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.930> way

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
there this is low-key too by the way

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.339 
there this is low-key too by the way
them<00:02:32.250> it's<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.910> map<00:02:33.120> with<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:34.080> can<00:02:34.200> see

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
them it's a map with that you can see

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.729 
them it's a map with that you can see
the<00:02:34.500> kind<00:02:34.800> of<00:02:34.830> expansion<00:02:35.610> below<00:02:36.530> behind<00:02:37.530> your

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
the kind of expansion below behind your

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.710 
the kind of expansion below behind your
main<00:02:37.890> base<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:38.700> it's<00:02:38.849> easy<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.150> take<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.540> one

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
main base so it's easy to take that one

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.130 
main base so it's easy to take that one
because<00:02:39.900> it's<00:02:40.200> pretty<00:02:40.800> protected<00:02:41.900> where<00:02:42.900> and

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
because it's pretty protected where and

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.590 
because it's pretty protected where and
there's<00:02:43.260> also<00:02:43.410> another<00:02:43.590> natural<00:02:43.980> expansion

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
there's also another natural expansion

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.150 
there's also another natural expansion
outside<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.690> your<00:02:45.810> main<00:02:45.989> base<00:02:46.200> below<00:02:46.680> kind<00:02:47.100> of

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
outside of your main base below kind of

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.100 
outside of your main base below kind of
down<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.519> ramp<00:02:47.760> but<00:02:48.540> um<00:02:48.980> that's<00:02:50.840> it's<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.930> lot

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
down that ramp but um that's it's a lot

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.539 
down that ramp but um that's it's a lot
more<00:02:52.140> difficult<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.680> hold<00:02:52.830> especially<00:02:53.340> since

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
more difficult to hold especially since

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:54.860 
more difficult to hold especially since
there's<00:02:53.790> actually<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.180> little<00:02:54.299> bit<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.660> back

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
there's actually a little bit of a back

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.559 
there's actually a little bit of a back
door<00:02:55.140> there<00:02:55.489> its<00:02:56.489> width<00:02:56.670> at<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:56.940> spawn<00:02:57.299> points

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
door there its width at the spawn points

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.600 
door there its width at the spawn points
are<00:02:57.630> actually<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.900> little<00:02:57.989> bit<00:02:58.370> dissimilar<00:02:59.370> in

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
are actually a little bit dissimilar in

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.030 
are actually a little bit dissimilar in
the<00:03:00.120> top<00:03:00.299> right<00:03:00.540> corner<00:03:00.750> that<00:03:01.470> expansion

the top right corner that expansion

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.309 
the top right corner that expansion
there's<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.489> back<00:03:02.700> door<00:03:02.730> but<00:03:03.209> it's<00:03:03.420> it's<00:03:03.989> easier

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
there's a back door but it's it's easier

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.259 
there's a back door but it's it's easier
to<00:03:04.440> hold<00:03:04.560> their<00:03:04.799> your<00:03:05.130> natural<00:03:05.790> for<00:03:06.120> this

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
to hold their your natural for this

to hold their your natural for this
bottom<00:03:06.660> left<00:03:06.840> corner<00:03:06.989> spawn<00:03:08.299> it<00:03:09.299> just<00:03:09.630> kind<00:03:09.780> of

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
bottom left corner spawn it just kind of

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.979 
bottom left corner spawn it just kind of
works<00:03:10.019> out<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.170> way<00:03:10.730> strangely<00:03:11.730> enough

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
works out that way strangely enough

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.809 
works out that way strangely enough
anyways<00:03:12.989> be<00:03:13.590> sooo<00:03:13.769> getting<00:03:14.040> is<00:03:14.130> gas<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.610> little

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
anyways be sooo getting is gas a little

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.810 
anyways be sooo getting is gas a little
bit<00:03:15.030> later<00:03:15.329> because<00:03:15.570> he's<00:03:15.870> got<00:03:16.049> that<00:03:16.290> um<00:03:16.820> that

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
bit later because he's got that um that

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.849 
bit later because he's got that um that
Nexus<00:03:18.359> down<00:03:18.570> in<00:03:18.750> his<00:03:18.870> natural<00:03:19.049> expansion<00:03:19.500> but

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
Nexus down in his natural expansion but

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.020 
Nexus down in his natural expansion but
obviously<00:03:20.160> that's<00:03:20.400> going<00:03:20.549> to<00:03:20.640> be<00:03:20.760> an

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
obviously that's going to be an

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.660 
obviously that's going to be an
advantage<00:03:21.329> for<00:03:21.540> later<00:03:21.840> on<00:03:22.019> zillow's<00:03:22.739> matching

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
getting his command center usually this

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.910 
getting his command center usually this
map<00:03:26.819> ends<00:03:27.090> up<00:03:27.299> being<00:03:27.510> really<00:03:28.350> really<00:03:28.590> long

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
map ends up being really really long

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.970 
map ends up being really really long
games<00:03:29.359> because<00:03:30.359> of<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.930> fact<00:03:31.170> that<00:03:31.380> there<00:03:31.950> are

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
games because of the fact that there are

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.009 
games because of the fact that there are
there<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.519> mean<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.790> have<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:33.120> easy<00:03:33.569> to<00:03:33.840> take

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
there I mean you have to easy to take

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.140 
there I mean you have to easy to take
expansions<00:03:34.739> you<00:03:34.980> get<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.220> lot<00:03:35.370> of<00:03:35.400> resources<00:03:35.790> in

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
expansions you get a lot of resources in

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.800 
expansions you get a lot of resources in
pretty<00:03:36.450> quick<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:38.030> so<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.150> make<00:03:39.299> games<00:03:39.510> right

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
pretty quick and so the make games right

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.740 
pretty quick and so the make games right
or<00:03:39.959> wrong<00:03:42.319> although<00:03:43.319> we<00:03:43.620> did<00:03:43.769> see<00:03:43.980> a<00:03:44.480> game<00:03:45.480> on

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
or wrong although we did see a game on

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.140 
or wrong although we did see a game on
this<00:03:45.959> map<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.709> couple<00:03:47.459> days<00:03:47.609> ago<00:03:47.639> that<00:03:48.000> was

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
this map a couple days ago that was

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.690 
this map a couple days ago that was
three<00:03:48.930> minutes<00:03:49.109> and<00:03:49.500> about<00:03:49.859> ten<00:03:50.100> seconds<00:03:50.489> long

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
three minutes and about ten seconds long

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.690 
three minutes and about ten seconds long
so<00:03:50.940> you<00:03:51.329> know<00:03:51.420> it's<00:03:51.780> all<00:03:51.900> relative<00:03:52.440> so<00:03:53.310> zealous

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
so you know it's all relative so zealous

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.449 
so you know it's all relative so zealous
putting<00:03:54.660> out<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.750> bunker<00:03:55.139> there<00:03:55.290> that's<00:03:56.190> pretty

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
putting out a bunker there that's pretty

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.970 
putting out a bunker there that's pretty
good<00:03:56.549> move<00:03:56.730> on<00:03:56.819> his<00:03:56.970> part<00:03:57.139> and<00:03:58.139> that's<00:03:58.769> just

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
good move on his part and that's just

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.319 
good move on his part and that's just
why<00:03:59.190> I<00:03:59.220> say<00:03:59.459> like<00:03:59.670> he's<00:03:59.819> been<00:03:59.940> playing<00:04:00.150> with<00:04:00.239> a

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
why I say like he's been playing with a

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.000 
why I say like he's been playing with a
lot<00:04:00.480> in<00:04:00.750> general<00:04:01.139> you<00:04:01.230> see<00:04:01.500> him<00:04:01.590> making<00:04:01.859> that

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
lot in general you see him making that

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.080 
lot in general you see him making that
kind<00:04:02.310> of<00:04:02.400> move<00:04:02.870> and<00:04:04.160> putting<00:04:05.160> just<00:04:05.489> like

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
kind of move and putting just like

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.059 
kind of move and putting just like
really<00:04:06.420> really<00:04:06.510> smart<00:04:07.019> basically<00:04:07.620> in<00:04:07.739> general

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
really really smart basically in general

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.670 
really really smart basically in general
playing<00:04:08.280> really<00:04:08.519> intelligently<00:04:09.560> gaining<00:04:10.560> a

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
bunker down in case pc was getting some

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.150 
bunker down in case pc was getting some
more<00:04:13.079> zealots<00:04:13.410> or<00:04:13.530> something<00:04:13.799> like<00:04:13.920> that<00:04:13.980> that

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
is skipping that choke all together okay

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.249 
is skipping that choke all together okay
he's<00:06:03.550> following<00:06:03.909> those<00:06:04.030> units<00:06:04.389> he<00:06:04.719> has<00:06:04.930> skin

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:05.259 
he's following those units he has skin

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.999 
he's following those units he has skin
so<00:06:05.440> he's<00:06:05.530> able<00:06:05.680> to<00:06:05.830> track<00:06:06.099> down<00:06:06.310> that<00:06:06.370> that<00:06:07.120> um

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:08.009 
so he's able to track down that that um

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:11.070 
so he's able to track down that that um
zealot<00:06:09.009> there<00:06:09.219> okay<00:06:10.000> so<00:06:10.060> it<00:06:10.270> looks<00:06:10.330> like<00:06:10.539> bc<00:06:11.020> is

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
zealot there okay so it looks like bc is

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.540 
zealot there okay so it looks like bc is
actually<00:06:11.409> just<00:06:11.500> going<00:06:11.650> to<00:06:11.740> bet<00:06:11.949> on<00:06:12.159> getting

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
actually just going to bet on getting

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.550 
actually just going to bet on getting
that<00:06:12.669> robotics<00:06:13.180> miss<00:06:13.330> Lily<00:06:13.539> out<00:06:13.690> and<00:06:13.900> holding

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
that robotics miss Lily out and holding

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.129 
that robotics miss Lily out and holding
his<00:06:14.680> ramp<00:06:14.889> until<00:06:15.370> he<00:06:16.090> gets<00:06:16.300> I<00:06:16.509> mean<00:06:16.780> getting

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:17.139 
his ramp until he gets I mean getting

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:18.899 
his ramp until he gets I mean getting
the<00:06:17.199> rear<00:06:17.889> out<00:06:18.069> he's<00:06:18.219> going<00:06:18.370> to<00:06:18.430> try<00:06:18.610> and<00:06:18.639> hold

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909 
the rear out he's going to try and hold

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:20.249 
the rear out he's going to try and hold
his<00:06:19.090> ramp<00:06:19.270> until<00:06:19.569> I<00:06:19.599> guess<00:06:19.750> that<00:06:19.900> because<00:06:20.110> he's

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:20.259 
his ramp until I guess that because he's

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:24.890 
his ramp until I guess that because he's
not<00:06:20.440> cancelled<00:06:21.039> that<00:06:21.610> Nexus<00:06:22.419> um<00:06:23.039> at<00:06:24.039> all<00:06:24.310> um

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
not cancelled that Nexus um at all um

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.600 
not cancelled that Nexus um at all um
and<00:06:25.900> wow<00:06:26.409> just<00:06:26.710> looking<00:06:26.949> at<00:06:27.039> the<00:06:27.099> map<00:06:27.250> i<00:06:27.400> miss

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
and wow just looking at the map i miss

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.709 
and wow just looking at the map i miss
been<00:06:27.789> thinking<00:06:28.060> another<00:06:28.240> map<00:06:28.449> because

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719 
been thinking another map because

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:29.820 
been thinking another map because
apparently<00:06:29.050> there's<00:06:29.319> not<00:06:29.440> a<00:06:29.469> back<00:06:29.650> door

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
apparently there's not a back door

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.260 
apparently there's not a back door
either<00:06:30.009> after<00:06:30.520> i<00:06:30.550> was<00:06:30.789> thinking<00:06:31.120> of<00:06:31.180> something

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
either after i was thinking of something

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.810 
either after i was thinking of something
else<00:06:31.479> it<00:06:32.080> is<00:06:32.229> the<00:06:32.349> other<00:06:32.469> loci<00:06:32.860> but<00:06:33.610> it<00:06:33.699> does

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:33.820 
else it is the other loci but it does

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:34.610 
else it is the other loci but it does
have<00:06:34.000> some<00:06:34.210> fortunate

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
have some fortunate

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.010 
have some fortunate
so<00:06:34.949> he<00:06:35.040> might<00:06:35.220> be<00:06:35.370> able<00:06:35.430> to<00:06:35.550> hold<00:06:35.669> this<00:06:35.820> up<00:06:36.020> for

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
so he might be able to hold this up for

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.110 
so he might be able to hold this up for
52<00:06:37.320> goods<00:06:37.530> and<00:06:37.740> Azad<00:06:37.979> are<00:06:38.250> going<00:06:38.400> to<00:06:38.460> do<00:06:38.639> okay

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
52 goods and Azad are going to do okay

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.300 
52 goods and Azad are going to do okay
against<00:06:39.510> those<00:06:39.630> especially<00:06:40.560> if<00:06:40.860> he<00:06:40.979> yeah<00:06:41.160> if

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
against those especially if he yeah if

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.850 
against those especially if he yeah if
he<00:06:41.430> could<00:06:41.580> pick<00:06:41.699> those<00:06:41.910> off<00:06:42.060> Wow<00:06:42.710> picking<00:06:43.710> off

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
he could pick those off Wow picking off

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.469 
he could pick those off Wow picking off
the<00:06:43.889> Marines<00:06:44.280> he's<00:06:44.699> wearing<00:06:45.090> his<00:06:45.150> Marines

away trying to get up to the upper
ground<00:06:46.979> but<00:06:47.550> in<00:06:47.669> the<00:06:47.729> meantime<00:06:47.910> as<00:06:48.210> medics<00:06:48.570> are

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
ground but in the meantime as medics are

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.719 
ground but in the meantime as medics are
not<00:06:48.810> healing<00:06:49.020> them<00:06:49.260> and<00:06:49.440> that's<00:06:49.560> all<00:06:49.889> that's

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:50.729 
not healing them and that's all that's

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:53.409 
not healing them and that's all that's
it's<00:06:51.180> absolutely<00:06:51.870> horrible<00:06:52.320> for<00:06:52.590> his<00:06:52.680> hours

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:53.419 
it's absolutely horrible for his hours

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:56.330 
it's absolutely horrible for his hours
his<00:06:54.419> whole<00:06:54.720> pushed<00:06:55.050> well<00:06:55.440> that<00:06:55.919> little<00:06:56.040> push

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
his whole pushed well that little push

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.159 
his whole pushed well that little push
there<00:06:56.580> has<00:06:56.790> just<00:06:56.850> been<00:06:57.169> basically

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:58.169 
there has just been basically

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:00.110 
there has just been basically
counteracted<00:06:58.830> because<00:06:59.040> he<00:06:59.130> didn't<00:06:59.370> he<00:06:59.940> had<00:06:59.970> a

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
counteracted because he didn't he had a

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.070 
counteracted because he didn't he had a
few<00:07:00.419> too<00:07:01.380> few<00:07:01.850> units<00:07:02.850> there<00:07:03.180> and<00:07:03.540> he<00:07:03.780> wasn't

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
few too few units there and he wasn't

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.600 
few too few units there and he wasn't
able<00:07:04.169> to<00:07:04.350> engage<00:07:04.710> directly<00:07:05.070> but<00:07:05.370> in<00:07:05.520> the

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:05.610 
able to engage directly but in the

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.010 
able to engage directly but in the
meantime<00:07:05.760> he's<00:07:06.060> actually<00:07:06.240> I<00:07:06.510> mean<00:07:06.720> otherwise

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 
meantime he's actually I mean otherwise

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.990 
meantime he's actually I mean otherwise
he's<00:07:07.440> wasting<00:07:08.070> his<00:07:08.100> units<00:07:08.490> by<00:07:08.610> just<00:07:08.820> running

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
he's wasting his units by just running

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.370 
he's wasting his units by just running
away<00:07:09.210> and<00:07:09.300> letting<00:07:09.660> him<00:07:09.750> get<00:07:09.870> picked<00:07:10.110> off<00:07:10.229> like

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 
away and letting him get picked off like

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.210 
away and letting him get picked off like
that<00:07:10.620> and<00:07:10.889> now<00:07:11.340> bc<00:07:11.900> bc<00:07:12.900> when<00:07:13.260> getting<00:07:14.010> that

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.220 
that and now bc bc when getting that

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.790 
that and now bc bc when getting that
Observatory<00:07:14.639> so<00:07:15.260> he's<00:07:16.260> probably<00:07:16.410> getting<00:07:16.620> a

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 
Observatory so he's probably getting a

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.590 
Observatory so he's probably getting a
river<00:07:17.070> all<00:07:17.160> right<00:07:17.340> now<00:07:17.490> Wow<00:07:18.000> because<00:07:18.360> else

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600 
river all right now Wow because else

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.750 
river all right now Wow because else
does<00:07:18.810> have<00:07:18.960> a<00:07:18.990> lot<00:07:19.199> of<00:07:19.229> range<00:07:19.530> though<00:07:19.760> maybe

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:20.760 
does have a lot of range though maybe

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.400 
does have a lot of range though maybe
that's<00:07:20.850> I<00:07:21.150> guess<00:07:21.300> we<00:07:21.479> was<00:07:21.630> hoping<00:07:21.900> for<00:07:21.930> keep

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:22.410 
that's I guess we was hoping for keep

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.290 
that's I guess we was hoping for keep
those<00:07:22.560> medics<00:07:22.979> alive<00:07:23.220> to<00:07:23.460> work<00:07:23.639> with<00:07:24.150> those

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300 
those medics alive to work with those

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.350 
those medics alive to work with those
Marines<00:07:24.630> and<00:07:24.870> yeah<00:07:25.860> so<00:07:26.190> without<00:07:26.940> the<00:07:27.150> river

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 
Marines and yeah so without the river

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.760 
Marines and yeah so without the river
those<00:07:27.690> those<00:07:27.990> goons<00:07:28.229> are<00:07:28.440> going<00:07:28.590> to<00:07:28.650> get

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:28.770 
those those goons are going to get

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.279 
those those goons are going to get
scared<00:07:29.070> off<00:07:29.190> by<00:07:29.400> those<00:07:29.580> reeds<00:07:30.330> that<00:07:30.449> met

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:31.289 
scared off by those reeds that met

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:33.820 
scared off by those reeds that met
greens<00:07:31.620> are<00:07:31.860> pretty<00:07:32.460> damn<00:07:32.639> decent<00:07:32.940> against

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:33.830 
greens are pretty damn decent against

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.730 
greens are pretty damn decent against
dragoons<00:07:34.830> if<00:07:35.430> if<00:07:36.000> like<00:07:36.510> I<00:07:36.720> mean<00:07:36.960> obviously<00:07:37.320> if

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 
dragoons if if like I mean obviously if

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.050 
dragoons if if like I mean obviously if
you<00:07:37.860> can<00:07:37.979> have<00:07:38.130> the<00:07:38.250> medics<00:07:38.520> actually<00:07:38.849> healing

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060 
you can have the medics actually healing

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.670 
you can have the medics actually healing
them<00:07:39.330> and<00:07:39.840> that<00:07:39.990> was<00:07:40.080> the<00:07:40.169> main<00:07:40.320> problem

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 
them and that was the main problem

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.050 
them and that was the main problem
there's<00:07:40.860> what<00:07:41.310> he<00:07:41.370> was<00:07:41.490> running<00:07:41.550> away<00:07:41.700> as<00:07:41.849> they

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:42.060 
there's what he was running away as they

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.730 
there's what he was running away as they
weren't<00:07:42.240> healing<00:07:42.630> at<00:07:42.780> all<00:07:42.900> and<00:07:43.200> really<00:07:43.710> I

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740 
weren't healing at all and really I

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.810 
weren't healing at all and really I
think<00:07:43.800> this<00:07:44.039> all<00:07:44.130> should<00:07:44.430> have<00:07:44.520> turned<00:07:44.639> around

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:44.820 
think this all should have turned around

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.330 
think this all should have turned around
and<00:07:45.150> at<00:07:45.539> least<00:07:45.720> gotten<00:07:46.620> a<00:07:46.710> few<00:07:46.830> hits<00:07:47.039> and<00:07:47.250> in

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:47.340 
and at least gotten a few hits and in

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.800 
and at least gotten a few hits and in
trying<00:07:47.490> to<00:07:47.610> take<00:07:47.789> out<00:07:47.940> one<00:07:48.180> of<00:07:48.210> those<00:07:48.389> students

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:48.810 
trying to take out one of those students

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.410 
trying to take out one of those students
or<00:07:48.960> something<00:07:49.229> like<00:07:49.349> that
