00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:05.029 
so in this video we are gonna build off

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:06.370 
so in this video we are gonna build off
the<00:00:05.210> last<00:00:05.390> one<00:00:05.630> where<00:00:05.779> we<00:00:05.899> were<00:00:05.990> talking<00:00:06.290> about

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:06.380 
the last one where we were talking about

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.710 
the last one where we were talking about
half<00:00:06.680> steps<00:00:07.010> and<00:00:07.130> whole<00:00:07.220> steps<00:00:07.370> and<00:00:07.880> now<00:00:08.450> we're

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:08.720 
half steps and whole steps and now we're

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.770 
half steps and whole steps and now we're
gonna<00:00:08.840> use<00:00:09.110> that<00:00:09.320> to<00:00:09.380> start<00:00:09.769> building<00:00:10.010> chords

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
gonna use that to start building chords

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.800 
gonna use that to start building chords
first<00:00:11.780> I<00:00:11.960> want<00:00:12.110> to<00:00:12.140> talk<00:00:12.350> about<00:00:12.500> major<00:00:12.890> chords

compared<00:00:28.009> to<00:00:28.070> this<00:00:28.220> your<00:00:28.460> C<00:00:28.669> major<00:00:29.019> here's<00:00:30.019> C

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:30.319 
compared to this your C major here's C

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:37.350 
compared to this your C major here's C
minor<00:00:31.899> so<00:00:32.899> happy<00:00:33.320> vs.<00:00:33.739> sad<00:00:34.730> or<00:00:35.060> sunny<00:00:35.840> rainy

minor so happy vs. sad or sunny rainy

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.720 
minor so happy vs. sad or sunny rainy
maybe<00:00:38.360> good<00:00:38.990> versus<00:00:39.530> evil<00:00:42.160> okay<00:00:43.160> so<00:00:43.220> the<00:00:43.610> way

maybe good versus evil okay so the way

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.210 
maybe good versus evil okay so the way
that<00:00:43.910> we<00:00:44.000> find<00:00:44.210> these<00:00:44.420> chords<00:00:44.810> we<00:00:45.140> can<00:00:45.350> here's

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
that we find these chords we can here's

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.390 
that we find these chords we can here's
a<00:00:46.280> C<00:00:46.520> chord<00:00:46.730> we<00:00:46.910> can<00:00:46.940> count<00:00:47.360> up<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:47.690> distance

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
a C chord we can count up the distance

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.100 
a C chord we can count up the distance
between<00:00:49.400> each<00:00:49.790> note<00:00:50.030> and<00:00:50.570> it<00:00:50.720> will<00:00:50.840> be<00:00:50.960> the

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
between each note and it will be the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.160 
between each note and it will be the
same<00:00:51.380> structure<00:00:51.980> or<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:52.280> same<00:00:52.490> distance

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
same structure or the same distance

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.600 
same structure or the same distance
wherever<00:00:54.170> I<00:00:54.260> put<00:00:54.530> my<00:00:54.710> thumb<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:55.220> if<00:00:55.280> I<00:00:55.370> want<00:00:55.550> to

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
wherever I put my thumb so if I want to

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.610 
wherever I put my thumb so if I want to
start<00:00:55.790> here<00:00:55.880> this<00:00:56.840> is<00:00:56.990> going<00:00:57.110> to<00:00:57.200> be<00:00:57.320> the<00:00:57.440> same

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
start here this is going to be the same

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.500 
start here this is going to be the same
distance<00:00:57.800> I<00:00:58.250> want<00:00:58.760> to<00:00:58.820> start<00:00:59.000> on<00:00:59.120> this<00:00:59.300> note

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
distance I want to start on this note

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.960 
distance I want to start on this note
this<00:00:59.750> is<00:01:00.500> still<00:01:00.740> the<00:01:00.860> same<00:01:01.100> distance<00:01:01.490> of<00:01:01.790> half

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
this is still the same distance of half

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.109 
this is still the same distance of half
steps<00:01:02.329> and<00:01:02.540> whole<00:01:02.630> steps<00:01:03.159> so<00:01:04.159> I'm<00:01:04.939> going<00:01:05.089> to

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
steps and whole steps so I'm going to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.880 
steps and whole steps so I'm going to
start<00:01:05.329> by<00:01:05.479> counting<00:01:05.869> 0<00:01:06.320> 1<00:01:07.010> 2<00:01:07.400> 3<00:01:07.760> 4<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:09.020> from<00:01:09.620> C<00:01:09.860> to

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
start by counting 0 1 2 3 4 so from C to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.380 
start by counting 0 1 2 3 4 so from C to
e<00:01:10.010> is<00:01:10.370> 4<00:01:10.820> half<00:01:11.060> steps<00:01:11.090> 0<00:01:12.050> 1<00:01:12.350> 2<00:01:12.680> 3<00:01:12.710> 4<00:01:13.430> then<00:01:13.760> from<00:01:14.210> E

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
e is 4 half steps 0 1 2 3 4 then from E

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.260 
e is 4 half steps 0 1 2 3 4 then from E
to<00:01:14.420> G<00:01:14.540> is<00:01:14.840> 3<00:01:15.350> half<00:01:15.530> steps<00:01:15.560> 0<00:01:16.280> 1<00:01:16.850> 2<00:01:17.180> 3<00:01:18.250> so<00:01:19.250> from<00:01:20.090> C

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
to G is 3 half steps 0 1 2 3 so from C

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.530 
to G is 3 half steps 0 1 2 3 so from C
to<00:01:20.300> e<00:01:20.510> 4<00:01:20.990> half<00:01:21.470> steps<00:01:21.500> from<00:01:22.159> E<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.490> G<00:01:22.610> 3<00:01:23.360> half

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
to e 4 half steps from E to G 3 half

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.469 
to e 4 half steps from E to G 3 half
steps<00:01:23.570> if<00:01:24.229> you<00:01:24.290> can<00:01:24.470> number<00:01:24.710> 4<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.100> 3<00:01:25.370> then<00:01:26.240> you

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
steps if you can number 4 and 3 then you

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.870 
steps if you can number 4 and 3 then you
can<00:01:26.510> find<00:01:26.870> any<00:01:27.170> major<00:01:27.409> triad<00:01:27.890> on<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.520> keyboard

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
can find any major triad on the keyboard

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.880 
can find any major triad on the keyboard
how<00:01:29.180> fast<00:01:29.450> was<00:01:29.659> that<00:01:29.690> we<00:01:30.440> want<00:01:30.620> to<00:01:30.710> think

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
how fast was that we want to think

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.140 
how fast was that we want to think
strategically<00:01:31.100> like<00:01:31.610> this<00:01:31.820> rather<00:01:32.030> than

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
strategically like this rather than

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.360 
strategically like this rather than
memorizing<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:33.110> way<00:01:33.260> each<00:01:33.500> shape<00:01:33.799> looks<00:01:34.070> like

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
memorizing the way each shape looks like

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.820 
memorizing the way each shape looks like
black<00:01:34.610> white<00:01:34.850> black<00:01:35.150> white<00:01:35.650> white<00:01:36.650> white

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
black white black white white white

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.440 
black white black white white white
there's<00:01:37.190> 12<00:01:37.460> different<00:01:37.520> shapes<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.240> that's<00:01:38.360> a

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
there's 12 different shapes and that's a

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.300 
there's 12 different shapes and that's a
lot<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.840> memorize<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.740> just<00:01:39.950> want<00:01:40.250> to

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
lot to memorize you just want to

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.070 
lot to memorize you just want to
memorize<00:01:40.700> 4<00:01:41.120> and<00:01:41.270> 3<00:01:41.510> because<00:01:41.810> that<00:01:41.930> has<00:01:42.049> to

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
memorize 4 and 3 because that has to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.660 
memorize 4 and 3 because that has to
save<00:01:42.320> you<00:01:42.470> a<00:01:42.500> lot<00:01:42.590> of<00:01:42.650> time<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.190> memory<00:01:43.340> in

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
save you a lot of time and memory in

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.100 
save you a lot of time and memory in
your<00:01:43.729> mind<00:01:45.340> so<00:01:46.360> 4<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:47.479> 3<00:01:47.630> let's<00:01:47.810> try<00:01:47.990> another

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
your mind so 4 and 3 let's try another

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:56.230 
your mind so 4 and 3 let's try another
one<00:01:48.290> let's<00:01:48.380> try<00:01:48.530> b-flat<00:01:49.659> 0<00:01:51.369> 1<00:01:52.369> 2<00:01:53.119> 3<00:01:53.860> 4<00:01:55.150> so<00:01:56.150> I'm

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
one let's try b-flat 0 1 2 3 4 so I'm

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.460 
one let's try b-flat 0 1 2 3 4 so I'm
counting<00:01:56.360> up<00:01:56.570> 4<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:56.930> now<00:01:56.990> we<00:01:57.049> have<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.260> count

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
counting up 4 and now we have to count

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.640 
counting up 4 and now we have to count
up<00:01:57.560> 3<00:01:57.830> 0<00:01:58.640> 1<00:01:59.080> 2<00:02:01.869> if<00:02:02.869> it<00:02:03.080> sounds<00:02:03.439> right

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
up 3 0 1 2 if it sounds right

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.740 
up 3 0 1 2 if it sounds right
sounds<00:02:04.610> like<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.850> other<00:02:04.880> major<00:02:05.210> chords<00:02:05.570> you

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
sounds like the other major chords you

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.039 
sounds like the other major chords you
know<00:02:05.869> then<00:02:06.140> you<00:02:06.590> probably

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049

start<00:04:17.040> with<00:04:17.160> one<00:04:17.310> shape<00:04:17.519> let's<00:04:17.729> start<00:04:17.910> with<00:04:18.000> C

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
start with one shape let's start with C

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.530 
start with one shape let's start with C
0<00:04:18.389> 1

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
0 1

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.950 
0 1
three<00:04:19.870> four<00:04:20.110> zero<00:04:20.860> one<00:04:20.950> two<00:04:21.340> three<00:04:21.900> so<00:04:22.900> you

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
three four zero one two three so you

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.990 
three four zero one two three so you
have<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.080> c-major<00:04:23.410> here<00:04:23.740> I'm<00:04:24.490> gonna<00:04:24.640> move<00:04:24.790> each

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
have a c-major here I'm gonna move each

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.070 
have a c-major here I'm gonna move each
finger<00:04:25.030> up<00:04:25.540> one<00:04:26.470> note<00:04:26.710> or<00:04:26.980> one<00:04:27.130> half<00:04:27.340> step<00:04:27.490> so

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
finger up one note or one half step so

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.990 
finger up one note or one half step so
now<00:04:29.080> I<00:04:29.110> have<00:04:29.320> C<00:04:29.560> sharp<00:04:29.610> major

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
now I have C sharp major

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.580 
now I have C sharp major
I'm<00:04:31.210> gonna<00:04:31.360> do<00:04:31.510> that<00:04:31.660> again<00:04:31.810> each<00:04:32.200> finger<00:04:32.530> is

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
I'm gonna do that again each finger is

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.130 
I'm gonna do that again each finger is
gonna<00:04:32.740> move<00:04:32.860> up<00:04:33.040> pinkie<00:04:33.520> first<00:04:33.750> then<00:04:34.750> this<00:04:34.930> one

gonna move up pinkie first then this one
and<00:04:35.530> my<00:04:35.920> thumb<00:04:36.360> now<00:04:37.360> I<00:04:37.390> have<00:04:37.570> D<00:04:37.720> major

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.910 

if<00:04:41.680> you<00:04:41.800> move<00:04:41.920> each<00:04:42.190> finger<00:04:42.220> up<00:04:42.760> a<00:04:42.910> half<00:04:43.090> step

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
if you move each finger up a half step

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.580 
if you move each finger up a half step
this<00:04:44.920> will<00:04:45.100> also<00:04:45.280> help<00:04:45.820> you<00:04:45.970> find<00:04:46.030> any<00:04:46.600> major

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
this will also help you find any major

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.350 
this will also help you find any major
chord<00:04:48.040> or<00:04:48.280> a<00:04:48.310> minor<00:04:48.340> chord<00:04:48.760> depending<00:04:49.150> on<00:04:49.240> what

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
chord or a minor chord depending on what

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.020 
chord or a minor chord depending on what
shape<00:04:49.570> you<00:04:49.690> are<00:04:49.720> starting<00:04:50.110> with<00:04:50.430> in<00:04:51.430> any<00:04:51.730> key

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
shape you are starting with in any key

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.850 
shape you are starting with in any key
that's<00:04:52.750> a<00:04:52.840> good<00:04:52.990> way<00:04:53.110> to<00:04:53.170> practice<00:04:53.380> all<00:04:53.740> the

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
that's a good way to practice all the

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.290 
that's a good way to practice all the
shapes<00:04:54.070> so<00:04:54.400> let's<00:04:54.520> start<00:04:54.700> with<00:04:54.790> minor<00:04:55.000> and<00:04:55.210> go

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
shapes so let's start with minor and go

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.750 
shapes so let's start with minor and go
down<00:04:57.570> each<00:04:58.570> finger<00:04:58.900> is<00:04:58.990> staying<00:04:59.730> the<00:05:00.730> same

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
down each finger is staying the same

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.670 
down each finger is staying the same
it's<00:05:01.150> only<00:05:01.240> going<00:05:01.570> down<00:05:01.750> one<00:05:02.050> half-step<00:05:02.320> each

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
it's only going down one half-step each

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:11.880 
it's only going down one half-step each
time<00:05:09.750> that's<00:05:10.750> because<00:05:11.080> all<00:05:11.320> of<00:05:11.350> these<00:05:11.530> courts

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
time that's because all of these courts

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.590 
time that's because all of these courts
have<00:05:12.040> the<00:05:12.070> same<00:05:12.370> structure<00:05:12.880> that<00:05:13.030> all<00:05:13.390> these

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
have the same structure that all these

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.780 
have the same structure that all these
minor<00:05:13.840> chords<00:05:14.260> are<00:05:14.410> three<00:05:14.710> and<00:05:14.860> four<00:05:15.100> so<00:05:15.340> if<00:05:15.730> I

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
minor chords are three and four so if I

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.000 
minor chords are three and four so if I
move<00:05:15.970> each<00:05:16.270> finger<00:05:16.330> down<00:05:16.960> equally<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.800> same

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
move each finger down equally the same

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.790 
move each finger down equally the same
amount<00:05:18.720> I'm<00:05:19.720> still<00:05:20.020> going<00:05:20.170> to<00:05:20.230> have<00:05:20.380> a<00:05:20.590> minor

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
amount I'm still going to have a minor

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.700 
amount I'm still going to have a minor
chord

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.680 

I'm<00:05:24.190> gonna<00:05:24.370> move<00:05:24.520> this<00:05:24.670> one<00:05:24.850> here<00:05:25.090> this<00:05:25.630> one

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
I'm gonna move this one here this one

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:33.570 
I'm gonna move this one here this one
here<00:05:26.050> this<00:05:26.110> one<00:05:26.410> here<00:05:31.860> there<00:05:32.860> I<00:05:32.890> am<00:05:33.070> back<00:05:33.220> at<00:05:33.400> C

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
here this one here there I am back at C

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.920 
here this one here there I am back at C
minor<00:05:33.760> so<00:05:33.970> I've<00:05:34.030> gone<00:05:34.150> through<00:05:34.210> all<00:05:34.480> 12<00:05:34.750> keys

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
minor so I've gone through all 12 keys

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.300 
minor so I've gone through all 12 keys
that's<00:05:35.170> a<00:05:35.350> great<00:05:35.590> way<00:05:35.740> to<00:05:35.770> practice<00:05:36.070> your

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
that's a great way to practice your

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.750 
that's a great way to practice your
major<00:05:36.970> and<00:05:37.180> minor<00:05:37.360> chords
