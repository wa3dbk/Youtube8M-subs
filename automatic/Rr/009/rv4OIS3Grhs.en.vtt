with this we're going to take we're

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.060 
with this we're going to take we're
going<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.960> throw<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.170> out<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.710> don't<00:01:55.860> want<00:01:56.009> to

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
going to throw it out you don't want to

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.740 
going to throw it out you don't want to
deal<00:01:56.189> with<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.490> that's<00:01:57.240> not<00:01:57.420> going<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.630> help

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
deal with that that's not going to help

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.300 
deal with that that's not going to help
at<00:01:57.930> all

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
at all

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.249 
at all
so<00:01:59.310> what<00:02:00.210> you're<00:02:00.390> going<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.570> do<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.990> come

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
so what you're going to do is you come

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.340 
so what you're going to do is you come
here<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.740> take<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.159> end<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:03.110> soon<00:02:04.110> as<00:02:04.229> if

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
here and you take the end and soon as if

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.230 
here and you take the end and soon as if
I<00:02:04.439> find<00:02:04.770> a

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
I find a

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.630 
I find a
clean<00:02:05.509> end<00:02:05.810> over<00:02:06.049> here<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:07.070> this<00:02:07.159> is<00:02:07.340> going<00:02:07.520> to

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
clean end over here so this is going to

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.190 
clean end over here so this is going to
be<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:07.939> end<00:02:08.119> that<00:02:08.360> you're<00:02:08.509> going<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.810> connect

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
be the end that you're going to connect

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.309 
be the end that you're going to connect
to<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.310> hose<00:02:10.630> what<00:02:11.630> you<00:02:11.780> need<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.959> do<00:02:12.110> is<00:02:12.230> you

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
to the hose what you need to do is you

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.820 
to the hose what you need to do is you
need<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.530> get<00:02:12.709> into<00:02:12.980> here<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:15.520> find<00:02:17.830> this

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
need to get into here and find this

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.550 
need to get into here and find this
straight<00:02:19.640> connector<00:02:20.330> right<00:02:20.870> like<00:02:21.080> that<00:02:21.110> this

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
straight connector right like that this

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.770 
straight connector right like that this
is<00:02:21.709> this<00:02:21.830> connector<00:02:22.430> butt<00:02:22.910> butt<00:02:23.390> splice

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
is this connector butt butt splice

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.780 
is this connector butt butt splice
connector<00:02:24.410> what<00:02:25.130> you're<00:02:25.250> going<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.430> do<00:02:25.580> is

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
connector what you're going to do is

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.479 
connector what you're going to do is
going<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.000> take<00:02:26.209> this<00:02:26.420> piece<00:02:27.040> feed<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.250> hose

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
going to take this piece feed the hose

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.770 
going to take this piece feed the hose
into<00:02:28.849> it

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.140 

until<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:32.900> comes<00:02:33.080> out<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.500> other<00:02:33.590> end<00:02:34.150> and

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
until it comes out of the other end and

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.300 
until it comes out of the other end and
then<00:02:35.239> you<00:02:35.360> take<00:02:35.599> this<00:02:35.840> part<00:02:36.319> and<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:36.709> stick<00:02:37.280> it

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
then you take this part and you stick it

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.309 
then you take this part and you stick it
onto<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:38.030> end<00:02:38.150> like<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.420> get<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:38.930> all<00:02:39.110> the

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
onto the end like that get it all the

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:47.229 
onto the end like that get it all the
way<00:02:39.470> down<00:02:39.500> in<00:02:39.890> there<00:02:44.049> okay<00:02:46.120> optionally<00:02:47.120> you

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
way down in there okay optionally you

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.050 
way down in there okay optionally you
can<00:02:47.269> cut<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.720> off<00:02:47.840> right<00:02:48.140> there<00:02:48.489> but<00:02:49.489> I<00:02:49.730> don't

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
can cut it off right there but I don't

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.520 
can cut it off right there but I don't
think<00:02:50.150> it's<00:02:50.330> really<00:02:50.540> necessary<00:02:50.660> because<00:02:51.200> then

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
think it's really necessary because then

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.750 
think it's really necessary because then
you're<00:02:51.650> going<00:02:51.739> to<00:02:51.830> take<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.160> pull<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:52.580> back

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
you're going to take and pull it back

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.240 
you're going to take and pull it back
and<00:02:53.000> now<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.180> see<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.420> actually<00:02:53.950> stays<00:02:54.950> in

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
and now you see it actually stays in

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.400 
and now you see it actually stays in
there<00:02:55.459> because<00:02:56.090> in<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.690> instructions<00:02:57.260> it

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
there because in the instructions it

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.500 
there because in the instructions it
does<00:02:57.560> not<00:02:57.709> tell<00:02:58.459> you<00:02:58.580> to<00:02:58.700> put<00:02:58.880> anything<00:02:59.120> in

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
does not tell you to put anything in

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.930 
does not tell you to put anything in
there<00:02:59.780> to<00:03:00.319> actually<00:03:00.769> keep<00:03:01.040> that<00:03:01.370> from<00:03:01.700> coming

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
there to actually keep that from coming

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.050 
there to actually keep that from coming
back<00:03:02.239> out<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:02.720> that's<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.140> root<00:03:03.319> of<00:03:03.470> all<00:03:03.590> evil

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
back out and that's the root of all evil

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.460 
back out and that's the root of all evil
all<00:03:05.060> right<00:03:05.239> I'm<00:03:05.360> going<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.569> take<00:03:05.720> your<00:03:05.930> your

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
all right I'm going to take your your

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.610 
all right I'm going to take your your
filter<00:03:07.180> drop<00:03:08.180> that<00:03:08.450> in<00:03:08.630> like<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:09.080> it's

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
filter drop that in like that it's

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.740 
filter drop that in like that it's
facing<00:03:09.829> upwards<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:10.459> see<00:03:10.579> the<00:03:10.700> dome<00:03:10.910> dome<00:03:11.390> up

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
facing upwards you see the dome dome up

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:20.810 
facing upwards you see the dome dome up
you<00:03:12.560> take<00:03:12.769> this<00:03:13.299> screw<00:03:14.299> it<00:03:14.420> on

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.000 

get<00:03:21.820> on<00:03:21.970> there<00:03:22.090> pretty<00:03:22.360> tight<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:23.320> don't

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
get on there pretty tight and don't

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.230 
get on there pretty tight and don't
over-tighten<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.610> none<00:03:24.760> of<00:03:24.790> this<00:03:24.940> stuff<00:03:25.150> is

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
over-tighten it none of this stuff is

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.430 
over-tighten it none of this stuff is
built<00:03:25.510> very<00:03:25.830> sturdy<00:03:26.830> very<00:03:27.130> secure<00:03:28.440> original

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
built very sturdy very secure original

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.930 
built very sturdy very secure original
washer<00:03:29.920> that<00:03:30.040> goes<00:03:30.160> on<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.460> end<00:03:30.610> and<00:03:30.850> then

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
washer that goes on the end and then

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.880 
washer that goes on the end and then
this<00:03:31.150> right<00:03:31.330> here<00:03:31.600> would<00:03:31.750> fit<00:03:32.050> on<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.650> your

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
this right here would fit on to your

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.370 
this right here would fit on to your
hose<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.430> this<00:03:33.970> will<00:03:34.180> actually<00:03:34.600> work<00:03:34.810> it

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
hose and this will actually work it

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.270 
hose and this will actually work it
might<00:03:35.620> leak<00:03:35.890> a<00:03:36.070> very<00:03:36.430> small<00:03:36.970> amount<00:03:38.280> usually

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
might leak a very small amount usually

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.410 
might leak a very small amount usually
right<00:03:39.520> there<00:03:39.850> and<00:03:39.970> I<00:03:40.030> think<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:40.270> could

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
right there and I think you could

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.000 
right there and I think you could
probably<00:03:40.540> put<00:03:40.900> some<00:03:41.050> teflon<00:03:41.470> tape<00:03:41.709> if<00:03:41.890> it

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
probably put some teflon tape if it

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.690 
probably put some teflon tape if it
bothered<00:03:42.370> you

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
bothered you

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.420 
bothered you
it<00:03:42.940> never<00:03:43.240> leaked<00:03:43.810> enough<00:03:44.140> to<00:03:44.740> bother<00:03:44.920> me<00:03:45.250> I

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
it never leaked enough to bother me I

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.130 
it never leaked enough to bother me I
actually<00:03:45.940> just<00:03:46.180> use<00:03:46.360> it<00:03:46.480> as<00:03:46.600> like<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:46.900> first

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
actually just use it as like the first

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.690 
actually just use it as like the first
you<00:03:47.590> know<00:03:47.680> hang<00:03:48.100> it<00:03:48.220> over<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.550> first

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
you know hang it over the first

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.140 
you know hang it over the first
flowerpot<00:03:49.420> or<00:03:49.450> whatever<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.820> it<00:03:51.820> does<00:03:51.970> some

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
flowerpot or whatever and it does some
