a<00:01:07.770> photo<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.610> from<00:01:08.760> later<00:01:08.939> Amma

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
a photo so this is from later Amma

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.280 
a photo so this is from later Amma
doesn't<00:01:09.600> really<00:01:09.720> matter<00:01:09.960> because<00:01:10.140> it

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
doesn't really matter because it

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.740 
doesn't really matter because it
illustrates<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.920> same<00:01:11.100> point<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.750> these

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
illustrates the same point and these

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.080

nothing being done why was nothing being
done<00:04:14.180> now<00:04:14.509> there's<00:04:14.840> a<00:04:14.959> reason<00:04:15.349> for<00:04:15.530> that<00:04:15.620> and

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
done now there's a reason for that and

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.370 
done now there's a reason for that and
you<00:04:16.849> need<00:04:17.030> to<00:04:17.180> think<00:04:17.209> about<00:04:17.690> it<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.079> biggest
