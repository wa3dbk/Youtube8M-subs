Wiley's well I'm glad you asked I'd like

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.240 
Wiley's well I'm glad you asked I'd like
to<00:00:06.540> take<00:00:06.630> a<00:00:06.690> couple<00:00:07.049> of<00:00:07.109> minutes<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.620> talk

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
to take a couple of minutes and talk

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.580 
to take a couple of minutes and talk
about<00:00:08.549> some<00:00:08.760> of<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.080> potential<00:00:10.080> benefits

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
about some of the potential benefits

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.439 
about some of the potential benefits
that<00:00:10.709> you'd<00:00:10.889> have<00:00:11.160> by<00:00:11.699> considering<00:00:12.209> the<00:00:12.299> lease

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:12.449 
that you'd have by considering the lease

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.439 
that you'd have by considering the lease
option<00:00:12.680> now<00:00:13.680> usually<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.670> lease<00:00:14.850> payment<00:00:15.330> is

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:15.449 
option now usually the lease payment is

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.349 
option now usually the lease payment is
less<00:00:16.080> or<00:00:16.350> considerably<00:00:16.949> less<00:00:17.279> than<00:00:17.550> what<00:00:18.240> the

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
less or considerably less than what the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.570 
less or considerably less than what the
purchase<00:00:18.540> payment<00:00:19.080> would<00:00:19.140> be<00:00:19.220> but<00:00:20.220> let's<00:00:20.400> say

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
purchase payment would be but let's say

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.980 
purchase payment would be but let's say
for<00:00:20.790> example<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.990> payments<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.440> same<00:00:23.990> what

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
for example the payments the same what

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.940 
for example the payments the same what
benefits<00:00:25.500> would<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.830> derive<00:00:26.870> then<00:00:27.870> by<00:00:28.590> not

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
benefits would you derive then by not

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.310 
benefits would you derive then by not
having<00:00:29.100> a<00:00:29.310> payment<00:00:29.640> advantage<00:00:30.140> say<00:00:31.140> for

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
having a payment advantage say for

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.170 
having a payment advantage say for
example<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:32.129> really<00:00:32.279> understand<00:00:32.879> at<00:00:33.030> least

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
example to really understand at least

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.819 
example to really understand at least
you<00:00:33.329> have<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.539> understand<00:00:34.050> how<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.680> lease

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
you have to understand how the lease

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.370 
you have to understand how the lease
structure<00:00:35.310> is<00:00:35.690> first<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.870> all<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.079> lease<00:00:37.230> is
