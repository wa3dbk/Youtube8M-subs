00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.670
 I bought this for a game but I was a friend with the moon 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.920

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.890
 Well first 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.890
 This is positive 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:39.320
 It is characteristic of this speaker , but we can supply power with usb 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.320

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.480
 That is 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.600
 Well this 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:00.710

 Bought guy that the earphone jack is bifurcated 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:01.580
 I use it with a feeling like eight speakers here and there 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.450
 It seems like the computer speakers are mainly bad now 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.450
