00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.100
 hello everyone space game guys are 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.860
 learned that we are back today 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.590
 this channel with another video analysis 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.930
 but I don't play a per game analysis 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.599
 we did a little with the video 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.220
 what happened to titan for two today 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.470
 we deal with workshops and comets already 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.450
 could understand from the title we will see 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.369
 or at least I will explain my reasons for 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.550
 which this title can be inserted 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.040
 among the tops or even between the flops for others 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.790
 motivations then wars dogs top and flop 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.170
 essentially our title therefore vi 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.250
 I will explain my reasons why second 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.680
 me to this game can be 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.710
 quietly inserted between the tops and 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.570
 the following are first of all the idea of ​​a 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.820
 innovative game of the genre because 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.800
 however the game was very popular 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.500
 success because of this plot that 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.360
 however quite engaging 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.340
 There are virtually all these 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.350
 system hacking activity 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.540
 agile computer hackers who camera 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.430
 range of devices that makes us understand 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.500
 just how technology is 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.390
 nestled within our lives and how much 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.079
 is not becoming more and more 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.329
 technician employees ie we practically 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:15.219
 we rely on technology but 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.990
 casoli also has a mission in mind 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.429
 of a prison now I will not marry 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.560
 the whole story, however, didn't put one 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.200
 prison where one is said 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.490
 advanced technology called this 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.039
 prison that will then succeed easily 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.259
 to hack but you will see it when 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.969
 you will carry out this chapter of the road 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.100
 maybe you have already done so not there 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:35.649
 I say absolutely nothing new though 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.590
 not let's get over it and I told you that 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.630
 however the game is very very nice 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.159
 because it is an engaging story vi 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.630
 I said this activity by 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.490
 hacking of the various hackers 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.289
 devices that make us understand precisely 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.810
 when we are employees of technology 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.659
 and then also the fact that it is a free 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.670
 roaming very rich in activity 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.229
 sure maybe as a community 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.090
 assassin's creed because also in 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.950
 there are so many assassin's creed 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.950
 activities to be carried out for example in 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.590
 black flag the points to explore the areas 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.380
 of discovering then a little below 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.030
 this aspect is the same as that with 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.760
 lightroom stoxx of course everything 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.980
 revisited in modern sauce then 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.250
 maybe find the codes you watch 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.220
 scattered scattered 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.560
 for the city or maybe just like you have 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.720
 there are the tutorials I brought you 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.090
 a short time ago find the antennas then 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.360
 reach perhaps the ideal way to 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.710
 therefore being able to hack all of these 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.720
 alternative activities however 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.730
 make the game varied and fun 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.450
 and not simply monotonous based 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.760
 on the storyline and all in all 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.820
 therefore in these respects I would say that the 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.310
 game and top then behaved 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.560
 according to expectations 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.780
 secondly, however, also comes the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.370
 a little weaker side of the game 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.320
 so a little bit this flop 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.300
 surely a flop comes from i 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.310
 movements had been rumored that this 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.900
 maybe I play one of the games 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.670
 best for however it was on next gen 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.739
 so to mobilize people it would be 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.260
 it was practically similar to the real one 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.239
 gods and normal human beings instead 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.770
 there are still some pubs of movement 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.870
 so let's say I'm not really 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.200
 negatives similar game is however 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.489
 a player maybe than you only of 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.100
 play austere can easily 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.739
 surely to overlook this aspect 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.410
 what really surprised me was 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.480
 the very high downgrade that occurred 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.640
 in the graphic because if we go to see 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.790
 a comparative video indeed you see in 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.040
 this moment between between 2012 and the 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.959
 grand prix current of 2014 you can 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.660
 understand how much there was a net from a 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.310
 greider of own game images 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.959
 because you see as a hayden character 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.519
 it moves in a much more fluid way na 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.220
 vittorio king of letters and how much in 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:54.140
 much more mechanical way in the game 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:56.060
 actual 2014 so I don't know this 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.950
 I play a bit of light and shadow as well 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.400
 another shadow urge me to have pain 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.829
 noted again the good though anyway 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.510
 haydn hacking skills 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.430
 hence this hacking ability in 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.620
 actually it was n't new to me because I don't know if 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.230
 you know it or otherwise if you wanted 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.420
 watched the person television series 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.550
 then fake remains the series where 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.910
 wax 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.799
 these two two protagonists that one 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.770
 managed IT systems a bit like 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.000
 bad boy let's say so it works you docs is 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.640
 other that went around doing the 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.690
 dirty work in quotation marks then in 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.290
 this case, what does our 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.450
 hayden 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.940
 now I sincerely remember ourselves of the 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.220
 protagonist of a person of great interest 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.320
 however he was the protagonist and whose or 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.640
 It was done by gigi Jim Caviezel then 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.980
 understand if I don't know how to pronounce it 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.030
 precisely however a story is 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.320
 according to me a base a little bit already 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.910
 I don't know if it was born before the magazine 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.820
 concept of the television series I believe 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.820
 anyway yes and after the videogame not 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.140
 I'm sure we say this though 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.480
 I wait a little hit me for 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.030
 this bit too much resemblance to the 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.010
 TV series and the game then 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.200
 floors are very inspired by 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.670
 this television series 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.190
 having said that these are not just mine 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.980
 opinion a little as it happened with titan 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.330
 so I also invite you to get me 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.780
 know your reasons why 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.700
 you would put work stoxx in the top with the 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.010
 This year's flop of games if it has 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:28.270
 disappointed your expectations or series a 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.950
 altogether we say maintained then vi 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.900
 thank you invitation as always pass by 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.210
 my personal channel you find how 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.770
 always in the description and choose with 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.620
 some are videos here on the channel of 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.620
 spaces thanks to all guys guys
