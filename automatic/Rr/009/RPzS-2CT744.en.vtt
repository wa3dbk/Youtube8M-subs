00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
my design and for this design I'm going

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.639 
my design and for this design I'm going
to<00:00:46.170> do<00:00:46.320> three<00:00:46.850> 30-inch<00:00:47.850> boxes<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.260> measured

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
to do three 30-inch boxes so I measured

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.619 
to do three 30-inch boxes so I measured
the<00:00:49.800> length<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> wall<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.059> figured<00:00:51.480> out

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
the length of the wall and I figured out

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.020 
the length of the wall and I figured out
where<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.960> center<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.289> my<00:00:52.590> wall<00:00:52.800> was<00:00:53.039> when<00:00:54.000> I

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
where the center of my wall was when I

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.420 
where the center of my wall was when I
marked<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.629> spot<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.230> then<00:00:55.770> took<00:00:55.949> my<00:00:56.160> t-square

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
marked that spot I then took my t-square

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.619 
marked that spot I then took my t-square
and<00:00:57.030> put<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.739> top<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> wall<00:00:59.520> and

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.990 

figured<00:01:03.629> out<00:01:03.780> 15<00:01:04.320> inches<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.979> either<00:01:05.250> side<00:01:05.670> and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
figured out 15 inches on either side and

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.710 
figured out 15 inches on either side and
drew<00:01:06.570> my<00:01:06.900> 30<00:01:07.170> inch<00:01:07.470> square<00:01:08.060> from<00:01:09.060> there<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.689> just

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
drew my 30 inch square from there I just

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.090 
drew my 30 inch square from there I just
used<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:11.460> width<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:13.170> t-square<00:01:13.770> to

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
used the width of the t-square to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.880 
used the width of the t-square to
separate<00:01:14.580> my<00:01:14.880> boxes<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.840> started<00:01:16.650> drawing

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
separate my boxes and started drawing

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.850 
separate my boxes and started drawing
the<00:01:17.280> next<00:01:17.549> 30<00:01:17.790> inch<00:01:18.060> square<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.710> do

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the next 30 inch square and you can do

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
the next 30 inch square and you can do
that<00:01:20.040> easily<00:01:20.310> by<00:01:21.180> just<00:01:21.210> changing<00:01:21.960> your

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
that easily by just changing your

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.499 
that easily by just changing your
t-square<00:01:22.619> around<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.729> get<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> nice<00:01:24.150> straight

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
t-square around to get a nice straight

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.950 
t-square around to get a nice straight
box<00:01:25.580> second<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.700> took<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.060> painters<00:01:27.390> tape<00:01:27.420> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
box second I took the painters tape and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.069

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
I outlined the box with the painters

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.760 
I outlined the box with the painters
tape<00:01:31.430> because<00:01:32.750> you<00:01:33.750> will<00:01:33.869> see<00:01:34.079> later<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.560> when

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
tape because you will see later on when

nicely with the purple

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.920 
nicely with the purple
I<00:03:28.169> used<00:03:28.829> this<00:03:29.040> Anita's<00:03:29.579> brand<00:03:29.970> which<00:03:30.690> was<00:03:30.900> a

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
I used this Anita's brand which was a

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.619 
I used this Anita's brand which was a
little<00:03:31.290> bit<00:03:31.409> thinner<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:32.010> less<00:03:32.639> desirable<00:03:33.150> as

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
little bit thinner and less desirable as

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.469 
little bit thinner and less desirable as
it<00:03:33.690> took<00:03:34.139> three<00:03:34.590> coats<00:03:34.949> to<00:03:35.310> get<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:36.150> desired

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:36.479 
it took three coats to get the desired

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.860 
it took three coats to get the desired
look

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
look

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.259 
look

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
so when you're choosing your paint

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.099 
so when you're choosing your paint
remember<00:03:40.459> that<00:03:41.459> color<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:42.060> important<00:03:42.750> but<00:03:42.989> if

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
remember that color is important but if

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.439 
remember that color is important but if
you<00:03:43.260> can<00:03:43.440> find<00:03:43.739> one<00:03:44.069> in<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.459> better<00:03:44.639> brand<00:03:44.970> and
