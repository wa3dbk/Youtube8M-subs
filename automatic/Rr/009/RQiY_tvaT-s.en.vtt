hello students this is mrs. Nickerson
and<00:00:03.389> today<00:00:03.780> we're<00:00:04.020> going<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.440> learn<00:00:04.620> about

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
and today we're going to learn about

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.970 
and today we're going to learn about
human<00:00:05.460> environment<00:00:06.270> interaction<00:00:07.140> this<00:00:07.740> is

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
human environment interaction this is

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.259 
human environment interaction this is
that<00:00:08.189> in<00:00:08.429> in<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.469> ESPN<00:00:10.469> model<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.820> we<00:00:12.000> looked

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
that in in the ESPN model that we looked

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.289 
that in in the ESPN model that we looked
at<00:00:12.450> last<00:00:12.750> class<00:00:13.110> period<00:00:13.490> our<00:00:14.490> big<00:00:14.790> question

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
at last class period our big question

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.439 
at last class period our big question
today<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.839> how<00:00:16.199> do<00:00:16.260> people<00:00:16.890> depend<00:00:17.369> on<00:00:17.550> adapt

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
today is how do people depend on adapt

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.019 
today is how do people depend on adapt
to<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.990> modify<00:00:19.920> their<00:00:20.220> visit<00:00:20.580> physical

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
to and modify their visit physical

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.509 
to and modify their visit physical
environment<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:22.199> let's<00:00:22.410> find<00:00:22.619> out<00:00:25.430> before<00:00:26.430> we

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
environment so let's find out before we

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.000 
environment so let's find out before we
get<00:00:26.670> started<00:00:27.090> take<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.660> look<00:00:28.109> at<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.710> words

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
get started take a look at the words

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.339 
get started take a look at the words
that<00:00:29.279> are<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.880> screen<00:00:30.300> these<00:00:30.990> are<00:00:31.050> all

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
that are on the screen these are all

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.020 
that are on the screen these are all
words<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:32.189> you're<00:00:32.399> going<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.669> see<00:00:32.880> either

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
words that you're going to see either

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.260 
words that you're going to see either
today<00:00:33.600> or<00:00:33.630> next<00:00:34.350> class<00:00:34.590> period<00:00:34.940> so<00:00:35.940> take<00:00:36.239> a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
today or next class period so take a

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.010 
today or next class period so take a
moment<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:38.219> your<00:00:38.489> paper<00:00:38.960> classify<00:00:39.960> these

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
moment and on your paper classify these

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.240 
moment and on your paper classify these
words<00:00:40.680> as<00:00:41.010> words<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:42.120> already<00:00:42.570> know<00:00:42.780> or<00:00:43.260> words<00:00:43.950> I

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
words as words I already know or words I

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:52.310 
words as words I already know or words I
don't<00:00:44.640> know<00:00:45.000> yet<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.840> may<00:00:46.440> pause<00:00:46.739> here<00:00:51.320> so

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
don't know yet you may pause here so

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.900 
don't know yet you may pause here so
modifying<00:00:52.949> versus<00:00:53.640> adapting<00:00:55.520> look<00:00:56.520> at<00:00:56.699> these

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
modifying versus adapting look at these

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.229 
modifying versus adapting look at these
two<00:00:57.420> pictures<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.469> think<00:00:59.219> about<00:00:59.520> what<00:00:59.940> we

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
two pictures and think about what we

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.330 
two pictures and think about what we
have<00:01:00.539> discussed<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.649> class

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
have discussed in class

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.830 
have discussed in class
what<00:01:02.969> does<00:01:03.619> modifying<00:01:04.619> mean<00:01:05.479> which<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.689> these

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
what does modifying mean which of these

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.609 
what does modifying mean which of these
pictures<00:01:07.640> most<00:01:08.640> shows<00:01:09.119> modifying<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
pictures most shows modifying the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.649 
pictures most shows modifying the
environment<00:01:11.840> think<00:01:12.840> about<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:14.420> do<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.450> have

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
environment think about it do you have

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.010 
environment think about it do you have
it<00:01:17.600> great<00:01:18.600> job

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
it great job

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.010 
it great job
this<00:01:19.860> pictures<00:01:20.340> modifying<00:01:20.939> because<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.780> land

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
this pictures modifying because the land

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.580 
this pictures modifying because the land
itself<00:01:22.680> was<00:01:23.100> changed<00:01:23.670> from<00:01:23.970> what<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.299> was<00:01:24.750> to

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
itself was changed from what it was to

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.740 
itself was changed from what it was to
allow<00:01:25.950> for<00:01:26.400> farming

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.499 

so<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.930> means<00:01:31.170> which<00:01:31.470> picture<00:01:32.009> shows

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
so that means which picture shows

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.700 
so that means which picture shows
adapting<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.439> environment<00:01:36.140> yep<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.500> got

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
adapting to the environment yep you got

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.060 
adapting to the environment yep you got
it

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
it

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.999 
it
the<00:01:38.700> land<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.299> windy<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.560> wind<00:01:40.799> is

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
the land is windy so the wind is

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.210 
the land is windy so the wind is
harnessed<00:01:41.670> but<00:01:42.390> it's<00:01:42.570> not<00:01:42.979> changed

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
harnessed but it's not changed

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.700 
harnessed but it's not changed
remember<00:01:44.939> when<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.659> adapt<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
remember when you adapt to the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.620 
remember when you adapt to the
environment<00:01:46.829> you're<00:01:47.549> changing<00:01:48.149> your

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
environment you're changing your

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.480 
environment you're changing your
behavior<00:01:48.780> you're<00:01:49.500> not<00:01:49.799> changing<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
behavior you're not changing the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.249 
behavior you're not changing the
environment<00:01:50.729> itself<00:01:53.509> so<00:01:54.509> what's<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
environment itself so what's the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.100 
environment itself so what's the
difference<00:01:55.710> between<00:01:55.890> modifying<00:01:56.759> and

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
difference between modifying and

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.920 
difference between modifying and
adapting<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.590> environment<00:01:59.570> take<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> few

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
adapting to the environment take a few

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.830 
adapting to the environment take a few
minutes<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.560> respond<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.880> question<00:02:03.630> on

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
minutes and respond to this question on

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.050 
minutes and respond to this question on
your<00:02:04.439> paper<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:05.520> may<00:02:05.700> pause<00:02:05.969> here

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.470 

so<00:02:12.060> let's<00:02:12.390> look<00:02:12.750> at<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.080> few<00:02:13.830> more<00:02:14.480> adaptations

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
so let's look at a few more adaptations

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.470 
so let's look at a few more adaptations
or<00:02:15.690> modifications<00:02:16.650> see<00:02:17.430> if<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.910> can<00:02:18.270> identify

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
or modifications see if you can identify

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.960 
or modifications see if you can identify
them<00:02:19.410> take<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.370> look<00:02:20.790> at<00:02:21.030> each<00:02:21.599> of<00:02:21.870> these<00:02:22.410> four

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
them take a look at each of these four

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.080 
them take a look at each of these four
pictures<00:02:23.970> those<00:02:24.900> numbers<00:02:25.530> correspond<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.730> the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
pictures those numbers correspond to the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.330 
pictures those numbers correspond to the
1<00:02:27.360> 2<00:02:27.750> 3<00:02:27.780> &amp;<00:02:28.349> 4<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.310> see<00:02:29.849> on<00:02:30.120> your<00:02:30.660> paper

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340

your<00:02:32.340> job<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:32.970> classify<00:02:33.390> each<00:02:33.989> picture<00:02:34.590> as

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
your job is to classify each picture as

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.380 
your job is to classify each picture as

answer in the spaces below remember
think<00:02:43.500> about<00:02:43.590> what<00:02:44.160> they<00:02:44.400> were<00:02:44.459> designed<00:02:45.060> to

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
think about what they were designed to

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.039 
think about what they were designed to
accomplish<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.560> whether<00:02:47.459> or<00:02:47.790> not<00:02:48.049> the

accomplish and whether or not the

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.490 
accomplish and whether or not the
environment<00:02:49.500> itself<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.790> changed<00:02:51.600> or<00:02:52.019> if

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
environment itself is changed or if

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.920 
environment itself is changed or if
human<00:02:53.220> behavior<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.319> changed<00:02:55.319> pause<00:02:56.010> here<00:02:56.700> and
