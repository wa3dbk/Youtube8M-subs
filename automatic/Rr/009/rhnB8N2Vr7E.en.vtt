day become one I'm not sure what it
means<00:02:06.210> but<00:02:06.450> my<00:02:06.720> guess<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.380> something

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
means but my guess is that something

means but my guess is that something
extraordinary<00:02:08.190> happens<00:02:08.880> in<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.149> region<00:02:09.330> of

extraordinary happens in that region of

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.660 
extraordinary happens in that region of
space<00:02:09.690> once<00:02:10.140> every<00:02:10.440> thousand<00:02:10.890> years<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.459> it's

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
space once every thousand years and it's

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.600 
space once every thousand years and it's
about<00:02:11.880> to<00:02:12.120> happen<00:02:12.239> again

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
about to happen again

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.800 
about to happen again
sending<00:02:14.610> every<00:02:14.910> ship<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.269> their<00:02:15.360> fleet<00:02:15.420> to

sending every ship in their fleet to

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.540 
sending every ship in their fleet to
rendezvous<00:02:16.140> there<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:17.069> would<00:02:17.190> have<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.459> be

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
rendezvous there you would have to be

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.070 
rendezvous there you would have to be
out<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.700> your<00:02:17.880> minds<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.450> try<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.720> intercept

so<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:11.110> matter<00:03:11.380> X<00:03:11.620> will<00:03:11.920> be<00:03:12.150> all-powerful<00:03:17.010> you

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
so the matter X will be all-powerful you

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.920 
so the matter X will be all-powerful you
can<00:03:18.220> operate<00:03:18.460> the<00:03:18.670> ship<00:03:18.880> from<00:03:19.030> here<00:03:19.390> there's

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
can operate the ship from here there's
