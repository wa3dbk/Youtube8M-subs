00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.600
 theme of intestinal health and tenants 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.519
 You could give us short checks 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.200
 explain the basics of this concept 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.969
 Of course there is something very important 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.279
 functions for an organism under 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.619
 Of course, the other bari zones help 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.619
 resorption function and what more and more 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.400
 of course, that is explored 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:29.160
 property that he has a significant 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.399
 microbiologist carries or carries in itself 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.160
 the crew around the totality of all 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:37.230
 intestinal bacteria in the system is there 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.829
 business to about one to two 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:45.539
 kilograms and is a whole 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:50.070
 nasty quantity there are assumptions that one 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.770
 about 500 others say one to pay 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.870
 1000 different species of intestine 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.789
 Bacteria in the gut throughout 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.010
 gremiums finds and always stops 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.799
 Community function in flins 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.170
 the same for loris must mean whole 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.439
 of course, that the immune system in 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.890
 there is of course in lower layers 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:16.020
 The practice will be lymphocytes 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.299
 formed the b cells 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.700
 Plasma cells formed it is whole 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.950
 significant functions in the lower 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.049
 to provide layers of the gut for ours 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.729
 immune system normal shift 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.829
 Of course , you can find more in-depth ones 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.780
 throw again and say that 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.380
 do 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.939
 serotonin everyone knows you europe 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.630
 vitally different 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.880
 Features It has more community function 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.039
 and is vital to us 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.149
 for various operations on ours 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:50.030
 mood and it will be five percent of 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:54.470
 serotonins in that made so that 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:57.979
 we know functions influencing 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.289
 entire organism act again 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.259
 Finally, if the barrier function 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:07.630
 the disturbed mucosa is promise 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:11.299
 from league gut permeability syndrome 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.790
 then so many toxins will be on 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:17.780
 reached this again stress for 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.560
 medium and so significant connection to 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.950
 act to the tenant if vital 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.709
 nutrients are not well processed and 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.260
 be metabolized senior online 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.390
 And so is the trade medicine the 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.950
 treatment of intestinal health 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.519
 integral part 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.170
 that's why it's very important to us 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.170
 to include
