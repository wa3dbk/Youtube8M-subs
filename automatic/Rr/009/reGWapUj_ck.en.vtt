00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
foam grips you can see that there are

foam grips you can see that there are
some<00:01:33.540> cutaways<00:01:34.350> here<00:01:34.829> actually<00:01:35.340> gives<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.700> a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
some cutaways here actually gives it a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.340 
some cutaways here actually gives it a
little<00:01:35.939> bit<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.270> texture<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.229> some

little bit of texture and some

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.230 
little bit of texture and some
ergonomics<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.340> feels<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.880> much<00:01:39.030> better

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
ergonomics so it feels that much better

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.020 
ergonomics so it feels that much better
in<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.780> hand<00:01:40.079> but<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.770> also<00:01:40.920> helps<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.610> cut

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
in the hand but it also helps to cut

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.230 
in the hand but it also helps to cut
down<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.630> weight<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.200> again<00:01:43.380> you've<00:01:43.530> got<00:01:43.560> that
