00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.160 
don't really know the style nor the
colors<00:03:37.569> obviously<00:03:37.840> we<00:03:38.230> got<00:03:38.319> yellow<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:39.069> white

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
colors obviously we got yellow and white

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.990 
colors obviously we got yellow and white
so<00:03:41.170> these<00:03:41.739> are<00:03:41.920> like<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.069> poppers<00:03:42.549> they<00:03:42.760> walk

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
so these are like the poppers they walk

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.589 
so these are like the poppers they walk
tremendously<00:03:43.930> in<00:03:44.319> open<00:03:45.099> water<00:03:45.360> once<00:03:46.360> you<00:03:46.450> put

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
tremendously in open water once you put

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:47.789 
tremendously in open water once you put
these<00:03:46.720> things<00:03:46.870> like<00:03:47.110> blue<00:03:47.290> pads<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:47.680> stuff

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
these things like blue pads and stuff

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:48.809 
these things like blue pads and stuff
they're<00:03:48.010> just<00:03:48.040> kind<00:03:48.280> of<00:03:48.310> start<00:03:48.579> coming

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
they're just kind of start coming

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.520 
they're just kind of start coming
straight<00:03:49.060> with<00:03:49.209> a<00:03:49.239> popping<00:03:49.659> action<00:03:49.959> but<00:03:50.140> cool

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
straight with a popping action but cool

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.600 
straight with a popping action but cool
frogs<00:03:50.769> definitely<00:03:51.250> when<00:03:51.370> you<00:03:51.400> need<00:03:51.579> a

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
frogs definitely when you need a

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.710 
frogs definitely when you need a
different<00:03:51.819> kind<00:03:52.000> of<00:03:52.150> action<00:03:52.450> these<00:03:52.569> are

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
different kind of action these are

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.030 
different kind of action these are
definitely<00:03:53.049> something<00:03:53.200> to<00:03:53.349> tie<00:03:53.650> on<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:53.799> lines

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
definitely something to tie on the lines

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.640 
definitely something to tie on the lines
start<00:03:54.280> casting<00:03:54.670> around<00:03:54.730> but<00:03:55.510> cool<00:03:56.230> frogs<00:03:56.440> here

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
start casting around but cool frogs here

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.770 
start casting around but cool frogs here
I<00:03:56.920> also<00:03:57.519> have<00:03:57.790> that<00:03:57.940> frog<00:03:58.209> in<00:03:58.360> a<00:03:58.450> smaller

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
I also have that frog in a smaller

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.390 
I also have that frog in a smaller
version<00:04:01.049> comparable<00:04:02.049> to<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.260> 45t<00:04:03.010> they're

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
version comparable to the 45t they're

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.280 
version comparable to the 45t they're
about<00:04:03.849> the<00:04:04.060> same<00:04:04.239> size<00:04:04.299> this<00:04:04.870> guy's<00:04:05.019> a<00:04:05.049> little

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
about the same size this guy's a little

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.539 
about the same size this guy's a little
smaller<00:04:05.709> so<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:08.410> last<00:04:08.620> one<00:04:08.799> is<00:04:08.859> the<00:04:08.920> scum<00:04:09.310> frog

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
smaller so the last one is the scum frog

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.569 
smaller so the last one is the scum frog
Bigfoot<00:04:10.030> I<00:04:10.269> had<00:04:11.230> this<00:04:11.410> frog<00:04:11.590> forever<00:04:11.950> caught

and it's just one of those frogs he keep
as<00:04:19.030> a<00:04:19.060> memory<00:04:19.239> kind<00:04:19.570> of<00:04:19.630> thing<00:04:20.430> so<00:04:21.430> basically<00:04:22.030> I

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
as a memory kind of thing so basically I

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.719 
as a memory kind of thing so basically I
mean<00:04:22.780> there's<00:04:23.410> my<00:04:23.530> boatloads<00:04:24.070> of<00:04:24.280> scum<00:04:24.460> frogs

all the bodies coppers everything and go
into<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.300> modification<00:04:28.990> for<00:04:29.350> you<00:04:29.680> show<00:04:29.919> you

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
into a modification for you show you

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
way down to where the skirt exits the

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.750 
way down to where the skirt exits the
Frog<00:05:00.220> and<00:05:00.550> just<00:05:01.080> snip<00:05:02.080> it<00:05:02.229> off<00:05:02.430> so<00:05:03.430> I<00:05:03.490> got<00:05:03.639> all

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
Frog and just snip it off so I got all

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.909 
Frog and just snip it off so I got all
this<00:05:03.910> skirt<00:05:04.180> off<00:05:04.479> of<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:04.840> Frog<00:05:05.080> what<00:05:05.740> that's

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
this skirt off of the Frog what that's

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.010 
this skirt off of the Frog what that's
helping<00:05:06.280> you<00:05:06.340> do<00:05:06.520> is<00:05:06.820> helps<00:05:07.270> the<00:05:07.419> Frog<00:05:07.720> walk

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
helping you do is helps the Frog walk

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.689 
helping you do is helps the Frog walk
and<00:05:08.289> it<00:05:08.560> gives<00:05:08.710> you<00:05:08.800> better<00:05:08.949> hookup<00:05:09.340> ratios

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
and it gives you better hookup ratios

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.870 
and it gives you better hookup ratios
there's<00:05:10.030> less<00:05:11.010> less<00:05:12.010> material<00:05:12.520> in<00:05:12.699> the<00:05:12.789> way

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
there's less less material in the way

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.450 
there's less less material in the way
for<00:05:12.910> your<00:05:13.120> hook<00:05:13.300> start<00:05:13.570> so<00:05:14.440> just<00:05:15.130> trim<00:05:15.280> half

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
for your hook start so just trim half

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.170 
for your hook start so just trim half
the<00:05:15.639> skirt<00:05:15.820> off<00:05:16.030> and<00:05:16.740> then<00:05:17.789> you<00:05:18.789> can<00:05:18.940> always

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
the skirt off and then you can always

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.580 
the skirt off and then you can always
take<00:05:19.539> a<00:05:19.810> little<00:05:20.169> bit<00:05:20.440> I'm<00:05:20.860> talking<00:05:22.349> that<00:05:23.349> much

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
take a little bit I'm talking that much

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.710 
take a little bit I'm talking that much
I<00:05:23.800> mean<00:05:23.830> it's<00:05:24.160> like<00:05:24.340> a<00:05:24.550> centimeter<00:05:25.090> of<00:05:25.360> skirt

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
I mean it's like a centimeter of skirt

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.060 
I mean it's like a centimeter of skirt
movie<00:05:25.900> material<00:05:26.139> and<00:05:26.500> cut<00:05:26.650> it<00:05:26.740> straight<00:05:26.949> down
