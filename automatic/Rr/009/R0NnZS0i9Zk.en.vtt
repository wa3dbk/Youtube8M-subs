is only fifty six thousand and so that's

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.350 
is only fifty six thousand and so that's
about<00:00:41.700> half<00:00:42.239> now<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.379> reason<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.520> I

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
about half now the reason for that is I

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.600
