 the crown of the category to conquer 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.820
 Now lotus sends a car again 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.770

 we will succeed or not 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.989
 right now as usual in view of 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.110

 Located in the category 694 as 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.560
 Performance index working under the hood 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.600
 298 kw 410 newton meters the whole 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.190
 1,250 kilograms it is good six points 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.039
 to forgive and the points has herrn 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.720
 potato also found it 700 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.399
 performance index i believe the bars 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.200
 have remained unchanged too 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.410
 the performance data of the 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.149
 motors continue to be 298 kw 410 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.840
 newtonmeter but the car still has one 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.819
 kilograms slimmed down now weighs 1249 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.240
 kilogram acceleration value of zero 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:33.099
 to 100 4 seconds top speed 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.539
 291 km / h look down on the 

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:36.520
 detect lateral acceleration it to 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.470
 Let's venture really well around the corners 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.479
 goes as usual also a few 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.340
 take information on the car itself 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.179
 I am the basis for this racing car 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.679
 the normal lotus evora but here 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.289
 was heavily modified after four 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.119
 the regulation was changed that is the 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.630
 motor does a bit more 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.190
 400 ps lets you dare 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.860
 six cylinder of the v6 engine out of the house 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.300
 toyota now on the rear axle los the 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.250
 dare has also slimmed a bit 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.130
 namely 200 kilos compared to 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.630
 series model , especially in the 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.640
 interior was found 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.590
 the body is apart from that 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.410
 giant tail wings and the cup of user 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.780
 the car is almost unchanged 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.650
 18 inch wheels with slick tires 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.750
 are equipped 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.959
 behind the due squats a six 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.459
 piston brake system from ap racing too 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.600
 the tank was changed a bit 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.880
 namely 11 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.810
 Now for long distance races optimizes a 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.630
 up to 120 liters is switched 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.300
 befitting in a six-course 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.980
 sequential gear well one more 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.690
 look if I have something here now 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.160
 have forgotten no as said it is 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.060
 a thoroughbred race car for nothing 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.990
 The street has no 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.120
 street use 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.070
 But now it's time for us to do that 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.130
 our racer in these for him 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:54.330
 actually set passable car 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.920
 Some say he can with his eyes 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.590
 get cylinder heads but you know the 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.910
 just under the name tom stick and he 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.530
 shows up here now I think 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.940
 times he will feel relatively comfortable because 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.050
 real racer belongs 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.820
 real race car 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.950
 we also see the little one here 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.240
 roll cage the huge 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.520
 rear wing of the open not for 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.560
 contact pressure is ensured by a digital speedometer 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.120
 if the mice are cinema and otherwise yes 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.980
 everything outside we are also here the door 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.380
 pamela's municipalities so here was 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.580
 lightweight extremely good with 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.710
 light schubs we go 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.120
 as usual a bit outside 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.860
 impressions again with freedom 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.390
 go in wilson foam engine 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.650
 it's actually cold 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.660
 just go in the pants we see here 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.070
 a light slide but everything 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.840
 controllable tomsic is here too 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.370
 already full can on the grass 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.590
 on it we would be here now in chicago 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.360
 give in and we see how it is 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.920
 looks mature already the optimal 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.750
 temperature found because we see here 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.450
 no bit not slip at all 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.520
 the far more than 400 ps will be here 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.890
 neatly on the street we brought 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.720
 now headhead hammerhead fly that way 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.800
 is a left right change and the 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.420
 tree or let's see if here 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.790
 to see the smurf is easier 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.930
 Brake system glows from and behind the 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.150
 means he was quite a bit on the 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.770
 brake balance on changed namely that 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.260
 not just on the front axle 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.930
 Brakes here also no trace of slippage 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.890
 direction of o2 is now flatout 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.170
 that means full throttle no licking no 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.720
 absolutely nothing on the pile of tires over 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.780
 and that looks like it would 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.090
 here in train for the course has the 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.890
 Braking on the penultimate turn we 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.780
 are here to equal a whole 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.030
 Lightweight meets all four wheels 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.800
 Now we wish to use in Gemen Rhein 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.540
 the entire roadway width over the 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.040
 hill and over the line over and it 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.530
 was another look what the dare 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.419
 we have seen around the current 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.750
 best time of the box set up with one 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:44.210
 minute 14 976 1 minute we have already 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:47.160
 even a minute 14 hammer already 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.850
 Now it's tight boxer or lotus 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.000
 kickboxer lotus ford lotus and it is yes 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.090
 lotus with a minute 14 37 9 and so on 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.370
 has this race car in 1st place 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.260
 the skd brie and I have to 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.710
 say well deserved because the thing went 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.870
 really like a hot knife through 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.690
 Ice cold butter so better you can 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.800
 Do not build a car to the end 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.530
 a little look at that 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.080
 current class as it currently in the it 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.240
 category looks we see the top 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.970
 Now up to date terror potato in the lotus 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.800
 evora followed by the boxer both with one
