dread bores and if they run like heroes

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.000 
dread bores and if they run like heroes
downfalls<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.989> things<00:00:34.110> like<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.260> they<00:00:34.860> can

downfalls and things like that they can

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.110 
downfalls and things like that they can
be<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> bit<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.340> an<00:00:35.430> issue<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.880> think<00:00:35.940> that

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
be a bit of an issue but I think that

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.240 
be a bit of an issue but I think that
it's<00:00:36.329> pretty<00:00:36.480> even<00:00:36.870> as<00:00:37.020> we<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:37.950> just<00:00:38.070> take<00:00:38.219> a

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
it's pretty even as we can just take a

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.610 
it's pretty even as we can just take a
lot<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.489> games<00:00:38.760> with<00:00:39.270> them<00:00:39.540> not<00:00:40.200> having<00:00:40.260> an

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
lot of games with them not having an

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.750 
lot of games with them not having an
answer<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:40.920> their<00:00:41.040> hand<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.370> just<00:00:41.460> doing<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
answer in their hand and just doing the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.190 
answer in their hand and just doing the
second<00:00:42.000> turn<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.300> Arthur<00:00:42.719> Chen<00:00:42.870> colonial

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200

Hydra<00:00:43.530> again<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.399> deck<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.640> anything<00:00:45.059> but

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
Hydra again this deck is anything but

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.810 
Hydra again this deck is anything but
complete<00:00:46.200> there's<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.530> few<00:00:46.739> cards<00:00:47.070> that

probably need to be switched out our man

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.110 
probably need to be switched out our man
obeys<00:00:49.980> probably<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> little<00:00:50.789> bit<00:00:51.000> more

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120

sideboard against those type of I think
coarser<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> right<00:01:03.030> deck<00:01:03.270> or<00:01:03.510> right<00:01:04.260> card

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
coarser is the right deck or right card

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
I probably want to try out as like a one

I probably want to try out as like a one
of<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> main<00:01:23.939> board<00:01:24.180> as<00:01:24.500> we<00:01:25.500> do<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.740> ways

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
of in the main board as we do have ways

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.090 
of in the main board as we do have ways
to<00:01:27.229> put<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.290> out<00:01:28.350> first<00:01:28.560> turn<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.950> could

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
to put it out first turn that could

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.700 
to put it out first turn that could
actually<00:01:29.189> accelerate<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.119> bit<00:01:31.020> faster<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.680> I

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
actually accelerate a bit faster so I

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.899 
actually accelerate a bit faster so I
think<00:01:31.890> he's<00:01:32.009> going<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.159> put<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> one<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.670> elvish

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
think the seven is perfect i for the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.990 
think the seven is perfect i for the
heinous<00:01:46.530> are<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> little<00:01:46.979> bit<00:01:47.159> weird<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.700> they

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
heinous are a little bit weird and they

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.069 
heinous are a little bit weird and they
usually<00:01:48.240> end<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.360> cutting<00:01:48.570> them<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:48.930> i'm<00:01:48.990> going

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
usually end up cutting them so i'm going

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.480 
usually end up cutting them so i'm going
to<00:01:49.140> put<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.290> 1<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> village<00:01:49.799> mystic<00:01:50.130> main<00:01:50.280> board

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
to put a 1 a village mystic main board

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.249 
to put a 1 a village mystic main board
and<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:51.030> allows<00:01:51.329> us<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.570> kind<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.899> go<00:01:52.020> this

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
and this allows us to kind of go this

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.810 
and this allows us to kind of go this
this<00:01:52.500> course<00:01:52.740> or<00:01:52.860> crew<00:01:53.009> fix<00:01:53.189> da<00:01:53.399> morire<00:01:53.640> out

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
this course or crew fix da morire out

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.359 
this course or crew fix da morire out
and<00:01:54.149> i<00:01:54.899> think<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.680> one<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.950> da<00:01:56.100> Marie's

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
and i think just a one of da Marie's

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.130 
and i think just a one of da Marie's
probably<00:01:56.729> or<00:01:56.880> two<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.180> Dom<00:01:57.299> DOM<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.719> probably

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
probably or two of Dom DOM is probably

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.410 
probably or two of Dom DOM is probably
fine<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:59.009> cut<00:01:59.219> one<00:01:59.549> more<00:01:59.729> reclamation

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
fine and we cut one more reclamation

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.440 
fine and we cut one more reclamation
sage<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.020> i<00:02:01.770> think<00:02:02.009> i'm<00:02:02.100> going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.460> put<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.969> 10

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
sage and i think i'm going to put a 10

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.180 
sage and i think i'm going to put a 10

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
package here these four in here and then

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.229 
package here these four in here and then
take<00:02:17.670> out<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.299> solo<00:02:18.540> Chandalar<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:20.239> maybe

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
take out the solo Chandalar and maybe

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.580 
take out the solo Chandalar and maybe
even<00:02:21.360> master<00:02:21.780> cruelty<00:02:22.049> is<00:02:22.110> just<00:02:22.290> all<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
even master cruelty is just all the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.160 
even master cruelty is just all the
slower<00:02:22.980> cards<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.670> then<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.690> then<00:02:24.840> put<00:02:25.019> these

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
slower cards and then and then put these

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.600 
slower cards and then and then put these
guys<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.500> we'd<00:02:25.650> even<00:02:25.799> put<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> dread<00:02:26.250> bore<00:02:26.430> out

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610

guys and we'd even put a dread bore out
our<00:02:26.879> dread<00:02:27.330> borean<00:02:27.629> so<00:02:27.870> what<00:02:28.379> I<00:02:28.409> do<00:02:28.500> is

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
our dread borean so what I do is

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.160 
our dread borean so what I do is
probably<00:02:28.860> take<00:02:29.099> out<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.250> shadow-born<00:02:29.549> demon

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
probably take out a shadow-born demon

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.420 
probably take out a shadow-born demon
soil<00:02:31.170> Chandalar<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:33.799> probably<00:02:34.799> between<00:02:35.129> the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
soil Chandalar and probably between the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.030 
soil Chandalar and probably between the
four<00:02:35.670> Sator<00:02:36.360> hedonist<00:02:36.840> or<00:02:37.080> life's<00:02:37.290> legacy<00:02:37.500> and

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
four Sator hedonist or life's legacy and

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.920 
four Sator hedonist or life's legacy and
wow<00:02:38.580> we<00:02:38.760> have<00:02:38.849> to<00:02:38.879> life's<00:02:39.209> legacies<00:02:39.629> I<00:02:39.720> think

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
wow we have to life's legacies I think

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.240 
wow we have to life's legacies I think
that<00:02:40.049> just<00:02:40.079> a<00:02:40.379> one<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:42.349> ya<00:02:43.349> one<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.860> their<00:02:44.040> we<00:02:44.129> go

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
that just a one of ya one of their we go

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.680 
that just a one of ya one of their we go
we<00:02:44.370> can<00:02:44.489> take<00:02:44.579> another<00:02:44.819> life's<00:02:45.090> legacy<00:02:45.299> and

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
we can take another life's legacy and

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.080 
we can take another life's legacy and

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
put in a scavenging news and now we even

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.059 
put in a scavenging news and now we even
have<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.269> better<00:02:48.599> better<00:02:49.049> way<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.290> deal<00:02:49.769> with<00:02:49.799> it

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
have a better better way to deal with it

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.550 
have a better better way to deal with it
with<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.400> scouting<00:02:50.670> uses<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:52.019> coerce<00:02:52.260> or<00:02:52.349> crew

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
with to scouting uses to coerce or crew

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.430 
with to scouting uses to coerce or crew
fixes<00:02:53.040> in<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:54.060> sideboard<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.720> then<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.140> one

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
fixes in the sideboard and then that one

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.690 
fixes in the sideboard and then that one
of<00:02:55.530> those<00:02:55.620> mystic<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.099> think<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.340> makes<00:02:56.489> it<00:02:56.640> a

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
of those mystic I think it makes it a

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.960 
of those mystic I think it makes it a
lot<00:02:57.060> better<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.319> matchup<00:02:58.560> as<00:02:59.430> we<00:02:59.730> do<00:02:59.849> have

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
lot better of a matchup as we do have

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.900 
lot better of a matchup as we do have
some<00:03:00.090> outs<00:03:00.239> versus<00:03:00.569> the<00:03:00.629> burn<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.910> you

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
some outs versus the burn so and you

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.220 
some outs versus the burn so and you
know<00:03:03.000> those<00:03:03.150> cards<00:03:03.420> aren't<00:03:03.540> terrible<00:03:03.900> the

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
know those cards aren't terrible the

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.809 
know those cards aren't terrible the
course<00:03:04.470> or<00:03:04.560> graphics<00:03:04.859> is<00:03:05.069> in<00:03:05.129> terrible<00:03:05.340> versus

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
course or graphics is in terrible versus

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.059 
course or graphics is in terrible versus
the<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.780> Jun<00:03:07.109> planeswalkers<00:03:07.680> so<00:03:07.829> the<00:03:07.920> two

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
the the Jun planeswalkers so the two

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.500 
the the Jun planeswalkers so the two
decks<00:03:08.250> we<00:03:08.400> lost<00:03:08.609> against<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:09.000> think<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:09.299> makes

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
decks we lost against I think this makes

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.380 
decks we lost against I think this makes
it<00:03:09.599> a<00:03:09.690> little<00:03:09.810> bit<00:03:09.959> better<00:03:10.079> I<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:11.250> still<00:03:12.239> do<00:03:12.359> like

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
it a little bit better I I still do like

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.660 
it a little bit better I I still do like
that<00:03:12.660> one<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.989> life's<00:03:13.200> legacy<00:03:13.379> I<00:03:13.799> don't<00:03:14.609> know

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
that one of life's legacy I don't know

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.979 
that one of life's legacy I don't know
we'll<00:03:14.849> test<00:03:15.060> around<00:03:15.359> with<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:15.690> see<00:03:15.720> if<00:03:15.840> it's

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
we'll test around with it to see if it's

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.300 
we'll test around with it to see if it's
worth<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.379> just<00:03:16.530> killing<00:03:16.829> that<00:03:16.920> underworld

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
worth it just killing that underworld

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.220 
worth it just killing that underworld
servers<00:03:17.700> for<00:03:17.849> life's<00:03:18.060> legacy<00:03:18.209> seems<00:03:18.690> really

in<00:05:04.980> the<00:05:05.040> comments<00:05:05.310> what<00:05:05.400> cards<00:05:05.640> you<00:05:05.670> to<00:05:05.730> take

in the comments what cards you to take

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.400 
in the comments what cards you to take
out<00:05:06.000> put<00:05:06.330> in<00:05:06.480> I<00:05:06.600> think<00:05:06.780> we<00:05:06.870> can<00:05:06.960> actually<00:05:07.140> make

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
out put in I think we can actually make

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.890 
out put in I think we can actually make
this<00:05:07.500> more<00:05:07.710> competitive<00:05:08.100> again<00:05:08.730> the<00:05:08.900> dredge

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
this more competitive again the dredge

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.390 
this more competitive again the dredge
deck<00:05:10.140> started<00:05:10.560> out<00:05:10.650> as<00:05:10.770> kind<00:05:11.010> of<00:05:11.040> a<00:05:11.130> very

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
deck started out as kind of a very

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.030 
deck started out as kind of a very
poorly<00:05:12.330> built<00:05:12.540> deck<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.020> i<00:05:13.110> ended<00:05:13.650> up<00:05:13.710> tuning

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
poorly built deck and i ended up tuning

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.950 
poorly built deck and i ended up tuning
it<00:05:14.130> enough<00:05:14.340> to<00:05:14.490> where<00:05:14.640> you<00:05:15.150> know<00:05:15.240> it<00:05:15.510> gave<00:05:15.810> me<00:05:15.900> a

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
it enough to where you know it gave me a

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.270 
it enough to where you know it gave me a
top-eight<00:05:16.290> finish<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:16.770> i'm<00:05:16.830> thinking<00:05:16.980> that

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
top-eight finish and i'm thinking that

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.070 
top-eight finish and i'm thinking that
this<00:05:17.370> deck<00:05:17.640> is<00:05:17.820> definitely<00:05:18.330> my<00:05:18.420> style<00:05:18.480> i'm

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
this deck is definitely my style i'm

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.590 
this deck is definitely my style i'm
definitely<00:05:19.650> more<00:05:19.800> of<00:05:20.010> a<00:05:20.160> synergy<00:05:21.150> gender

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
definitely more of a synergy gender

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.300 
definitely more of a synergy gender
synergy<00:05:22.020> actually<00:05:22.290> black<00:05:22.500> green<00:05:22.770> player<00:05:23.040> and

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
synergy actually black green player and

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.280 
synergy actually black green player and
this<00:05:23.670> is<00:05:23.880> right<00:05:24.030> up<00:05:24.060> my<00:05:24.180> alley<00:05:24.300> so<00:05:24.810> I'm<00:05:25.050> hoping

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
this is right up my alley so I'm hoping

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.050 
this is right up my alley so I'm hoping

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
to actually make this this deck work I

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.430 
to actually make this this deck work I
think<00:05:27.210> generation<00:05:27.600> urban<00:05:27.810> again<00:05:28.020> generators

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
think generation urban again generators

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.140 
think generation urban again generators
