00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.759
 your career 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.860
 Well, that's a real challenge 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.090
 to go from 2 euros to 4 euros if you want 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.750

 It handles do not made in offer is 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:10.360

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.750
 it's to test the car or dakar 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.670

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.479
 really a very beautiful course and 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.960

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.040
