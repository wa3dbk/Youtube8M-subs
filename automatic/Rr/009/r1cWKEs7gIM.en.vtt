00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
think it might be I think it might be

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.510 
think it might be I think it might be
and<00:00:51.329> I'm<00:00:51.420> rather<00:00:51.899> rather<00:00:52.649> sad<00:00:52.980> about<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.399> cuz

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
and I'm rather rather sad about that cuz

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.889 
and I'm rather rather sad about that cuz
I<00:00:53.579> mean<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.730> love<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.180> game<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.449> loved<00:00:54.750> the

storyline<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.530> think<00:00:55.890> there's<00:00:56.070> still<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.460> much

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
storyline I think there's still so much

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.790 
storyline I think there's still so much
more<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:57.000> needs<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.750> answered<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.649> it

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
more that needs to be answered in it

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.410 
more that needs to be answered in it

five<00:01:08.369> nights<00:01:08.580> at<00:01:08.729> Freddy's<00:01:09.030> might<00:01:09.840> be

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
five nights at Freddy's might be

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.380
