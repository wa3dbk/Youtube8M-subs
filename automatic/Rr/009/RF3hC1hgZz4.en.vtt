00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
in my opinion a little bit because when

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.980 
in my opinion a little bit because when
you<00:01:32.579> keep<00:01:32.759> pulling<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.180> too<00:01:33.329> tight<00:01:33.600> or<00:01:33.869> you're

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
pulling it too loose a lot of times you

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.670 
pulling it too loose a lot of times you
can<00:01:35.640> tend<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.970> get<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.869> bending<00:01:37.290> more<00:01:37.530> than

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
change it one one mark up it only moves

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.839 
change it one one mark up it only moves
it<00:05:19.599> in<00:05:19.690> our<00:05:19.900> increments<00:05:20.650> the<00:05:21.400> minute<00:05:21.669> hand

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
it in our increments the minute hand

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:23.040 
it in our increments the minute hand
stops<00:05:22.210> so<00:05:22.479> this<00:05:22.599> way<00:05:22.750> you<00:05:22.810> don't<00:05:22.930> have<00:05:22.960> to

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
stops so this way you don't have to

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.920 
stops so this way you don't have to
worry<00:05:23.229> about<00:05:23.409> setting<00:05:23.620> the<00:05:23.800> minutes<00:05:24.099> any<00:05:24.250> hour

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
worry about setting the minutes any hour

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.570 
worry about setting the minutes any hour
so<00:05:25.930> that's<00:05:26.080> one<00:05:26.349> handy<00:05:26.680> feature<00:05:29.010> and<00:05:30.010> going

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
so that's one handy feature and going

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.200 
so that's one handy feature and going
back<00:05:30.729> to<00:05:30.909> setting<00:05:31.210> the<00:05:31.300> time<00:05:32.820> click<00:05:33.820> it<00:05:33.940> in<00:05:34.060> one

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
back to setting the time click it in one

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.029 
back to setting the time click it in one
spot<00:05:36.719> another<00:05:37.719> nice<00:05:37.960> thing<00:05:37.990> is<00:05:38.380> it's<00:05:38.560> got<00:05:38.710> two

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
spot another nice thing is it's got two

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.580 
spot another nice thing is it's got two
hours<00:05:39.370> two<00:05:39.880> hours<00:05:39.909> so<00:05:40.870> if<00:05:41.020> you're<00:05:41.140> moving<00:05:41.320> up

hours two hours so if you're moving up
the<00:05:41.710> dial<00:05:41.950> the<00:05:42.460> second<00:05:42.820> arrow<00:05:42.940> takes<00:05:43.240> over<00:05:43.539> so

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:43.719 
the dial the second arrow takes over so

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:44.880 
the dial the second arrow takes over so
this<00:05:43.810> way<00:05:43.960> you<00:05:44.020> just<00:05:44.229> move<00:05:44.409> it<00:05:44.530> right<00:05:44.650> over

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
this way you just move it right over

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.339 
this way you just move it right over
there<00:05:45.010> and<00:05:45.370> as<00:05:46.150> you<00:05:46.330> can<00:05:46.450> see<00:05:46.659> it<00:05:46.810> goes<00:05:46.960> back<00:05:47.200> to

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 
there and as you can see it goes back to

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:49.080 
there and as you can see it goes back to
the<00:05:47.440> time<00:05:47.979> that<00:05:48.039> you<00:05:48.250> wanted<00:05:48.520> to<00:05:48.700> keep<00:05:48.909> you

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
automatically starts from zero another

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.460 
automatically starts from zero another
thing<00:06:46.400> I<00:06:46.490> like<00:06:46.670> about<00:06:46.700> it<00:06:47.060> is<00:06:47.210> clicking<00:06:48.170> it<00:06:48.290> one
