 the ant hill 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.430

 Throw the car running 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:17.819
 the six-wheeled team was another experience that did not 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:21.199
 in the late 70's 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.529
 boosted formula 1 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:25.529

 That's what my fan of the actor is. 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:03.610
 with the passage from the 80's to the 80's, formula 1 met a new and 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.729
 big talent 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.650

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.169
 two time champion 

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:40.459
