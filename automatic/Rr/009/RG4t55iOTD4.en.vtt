of honoring our commitments is huge fact

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.200 
of honoring our commitments is huge fact
is<00:00:44.420> we<00:00:44.660> simply<00:00:44.840> can't<00:00:45.380> function<00:00:45.800> optimally

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
is we simply can't function optimally

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.819
