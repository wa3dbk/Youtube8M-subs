00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
next to it which will be this one get

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.539 
next to it which will be this one get
the<00:01:14.759> correct<00:01:14.970> tool<00:01:15.890> just<00:01:16.890> remove<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.310> screw

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
the correct tool just remove that screw

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:27.610 
the correct tool just remove that screw
musta<00:01:18.119> time<00:01:18.299> they've<00:01:18.479> got<00:01:18.630> one<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.930> two<00:01:19.080> screws

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.950 

and<00:01:28.490> that's<00:01:28.940> loose<00:01:29.210> then<00:01:29.480> we'll<00:01:29.630> pry<00:01:29.870> it<00:01:29.930> up

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
and that's loose then we'll pry it up

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.880 
and that's loose then we'll pry it up
now<00:01:32.960> usually<00:01:33.140> snap<00:01:33.650> in<00:01:34.330> snap<00:01:35.330> loose<00:01:35.740> lay<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:36.860> to

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
now usually snap in snap loose lay it to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.940 
now usually snap in snap loose lay it to
the<00:01:37.100> side<00:01:37.370> as<00:01:37.990> you<00:01:38.990> can<00:01:39.170> see<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:39.500> this<00:01:39.560> happens

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
the side as you can see and this happens

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.000 
the side as you can see and this happens
a<00:01:40.040> lot<00:01:40.190> in<00:01:40.250> these<00:01:40.490> sometimes<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:42.020> Wi-Fi<00:01:42.500> card

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
a lot in these sometimes the Wi-Fi card

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.040 
a lot in these sometimes the Wi-Fi card
actually<00:01:43.250> has<00:01:43.670> its<00:01:43.700> own<00:01:44.030> dedicated<00:01:44.180> slop<00:01:44.840> it

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
actually has its own dedicated slop it

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.510 
actually has its own dedicated slop it
in<00:01:45.140> this<00:01:45.260> one<00:01:45.440> it's<00:01:45.590> actually<00:01:45.980> built<00:01:46.190> in<00:01:46.340> with

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
in this one it's actually built in with

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.980 
in this one it's actually built in with
the<00:01:46.670> memory<00:01:46.970> although<00:01:47.150> it's<00:01:47.420> not<00:01:47.480> marked<00:01:47.840> on

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
the memory although it's not marked on

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.930 
the memory although it's not marked on
the<00:01:48.080> outside<00:01:48.470> cover<00:01:48.740> so<00:01:49.370> if<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:49.580> ever<00:01:49.670> have

it does have two and this particular

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.790 
it does have two and this particular
memory<00:02:04.850> is<00:02:05.000> on<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.270> top<00:02:05.420> slot<00:02:05.810> so<00:02:06.440> we<00:02:06.560> want<00:02:06.740> to

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
memory is on the top slot so we want to

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.169 
memory is on the top slot so we want to
add<00:02:06.920> one<00:02:07.070> below<00:02:07.130> it<00:02:07.370> so<00:02:07.550> we<00:02:07.670> have<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:07.940> remove

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
add one below it so we have to remove

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.460 
add one below it so we have to remove
this<00:02:08.420> one<00:02:08.660> what<00:02:08.780> we're<00:02:08.899> going<00:02:08.990> to<00:02:09.110> do<00:02:09.200> is<00:02:09.290> drop

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
this one what we're going to do is drop

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.680 
this one what we're going to do is drop
it<00:02:09.679> down<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:09.890> slot<00:02:10.280> so<00:02:11.030> what<00:02:11.180> we<00:02:11.300> actually<00:02:11.480> want

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
it down a slot so what we actually want

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.810 
it down a slot so what we actually want
to<00:02:11.900> do<00:02:12.050> is<00:02:12.290> on<00:02:12.440> each<00:02:12.560> side<00:02:12.860> of<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.070> RAM<00:02:13.340> next<00:02:13.730> to

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
to do is on each side of the RAM next to

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.920 
to do is on each side of the RAM next to
the<00:02:13.940> notch<00:02:14.120> you'll<00:02:14.390> see<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.570> little<00:02:14.720> metal

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
the notch you'll see a little metal

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.980 
the notch you'll see a little metal
plate<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:16.250> want<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.520> barely<00:02:16.790> pull<00:02:17.660> them<00:02:17.810> to

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
plate you want to barely pull them to

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.780 
plate you want to barely pull them to
the<00:02:18.020> side<00:02:18.140> until<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:19.490> RAM<00:02:19.670> flips<00:02:20.060> up<00:02:20.300> like<00:02:21.230> so

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
the side until the RAM flips up like so

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.270 
the side until the RAM flips up like so
pull<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.940> RAM<00:02:23.170> straight<00:02:24.170> back<00:02:26.980> what<00:02:27.980> we<00:02:28.100> want

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
pull the RAM straight back what we want

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.830 
pull the RAM straight back what we want
to<00:02:28.340> do<00:02:28.430> next<00:02:28.640> is<00:02:28.970> flip<00:02:29.210> it<00:02:29.300> over<00:02:29.420> I've<00:02:29.630> got

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
to do next is flip it over I've got

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.199 
to do next is flip it over I've got
quite<00:02:29.990> a<00:02:30.080> bit<00:02:30.230> of<00:02:30.290> ram<00:02:30.530> laying<00:02:30.740> around<00:02:31.070> we<00:02:32.030> want

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
quite a bit of ram laying around we want

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.850 
quite a bit of ram laying around we want
to<00:02:32.270> match<00:02:32.420> it<00:02:32.600> up<00:02:32.690> as<00:02:32.900> far<00:02:33.110> as<00:02:33.320> this<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.650> 1

this right here this will match you know
you've<00:02:51.200> got<00:02:51.610> different<00:02:52.610> types<00:02:53.090> but<00:02:53.330> you<00:02:53.420> just

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
you've got different types but you just

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.720 
you've got different types but you just
want<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.780> match<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.170> speeds<00:02:54.440> on<00:02:54.650> those<00:02:54.860> ok<00:02:55.670> so

what<00:02:56.000> we're<00:02:56.120> going<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.300> do<00:02:56.450> is<00:02:56.720> take<00:02:57.650> one<00:02:57.860> of

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
what we're going to do is take one of

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.070 
what we're going to do is take one of
the<00:02:58.040> sticks<00:02:58.310> of<00:02:58.430> ram<00:02:58.670> place<00:02:59.420> it<00:02:59.630> in<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.720> bottom

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
the sticks of ram place it in the bottom

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.810 
the sticks of ram place it in the bottom
spot<00:03:00.410> really<00:03:01.370> carefully<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:04.370> want<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:04.610> do<00:03:04.700> is

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
spot really carefully you want to do is

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.330 
spot really carefully you want to do is
push<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.180> all<00:03:05.270> the<00:03:05.300> way<00:03:05.450> in<00:03:05.540> until<00:03:06.080> all<00:03:06.860> the

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
push it all the way in until all the

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.190 
push it all the way in until all the
little<00:03:07.580> gold<00:03:07.820> traces<00:03:08.420> are<00:03:08.630> just<00:03:08.810> about<00:03:08.989> even

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
little gold traces are just about even

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.440 
little gold traces are just about even
with<00:03:09.470> this<00:03:09.590> cover<00:03:10.459> as<00:03:10.760> close<00:03:11.090> as<00:03:11.239> you<00:03:11.300> can<00:03:11.360> get

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
with this cover as close as you can get

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.910 
with this cover as close as you can get
it<00:03:11.570> you<00:03:11.630> want<00:03:11.810> it<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:11.989> be<00:03:12.080> even<00:03:12.440> you<00:03:12.530> don't<00:03:12.709> want

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
it you want it to be even you don't want

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.530 
it you want it to be even you don't want
so<00:03:13.190> much<00:03:13.310> sticking<00:03:13.640> out<00:03:13.850> here<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:14.180> then<00:03:14.269> twice

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
so much sticking out here and then twice

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.970 
so much sticking out here and then twice
as<00:03:14.750> much<00:03:14.870> sticking<00:03:15.200> on<00:03:15.350> this<00:03:15.530> side<00:03:15.709> that<00:03:15.860> means

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
as much sticking on this side that means

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.310 
as much sticking on this side that means
you<00:03:16.190> don't<00:03:16.370> have<00:03:16.430> it<00:03:16.670> in<00:03:16.790> right<00:03:17.060> so<00:03:17.989> once<00:03:18.200> you

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
you don't have it in right so once you

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.650 
you don't have it in right so once you
do<00:03:18.440> that<00:03:18.470> press<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.400> down<00:03:19.430> until<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.940> clicks

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.880 

like<00:03:23.660> so<00:03:23.959> now<00:03:24.920> we<00:03:24.980> have<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.400> first<00:03:25.550> stick<00:03:25.880> in

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
like so now we have the first stick in

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.250 
like so now we have the first stick in
take<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:27.920> second<00:03:28.459> one<00:03:28.519> just<00:03:28.760> like<00:03:29.209> that<00:03:29.269> one

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.900 

excuse<00:03:33.260> me<00:03:33.410> you<00:03:34.100> want<00:03:34.280> to<00:03:34.340> line<00:03:34.459> this<00:03:34.640> little

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
excuse me you want to line this little

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.250 
excuse me you want to line this little
notch<00:03:35.030> up<00:03:35.300> there's<00:03:35.540> a<00:03:35.600> little<00:03:35.780> notch<00:03:35.930> on<00:03:36.170> the

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
notch up there's a little notch on the

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.750 
notch up there's a little notch on the
inside<00:03:36.620> of<00:03:36.650> this<00:03:36.920> here<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:37.220> want<00:03:37.519> to<00:03:37.579> line<00:03:37.730> it

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
inside of this here you want to line it

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.460 
inside of this here you want to line it
up<00:03:37.970> with<00:03:38.030> it

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.880 

push<00:03:42.470> it<00:03:42.650> in<00:03:43.180> you<00:03:44.180> want<00:03:44.360> to<00:03:44.420> push<00:03:44.569> it<00:03:44.600> down

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
push it in you want to push it down

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.980 
push it in you want to push it down
until<00:03:45.890> it<00:03:46.130> snaps<00:03:46.160> again<00:03:48.130> and<00:03:49.750> that's<00:03:50.750> actually

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
until it snaps again and that's actually

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.040 
until it snaps again and that's actually
pretty<00:03:51.410> much<00:03:51.620> it<00:03:51.860> you<00:03:52.130> just<00:03:52.480> that<00:03:53.480> is<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:53.930> as

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
pretty much it you just that is it as

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.690 
pretty much it you just that is it as
far<00:03:54.230> as<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:55.280> RAM<00:03:55.520> goes<00:03:57.160> put<00:03:58.160> your<00:03:58.310> cover<00:03:58.489> back

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
far as the RAM goes put your cover back

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.790 
far as the RAM goes put your cover back

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
in you'll notice a lot of times with

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.120 
in you'll notice a lot of times with
newer<00:04:01.010> laptops<00:04:02.290> these<00:04:03.290> little<00:04:03.590> snaps<00:04:03.890> that

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
newer laptops these little snaps that

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.500 
newer laptops these little snaps that
are<00:04:04.250> in<00:04:04.340> here<00:04:04.580> they're<00:04:04.760> real<00:04:04.910> easier<00:04:05.209> breaks

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
are in here they're real easier breaks

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.120 
are in here they're real easier breaks
will<00:04:05.720> be<00:04:05.810> careful<00:04:06.170> and<00:04:06.260> actually<00:04:06.680> go<00:04:06.830> under

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
will be careful and actually go under

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.910 
will be careful and actually go under
the<00:04:07.250> lip<00:04:07.400> on<00:04:07.580> each<00:04:07.730> side<00:04:08.000> here<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:09.560> easiest

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
the lip on each side here the easiest

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.860 
the lip on each side here the easiest
way<00:04:10.100> to<00:04:10.160> do<00:04:10.340> it<00:04:10.459> that<00:04:10.489> I've<00:04:10.700> noticed<00:04:10.940> is<00:04:11.330> if<00:04:11.750> you

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
way to do it that I've noticed is if you

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.509 
way to do it that I've noticed is if you
can<00:04:12.020> take<00:04:12.170> your<00:04:12.350> thumb<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:12.680> hold<00:04:13.040> up<00:04:13.190> on<00:04:13.340> one

can take your thumb and hold up on one

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.990 
can take your thumb and hold up on one
side<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:13.820> push<00:04:14.330> in<00:04:14.600> that<00:04:15.130> will<00:04:16.130> actually<00:04:16.310> push

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
side and push in that will actually push

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.370 
side and push in that will actually push
that<00:04:17.180> cover<00:04:17.450> underneath<00:04:17.750> there<00:04:18.049> you<00:04:18.140> see<00:04:18.290> how

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380

that cover underneath there you see how
easy<00:04:18.560> that<00:04:18.680> was<00:04:19.299> which<00:04:20.299> on<00:04:20.480> this<00:04:20.660> side<00:04:20.870> it's<00:04:21.079> a

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
easy that was which on this side it's a

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.810 
easy that was which on this side it's a
little<00:04:21.290> bit<00:04:21.380> different<00:04:21.799> if<00:04:21.950> you<00:04:22.130> can<00:04:22.340> push<00:04:22.610> in

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
little bit different if you can push in

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.630 
little bit different if you can push in
