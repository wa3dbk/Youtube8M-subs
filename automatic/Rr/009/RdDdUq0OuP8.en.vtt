00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.300
 Accuracy responsive and the 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.429
 full control over the vehicle straight 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.520
 in extreme situations, that's what 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.890
 counts because the adac and scania search 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.020
 Germany's safest truck driver 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.330
 Participants here, therefore, all have only one 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.640
 goal i want germany safest 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.590
 truck drivers are just for the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.060
 safety because i like the rs but mine 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.920
 professional know-how 4 in this 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.550
 to present competition if the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.120
 register safety first 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.680
 stands 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.290
 you can take experience out there 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.879
 you do not get in normal life 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.129
 36 participants compete against each other 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.840
 everyone is fighting to make it to the final 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.430
 The exams are extremely like that 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:58.170
 Dodge to the centimeter and brake 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:01:00.120
 on wet ground on the brake occurs 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.460
 you do not know him who does not 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.670
 There must be more influence on it 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.140
 feeling more 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.240
 in the skill test must 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.659
 15 tonnes empty weight exactly ranked 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.640
 become 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.740
 the conditions are similar to the everyday 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.600
 Parking space is small only ten minutes 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.710
 have the driver for the whole 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.939
 time is not enough 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.330
 difficult is because the windows 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.250
 the driver side is added to who 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.030
 the outside limit has only touched 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.770
 already lost 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.720
 all participants are with this 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.100
 Examination situation under great pressure 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.810
 most fail as frustrated 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.810
 of course that's a serious thing already 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.210
 I am very pretty 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.549
 ambitious 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.530
 the title of germany safest 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.840
 truck driver is highly competitive 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.460
 but only those who keep their nerves have one 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.460
 chance to climb the staircase 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.200
 which had been properly 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.730
 The competition has many facets 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.980
 Load securing is another 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.930
 test point here too test the 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.210
 participants their personal competence 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.430
 Bound from them you will find out where you really are 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.470
 stand and become all outsiders 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.280
 quickly realized a good truck driver 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.280
 needs a head 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.010
 So I can not just five boxes there 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.360
 The front then put the front 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.970
 We caught that way forward 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.270
 form circuit have but if the ten 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.860
 crates together weigh 26 tons then 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.190
 make music and jump on the whole 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.200
 area gets distributed ten points too 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.610
 Who saves fuel on the eco drive ? 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.660
 horse actually one 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.130
 naturalness 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.560
 but even if the perser under 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.690
 Time pressure is ruled by the leadfoot 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.820
 important that gas take early 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.620
 slight slope we have 40 tons 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.049
 So mass pushes the truck I have 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.489
 completely deplete from the gas 0 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:58.780
 Power has precision in all areas 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.780
 in the search for germany 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.940
 safest truck driver the top priority 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.069
 the pinpoint braking is not 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.430
 only part of the competition but one 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.510
 experience for life 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.579
 the beautiful on this day that actually 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.379
 so that as a situation you can 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.450
 so does not find that you practice here 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.879
 You can also tell where you are 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.440
 Weaken it has horny exciting 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.610
 experience in any case what should 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.129
 actually become a mandatory exercise that 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.590
 every so what you do but who are the 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:30.750
 best three truck driver of today 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.750
 day in third place 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.690

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.489
 hannes timmermanns is the family man 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.500
 otherwise through to a 40 tonner 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.500
 Germany is stunned 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.260
 i went here with 0 8 i 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.260
 I gave everything

 the three best from nrw are their goal 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.690
 a big step closer 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.549
 already in July they are against the 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.300
