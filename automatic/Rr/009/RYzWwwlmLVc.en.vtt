00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.220 
thing about him is his shield is every
like<00:01:47.040> 20<00:01:47.340> or<00:01:47.460> 30<00:01:47.640> seconds<00:01:48.150> he<00:01:48.780> changes<00:01:49.200> his

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
like 20 or 30 seconds he changes his

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.630 
like 20 or 30 seconds he changes his
shield<00:01:49.590> type<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.100> shield<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.490> that's

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
shield type of the shield so that's

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.190 
shield type of the shield so that's
super<00:01:51.030> irritating<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.690> once<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.930> take<00:01:52.080> his

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
super irritating so once you take his

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.500 
super irritating so once you take his
shield<00:01:52.409> down<00:01:52.610> try<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> try<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.150> keep<00:01:54.330> it<00:01:54.479> down

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
shield down try to try to keep it down

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.360 
shield down try to try to keep it down
and<00:01:54.900> do<00:01:55.020> as<00:01:55.140> much<00:01:55.260> damage<00:01:55.320> at<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.070> him<00:01:56.220> as<00:01:56.340> you

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
and do as much damage at to him as you

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.660 
and do as much damage at to him as you
can<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:57.600> basically<00:01:58.140> once<00:01:58.620> you<00:01:58.770> like<00:01:59.460> he's

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
can but basically once you like he's

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.460 
can but basically once you like he's
just<00:01:59.880> gonna<00:02:00.060> pretty<00:02:00.450> much<00:02:00.540> just<00:02:00.780> run<00:02:01.080> his<00:02:01.229> face

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
this is going to be even easier when

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.170 
this is going to be even easier when
