00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
all the films are like that in fact

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.620 
all the films are like that in fact
probably<00:02:40.220> not<00:02:40.340> even<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.610> majority<00:02:40.790> that's

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
probably not even the majority that's

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.300 
probably not even the majority that's
the<00:02:41.810> one<00:02:41.930> kids<00:02:42.200> seem<00:02:42.410> to<00:02:42.440> like<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.829> most<00:02:43.069> and

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
the one kids seem to like the most and

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.610 
the one kids seem to like the most and
it<00:02:43.549> started<00:02:43.910> at<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.180> very<00:02:44.209> beginning<00:02:44.930> Disney

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
it started at the very beginning Disney

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.289 
it started at the very beginning Disney
knew<00:02:45.769> then<00:02:46.010> that<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.310> more<00:02:46.459> timeless<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.120> can

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
knew then that the more timeless you can

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:48.640 
knew then that the more timeless you can
make<00:02:47.480> something<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.019> longer<00:02:48.349> it'll<00:02:48.560> be

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
make something the longer it'll be

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.830 
make something the longer it'll be
around<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:49.430> logically<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.269> makes<00:02:50.450> sense<00:02:50.660> to

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
around so logically it makes sense to

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.930 
around so logically it makes sense to
start<00:02:51.079> off<00:02:51.260> with<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.530> fairy<00:02:51.799> tale<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.250> as<00:02:52.819> the

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:46.920 
the first animated film I think actually

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.310 
the first animated film I think actually
it<00:06:47.400> does<00:06:47.670> hold<00:06:48.030> up<00:06:48.240> for<00:06:48.420> little<00:06:48.660> kids<00:06:48.900> and<00:06:49.140> I've

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.470 
even argue adults is it complex no is it
engaging<00:06:52.830> no<00:06:53.400> but<00:06:54.150> it's<00:06:54.300> emotional

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:54.480 
engaging no but it's emotional

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.290
