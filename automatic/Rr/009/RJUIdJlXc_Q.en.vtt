00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
newer games will require PCI Express but

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
always about an inch if like this is

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.260 
always about an inch if like this is

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
where the PCI slots are the AGP will be

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.119 
where the PCI slots are the AGP will be
about<00:00:54.510> an<00:00:54.690> inch<00:00:54.809> behind<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.860> kind<00:00:56.070> of

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
about an inch behind to kind of

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.250 
about an inch behind to kind of
differentiate<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:57.239> yeah<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:58.410> AGP<00:00:59.989> if<00:01:00.989> you're

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
differentiate it yeah but AGP if you're

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.740 
differentiate it yeah but AGP if you're
thinking<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.710> an<00:01:01.829> AGP<00:01:02.129> video<00:01:02.460> card<00:01:02.670> more<00:01:03.600> than

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
thinking of an AGP video card more than

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.509 
thinking of an AGP video card more than
likely<00:01:03.989> you're<00:01:04.439> needed<00:01:04.949> for<00:01:05.129> video<00:01:05.400> editing

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
likely you're needed for video editing

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.880 
likely you're needed for video editing
or<00:01:05.909> games<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.810> you're<00:01:06.990> thinking<00:01:07.170> about<00:01:07.439> video

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.340 
or games if you're thinking about video
editing<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.490> worth<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.060> money<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.510> maybe

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
editing it's worth the money and maybe
