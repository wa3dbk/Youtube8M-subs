that<00:00:29.550> are<00:00:29.670> unaware<00:00:30.289> this<00:00:31.289> card<00:00:31.679> actually<00:00:32.399> when

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
that are unaware this card actually when

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.860 
that are unaware this card actually when
I<00:00:32.820> flip<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.210> over<00:00:33.300> here<00:00:33.570> you're<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.809> see

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
I flip it over here you're going to see

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.490 
I flip it over here you're going to see
but<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.040> card<00:00:35.280> actually<00:00:35.520> gives<00:00:35.969> me<00:00:36.180> plus<00:00:36.600> 22

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
but this card actually gives me plus 22

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.549 
but this card actually gives me plus 22
speed<00:00:38.010> for<00:00:38.730> my<00:00:38.850> entire<00:00:39.300> team<00:00:39.750> now<00:00:40.379> that

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
speed for my entire team now that

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.460 
actually making this happen because i
really<00:01:06.390> didn't<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.689> any<00:01:06.960> idea<00:01:07.320> what<00:01:07.409> i

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
really didn't have any idea what i

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.560 
really didn't have any idea what i
needed<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.830> do<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.250> actually<00:01:08.430> unlock<00:01:09.180> these

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
needed to do to actually unlock these

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.840 
needed to do to actually unlock these
solo<00:01:09.869> challenges<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.710> mean<00:01:11.220> obviously<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.670> knew

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
solo challenges I mean obviously I knew

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.920 
solo challenges I mean obviously I knew
that<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.030> needed<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.420> get<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.750> write

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
that I needed to get to write

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.690 
that I needed to get to write
chemistry's<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.950> didn't<00:01:14.280> know<00:01:14.340> how<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.520> do

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
chemistry's but I didn't know how to do

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.300 
chemistry's but I didn't know how to do
it<00:01:14.820> effectively<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:17.070> know<00:01:17.159> without

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
it effectively with you know without

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.490 
it effectively with you know without
spending<00:01:17.759> hundreds<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.570> thousands<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.290> coins

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
spending hundreds of thousands of coins

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.219 
spending hundreds of thousands of coins
so<00:01:20.310> what<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.850> ended<00:01:20.909> up<00:01:21.180> doing<00:01:21.240> was<00:01:21.570> looking<00:01:21.780> at

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
so what I ended up doing was looking at

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.740 
so what I ended up doing was looking at
my<00:01:22.320> own<00:01:22.470> reserves<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.270> finding<00:01:24.270> cards<00:01:24.570> that

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
my own reserves and finding cards that

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.960 
my own reserves and finding cards that
had<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.259> right<00:01:25.500> chemistry's<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.700> solo

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
had the right chemistry's for the solo

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.280 
had the right chemistry's for the solo
challenges<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.720> was<00:01:27.900> going<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.049> be<00:01:28.140> doing

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
challenges that I was going to be doing

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.380 
challenges that I was going to be doing
but<00:01:29.040> then<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.220> also<00:01:29.369> went<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.970> auction

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
but then I also went on to the auction

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.420 
but then I also went on to the auction
block<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.229> searched<00:01:31.500> for<00:01:31.530> cards<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.310> were

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
block and I searched for cards that were

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.219 
block and I searched for cards that were
relatively<00:01:32.970> cheap<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.780> lot<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.049> times

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
relatively cheap and a lot of times

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.660 
relatively cheap and a lot of times
these<00:01:34.350> were<00:01:34.530> gold<00:01:34.770> cards<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.220> couple<00:01:35.490> times

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
these were gold cards a couple times

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.480 
these were gold cards a couple times
they<00:01:35.820> were<00:01:35.880> fantasy<00:01:36.329> cars<00:01:36.540> or<00:01:36.750> elite<00:01:36.990> cards

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
they were fantasy cars or elite cards

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.310 
they were fantasy cars or elite cards
but<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.759> look<00:01:39.210> for<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.420> right<00:01:39.659> ones<00:01:39.960> with<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
but I look for the right ones with the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.810 
but I look for the right ones with the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
right chemistry's that were going for

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.330 
right chemistry's that were going for
relatively<00:01:42.299> cheap<00:01:42.530> now<00:01:43.530> once<00:01:43.740> i<00:01:43.829> got<00:01:43.950> into<00:01:44.009> the

game I made sure that I switch back my

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.780 
game I made sure that I switch back my
line<00:01:46.470> up<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.770> what<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> normally<00:01:47.040> run<00:01:47.670> on

line up to what I normally run on
offense<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.390> defense<00:01:48.960> if<00:01:49.229> you're<00:01:49.770> unaware<00:01:50.009> in

you<00:02:16.130> didn't<00:02:16.340> know<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:16.640> now<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:16.970> know<00:02:17.270> that's

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
you didn't know that now you know that's

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.150 
you didn't know that now you know that's
something<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:17.959> I<00:02:18.080> was<00:02:18.200> unaware<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.739> so

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
something that I was unaware of so

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.740 
something that I was unaware of so
definitely<00:02:19.790> look<00:02:19.970> into<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.300> if<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.569> haven't

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
definitely look into that if you haven't

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.050 
definitely look into that if you haven't
done<00:02:21.170> this<00:02:21.290> challenge<00:02:21.739> yet<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.760> what<00:02:22.940> you're

challenges and what I ended up doing was

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.610 
challenges and what I ended up doing was
actually<00:02:55.580> putting<00:02:55.850> together<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.630> lineup<00:02:57.380> of

actually putting together a lineup of

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.170 
actually putting together a lineup of

lineup to fulfill each of these

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.970 
lineup to fulfill each of these
chemistry's<00:03:02.569> and<00:03:03.290> if<00:03:03.470> you<00:03:03.530> take<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.739> look<00:03:03.890> at

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
chemistry's and if you take a look at

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.170 
chemistry's and if you take a look at
your<00:03:04.100> screen<00:03:04.310> right<00:03:04.549> now<00:03:04.580> you're<00:03:05.000> going<00:03:05.120> to

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
your screen right now you're going to

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.600 
your screen right now you're going to
kind<00:03:05.450> of<00:03:05.510> see<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:05.959> quick<00:03:06.319> breakdown<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:06.860> each<00:03:07.400> of

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
kind of see a quick breakdown of each of

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.309 
kind of see a quick breakdown of each of
these<00:03:07.760> they're<00:03:08.660> going<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:08.840> be<00:03:08.930> on<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.080> screen

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
these they're going to be on the screen

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.020 
these they're going to be on the screen
for<00:03:09.530> about<00:03:09.799> eight<00:03:10.010> seconds<00:03:10.489> each<00:03:10.730> so<00:03:11.000> you're

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
for about eight seconds each so you're

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.210 
for about eight seconds each so you're
going<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.239> be<00:03:11.330> able<00:03:11.390> to<00:03:11.540> see<00:03:11.750> each<00:03:12.220> individual

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
going to be able to see each individual

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.220 
going to be able to see each individual
chemistry<00:03:14.030> there's<00:03:14.780> going<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:14.959> be<00:03:14.989> two

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
chemistry there's going to be two

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.160 
chemistry there's going to be two
screens<00:03:15.560> for<00:03:15.799> each<00:03:15.950> chemistry<00:03:16.579> and<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:17.840> thought

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170

all of these cards but after talking to
a<00:03:24.230> few<00:03:24.440> people<00:03:24.859> and<00:03:25.070> thinking<00:03:25.579> about<00:03:25.790> it<00:03:25.940> a

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
a few people and thinking about it a

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.240 
a few people and thinking about it a
little<00:03:26.120> bit<00:03:26.239> more<00:03:26.739> what<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:27.769> kind<00:03:28.070> of<00:03:28.130> decided

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
little bit more what I kind of decided

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.920 
little bit more what I kind of decided
was<00:03:28.790> that<00:03:28.820> it<00:03:29.209> was<00:03:29.329> kinda<00:03:29.660> going<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:29.840> be
