hi it's Victoria lorient babish holistic
psychotherapist<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.110> in<00:00:10.799> my<00:00:10.980> practice<00:00:11.309> and

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
psychotherapist and in my practice and

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.360 
psychotherapist and in my practice and
also<00:00:12.030> in<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.240> YouTube<00:00:12.540> environment<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.340> have<00:00:14.340> a

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
also in the YouTube environment I have a

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.339 
also in the YouTube environment I have a
lot<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.580> questions<00:00:15.210> about<00:00:15.360> this<00:00:15.870> neural

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:16.349 
lot of questions about this neural

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.980 
lot of questions about this neural
pathway<00:00:16.950> thing<00:00:17.759> that<00:00:18.060> I've<00:00:18.150> talked<00:00:18.509> about<00:00:18.810> in

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
pathway thing that I've talked about in

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.540 
pathway thing that I've talked about in
a<00:00:19.110> variety<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.470> videos<00:00:19.830> or<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> couple

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
a variety of videos or in a couple

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.960 
a variety of videos or in a couple
videos<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:21.710> it's<00:00:22.710> neuroscience<00:00:23.430> basically

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
videos and it's neuroscience basically

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.570 
videos and it's neuroscience basically
and<00:00:24.090> we<00:00:24.240> have<00:00:24.449> many<00:00:24.869> many<00:00:25.140> neural<00:00:26.010> pathways

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
and we have many many neural pathways

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.179 
and we have many many neural pathways
going<00:00:26.970> on<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.449> our<00:00:27.630> brain<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.710> seems<00:00:29.039> that

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
going on in our brain and it seems that

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.070 
going on in our brain and it seems that
it<00:00:29.340> has<00:00:29.550> been<00:00:29.730> shown<00:00:29.789> scientifically<00:00:30.630> that

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
it has been shown scientifically that

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.470 
it has been shown scientifically that
whatever<00:00:31.710> belief<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.519> we<00:00:32.669> have<00:00:32.940> it's<00:00:33.210> very

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
whatever belief that we have it's very

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.560 
whatever belief that we have it's very

held strong is caught is really in
relationship<00:00:37.409> with<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.650> neural<00:00:37.890> pathways<00:00:38.430> so

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
relationship with the neural pathways so

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.210 
relationship with the neural pathways so
whatever<00:00:39.360> belief<00:00:39.720> that<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.220> repetitive

whatever belief that is repetitive

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.469 
whatever belief that is repetitive

this is what I think this is how I am
this<00:01:03.689> is<00:01:03.839> my<00:01:03.989> personality<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.309> way

this is my personality this is the way

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.330 
this is my personality this is the way
it<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.760> these<00:01:06.479> neural<00:01:06.960> pathways<00:01:07.530> seem<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.160> be

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
it is these neural pathways seem to be

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.810 
it is these neural pathways seem to be

thin very undeveloped and it really is
important<00:01:45.150> that<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:45.360> you're<00:01:45.480> trying<00:01:45.750> to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
important that if you're trying to

important that if you're trying to
create<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.380> new<00:01:46.740> behavior<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.460> your<00:01:47.700> life<00:01:48.030> that

create a new behavior in your life that

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.010 
create a new behavior in your life that
you<00:01:48.900> become<00:01:49.200> very<00:01:49.470> very<00:01:49.820> aware<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.240> conscious

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
you become very very aware and conscious

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.460 
you become very very aware and conscious
of<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> fact<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.979> you're<00:01:53.700> kind<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.090> up

first<00:02:06.120> go<00:02:06.390> listen<00:02:07.049> let<00:02:07.500> me<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.740> tell<00:02:07.890> you

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
first go listen let me just tell you

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.979 
first go listen let me just tell you
something<00:02:08.099> you're<00:02:08.879> up<00:02:09.030> against<00:02:09.450> your<00:02:09.659> biology

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
something you're up against your biology

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.800 
something you're up against your biology
and<00:02:10.409> the<00:02:10.440> very<00:02:10.890> very<00:02:11.069> thick<00:02:11.600> highway<00:02:12.600> like

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
and the very very thick highway like

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.410 
and the very very thick highway like
neural<00:02:13.290> pathways<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:14.100> your<00:02:14.160> brain<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:15.209> cut

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
neural pathways in your brain so cut

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.760 
neural pathways in your brain so cut
yourself<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.840> break<00:02:16.020> but<00:02:16.590> I

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
yourself a break but I

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.770 
yourself a break but I
stand<00:02:17.130> that<00:02:17.370> if<00:02:17.460> you<00:02:17.550> do<00:02:17.760> want<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.060> change<00:02:18.120> and

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
stand that if you do want to change and

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.870 
stand that if you do want to change and
I<00:02:19.200> am<00:02:19.350> encouraging<00:02:19.710> change<00:02:20.250> where<00:02:20.610> needed

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
I am encouraging change where needed

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.020 
I am encouraging change where needed
that<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:22.020> that<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.470> go<00:02:22.800> about<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.100> systematic

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
that you that you go about a systematic

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
that you that you go about a systematic
approach<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.810> both<00:02:26.840> understanding<00:02:27.840> what<00:02:27.960> it

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
approach of both understanding what it

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.020 
approach of both understanding what it
is<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.260> want<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.560> change<00:02:28.860> getting<00:02:29.610> very<00:02:29.790> very

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
is you want to change getting very very

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.390 
is you want to change getting very very
clear<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.350> is<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.710> specific<00:02:31.920> thing

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
clear that that is the specific thing

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.400 
clear that that is the specific thing
you<00:02:32.820> want<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.090> change<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:33.600> maybe<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.960> behavior

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
you want to change so maybe the behavior

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.350 
you want to change so maybe the behavior
is<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.740> no<00:02:34.980> longer<00:02:35.370> want<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:35.910> experience

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
is I no longer want to experience

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.490 
is I no longer want to experience
anxiety<00:02:36.750> when<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.500> am<00:02:37.890> public<00:02:38.280> speaking<00:02:38.760> so

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
anxiety when I am public speaking so

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.810 
anxiety when I am public speaking so
this<00:02:40.500> thing<00:02:40.680> isn't<00:02:40.830> just<00:02:41.160> going<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.520> go<00:02:41.670> away

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
this thing isn't just going to go away

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.110 
this thing isn't just going to go away
you've<00:02:42.300> got<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:42.840> very<00:02:43.050> very<00:02:44.120> almost

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
you've got to be very very almost

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.000 
you've got to be very very almost

methodical scientific about how you
change<00:02:47.490> behavior<00:02:48.000> because<00:02:48.830> you're<00:02:49.830> up

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
change behavior because you're up

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.330 
change behavior because you're up
against<00:02:50.430> your<00:02:50.580> biology<00:02:51.140> so<00:02:52.140> very<00:02:52.800> important

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
against your biology so very important

number one identify what you want to
change<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.920> then<00:02:56.400> go<00:02:56.610> about<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:57.150> great<00:02:57.630> way<00:02:57.840> to

do it is to go about trying small new
behaviors<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.650> incrementally<00:03:04.650> increase

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
conscious when you're engaging in those

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.690 
conscious when you're engaging in those
new<00:03:09.690> behaviors<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.350> what<00:03:11.070> you're<00:03:11.280> thinking

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
new behaviors of what you're thinking

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.160 
new behaviors of what you're thinking
because<00:03:11.970> if<00:03:12.090> you're<00:03:12.210> thinking<00:03:12.420> as<00:03:12.840> you're

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
because if you're thinking as you're

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.170 
because if you're thinking as you're
doing<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:13.440> new<00:03:13.620> behavior<00:03:14.010> oh<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:15.000> never

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
doing this new behavior oh this is never

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.420 
doing this new behavior oh this is never
going<00:03:15.300> to<00:03:15.390> happen<00:03:15.600> I'm<00:03:16.230> totally<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.800> failure

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
going to happen I'm totally a failure

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.150 
going to happen I'm totally a failure
I'm<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:18.090> know<00:03:18.180> I'm<00:03:18.360> not<00:03:18.900> worth<00:03:19.140> anything<00:03:19.470> well

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
I'm you know I'm not worth anything well

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.100 
I'm you know I'm not worth anything well
guess<00:03:20.550> what<00:03:20.760> those<00:03:21.090> neural<00:03:21.450> pathways<00:03:22.080> are

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
guess what those neural pathways are

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.320 
guess what those neural pathways are
going<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.620> be<00:03:22.740> getting<00:03:23.459> thicker<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.090> thicker

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
going to be getting thicker and thicker

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.900 
going to be getting thicker and thicker
alongside<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.560> behavioral<00:03:26.220> neural<00:03:26.490> pathway

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
alongside the behavioral neural pathway

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.570 
alongside the behavioral neural pathway
so<00:03:27.480> it's<00:03:27.840> important<00:03:28.320> that<00:03:28.350> you<00:03:28.470> really<00:03:29.160> throw

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
so it's important that you really throw

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.730 
so it's important that you really throw
yourself<00:03:30.000> into<00:03:30.150> change<00:03:30.600> with<00:03:31.440> self

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
yourself into change with self

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.440 
yourself into change with self
compassion<00:03:32.130> in<00:03:32.610> that<00:03:33.030> it's<00:03:33.150> not<00:03:33.240> going<00:03:33.360> to

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
compassion in that it's not going to

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.710 
compassion in that it's not going to
happen<00:03:33.510> happen<00:03:34.200> immediately<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:35.720> allow

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
happen happen immediately and allow

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.250 
happen happen immediately and allow
yourself<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:38.250> couple<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.060> new<00:03:39.600> behavior

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
yourself to to couple the new behavior

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.840 
yourself to to couple the new behavior
with<00:03:42.590> accompanying<00:03:43.590> positive<00:03:44.870> encouraging

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
information that you give yourself I see

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.760 
information that you give yourself I see
a<00:03:56.070> lot<00:03:56.490> of<00:03:56.520> people<00:03:56.910> getting<00:03:57.060> very<00:03:57.360> discouraged

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
a lot of people getting very discouraged

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.740 
a lot of people getting very discouraged
when<00:03:58.770> they<00:03:59.010> are<00:03:59.220> trying<00:03:59.580> to<00:03:59.790> wean<00:04:00.480> themselves

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
we engage in for some reason our

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.760 
we engage in for some reason our

something positive even though the

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.680 
something positive even though the
behavior<00:04:23.070> is<00:04:23.220> negative<00:04:23.700> so<00:04:24.150> if<00:04:24.300> someone<00:04:24.540> is

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
behavior is negative so if someone is

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.840 
behavior is negative so if someone is
engaging<00:04:25.110> in<00:04:25.560> a<00:04:25.919> lot<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.280> anxiety

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
in all of this anxiety what is this

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.890 
in all of this anxiety what is this
anxiety<00:04:38.080> part<00:04:39.010> of<00:04:39.130> me<00:04:39.280> actually<00:04:39.610> trying<00:04:40.540> to<00:04:40.720> do

anxiety part of me actually trying to do

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.590 
anxiety part of me actually trying to do
for<00:04:40.930> me<00:04:41.350> if<00:04:41.560> you<00:04:41.620> sit<00:04:42.400> with<00:04:42.550> it<00:04:42.730> it's<00:04:43.180> saying

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
for me if you sit with it it's saying

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.540 
for me if you sit with it it's saying
probably<00:04:44.320> what<00:04:44.770> I<00:04:44.800> want<00:04:45.040> you<00:04:45.100> to<00:04:45.160> do<00:04:45.340> a<00:04:45.370> good

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
probably what I want you to do a good

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.150 
probably what I want you to do a good
job<00:04:45.610> and<00:04:46.150> I<00:04:46.240> want<00:04:46.420> you<00:04:46.510> to<00:04:46.600> be<00:04:46.690> really<00:04:47.160> accepted

by the people that are seeing you and

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.950 
by the people that are seeing you and
from<00:04:51.550> that<00:04:51.610> acceptance<00:04:52.270> I'm<00:04:52.480> going<00:04:52.690> to<00:04:52.750> get<00:04:52.930> a

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
from that acceptance I'm going to get a

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.980 
from that acceptance I'm going to get a
sense<00:04:53.110> of<00:04:53.880> peacefulness<00:04:54.880> and<00:04:55.420> likeness

sense of peacefulness and likeness

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.110 
sense of peacefulness and likeness
within<00:04:56.380> myself<00:04:56.560> so<00:04:57.310> there<00:04:57.550> is<00:04:57.580> a<00:04:57.700> positive

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
within myself so there is a positive

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.410 
within myself so there is a positive
purpose<00:04:58.810> to<00:04:59.470> the<00:04:59.560> negative<00:04:59.800> behavior<00:05:00.580> when

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
purpose to the negative behavior when

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.090 
purpose to the negative behavior when
you're<00:05:01.630> working<00:05:01.840> with<00:05:02.110> this<00:05:02.260> neural<00:05:02.590> pathway

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
you're working with this neural pathway

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.090 
you're working with this neural pathway
conversation<00:05:03.880> in<00:05:04.440> changing<00:05:05.440> your<00:05:05.530> behaviors

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
conversation in changing your behaviors

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.610 
conversation in changing your behaviors
what<00:05:06.700> will<00:05:06.820> be<00:05:06.910> very<00:05:07.240> helpful<00:05:08.110> to<00:05:08.350> that

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
what will be very helpful to that

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.560 
what will be very helpful to that
process<00:05:09.130> is<00:05:09.250> for<00:05:09.760> you<00:05:09.850> to<00:05:09.880> find<00:05:10.240> what<00:05:10.450> the

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
process is for you to find what the

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.110 
process is for you to find what the
positive<00:05:11.230> purpose<00:05:11.590> is<00:05:11.950> to<00:05:12.580> whatever<00:05:12.850> negative

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
positive purpose is to whatever negative

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.900 
positive purpose is to whatever negative
behavior<00:05:13.930> you're<00:05:14.110> trying<00:05:14.440> to<00:05:14.620> change<00:05:14.980> so

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
behavior you're trying to change so

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.230 
behavior you're trying to change so
eating<00:05:16.840> emotionally<00:05:17.680> you<00:05:18.250> might<00:05:18.430> sort<00:05:18.760> of<00:05:18.850> sit

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
eating emotionally you might sort of sit

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.580 
eating emotionally you might sort of sit
with<00:05:19.420> that<00:05:19.600> and<00:05:19.750> I've<00:05:19.840> heard<00:05:20.020> people<00:05:20.170> talk

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
with that and I've heard people talk

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.830 
with that and I've heard people talk
about<00:05:20.620> you<00:05:21.460> know<00:05:21.580> that<00:05:21.970> I'm<00:05:22.150> trying<00:05:22.480> to<00:05:22.660> feel

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
about you know that I'm trying to feel

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.740 
about you know that I'm trying to feel
full<00:05:23.320> because<00:05:24.190> I'm<00:05:24.310> actually<00:05:24.550> empty<00:05:25.240> and<00:05:25.480> what

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
full because I'm actually empty and what

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.540 
full because I'm actually empty and what
will<00:05:25.900> feeling<00:05:26.290> full<00:05:26.620> actually<00:05:27.130> bring<00:05:27.370> you

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
will feeling full actually bring you

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.790 
will feeling full actually bring you
well<00:05:28.090> it'll<00:05:28.300> probably<00:05:28.630> bring<00:05:29.080> me<00:05:29.260> a<00:05:29.290> sense<00:05:29.620> of

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
well it'll probably bring me a sense of

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.760 
well it'll probably bring me a sense of
calm<00:05:30.130> and<00:05:30.550> ease<00:05:31.180> and<00:05:31.630> peace<00:05:32.050> so<00:05:32.290> you're<00:05:32.440> trying

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
calm and ease and peace so you're trying

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.740 
calm and ease and peace so you're trying
to<00:05:32.860> get<00:05:32.980> column<00:05:33.400> and<00:05:33.520> ease<00:05:33.700> and<00:05:33.910> peace<00:05:34.120> so

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
to get column and ease and peace so

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.420 
to get column and ease and peace so
let's<00:05:35.050> see<00:05:35.290> if<00:05:35.380> you<00:05:35.500> can<00:05:35.530> first<00:05:36.570> engage<00:05:37.570> in<00:05:38.430> not

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
let's see if you can first engage in not

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.160 
let's see if you can first engage in not
repeating<00:05:39.880> that<00:05:39.970> negative<00:05:40.330> behavior<00:05:40.780> because

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170 
repeating that negative behavior because

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.650 
repeating that negative behavior because
you're<00:05:41.320> kind<00:05:41.470> of<00:05:41.650> saying<00:05:41.860> to<00:05:42.040> yourself<00:05:42.430> that

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
you're kind of saying to yourself that

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.300 
you're kind of saying to yourself that
negative<00:05:43.660> behavior<00:05:44.110> has<00:05:44.290> a<00:05:44.320> positive<00:05:44.740> purpose

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
negative behavior has a positive purpose

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.000 
negative behavior has a positive purpose
can<00:05:46.090> I<00:05:46.120> get<00:05:46.270> that<00:05:46.600> positive<00:05:46.840> purpose<00:05:47.350> without

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
can I get that positive purpose without

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.490 
can I get that positive purpose without
the<00:05:48.550> negative<00:05:48.940> behavior<00:05:49.450> can<00:05:49.630> I<00:05:49.690> get<00:05:49.870> calm<00:05:50.140> and

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
the negative behavior can I get calm and

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.800 
the negative behavior can I get calm and
peace<00:05:50.770> and<00:05:51.010> relaxation<00:05:51.550> without<00:05:52.510> the

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
peace and relaxation without the

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.100 
peace and relaxation without the
emotional<00:05:53.230> eating<00:05:53.970> you'll<00:05:54.970> probably<00:05:55.390> start

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
emotional eating you'll probably start

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.990 
emotional eating you'll probably start
to<00:05:56.200> think<00:05:56.380> creatively<00:05:56.680> about<00:05:57.190> what<00:05:57.730> else

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
to think creatively about what else

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.140 
to think creatively about what else
could<00:05:58.990> you<00:05:59.050> bring<00:05:59.530> could<00:06:00.280> bring<00:06:00.490> calm<00:06:00.790> and

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
could you bring could bring calm and

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.900 
could you bring could bring calm and
peace<00:06:01.540> into<00:06:02.380> your<00:06:02.770> system<00:06:03.190> without<00:06:03.640> the

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
peace into your system without the

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.810 
peace into your system without the
negative<00:06:04.540> pattern<00:06:04.960> behavior<00:06:05.530> and<00:06:05.740> like<00:06:06.460> that

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
negative pattern behavior and like that

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.550 
negative pattern behavior and like that
and<00:06:07.180> eventually<00:06:08.250> the<00:06:09.250> neural<00:06:10.120> pathways<00:06:10.810> that

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
and eventually the neural pathways that

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.190 
and eventually the neural pathways that
are<00:06:11.620> thin<00:06:12.040> and<00:06:12.070> like<00:06:12.490> footpaths<00:06:13.120> will<00:06:13.750> become

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
are thin and like footpaths will become

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.970 
are thin and like footpaths will become
thicker<00:06:15.040> and<00:06:15.490> more<00:06:15.900> evolved<00:06:16.900> like<00:06:17.380> freeways

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:17.980 
thicker and more evolved like freeways

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.100 
thicker and more evolved like freeways
like<00:06:18.520> the<00:06:18.730> neural<00:06:19.030> pathways<00:06:19.510> were<00:06:19.750> of<00:06:19.960> the
