00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 I was the basic scenario and also the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.629
 cinematic implementation of word pretty 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.429
 but was cool from the first trailer to 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.900
 Continuation not quite convinced yet 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.190
 And now it's time to take a look 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.280
 to throw on the second German 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.280
 trailer from the edge 2 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.280
 anarchy 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.369
 you can not go out there you know 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.079
 how dangerous that is that martin is not 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.800
 alive is it then not 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.470
 better go 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.310
 Do not do it it 's late you should 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.220
 go the traffic in the city center 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.680
 is increasing rapidly 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.740
 the citizens hurry home 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.740
 come 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.650
 you should not wish them 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:54.660
 leaving roads as fast as possible 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:54.660
 because there outside war soon function 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.600
 corresponds to the emergency 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.340
 transmission system we announce the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.340
 This year's year could be the beginning of this year 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.180
 even the siren sounds are all 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.900
 crime including twelve for twelve 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.900
 hours allowed 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.330
 Rescuers are no longer available 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.020
 available to your government thanks you 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.020
 for your part 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.610
 allowed tonight and become too 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.980
 to free 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.450
 america was a born-again nation 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:46.470
 simply drive 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:46.470
 stick to the plan you come with 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.470
 we should not be outside for so long 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.500
 the move is happening to us 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.500
 Not 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:11.820
 people like him did not survive that 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.820
 God 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:21.120
 This is the last match of the evening 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.120
 the minimum bid is 200,000 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.440
 do not forget how much good that 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.810
 cleansing and bringing 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.640
 I like it a lot better 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.250
 like page 2 energy brings universal 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.680
 pictures expected from 24 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.570
 july 2014 in German cinemas and the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.270
 Basic scenario is always the same 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.490
 One day a year will be for twelve hours 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.440
 at night in the usa every important 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.250
 authorities actually criminal offenses 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.190
 should prevent closed 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.300
 Hospitals close the same way 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.250
 police station that may be murdered and 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.320
 be assassinated on the streets the 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.940
 idea behind it is to create a valve 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.320
 which are important for the company to rache 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.990
 and in the course of a year 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.850
 a lot of anger pent up the pearc's 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.300
 Purification is the whole remedy 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.500
 create 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.030
 a really blatant is partial 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.710
 do you understand every scenario that I have 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.510
 I feel really good in the first part 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.470
 set up when it came down to as 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.510
 a family is in the 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.890
 high-security house tries 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.570
 but then shield a lot 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.280
 Funny people show up trying 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.600
 somehow because this house to arrive 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.520
 we have here in the first trailer 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.870
 Continuing a couple saw that 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.460
 somehow with the car stops 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.380
 while it 's getting dark and getting dark 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.730
 but the night of the pearc nourishes here in the 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.140
 second trailer because I found the 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.460
 basic idea a bit boring 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.230
 There is already into the storytelling 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.150
 to legally looks at a man of 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.620
 trying somehow to see on revenge 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.000
 or bring back something to anyone 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.800
 but apparently does not work 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.690
 but also partly to help you 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.640
 the musical accompaniment with america 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.650
 the brave and, above all, this one 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.270
 scenario of an auction of the last 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.620
 pearc by why you lined up 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.900
 victim sees the auction 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.370
 also reminds a bit on model 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.290
 He does not put this on motor but 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.820
 a hostel to the first row and the 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.410
 i find interesting the crossover and 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.910
 the musical accompaniment of the reason 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.290
 lay and also that the film again with 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.760
 a low budget under 10 million 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.620
 dollar comes along for me like that 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.180
 small signs that I hope that the 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.470
 Continuation can and I know 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.180
 that many of the purchase is not 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.680
 I was already thrilled and me 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.360
 faith for this niche is too 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.130
 this continues and I like that 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.200
 look of the second trailer and am pleased 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.580
 so on the 24th july what a miserable 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.019
 likes to write comments 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.700
 the second trailer also better 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.310
 or you say no you let me go 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.870
 how cold I think he can do a lot 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.780
 and somehow makes me want more 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.310
 in this very special genre 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.370
 so i have through with my short 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.270
 small second trailer jak2 energy 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.010
 to let 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.300
 This might let it we do not stay 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.560
 otherwise there are a few left 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.780
 and me around and tomorrow at 15 o'clock 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.100
 at the latest a new video and then it 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.620
 I hope to be here again tomorrow 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.620
 of course at 3
