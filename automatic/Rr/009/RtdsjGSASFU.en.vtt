00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.450
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.040
 second video of the series questions 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.300
 answers in which I respond to 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.030
 questions that are most often 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.080
 ask so the question of the day is 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.090
 how many hours of sport should I do 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.560
 per week to lose weight and to 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.199
 what time of the day 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.240
 first of all I want to remind you that 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.650
 just do sports do not you 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.210
 help lose weight pour into my 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.580
 we're not balancing your 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.929
 diet a little t you have to know that 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.329
 in weight loss sport 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.790
 represents around 20% while 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.110
 food it represents 80% 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.000
 now I recommend you 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.920
 actually to do sports like I 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.629
 you talked about it in the previous 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.550
 video if you have not seen it I you 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.840
 had it below in info bar for 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.579
 let it be clearer let's see 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.469
 together what a section represents 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.180
 sports in terms of calories burned 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.010
 you have to know that when you do 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.980
 a session of about 30 minutes of sport 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.170
 you will burn about 150 calories 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.250
 if you are doing brisk walking if 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.949
 you do something more 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.049
 supported as we will say of the race 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.850
 there you go friends live about 1,300 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.650
 calories to burn on your wall 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.030
 now this will vary from one person 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.750
 to another but it's still a 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.820
 good average 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.850
 and me in fact what I do is that 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.590
 I use a cardio watch that I 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.540
 find really great at the level of the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.189
 motivation is so I see exactly 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.420
 what I burn if you want more 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.159
 info on only two cases of I 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.720
 have also made a video and I will 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.890
 would put lunÃ©a below now 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.420
 you have how many calories you 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.100
 shine in a chance of sports let's see 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.900
 see this at the level of nutrition so 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.210
 a slice of bread is about 100 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.070
 calories and if you add 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.470
 little jam is filled to you 150 and 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.630
 160 calories if you add a small 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.970
 chocolate spoon you 're already 220 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.640
 calories and if you eat a croissant 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.770
 a boukessassa varies between 200 to 450 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.390
 caloric and you can see the 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.520
 calories burned can also be 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.800
 very very quickly my project is so in 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.740
 this case there if you do not take more than 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.450
 what your body needs during its 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.130
 day well the sport is just going to you 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.710
 to stabilize the lost weight 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.810
 a part amp is so the solution that's 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.979
 to play sports but also 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.899
 decrease the caloric intake of your 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.340
 diet stop balance and the c 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.899
 ie you are going to results now 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.459
 it must not ten miles any 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.440
 calories from your diet but this 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.000
 will be the subject of an upcoming video this 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.739
 which is the frequency all this is going 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.480
 depend on the number of calories you 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.920
 must be burned to lose weight and 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.110
 number of calories than to eat on 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.600
 the day but as a rule we 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.550
 advise to arrive at 2 to 3 sessions per 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.200
 week of about an hour and that's 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.150
 already the idea she could go there 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.709
 gradually started with sessions 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.650
 much shorter and fewer 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.260
 and little by little the extensions and on the 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.030
 duration and in number of times on your 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.820
 week do not set goals 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.560
 too big from the start it's not the goal 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.329
 record connector is not ready yet 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.739
 you may be discouraged 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.720
 really too silly so better 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.860
 start slowly but surely if 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.510
 you do not think you have time to 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.220
 to do sports start with really 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.200
 very small goals like five museums 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.940
 morning on your breakfast or five 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.650
 minutes in the evening in 35 minutes we can 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.820
 really go find on the day and 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.320
 then we have to think that it is worth 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.910
 better move a little bit than ben ali 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.190
 everything and who knows you is maybe 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.470
 take pleasure in the world's sun and 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.000
 gradually in recession I would like 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.220
 to establish a training program and 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 really noted your workouts 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.380
 in your calendar 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.700
 as if it were appointments that 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.489
 you can not miss it's your 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.920
 moment to you for you so spend I 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.420
 you 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.790
 right now already to take your 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.170
 agenda and set your first session of 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.610
 20 minutes we will say to begin 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.770
 for the coming week 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.200
 and the week after your pope to note 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.530
 two 20-minute sessions and so 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.840
 after 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.770
 next to your workout 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.319
 do not forget that in fact it is 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.730
 advised to do 20 to 30 minutes 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.010
 of physical activity every day every 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.600
 days but it can be just the 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.370
 brisk walk when you go to 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.850
 work will have contributed your children to 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.670
 school 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.430
 it's really taking an active life 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.900
 have a daily activity that you 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.880
 will you do well you can take good 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.680
 habits 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.920
 you will rather go shopping at 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.870
 rather than by car or take 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.489
 stairs rather than the escalators of the 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.620
 centers a bus station or metro 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.420
 earlier so you'll tell me this is 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.340
 maybe of those two things a little 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.870
 not very simple but frankly it makes a 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.840
 big difference it allows precisely 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.810
 to be active every day that's 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.860
 very simple for your body and on the 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.750
 long term this can make a 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.880
 difference in summary there is a style of 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.200
 active life I was also asked to 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.880
 from when the body starts 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.410
 really burn fat as 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.760
 as a source of energy for six years 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.520
 formed one must know that it is from 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.080
 20 to 30 minutes of physical exercise 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.419
 then for the best 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.400
 time of the day to play sports 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.130
 so yes it's true that the morning fasting 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.270
 the body makes them wish for cardio 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.010
 not really tapped into crates 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.350
 because he is fasting simply 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.890
 and that he was looking for Greece as a source 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.720
 energy 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.419
 now you have to know that this can 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.150
 also during the day by combining 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.530
 bodybuilding and cardio but that I you 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.240
 will explain in the next video 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.410
 now at the moment level in the 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.820
 day you have a lot of sport 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.289
 frankly see what's yours the 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.940
 better thoroughly this is not what will 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.960
 make a huge difference at the level of 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.539
 your weight loss 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.250
 so it's better to actually 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.510
 physical activity regularly 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.490
 during the moment 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.780
 day and there you will have results 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.100
 I advise you to have a calendar 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.580
 for example a leaf on which 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.290
 you have 30 to 31 square for the month and 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.450
 to put a cross every day you 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.130
 did a sport session so you 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.260
 can be proud and see black on 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:23.240
 white the efforts you make to 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:26.310
 to have a body in great shape is 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.150
 reached your goal in short little 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.800
 whatever time you go 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.940
 devote to your physical activity what 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.860
 which is important is to do is 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.510
 regularly is there you are really going 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.220
 have benefits at your level 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.380
 health of your well-being 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.030
 so really see to find the right 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.040
 balance between your activities 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.650
 daily and the time you go 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.300
 dedicated to taking care of your body 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.920
 by doing a workout 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.470
 I hope this video will love you more 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.760
 that especially she will have helped you if you 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.770
 want more click on the small 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.210
 puzzle below the video is so 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.400
 in the next video we will see 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.420
 sports style set that recommended 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.140
 for weight loss 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.140
 see you soon
