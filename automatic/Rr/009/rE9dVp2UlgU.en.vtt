installed<00:01:36.580> in<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.940> back<00:01:37.120> instead<00:01:37.360> of<00:01:37.540> a

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
installed in the back instead of a

installed<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.680> turbo<00:01:48.040> in<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.280> back<00:01:48.460> where

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
installed the turbo in the back where

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.660 
installed the turbo in the back where
the<00:01:49.060> muffler<00:01:49.390> is<00:01:49.540> on<00:01:49.960> an<00:01:50.290> rx-8<00:01:50.830> successfully

the muffler is on an rx-8 successfully

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.200 
the muffler is on an rx-8 successfully
and<00:01:51.850> drove<00:01:52.150> it<00:01:52.270> for<00:01:52.450> over<00:01:52.780> 30,000<00:01:53.530> miles<00:01:54.210> and

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.270 
and drove it for over 30,000 miles and
then<00:01:55.450> I<00:01:55.570> started<00:01:55.870> getting<00:01:56.020> carted<00:01:56.500> with<00:01:56.650> it<00:01:56.800> so

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
then I started getting carted with it so

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.820 
then I started getting carted with it so
I<00:01:57.310> dismounted<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.510> turbine<00:01:58.930> and<00:01:59.080> I<00:01:59.200> build<00:01:59.530> a

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
I dismounted the turbine and I build a

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.400 
I dismounted the turbine and I build a
mid-mounted<00:02:00.730> ah<00:02:01.300> with<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:01.900> one<00:02:02.080> that<00:02:02.170> goes

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
mid-mounted ah with the one that goes

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.740 
mid-mounted ah with the one that goes
where<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.130> catalytic<00:02:04.060> converter<00:02:04.420> is

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
where the catalytic converter is

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.029 
where the catalytic converter is
underneath<00:02:05.230> the<00:02:05.410> car<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:07.289> with<00:02:08.289> that<00:02:08.560> turbo

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
underneath the car and with that turbo

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.670 
underneath the car and with that turbo

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
you know I haven't had tuned it well

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.350 
you know I haven't had tuned it well
enough<00:02:11.950> or<00:02:12.250> I<00:02:12.519> don't<00:02:12.849> know<00:02:12.909> what<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.209> hell
