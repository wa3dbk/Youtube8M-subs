00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
hey I'm just here with my little proto X

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.240 
hey I'm just here with my little proto X
helicopter<00:00:24.250> it<00:00:24.369> picked<00:00:24.640> up<00:00:24.820> our<00:00:25.590> quadcopter<00:00:26.789> I

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
helicopter it picked up our quadcopter I

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.740 
helicopter it picked up our quadcopter I
bought<00:00:30.250> this<00:00:30.430> the<00:00:30.610> other<00:00:30.730> day<00:00:30.849> and<00:00:31.060> within

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
bought this the other day and within

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.310 
bought this the other day and within
maybe<00:00:32.050> 15<00:00:32.649> seconds<00:00:33.550> of<00:00:33.700> like<00:00:34.390> flying<00:00:34.719> it<00:00:35.110> I

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
maybe 15 seconds of like flying it I

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.369 
maybe 15 seconds of like flying it I
flew<00:00:35.590> way<00:00:35.860> too<00:00:35.920> high<00:00:36.480> landed<00:00:37.480> on<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:37.840> concrete

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
flew way too high landed on the concrete

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.310 
flew way too high landed on the concrete
ground<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:38.980> it<00:00:39.070> cracked<00:00:39.520> one<00:00:39.850> of<00:00:39.879> the<00:00:40.120> arms<00:00:41.079> go

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
ground and it cracked one of the arms go

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.139 
ground and it cracked one of the arms go
to<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:41.710> front<00:00:41.980> and<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:44.070> did<00:00:45.070> manage<00:00:45.460> to<00:00:45.489> fix<00:00:45.879> it

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
to the front and I did manage to fix it

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.299 
to the front and I did manage to fix it
and<00:00:46.390> thought<00:00:46.930> maybe<00:00:47.200> be<00:00:47.559> helpful<00:00:47.980> for<00:00:48.159> other

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
and thought maybe be helpful for other

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.270 
and thought maybe be helpful for other
people<00:00:48.699> see<00:00:48.969> if<00:00:49.570> they<00:00:49.989> did<00:00:50.199> the<00:00:50.320> same<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.820> I

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
people see if they did the same and I

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.619 
people see if they did the same and I
see<00:00:54.280> maybe<00:00:55.239> can't<00:00:55.569> see<00:00:55.809> show<00:00:56.289> you<00:00:56.350> with<00:00:56.589> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
see maybe can't see show you with the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.599 
see maybe can't see show you with the
exacto<00:00:58.629> knife<00:00:58.870> here

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
exacto knife here

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.809 
exacto knife here
right<00:01:00.609> here<00:01:01.229> is<00:01:02.229> where<00:01:02.499> mine<00:01:02.769> was<00:01:02.979> cracked<00:01:03.429> and

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:03.819 
right here is where mine was cracked and

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:06.000 
right here is where mine was cracked and
I<00:01:03.940> put<00:01:04.210> a<00:01:04.239> little<00:01:04.570> tiny<00:01:04.960> bit<00:01:05.229> of<00:01:05.260> solder<00:01:05.560> across

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
I put a little tiny bit of solder across

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.640 
I put a little tiny bit of solder across
it<00:01:06.750> well<00:01:07.750> I<00:01:07.780> did<00:01:07.870> was<00:01:08.229> I<00:01:08.380> scraped<00:01:08.860> off<00:01:09.159> the<00:01:10.650> cony

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
it well I did was I scraped off the cony

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.410 
it well I did was I scraped off the cony
over<00:01:12.070> top<00:01:12.280> of<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:12.610> I<00:01:12.640> think<00:01:13.060> they're<00:01:13.210> called

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
over top of the I think they're called

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.200 
over top of the I think they're called
traces<00:01:13.990> or<00:01:14.260> really<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.890> wires<00:01:15.130> they're<00:01:15.970> built

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
traces or really the wires they're built

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.480 
traces or really the wires they're built
to<00:01:16.360> a<00:01:16.390> circuit<00:01:16.900> board<00:01:17.100> there's<00:01:18.100> like<00:01:18.220> a<00:01:18.250> little

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
to a circuit board there's like a little

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.150 
to a circuit board there's like a little
protective<00:01:19.060> coating<00:01:19.479> on<00:01:19.600> it<00:01:19.860> scrape<00:01:20.860> that<00:01:21.100> off

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
protective coating on it scrape that off

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.000 
protective coating on it scrape that off
to<00:01:21.550> get<00:01:21.640> down<00:01:21.910> to<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.180> copper<00:01:22.800> and<00:01:23.800> then<00:01:23.950> I

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
to get down to the copper and then I

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.670 
to get down to the copper and then I
carefully<00:01:24.430> touch<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.300> a<00:01:25.630> little<00:01:26.500> bit<00:01:26.620> of

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
carefully touch the a little bit of

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.190 
carefully touch the a little bit of
solder<00:01:26.950> on<00:01:27.100> there<00:01:27.400> my<00:01:27.610> soldering<00:01:28.060> iron<00:01:28.200> and

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
solder on there my soldering iron and

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.460 
solder on there my soldering iron and
then<00:01:30.010> touched<00:01:30.400> it<00:01:30.700> to<00:01:31.300> there<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:31.840> really<00:01:32.350> it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
then touched it to there and really it

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.560 
then touched it to there and really it
just<00:01:32.500> only<00:01:33.220> went<00:01:33.460> where<00:01:33.640> it<00:01:33.760> was<00:01:33.880> cracked<00:01:34.240> and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
just only went where it was cracked and

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.340 
just only went where it was cracked and
where<00:01:34.780> it<00:01:34.870> scraped<00:01:35.230> it<00:01:35.470> and<00:01:35.730> then<00:01:36.730> I<00:01:37.350> worked

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
where it scraped it and then I worked

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.160 
where it scraped it and then I worked
perfect<00:01:38.950> I<00:01:39.190> sealed<00:01:39.640> it<00:01:39.820> up<00:01:39.910> with<00:01:40.150> CA<00:01:40.360> glue<00:01:40.480> and

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
perfect I sealed it up with CA glue and

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.660 
perfect I sealed it up with CA glue and
it's<00:01:41.830> held<00:01:42.040> up<00:01:42.160> really<00:01:42.220> good<00:01:42.670> I<00:01:43.830> just<00:01:44.830> really

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
it's held up really good I just really

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.700 
it's held up really good I just really
am<00:01:45.760> super<00:01:46.420> happy<00:01:46.570> with<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.930> fix<00:01:47.170> so<00:01:47.380> I<00:01:47.440> thought

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
am super happy with the fix so I thought

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.450 
am super happy with the fix so I thought
maybe<00:01:47.950> we<00:01:48.040> help<00:01:48.220> someone<00:01:48.580> else<00:01:48.730> so<00:01:50.310> maybe<00:01:51.310> it

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
maybe we help someone else so maybe it

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.290 
maybe we help someone else so maybe it
doesn't<00:01:51.730> work<00:01:52.330> so<00:01:52.540> good<00:01:52.570> in<00:01:52.870> every<00:01:53.170> instance

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
doesn't work so good in every instance

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.110 
doesn't work so good in every instance
but<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:56.350> can<00:01:56.770> fix<00:01:57.220> it<00:01:57.430> I<00:01:57.490> don't<00:01:57.670> have<00:01:57.940> any

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
but you can fix it I don't have any

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.020 
but you can fix it I don't have any
special<00:01:58.570> soldering<00:01:59.320> iron<00:01:59.590> our<00:02:00.250> this<00:02:00.670> guy

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
special soldering iron our this guy

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.180 
special soldering iron our this guy
relatively<00:02:01.750> small<00:02:02.020> tip<00:02:02.410> but<00:02:02.650> I<00:02:02.680> think<00:02:03.040> you

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
relatively small tip but I think you

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.309 
relatively small tip but I think you
could<00:02:03.340> do<00:02:03.490> it<00:02:03.580> even<00:02:03.700> with<00:02:03.970> a<00:02:04.000> bigger<00:02:04.300> one<00:02:04.530> and

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
could do it even with a bigger one and

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.369 
could do it even with a bigger one and
yeah<00:02:08.319> hopefully<00:02:08.920> uh<00:02:09.420> if<00:02:10.420> you<00:02:10.690> did<00:02:10.869> some<00:02:11.080> stupid

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
yeah hopefully uh if you did some stupid

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.559 
yeah hopefully uh if you did some stupid
and<00:02:11.800> brokers<00:02:12.250> this<00:02:12.849> helps<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.239> out<00:02:13.269> and<00:02:13.510> you

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
looking at buying it we had a little

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.610 
looking at buying it we had a little
tiny<00:02:24.730> normal<00:02:25.630> helicopter<00:02:26.230> though<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.530> was

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
tiny normal helicopter though it was

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.070 
tiny normal helicopter though it was
extremely<00:02:27.250> hard

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
extremely hard

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.210 
extremely hard

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220
