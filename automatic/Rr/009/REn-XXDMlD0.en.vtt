00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.700
 my second let's play world of tanks 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.070
 if your living room is so in the background 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.480
 hear a few sounds wondering 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.790
 not i have windows wide open 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.670
 open 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:21.150
 It's just great we're on 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.980
 Grünberg have fought an encounter 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:32.210
 i drive a medium for the india tank 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.210
 48 of the German yes we have one 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:45.780
 17.10 match with him 100 mhz from the e4 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:51.960
 on our side and object 268 4 and 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:54.750
 the match at on the opposite side of the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:02.010
 Panzer is just such a thing on the way 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:04.470
 on the way to the leopard you have to 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.170
 stop by there is quite something 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.860
 Let's say I'm standing, too 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.860
 pretty open 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.820
 somehow 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.750
 not so ok right now 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:42.590
 okay, of course, these are now clear 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.590
 kills without end 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.640
 the exact 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.510
 that could come out the same and 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:06.970
 Shot next to it because now away 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.220
 soma just look what I still tear here 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.930
 Here are many of the 50's 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.290
 of course, a pretty tough one too 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.290
 opponent 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.250
 so now i stay here and 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.909
 is trying to kill the 50 or the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.909
 a good question 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.090
 I should actually go through there 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.090
 are so many 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:05.989
 that is gone then we go on 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.989
 try deep in the 90's 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.130
 30 95 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.660
 If I had a chance , boy too 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.660
 to meet 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.249
 if not from the side of the 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.139
 a critical hit like that 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:53.160
 snatched back, I thought 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:13.340
 yes na c 590 I'm sorry for that 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.340
 Of course not respected 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.370
 where do we go the rhine 100 times? 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.370
 take a long look 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:37.009
 nothing in the reading 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.410
 So you should actually win 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.410
 beautiful 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.310
 the deep 1953 gone 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:02.850
 the small little scene that already 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.850
 is away 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:14.289
 which was actually a nice battle 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.340
 I would not have a little bit up front 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:21.389
 used around the corner 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:27.250
 Well, look what's up there but there 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:30.970
 sensemann okay I had with the 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:35.340
 gloria not I have the object 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:38.650
 even chains statements from me well 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.020
 and here we have an explanation 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.759
 Otherwise, but always there the chain 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:49.389
 shot down and a bit like 110 100 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:50.770
 a bit malicious where we stand yes 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.220
 but in damage, of course, very far 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.220
 below 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:05.069
 397 points of experience well okay we have 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:08.889
 here to fix 18,000 with premium 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:12.759
 Ammunition four and a half is left to us 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:13.389
 without premium we will keep in minus 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:16.810
 landed 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:22.990
 Potential received seems to have 1600 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:26.110
 she built me ​​a lot in the shots 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.680
 five hits fell 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:32.440
 okay okay 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:35.740
 yes that was my second let's play and 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.820
 was not a victory but okay look 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.830
 maybe I'll put you in the 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:43.030
 next videos my garage before 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:47.729

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.729
