00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
be four point one point one or four

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.810 
be four point one point one or four
point<00:04:01.870> two<00:04:02.080> so<00:04:02.680> just<00:04:02.920> wait<00:04:03.070> for<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.400> and<00:04:03.460> then

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
point two so just wait for that and then

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.880
