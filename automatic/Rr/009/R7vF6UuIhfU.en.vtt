in<00:00:20.939> New<00:00:21.210> York<00:00:21.359> City<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.840> we<00:00:22.199> were<00:00:22.260> kind<00:00:22.439> of

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
in New York City and we were kind of

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.710 
in New York City and we were kind of
gushing<00:00:22.859> over<00:00:23.039> their<00:00:23.609> skin<00:00:23.970> care<00:00:24.210> stuff<00:00:24.510> in

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
gushing over their skin care stuff in

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.540 
gushing over their skin care stuff in
there<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.080> I'd<00:00:25.350> always<00:00:25.590> wanted<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.099> try<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.340> so

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
there and I'd always wanted to try it so

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.790 
there and I'd always wanted to try it so
I<00:00:26.580> decided<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.180> give<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.660> go<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> bit

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
I decided to give it a go it is a bit

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.980 
I decided to give it a go it is a bit
more<00:00:28.949> expensive<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.519> was<00:00:29.609> $28<00:00:30.359> there<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.779> you

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
more expensive it was $28 there and you

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.459 
more expensive it was $28 there and you
get<00:00:31.289> 2.5<00:00:32.279> ounces<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.140> kind<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.380> a

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
get 2.5 ounces so this is kind of a

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.440 
get 2.5 ounces so this is kind of a
luxury<00:00:34.649> skincare<00:00:34.980> product<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.640> think<00:00:35.760> $28

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
luxury skincare product so I think $28

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.229 
luxury skincare product so I think $28
is<00:00:36.649> not<00:00:37.649> as<00:00:37.800> bad<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.129> could<00:00:38.250> be<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> lot<00:00:38.760> worse<00:00:38.790> I

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
is not as bad it could be a lot worse I

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.840 
is not as bad it could be a lot worse I
do<00:00:39.329> think<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:39.930> completely<00:00:40.320> worth<00:00:40.670> $28<00:00:41.670> I

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
do think it is completely worth $28 I

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.139 
do think it is completely worth $28 I
have<00:00:42.059> been<00:00:42.180> using<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.600> since<00:00:42.960> then<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.469> this

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
have been using it since then and this

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.490 
have been using it since then and this
products<00:00:45.149> for<00:00:45.300> all<00:00:45.420> skin<00:00:45.750> types<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.320> would

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
products for all skin types and I would

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.380 
products for all skin types and I would
say<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.190> could<00:00:47.340> use<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.640> anytime<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
say that you could use it anytime it's a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.569 
say that you could use it anytime it's a
day<00:00:48.539> cream<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:49.020> night<00:00:49.350> cream<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.950> doesn't<00:00:50.489> have

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
day cream a night cream it doesn't have

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.459 
day cream a night cream it doesn't have
SPF<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.719> day<00:00:51.840> you'd<00:00:52.050> have<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.289> wear<00:00:52.379> an

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
SPF so for the day you'd have to wear an

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.860 
SPF so for the day you'd have to wear an
SPF<00:00:52.559> under<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:53.789> if<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.239> have<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> breakout

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
SPF under it but if you have a breakout

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.420 
SPF under it but if you have a breakout
or<00:00:55.079> your<00:00:55.170> skin<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.500> dry<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:56.010> doesn't<00:00:56.309> matter

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
or your skin is dry it doesn't matter

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.490 
or your skin is dry it doesn't matter
what<00:00:56.730> condition<00:00:57.120> your<00:00:57.239> skin<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:58.170> will

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
what condition your skin is in this will

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.069 
what condition your skin is in this will
go<00:00:58.770> well<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.430> your<00:00:59.699> skin<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.239> little<00:01:00.809> goes<00:01:01.050> a

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
go well with your skin a little goes a

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.549 
go well with your skin a little goes a
long<00:01:01.440> way<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.180> so<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> tube<00:01:03.539> has<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> spout

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
long way and so the tube has a spout

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.410 
long way and so the tube has a spout
like<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.580> one<00:01:05.820> thing<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.090> want<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.330> keep

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
like this the one thing you want to keep

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.730 
like this the one thing you want to keep
in<00:01:06.570> mind<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.020> comes<00:01:07.170> out<00:01:07.350> kind<00:01:07.619> of

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
in mind is that it comes out kind of

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.859 
in mind is that it comes out kind of
fast<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.299> be<00:01:09.390> kind<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.570> hard<00:01:09.630> to

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
fast so you it can be kind of hard to

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.380 
fast so you it can be kind of hard to
control<00:01:10.380> how<00:01:10.830> much<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.189> get<00:01:11.430> out<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.729> here<00:01:11.939> but

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
control how much you get out of here but

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.090 
control how much you get out of here but
you<00:01:12.479> just<00:01:12.720> need<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.990> little<00:01:13.290> bit<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.770> goes<00:01:13.890> on

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
you just need a little bit it goes on

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.340 
you just need a little bit it goes on
really<00:01:14.130> smooth<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.000> sinks<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.509> really<00:01:16.049> fast

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
really smooth it sinks in really fast

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.740
