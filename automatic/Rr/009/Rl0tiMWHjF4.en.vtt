00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
oven 101 home run office also yeah now

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.200 
oven 101 home run office also yeah now
we're<00:00:22.289> going<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.439> start<00:00:22.619> with<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:24.090> always

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
we're going to start with is you always

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.599 
we're going to start with is you always
want<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.510> get<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.720> get<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.930> pump<00:00:25.430> hooked<00:00:26.430> up

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
want to get to get the pump hooked up

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.460 
want to get to get the pump hooked up
first<00:00:26.880> alright<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.449> let's<00:00:27.599> walk<00:00:27.720> over<00:00:27.779> there<00:00:28.230> I

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
first alright so let's walk over there I

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:39.619 
first alright so let's walk over there I
want<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:37.760> make<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:38.850> about<00:00:39.059> as<00:00:39.210> easy<00:00:39.360> as

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
want to make this about as easy as

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:49.459 
want to make this about as easy as
possible<00:00:40.370> because<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:48.510> pump<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.930> polarity

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
possible because the pump is polarity

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.690 
possible because the pump is polarity
neutral<00:00:49.860> doesn't<00:00:50.250> matter

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
neutral doesn't matter

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.220 
neutral doesn't matter
positive<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.270> positive<00:00:51.300> negative<00:00:51.750> negative

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
or which one's negative the polarity

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.200 
or which one's negative the polarity

weighs about 20 pounds just like this is
how<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:47.800> pump<00:01:48.040> comes<00:01:48.250> you<00:01:48.370> take<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.610> pup<00:01:48.760> out

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
how the pump comes you take the pup out

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.820 
how the pump comes you take the pup out
of<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.090> box<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.510> look<00:01:49.660> just<00:01:49.780> like<00:01:49.960> this<00:01:50.140> see

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
of the box and look just like this see

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.830 
of the box and look just like this see
this<00:01:51.340> is<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.580> centrifugal<00:01:52.030> one<00:01:52.360> which<00:01:52.570> has<00:01:52.690> got

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
this is a centrifugal one which has got

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.980 
this is a centrifugal one which has got
a<00:01:52.870> bigger<00:01:53.320> head<00:01:53.920> up<00:01:54.070> here<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.970> helical<00:01:55.750> rotor

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
a bigger head up here the helical rotor

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.910 
a bigger head up here the helical rotor
which<00:01:56.260> is<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.470> ones<00:01:56.620> that<00:01:56.680> we're<00:01:56.860> talking

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
which is the ones that we're talking

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.980 
which is the ones that we're talking
about<00:01:57.160> are<00:01:57.370> longer<00:01:57.880> right<00:01:58.210> but<00:01:58.570> just<00:01:58.780> look

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
about are longer right but just look

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.150 
about are longer right but just look
other<00:01:59.320> than<00:01:59.470> that<00:01:59.560> it's<00:01:59.710> pretty<00:01:59.770> much<00:02:00.010> the

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
other than that it's pretty much the

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.760 
other than that it's pretty much the
same<00:02:00.340> so<00:02:00.640> far<00:02:00.880> okay<00:02:01.330> you've<00:02:02.140> got<00:02:02.290> spots<00:02:02.590> up

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
same so far okay you've got spots up

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.810 
same so far okay you've got spots up
here<00:02:02.800> for<00:02:03.550> a<00:02:03.760> safety<00:02:04.360> rope<00:02:04.590> okay<00:02:05.590> so<00:02:06.280> we<00:02:06.729> have

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
here for a safety rope okay so we have

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.440 
here for a safety rope okay so we have
all<00:02:07.420> a<00:02:07.740> dip<00:02:08.740> well<00:02:09.009> now<00:02:09.250> we<00:02:10.090> was<00:02:10.720> how<00:02:10.980> going<00:02:11.980> down

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
all a dip well now we was how going down

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.340 
all a dip well now we was how going down
you're<00:02:13.450> going<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.600> lay<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.870> good<00:02:14.020> for<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.260> what

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
you're going to lay the good for it what

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.300 
you're going to lay the good for it what
you're<00:02:14.440> going<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.590> use<00:02:14.709> you<00:02:14.770> lay<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.040> puffs

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
you're going to use you lay the puffs

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.750 
you're going to use you lay the puffs
down<00:02:15.550> look<00:02:16.420> around<00:02:16.800> okay<00:02:17.890> one<00:02:18.250> more<00:02:18.640> way

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
down look around okay one more way

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.790 
down look around okay one more way
you're<00:02:19.240> going<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.450> connect<00:02:19.690> your<00:02:19.810> wire<00:02:20.020> all

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
you're going to connect your wire all

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.580 
you're going to connect your wire all
right<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:22.480> anyway<00:02:22.750> back<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:23.200> connect<00:02:23.470> your

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
right so anyway back you connect your

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.760 
right so anyway back you connect your
drop<00:02:24.040> drop<00:02:24.520> cable<00:02:24.880> wire<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.540> your<00:02:25.630> pump<00:02:25.870> we've

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
drop drop cable wire to your pump we've

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.350 
drop drop cable wire to your pump we've
got<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.920> splice<00:02:27.250> kit<00:02:27.459> which<00:02:27.610> we<00:02:27.760> supply<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.120> if

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
got a splice kit which we supply you if

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.580 
got a splice kit which we supply you if
you<00:02:28.480> heat<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.810> up<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:29.200> makes<00:02:29.350> a<00:02:29.440> nice

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
you heat that up and it makes a nice

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.140 
you heat that up and it makes a nice
tight<00:02:29.800> watertight<00:02:30.640> seal

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
tight watertight seal

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.960 
tight watertight seal
okay<00:02:31.420> that's<00:02:31.840> part<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.140> what<00:02:32.260> is<00:02:32.380> fine<00:02:32.970> all

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
okay that's part of what is fine all
