00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
single day I think about maybe once a

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.230 
single day I think about maybe once a
week<00:04:43.710> or<00:04:43.860> couple<00:04:44.310> days<00:04:44.460> out<00:04:44.670> of<00:04:44.730> the<00:04:44.850> week<00:04:44.940> I

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
kind of get emotional and just kind of

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.250 
kind of get emotional and just kind of
be<00:04:47.550> like<00:04:47.580> oh<00:04:47.940> my<00:04:48.180> gosh<00:04:48.450> like<00:04:48.720> what's<00:04:48.930> happened

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
to me but just got to be so positive and

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.110 
to me but just got to be so positive and
make<00:04:52.800> sure<00:04:52.980> that<00:04:53.190> you<00:04:53.430> surround<00:04:53.760> yourself

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
make sure that you surround yourself

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.840 
make sure that you surround yourself
with<00:04:54.150> people<00:04:54.390> who<00:04:54.570> are<00:04:54.690> there<00:04:54.900> for<00:04:54.930> you<00:04:55.230> um<00:04:55.850> and

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
with people who are there for you um and

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.910 
with people who are there for you um and
I<00:04:57.690> know<00:04:57.720> that<00:04:58.080> as<00:04:58.260> far<00:04:58.500> as<00:04:58.530> family<00:04:58.890> members

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
I know that as far as family members

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.040 
I know that as far as family members
it's<00:04:59.520> so<00:04:59.790> hard<00:05:00.120> because<00:05:00.420> they<00:05:00.630> don't

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
it's so hard because they don't

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.680 
it's so hard because they don't
understand<00:05:01.710> and<00:05:02.100> even<00:05:03.060> if<00:05:03.180> they're<00:05:03.390> given<00:05:03.630> a

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
understand and even if they're given a

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.480 
understand and even if they're given a
book<00:05:03.900> I<00:05:04.170> think<00:05:04.230> it's<00:05:04.590> still<00:05:04.830> really<00:05:05.160> hard<00:05:05.370> for

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
book I think it's still really hard for

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.770 
book I think it's still really hard for
them<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:05.730> comprehend<00:05:06.180> like<00:05:06.390> what<00:05:06.600> just

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
them to comprehend like what just

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.470 
them to comprehend like what just
happened<00:05:07.140> to<00:05:07.440> us<00:05:07.470> or<00:05:07.920> you<00:05:08.510> so<00:05:09.710> and<00:05:11.480> hopefully

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
happened to us or you so and hopefully

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.290 
happened to us or you so and hopefully
