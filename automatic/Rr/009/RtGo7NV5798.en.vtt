00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
finish at double the speed and really

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.210 
finish at double the speed and really
some<00:02:00.900> of<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.080> important<00:02:01.560> things<00:02:01.770> for<00:02:01.950> people

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
some of the important things for people

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.310 
some of the important things for people

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.930 
to understand as to why this is possible
for<00:02:04.500> us<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.830> because<00:02:05.040> with<00:02:05.310> altie<00:02:05.610> motion

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940

day what it means for hurkos customers

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.990 
day what it means for hurkos customers
is<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:28.170> ability<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.739> machine<00:02:29.070> parts<00:02:29.459> faster

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
is the ability to machine parts faster

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.380 
is the ability to machine parts faster

for motion control the two most

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.320 
for motion control the two most
important<00:02:36.420> things<00:02:36.720> are<00:02:36.990> speed<00:02:37.680> and

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
important things are speed and

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.530 
important things are speed and
