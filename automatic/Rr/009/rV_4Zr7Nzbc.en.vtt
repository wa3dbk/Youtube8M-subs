00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:10.250

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.620
 against all for a video fan of the times 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.970

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.390
 there what I'm going to show you his dishes 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.000
 two days of 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.640
 under the drop in fact so November 2 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.830

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.170
 a in the bruz lab leads so 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.660
 that is basically the limbic system 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.360
 spleen goal of our new wholesale on and 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.770
 I had to make it I had to donate 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.700
 wind and dance catches from there 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.829
 because you're going to help daddy 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.860
 because never lose a lot of 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.320
 time then and the almanac this of 3 was 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.420
 the next day it was basically like 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.100
 craftsmen and konami ska yet in a 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.890
 villa should enjoy for mu card 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:55.620
 nature in this area 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.920
 kraft 49 28 years the aircraft 19 thanks to 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.809
 ayman axis and again 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.330
 and again 3 it seems to me these are these three 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.770
 years when I have museums and it has me 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.799
 allowed to obtain 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.030
 you are without knowing each other and a double 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.890
 day I had kraft too ya 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.810
 just a kraft 20h20 so I think 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.159
 in total gave me 381.8 of neutral so 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.829
 then the next day 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.350
 finally the next day it was evening so 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.299
 the day I wake up around noon I'm 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.130
 went looking for why to enjoy 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:35.829
 still manna axis so I'm 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.719
 village tailor workshop alley and 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.189
 I farm important weight is 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:42.039
 really simple considering that coco is a 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:45.520
 captures 50 and creates his fans in singles 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:48.159
 to kraft so in fact what it takes is 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.399
 at the end of which you stay there it is 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.729
 capture at 2 2 to 2 to 2 which makes us 3 3 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:57.549
 4 on according to a spell that you 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.129
 catch and suddenly that makes you 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.280
 basically we have to find ourselves 

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:06.330
 with 30 wholesale capture so that's all 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:11.140
 does a lot of resources 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.790
 so I could crastes 4 nov in total the 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.620
 areas of europe 1 it was not too much 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:21.490
 load planckaert 87 +9 is more dense 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.120
 then +6 again so we are kraft 106 me 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.190
