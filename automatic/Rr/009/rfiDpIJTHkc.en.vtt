00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
hybrid electric vehicles we've got so

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.029 
hybrid electric vehicles we've got so
also<00:00:40.690> got<00:00:40.839> some<00:00:41.079> technology<00:00:41.649> on<00:00:41.739> exhaust

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
also got some technology on exhaust

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.069 
also got some technology on exhaust
treatment<00:00:42.429> to<00:00:42.879> improve<00:00:43.329> emissions<00:00:43.870> for

fuel tank systems on the market right

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.180 
fuel tank systems on the market right
now<00:00:48.729> I<00:00:49.199> understand<00:00:50.199> these<00:00:50.379> could<00:00:50.620> be<00:00:50.710> used<00:00:50.949> on

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
now I understand these could be used on

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.069 
now I understand these could be used on
like<00:00:51.399> the<00:00:51.609> chevy<00:00:52.209> volt<00:00:52.449> or<00:00:52.659> the<00:00:52.719> Nissan<00:00:53.049> Leaf

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
like the chevy volt or the Nissan Leaf

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.439 
like the chevy volt or the Nissan Leaf
correct<00:00:53.949> any<00:00:54.129> any<00:00:54.399> electric<00:00:54.819> vehicle<00:00:55.239> has<00:00:55.420> a

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
correct any any electric vehicle has a

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.029 
correct any any electric vehicle has a
battery<00:00:55.899> pack<00:00:56.139> and<00:00:56.199> those<00:00:56.469> battery<00:00:56.769> packs

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
battery pack and those battery packs

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.559 
battery pack and those battery packs
heat<00:00:57.249> up<00:00:57.399> and<00:00:57.549> they<00:00:57.609> require<00:00:57.940> cooling<00:00:58.420> and

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:58.569 
heat up and they require cooling and

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:00.119 
heat up and they require cooling and
these<00:00:58.690> technologies<00:00:59.589> allow<00:00:59.859> it<00:00:59.920> to<00:00:59.979> be

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
these technologies allow it to be

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.979 
these technologies allow it to be
liquid-cooled<00:01:00.489> based<00:01:01.269> on<00:01:01.449> systems<00:01:01.839> that

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
liquid-cooled based on systems that

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.500 
liquid-cooled based on systems that
exist<00:01:02.079> today<00:01:02.379> in<00:01:02.799> the<00:01:02.949> auto<00:01:03.100> industry<00:01:03.510> these

exist today in the auto industry these

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.450 
exist today in the auto industry these
would<00:01:04.720> all<00:01:04.750> be<00:01:05.050> factory<00:01:05.590> installed<00:01:06.070> or<00:01:06.310> they'd

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
would all be factory installed or they'd

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.460 
would all be factory installed or they'd
be<00:01:06.520> aftermarket<00:01:07.330> correct<00:01:07.750> these<00:01:07.900> are<00:01:08.080> factory

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
be aftermarket correct these are factory

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.930 
be aftermarket correct these are factory
installed<00:01:08.800> technologies<00:01:09.430> you<00:01:09.580> wouldn't<00:01:09.850> do

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
something like this in the aftermarket

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.820 
something like this in the aftermarket
now<00:01:13.060> what<00:01:13.210> is<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.510> cost<00:01:14.080> of<00:01:14.410> these<00:01:14.590> pieces

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
now what is the cost of these pieces

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.190 
now what is the cost of these pieces
here<00:01:15.220> tell<00:01:15.730> you<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.030> exact<00:01:16.330> cost<00:01:16.630> it<00:01:16.810> depends

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
here tell you the exact cost it depends

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.980 
here tell you the exact cost it depends
on<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:17.380> product<00:01:17.650> specific<00:01:18.690> volume<00:01:19.690> and

compartment in this case here we've got
a<00:01:39.490> new<00:01:39.700> technology<00:01:40.300> that<00:01:40.330> reduces<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:41.230> noise

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
a new technology that reduces the noise

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.970 
a new technology that reduces the noise
of<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:43.240> system<00:01:43.870> and<00:01:44.050> itself<00:01:44.380> institute

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
of the the system and itself institute

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.230 
of the the system and itself institute
for<00:01:45.250> passenger<00:01:45.640> comfort<00:01:45.970> and<00:01:46.090> noise

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
for passenger comfort and noise

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.520 
for passenger comfort and noise
reduction<00:01:46.540> when<00:01:47.110> you're<00:01:47.230> in<00:01:47.290> a<00:01:47.350> hybrid

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
reduction when you're in a hybrid

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.410 
reduction when you're in a hybrid
vehicle<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:48.280> it's<00:01:48.760> running<00:01:48.909> an<00:01:49.060> electric

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
vehicle and it's running an electric

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.180 
vehicle and it's running an electric
mode<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.750> car<00:01:49.960> runs<00:01:50.170> very<00:01:50.380> quiet<00:01:50.770> so<00:01:51.100> the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
mode the car runs very quiet so the

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.220 
mode the car runs very quiet so the
challenge<00:01:51.430> for<00:01:51.790> a<00:01:51.850> lot<00:01:51.909> of<00:01:52.060> suppliers<00:01:52.690> is<00:01:53.050> to

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
challenge for a lot of suppliers is to

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.050 
challenge for a lot of suppliers is to
find<00:01:53.500> a<00:01:53.590> way<00:01:53.740> to<00:01:53.800> reduce<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.610> noise<00:01:54.760> within
