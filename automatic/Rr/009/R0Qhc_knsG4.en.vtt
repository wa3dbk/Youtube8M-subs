00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:12.709
 my first day at univativ was right 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:14.240
 Well, I was a bit nervous 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:15.650
 but the nervousness became fast 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.330
 taken by the nice colleagues and 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.720
 All in all it was a great one 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.330
 Day 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.060
 i was guided in dorum we were 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.140
 all employees preordered here was 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.720
 shown as the coffee machine 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.850
 works and where the tea is cooked 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.400
 So man was very well received and 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.050
 very collegial treated first of all 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.880
 all my colleagues were introduced to me 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.070
 then something came to me about mine 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.739
 Task area tells how well the first one 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.420
 day of the univativ there you are natural 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.730
 always a little bit excited new 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.380
 Employees new environment but after 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.850
 a certain time since air conditioning 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.739
 and then get in full 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.020
 I have come across a project though 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.309
 small detours 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.780
 I'm also applied for a job in 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.780
 The applicant pool will be included 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.460
 and then became univative itself 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.710
 Called and asked if this project 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.930
 want to do makes me says 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.720
 Project manager to the customer have me 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.799
 First of all, you will become whole 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.990
 normal as with any other 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.790
 company then becomes one 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.100
 interview 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.750
 which has then univative first 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.799
 Employees know a bit 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:25.250
 about his experiences and if 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.680
 Everything fits then you can possibly synonymous 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.360
 Politics get the routine is that 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.979
 it simply brings to a project 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.020
 then one becomes a conversation 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.450
 then during a certain time 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.040
 Invited and if you're lucky 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.870
 you then also this project then 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.340
 introduced 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.810
 So I could learn a lot of knowledge 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.830
 bring in my studies there now 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.860
 also in the area of â€‹â€‹personal marketing 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.960
 Work had previously been focused on 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.930
 bachelor also marketing and staff 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.780
 voted therefore it was super fit of 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.400
 the tasks I'm doing here are sociology 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.960
 I could not study very many 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.090
 knowledge from my studies 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.650
 factory student job but I bring 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.960
 learn a lot of new experiences here 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.400
 and things I definitely add 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.820
 next to my good use 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.070
 can 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.320
 my knowledge comes from the study 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.360
 I temporarily bring in the project 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.270
 a lot of knowledge from the school 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.440
 that have prior knowledge and of course 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.940
 It was quite new knowledge 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.850
 to acquire and over the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.260
 beyond the edge of the plate 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.940
 I already have some knowledge in my studies 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.370
 I could also get more often 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.740
 already at the customer bring in one 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.390
 more often new things to learn 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.770
 and also can be helpful though 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.810
 you have a good grasp 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.520
 Practical experience is more or less 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.400
 crucial in the bachelor's program 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.620
 This would be too short a study 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.600
 it's still good somewhere 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.970
 to have references especially to the win 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.420
 situation that I also practice experience 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.980
 and earn 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.420
 I think it's very important next to that 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.700
 Studying also to gain practical experience 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.620
 just to get a better chance later 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.180
 on the labor market have to 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.010
 Look at one of the area where you look 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.020
 For example, now a focus 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.959
 in the study really has also laid the 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.319
 is the one in a fun 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.410
 the first steps into working life are 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.130
 very important on the one hand one knots 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.930
 contacts one learns also the 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.519
 to know different company structures 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.989
 and always learn something new what you do 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.300
 also in the study I maybe necessarily 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.010
 it's very important to know 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.709
 gain practical experience 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.260
 by trying 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.850
 to find perspectives in life themselves 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.709
 in the future just bring on 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.750
 if you learn the theory in the study 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.140
 you should also the practice 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.140
 learn
