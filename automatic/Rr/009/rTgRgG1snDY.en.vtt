you well I know your well I'm fine okay

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.660 
you well I know your well I'm fine okay
what's<00:00:17.820> your<00:00:18.150> question<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:19.230> be<00:00:19.470> let<00:00:20.340> me<00:00:20.490> write

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
what's your question to be let me write

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.450 
what's your question to be let me write
it<00:00:20.699> down<00:00:21.859> great<00:00:22.859> so<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:23.699> X<00:00:24.510> Y<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.410> less<00:00:25.470> than

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
it down great so it is X Y is less than

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.389 
it down great so it is X Y is less than
three<00:00:26.970> ton<00:00:27.330> okay<00:00:28.170> equals<00:00:28.800> n<00:00:29.179> whip<00:00:30.289> over

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
three ton okay equals n whip over

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:39.729 
three ton okay equals n whip over
infinity<00:00:32.399> are<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:34.100> to<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> square<00:00:35.880> PI<00:00:38.360> right

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
infinity are you to a square PI right

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.369 
infinity are you to a square PI right
this<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.890> an<00:00:40.980> easy<00:00:41.100> one<00:00:41.340> folks<00:00:41.670> how<00:00:42.570> do<00:00:43.350> we

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
this is an easy one folks how do we

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.880 
this is an easy one folks how do we
solve<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.370> problem<00:00:45.059> first<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:46.020> all<00:00:46.200> what<00:00:46.860> is

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
solve this problem first of all what is

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.310 
solve this problem first of all what is
this<00:00:48.649> it's<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.860> parent<00:00:50.870> but<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.079> not

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
this it's a parent but it's not

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.810 
this it's a parent but it's not
applicable<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:54.510> take<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.230> eggs<00:00:55.469> away<00:00:56.129> how

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
applicable so we take the eggs away how

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.299 
applicable so we take the eggs away how
do<00:00:56.879> we<00:00:57.120> do<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.570> lamar<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.770> take<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.160> eggs

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
do we do this is lamar we take the eggs

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.360 
do we do this is lamar we take the eggs
away<00:00:59.520> because<00:00:59.940> we've<00:01:00.480> got<00:01:00.629> two<00:01:00.870> people<00:01:01.370> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
away because we've got two people the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.969 
away because we've got two people the
two<00:01:02.399> people<00:01:02.730> were<00:01:03.420> married<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.739> one

two people were married the one

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.250 
two people were married the one
separates<00:01:05.820> from<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> other<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:06.960> called

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
separates from the other and it's called

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.109 
separates from the other and it's called
there<00:01:07.560> it's<00:01:08.780> that's<00:01:09.780> right<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.500> there<00:01:10.680> it's

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
there it's that's right so there it's

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.039 
there it's that's right so there it's
the<00:01:12.119> X<00:01:12.360> goes<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.960> eats<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:15.240> pie<00:01:15.540> yeah

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
the X goes and eats that the pie yeah

equals in whipped over you are we take
the<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.240> are<00:01:36.479> over<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.590> be<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.460> equal

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
the you are over to be for the equal

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.190 
the you are over to be for the equal
sign<00:01:38.869> why<00:01:39.869> do<00:01:39.930> we<00:01:40.170> do<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.759> fun<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:42.659> Lima<00:01:43.049> why

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
sign why do we do that fun is Lima why

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.609 
sign why do we do that fun is Lima why
do<00:01:43.259> we<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:44.100> don't<00:01:44.579> because<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.090> say<00:01:45.360> so

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
do we do that I don't because I say so

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.670 
do we do that I don't because I say so
okay<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.460> got<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.630> r<00:01:48.869> equals<00:01:49.680> y<00:01:50.040> 3<00:01:50.939> 10<00:01:51.270> /

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
okay so we got you r equals y 3 10 /

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.510 
okay so we got you r equals y 3 10 /
mweb<00:01:53.570> is<00:01:54.570> more<00:01:55.140> because<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:55.740> had<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:56.100> less<00:01:56.490> than

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
mweb is more because we had a less than

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.080 
mweb is more because we had a less than
sign<00:01:57.149> before<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.320> equal<00:01:58.829> now<00:01:59.280> we<00:01:59.430> take<00:01:59.850> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
sign before the equal now we take the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.880 
sign before the equal now we take the
little<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.780> take<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.140> off<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
little and take it to off to the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.260 
little and take it to off to the
equal<00:02:02.250> sign<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.939> becomes<00:02:03.530> more<00:02:04.939> it<00:02:05.939> becomes

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
equal sign so it becomes more it becomes

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.690 
equal sign so it becomes more it becomes
a<00:02:06.479> more<00:02:06.780> sign<00:02:07.729> now<00:02:08.729> we<00:02:08.789> need<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.239> go<00:02:09.450> beyond<00:02:09.780> sir

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
a more sign now we need to go beyond sir

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.619 
a more sign now we need to go beyond sir
then<00:02:10.970> you<00:02:11.090> see<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.420> answer<00:02:11.540> coming<00:02:12.310> can<00:02:13.310> you

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
then you see the answer coming can you

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.589 
then you see the answer coming can you
okay<00:02:14.629> because<00:02:14.989> here<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.760> n-word<00:02:17.239> goes

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
okay because here it is the n-word goes

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.360 
okay because here it is the n-word goes
away<00:02:17.870> over<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:19.040> 3-ton<00:02:19.959> so<00:02:20.959> we<00:02:21.170> are<00:02:21.319> late<00:02:21.530> with

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
away over the 3-ton so we are late with

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.740 
away over the 3-ton so we are late with
what<00:02:22.610> we<00:02:23.540> are<00:02:23.690> left<00:02:23.870> with<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.950> are<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.750> the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
what we are left with you are and the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.229 
what we are left with you are and the
more<00:02:26.780> sign<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.340> o<00:02:28.489> in<00:02:29.530> from<00:02:30.530> ton<00:02:31.060> so<00:02:32.060> is

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
more sign and the o in from ton so is
