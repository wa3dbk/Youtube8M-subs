 Welcome to the ico cookie processing plant 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.349
 the preparation of cookies begins with the receipt of raw materials 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.109
 those ingredients are prepared and selected for mixing 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.140
 the mixture is prepared according to each recipe 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.130
 which are stored digitally in the memory of a 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.859
 computer 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.789
 of the different mixtures and treatments result different types of masses 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.789
 which correspond to three different types of cookies 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.150

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.310

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.740

 refrigeration 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.730
