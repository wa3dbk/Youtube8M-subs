00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.300
 let's get the hunt half for 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.860
 evolve to our good hunting 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.770
 things to keep in mind to get 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.800
 the hunt to the hunting half must have 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:31.960
 visited fluxus city and talk to the 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:34.870
 professor cypress before anything and have us 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.850
 past the league pokemon always find 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.070
 the stones you have to find the league 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.020
 pokemon then we're going to direct the 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.950
 city ​​already enters and we will go south as 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.870
 you have seen 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:50.790
 moments before here I use a repellent that 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.610
 it is something very advisable 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.100
 and basically is this in 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.199
 this cave in the cave reflections 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.149
 there are two paths no longer I have 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.980
 chosen the shortest is simply 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.110
 get inside as you enter the cave to the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.110
 right down a bit and you get into the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.070
 left always remember the subject of 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.950
 the shadows do not do not step on the shadows 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.530
 because they were wild pokemon and this is 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.049
 the point of no return there in the mirror 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.119
 that you see there is an entrance to the cave 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.020
 here you are going to find a poke ball 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.350
 with I do not remember what it was really and 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.840
 here on the left on the east lake that 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.659
 it's not a lake it's really an area of 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.250
 bright is where you are at 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.649
 Half hunt due to video quality 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.040
 Well , you are not going to see it but well here 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.410

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.190

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.190
