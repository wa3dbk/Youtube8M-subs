00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.200
 separate cookies to make them a 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.860

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.270
 butter at room temperature in the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.870

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.830
 seconds 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:54.740
 depending on how we are going to see 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.740
 of that texture is more than perfect 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.650
 we revolve our 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.520
 and butter 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:09.250
 and we're going to put it in the cookies 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.250
 that we already crushed, we started 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.870
 and mix 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.340
 I can do it with a whisk can 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.340
 do it with your hands like you do 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.150

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.340
 there is nothing Russian 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.329
 they start to make it difficult to do it with 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.549
 his hands to forgive him do it with the master 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:37.140

 with your hands as follows 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.520

 I can put it on base and we start 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:04.780
 use our cookies to put them on 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.630
 base in our container as they can 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.700
 observe 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.790
 and that 's how it should be 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.270
 this container once it is already 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.910
 placed all his cookie like this 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.380
 easily what happens to do the 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.600
 next step that is also very 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.170
 important we take the glass of our 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.170
 blender 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.000

 being our milk is our milk 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.460
 milkmaking preferably with what not 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.410
 liquid first so that it gets in the 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.370
 cheese can first be stuck in 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.440
 the antlers and we happened to incorporate 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.480
 our 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.810
 remaining ingredients in our glass 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.810
 of the blender 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.610
 you are very easy you can split in two 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.040
 his weight philadelphia go in three 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.530
 depending for everything to be easy 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.990
 near you I want to incorporate 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.360
 one by one the bars as they can 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.300
 see if they do not do less 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.289
 dump and disaster in its consumption 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.289
 and liquefy 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.430
 once once our mix is ​​ready 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.200
 we are going to incorporate in our container 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.680
 that we have added the cookie 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.680
 around 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:53.349
 and in the end we will incorporate the cookie 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:53.349
 that previously 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:00.040
 brings aside and shred as it is 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.320
 the cookie to go over this 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.410
 cookie will give you a texture 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.830
 different to our bread will not be left 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.670
 as well as white but it's going to stay that way 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.670
 as follows 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.810
 and of 12 cautiously and then if we have 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.210
 that cover it perfectly comes 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.039
 towards the way it should look like 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.870
 As you can see it is very easy and good 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.930
 simple now let's move on to 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.810

 Well, I let you know that in the end it is 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:39.330
 how is our country of cheese 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:43.040
 remember that they are between 30 to 40 minutes 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.650
 an echo if important to know 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.110
 is that they are going to inflate or not 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.730
 worry that's normal then it's going to 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.670
 deflate and it will stay in my size 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.470
 normal and desired 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:58.250
 now like this cheese pie we did it 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:00.890
 with the ingredients that were one of 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.960
 each can double double 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:08.880

 before I forget also what 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.360
 You can obviously get out expecting the 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:30.930
 appropriate time to do it until about 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.240
 20 minutes to 30 20 minutes so that 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:36.440
 not going to stick to quartear and so 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.270
