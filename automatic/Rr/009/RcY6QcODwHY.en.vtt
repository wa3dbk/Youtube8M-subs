faithful<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.550> what<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.819> original<00:02:30.239> stuff<00:02:30.510> was

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
faithful to what the original stuff was

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.080 
faithful to what the original stuff was
while<00:02:31.349> doing<00:02:31.769> it<00:02:31.830> in<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.099> modern<00:02:32.310> context<00:02:33.000> at

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
while doing it in a modern context at

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.309 
while doing it in a modern context at
the<00:02:33.150> same<00:02:33.360> time<00:02:33.569> and<00:02:33.690> now<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.810> look<00:02:34.050> at<00:02:34.200> that

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
the same time and now you look at that

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.940 
the same time and now you look at that
clearly<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.280> is<00:02:35.459> modern<00:02:36.330> but<00:02:36.870> clearly<00:02:37.410> this

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
clearly this is modern but clearly this

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.009 
clearly this is modern but clearly this
is<00:02:38.160> completely<00:02:38.819> an<00:02:39.060> ode<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.420> original<00:02:39.870> and

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
is completely an ode to the original and

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.210 
is completely an ode to the original and
completely<00:02:40.410> faithful<00:02:40.769> to<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.890> original<00:02:40.920> at

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
completely faithful to the original at

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.339 
completely faithful to the original at
the<00:02:41.280> same<00:02:41.400> time<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.849> am<00:02:42.480> more<00:02:42.810> excited<00:02:43.290> about

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
the same time I am more excited about

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.430 
the same time I am more excited about
this<00:02:43.650> than<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:44.459> 40<00:02:45.030> plus<00:02:45.239> year<00:02:45.420> old<00:02:45.480> man<00:02:45.780> should

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
this than a 40 plus year old man should

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.830 
this than a 40 plus year old man should
not<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:47.130> am<00:02:47.489> so<00:02:47.910> psyched<00:02:48.209> for<00:02:48.330> this<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.690> that's

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
not I am so psyched for this and that's

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.360 
not I am so psyched for this and that's
a<00:02:48.930> fair<00:02:49.140> point<00:02:49.440> because<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:49.890> don't<00:02:50.130> want<00:02:50.280> this

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
a fair point because you don't want this

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.039 
a fair point because you don't want this
to<00:02:50.519> turn<00:02:50.670> into<00:02:50.730> another<00:02:51.000> Smurfs<00:02:51.510> where<00:02:51.780> we<00:02:51.930> all

to turn into another Smurfs where we all
grew<00:02:52.200> up<00:02:52.230> waking<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.739> Smurfs<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.099> that<00:02:53.220> was

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
grew up waking the Smurfs and that was

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.589 
grew up waking the Smurfs and that was
pretty<00:02:53.489> innocent<00:02:53.700> but<00:02:53.970> what<00:02:54.120> they<00:02:54.239> did<00:02:54.480> with

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599
