00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.140
 it's a bunch because we could say 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.119
 of Portuguese influence with sauce 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.550
 Spanish with Quebec products - 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.320
 it's multicultural in fact it's a 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.269
 little Portuguese inspiration the cod to 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.380
 the braz but often the turn of the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.420
 similarities between recipes 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.880
 Portuguese worse this Spanish from by the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.800
 simple hockey ingredients from 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.660

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.079
 québec we could say tip of the gaspésie 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.730

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.539
 olive table apples onions 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.950

 departure carbonara his contract that not 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.699
 for fish is actually the same 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.770
 technique it's a plan that's going to be my 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.570
 mini missions from the shadows so
