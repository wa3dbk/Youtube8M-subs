00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.750
 on 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.630
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.300
 next product review from mac mini at 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.820
 As you can see we have ours today 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.550
 location the product we adapted 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.829
 are in the editorial board and want 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.770
 Give the smart body a quieter sound today 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.689
 Imagine doing the unboxing from the left 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.860
 today also very uncomplicated 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.690
 because we just pull the ones 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.310
 Packing away and underneath the beautiful 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.920
 product that is what you are today 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.260
 want to introduce the smart body 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.590
 Analysis of that in a really nice 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.410
 design in front and stands with a stainless steel 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.470
 there in the middle and across and along 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.660
 dashes for the measurement of body fat 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.400
 At the top of the week we still have one 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.200
 very big black and white display 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.430
 actually all information like 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:06.210
 weight body fat pulse co2 worth or 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.590
 the temperature outside is displayed import 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.150
 otherwise you can demonstrate briefly 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.020
 namely, we go to the very short 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.539
 Libra and you can see the scales will be 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.329
 activates very special 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:22.890
 A novelty is that you are at the castle 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:24.950
 Here are two small events left 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.530
 that means that the goods are wrong 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.179
 that means in the end that that 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.950
 weight can not be measured correctly 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:35.520
 Can only if I dare you 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.039
 and all four corners say otherwise 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.380
 are balanced the scales are the 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.270
 right weight we can do it 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.679
 demonstrate somehow bad because 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.259
 and like to stand in front of the camera 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:49.139
 means the display is in this 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.299
 resolution and also in this quality 

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:52.060
 We will be back later 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.790
 detail 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.009
 as it then looks on the app because 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.320
 that is actually the basic feature of 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.140
 this dare namely the smart bolena 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.659
 You can connect more quietly with an app 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.970
 and all the data on the scales 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.599
 have been measured directly on the 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.950
 iphone then transfer here as well 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.900
 create desired goals such as for example 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.000
 now wants to lose five kilos and 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.300
 then come with this car exactly 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.950
 document how to lose weight 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.830
 the room climate changed how 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.170
 temperature is just in the board or even 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.600
 also how the body fat percentage 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.459
 has reduced or just increased that 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.799
 But now I show right away from the 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.410
 product itself is the processing 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:40.060
 really top of the floor is plastic 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.340
 top has something on it and this important too 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.890
 acceptable and not too much now 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.630
 place away in the boat 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.970
 All in all, we find great product 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.599
 and now let's have a look at the app 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.190
 a little closer to how we are 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.340
 have promised us look now 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.620
 app of the body analysis something more accurate for 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.450
 to inform you the apps the app 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.450
 There is free directly in the app store 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.829
 or you can do it over the conditional 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.810
 Download homepage at any time 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.790
 there are many updates from the 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.340
 apples will be there new features 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.010
 added or troubleshooting or 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.420
 bugs just fixed the design is 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.130
 simple and beautiful 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.590
 Here is an overview of the 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.600
 people are watching with this one right now 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.019
 worry is we have that 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.540
 Today's weight we can 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.359
 aiming to set up what you want now 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.180
 very briefly again we do can 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:37.690
 activate this feature and then 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.299
 so to speak, enter a desired weight 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.310
 we reach in a certain period of time 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:46.139
 want and then keep this stable 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.340
 the whole works with it 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.660
 notifications and the whole will then 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.569
 just with the scales and with the 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.840
 combined measured data and one has 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.880
 then a certain incentive of this 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.610
 to reach desired weight or that 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.120
 keep weight up 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.489
 we again go back very briefly 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.280
 we still have the air quality here and 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.409
 The room temperature is very high 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.909
 very nice statistics each day 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.530
 split we have one 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:15.470
 average temperature we have one 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:19.370
 maximum temperature and then below 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:22.010
 you can still see the co2 level again 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.100
 here a minimum and a maximum value 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.130
 because we can go here again 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.430
 switchen days back and forth between the 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:34.789
 or we second quite normal 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:37.580
 then we go to the heart rate here 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:41.030
 Of course you can also have a graph 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.979
 one days a week or even months 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.510
 divide 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:47.930
 we see the individual here 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.650
 Results 62 strokes per minute hero 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.320
 agitated 107 beats per minute 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.330
 We can all of these results in 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.139
 a normal clear format 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.720
 reproduce 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.370
 this works at heart rate and 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.910
 Of course, with the kilogram 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:10.430
 Here we see the body fat of with 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:12.229
 has been measured 13 12 25 kilo 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.030
 Of course she was very strong 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.510
 after where you measure yourself in the evening 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:20.389
 the early and we can still 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:23.030
 add different people or 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.610
 just remove it 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.669
 at the mountains it is so that maximum 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.660
 four people on this vague 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.270
 can be configured 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.639
 the scale is automatically recognized by who 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.180
 then approached with his iphone and 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:41.330
 who is being measured then everything in the 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.830
 All the app is very stable 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.330
 we still have a small page here 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.880
 Share menus with friends 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.979
 Settings also a user 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.370
 You can create with notifications 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:55.550
 work or share his weights or 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.620
 just connect with other apps too 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.440
 runkeeper or other stuff over 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.289
 the company wings said that it was 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.930
 Will that also be more apps and also sports 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:08.110
 bracelets like those of nike or the of 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.990
 We have already reviewed 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.850
 Starting from jobs also supported with the app 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.440
 and then, so to speak 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.930
 created a complete fitness plan 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.000
 can be where the weight then with 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.410
 calculated and also taken into account 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.990
 becomes 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:24.940
 I hope I have all now 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.040
 better because we have the app 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.110
 as desired no longer 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.360
 intercepted but have them directly from 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.850
 iphone and taken in the layout 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.590
 Of course , it also results in packaging 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.600
 Benefits significantly sharper the 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.850
 no contrasts are better as well 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.100
 something should be noticed at 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.610
 our reviews just commented 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.370
 below 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.570
 otherwise wish you much fun and 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:51.030
 We hope that the product has you 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:51.030
 fallen and until next week
