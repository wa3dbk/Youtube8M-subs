- hello my name is Sivaji Lumiere from
Salafi<00:00:03.120> ulama<00:00:03.300> calm<00:00:04.049> I'm<00:00:04.470> here<00:00:05.100> on<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.700> head

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
Salafi ulama calm I'm here on the head

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.230 
Salafi ulama calm I'm here on the head
of<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.359> Robert<00:00:06.810> earth<00:00:06.990> gift<00:00:07.820> I'm<00:00:08.820> going<00:00:09.150> to

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
of the Robert earth gift I'm going to

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.589 
of the Robert earth gift I'm going to
show<00:00:09.389> you<00:00:09.450> how<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.780> draw<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.170> Fibonacci<00:00:10.679> spiral

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 
show you how to draw a Fibonacci spiral

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.690 
show you how to draw a Fibonacci spiral
the<00:00:12.599> fibonacci<00:00:12.990> spiral<00:00:13.170> fuels<00:00:13.950> follows<00:00:14.400> the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
the fibonacci spiral fuels follows the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.880 
the fibonacci spiral fuels follows the
geometric<00:00:15.690> pattern<00:00:16.139> composed<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.740> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
geometric pattern composed of the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.310 
geometric pattern composed of the
Fibonacci<00:00:17.400> code<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.240> code<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.900> sequence

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
Fibonacci code the code is the sequence

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.279 
Fibonacci code the code is the sequence
of<00:00:19.500> numbers<00:00:20.340> like<00:00:20.699> 0<00:00:20.730> 1<00:00:21.890> 1<00:00:22.910> 2<00:00:23.910> 3<00:00:24.350> 5<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.519> on

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
of numbers like 0 1 1 2 3 5 and and on

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.339 
of numbers like 0 1 1 2 3 5 and and on
so<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.500> see<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:30.000> each<00:00:30.359> remaining<00:00:30.810> number

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
so we see that the each remaining number

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.069 
so we see that the each remaining number
is<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.619> sum<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:31.920> two<00:00:32.099> previous<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:33.000> 3<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
is the sum of two previous like 3 is the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.990 
is the sum of two previous like 3 is the
sum<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.500> 1<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.130> 2<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.380> on<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:37.739> I'm<00:00:38.520> going<00:00:38.879> to

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
sum of 1 and 2 and so on so I'm going to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.660 
sum of 1 and 2 and so on so I'm going to
draw<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.899> squares<00:00:40.379> using<00:00:40.829> these<00:00:41.190> numbers

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
draw the squares using these numbers

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.920 
draw the squares using these numbers
first<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.300> draw<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.200> square<00:00:43.940> 1<00:00:44.940> by<00:00:44.969> 1<00:00:45.390> unit<00:00:45.750> in

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
first I draw the square 1 by 1 unit in

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.880 
first I draw the square 1 by 1 unit in
measure<00:00:46.370> like<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.210> one<00:00:49.170> more<00:00:49.200> square

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
measure like this and one more square

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.670 
measure like this and one more square
right<00:00:50.219> next<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.700> my<00:00:51.510> first<00:00:51.840> square<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
right next to my first square with the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.779 
right next to my first square with the
same<00:00:52.710> measure<00:00:53.780> then<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.710> next<00:00:56.010> number<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.430> 2

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
same measure then the next number is 2

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.040 
same measure then the next number is 2
so<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.420> draw<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.870> square<00:00:58.320> under<00:00:59.010> my<00:00:59.690> first<00:01:00.690> two

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
so I draw the square under my first two

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.240 
so I draw the square under my first two
squares<00:01:01.440> twist<00:01:02.190> 2<00:01:02.430> by<00:01:02.640> 2<00:01:02.899> units<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.049> measure

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
squares twist 2 by 2 units the measure

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.690 
squares twist 2 by 2 units the measure
the<00:01:05.250> next<00:01:05.640> our<00:01:06.049> number<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.170> 3<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.460> see

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
the next our number is 3 and you see

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.910 
the next our number is 3 and you see
this<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.390> 1<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.500> 2<00:01:10.710> units<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:12.439> here<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.619> my

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
this is 1 this is 2 units and here is my

as you the paper allows you to do that

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.440 
as you the paper allows you to do that
so<00:01:48.060> I'm<00:01:48.270> now<00:01:48.810> going<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.430> outlining<00:01:50.430> my<00:01:50.909> spiral

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
so I'm now going to outlining my spiral

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.929 
so I'm now going to outlining my spiral
I<00:01:51.600> start<00:01:52.079> with<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:53.159> first<00:01:53.189> square<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.920> I<00:01:55.939> just

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
I start with the first square and I just

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.880 
I start with the first square and I just
draw<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.299> cure<00:01:57.810> with<00:01:58.079> line<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.979> this

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890
