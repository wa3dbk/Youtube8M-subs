here you might also see it but only once

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.300 
here you might also see it but only once
you<00:01:27.240> turn<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.540> one<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.780> these<00:01:27.950> so<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
you turn to one of these so that is the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.289 
you turn to one of these so that is the
center<00:01:31.549> nothing<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.729> better<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.030> do<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.150> on

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
center nothing to be better to do it on

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.240 
center nothing to be better to do it on
a<00:01:33.329> non<00:01:33.600> white<00:01:33.840> side<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.720> center

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
a non white side so that is the center

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.039 
a non white side so that is the center
that<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.549> center<00:01:38.880> then<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:40.049> believe<00:01:40.680> this

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
that is the center then I believe this

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:49.580 
that is the center then I believe this
this<00:01:43.399> this<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.439> are<00:01:47.070> all<00:01:48.110> i<00:01:49.110> want

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
this this this and this are all i want

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.200 
this this this and this are all i want
to<00:01:49.619> say<00:01:49.680> edges<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.430> then<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> corners<00:01:51.060> are

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
to say edges and then the corners are

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.719 
to say edges and then the corners are
that<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:52.399> that<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.270> i<00:01:54.689> think<00:01:55.729> so

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
that that that that and that i think so

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.459 
that that that that and that i think so
this<00:01:57.119> thing<00:01:57.360> can<00:01:57.390> get<00:01:57.630> pretty<00:01:57.840> scrambled<00:01:58.380> up

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
this thing can get pretty scrambled up

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.920 
this thing can get pretty scrambled up
so<00:01:58.770> let's<00:01:58.950> see<00:01:59.100> i<00:01:59.280> turn<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:01.040> that

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
so let's see i turn this that

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.389 
so let's see i turn this that
turn<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:05.000> then<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.039> an

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
turn that then I have that so this is an

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.500 
turn that then I have that so this is an
edge<00:02:08.729> these<00:02:09.179> two<00:02:09.479> our<00:02:09.600> corners<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.180> gets

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
edge these two our corners so this gets

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.920 
edge these two our corners so this gets
really<00:02:12.720> jumbled<00:02:13.230> up<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:14.690> it's<00:02:15.690> pretty

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
really jumbled up and it it's pretty

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.479 
really jumbled up and it it's pretty
much<00:02:16.080> salt<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.530> think<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.860> same<00:02:17.040> way<00:02:17.069> as<00:02:17.459> a

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
much salt I think the same way as a

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.460 
much salt I think the same way as a
megaminx<00:02:17.940> but<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.720> might<00:02:18.870> run<00:02:19.050> into<00:02:19.110> some

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
megaminx but you might run into some

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.590 
megaminx but you might run into some
like<00:02:19.680> parody<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.130> some<00:02:20.400> sort<00:02:20.640> but<00:02:21.420> also

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
like parody of some sort but also

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.140 
like parody of some sort but also
because<00:02:22.489> it's<00:02:23.489> kind<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:23.700> hard<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:23.940> wrap<00:02:24.120> your

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
because it's kind of hard to wrap your

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.330 
because it's kind of hard to wrap your
mind<00:02:24.480> around<00:02:24.569> it<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.020> right<00:02:25.860> out<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.160> box

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
mind around it so right out of the box

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.300 
mind around it so right out of the box
turning<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.780> be<00:02:27.870> good<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:28.080> can<00:02:28.290> see<00:02:29.040> it's<00:02:29.160> gonna

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
turning to be good I can see it's gonna

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.990 
turning to be good I can see it's gonna
start<00:02:29.700> catching<00:02:29.910> on<00:02:30.150> some<00:02:30.300> pieces<00:02:35.000> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
start catching on some pieces the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.930 
start catching on some pieces the
stickers<00:02:36.420> look<00:02:36.900> really<00:02:37.140> nice<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.819> only

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
stickers look really nice and the only

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.100 
stickers look really nice and the only
thing<00:02:39.000> worried<00:02:39.330> about<00:02:39.480> are<00:02:39.660> these<00:02:39.780> small<00:02:40.080> ones

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
thing worried about are these small ones

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.449 
thing worried about are these small ones
because<00:02:40.470> as<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.739> can<00:02:40.800> see<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.160> orange<00:02:41.340> is

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
because as you can see the orange is

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.390 
because as you can see the orange is
already<00:02:41.670> falling<00:02:41.880> off<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:43.010> smaller<00:02:44.010> stickers

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
already falling off and smaller stickers

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.780 
already falling off and smaller stickers
tend<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.940> fall<00:02:45.600> off<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:47.310> really<00:02:47.550> don't<00:02:47.610> want

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
tend to fall off and I really don't want

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.900 
tend to fall off and I really don't want
that<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.970> happen<00:02:51.650> I'm<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:52.980> happy<00:02:53.370> I<00:02:53.519> got<00:02:53.730> this

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
that to happen I'm so happy I got this

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.699 
that to happen I'm so happy I got this
I'm<00:02:54.360> probably<00:02:54.690> not<00:02:55.019> going<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.230> scramble<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.620> up

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
I'm probably not going to scramble it up

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.190 
I'm probably not going to scramble it up
today<00:02:55.920> I'm<00:02:56.100> probably<00:02:56.400> just<00:02:56.670> going<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.200> maybe

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
today I'm probably just going to maybe

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.320 
today I'm probably just going to maybe
do<00:02:58.440> some<00:02:58.620> algorithms<00:02:59.069> on<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.459> see<00:02:59.640> what

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
do some algorithms on it and see what

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.559 
do some algorithms on it and see what
happens<00:03:00.660> when<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.840> do<00:03:00.930> those<00:03:02.360> corner<00:03:03.360> cutting

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
happens when I do those corner cutting

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.350 
happens when I do those corner cutting
let's<00:03:04.049> see<00:03:06.920> clinic<00:03:07.920> coding<00:03:08.130> is<00:03:08.250> pretty<00:03:09.180> good

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
let's see clinic coding is pretty good

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.520 
let's see clinic coding is pretty good
actually<00:03:11.000> but<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.600> much<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.650> reverse<00:03:15.530> not

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
actually but that much and reverse not

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.060 
actually but that much and reverse not
really<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.810> this<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.049> a<00:03:19.200> standard<00:03:19.620> color

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
really so this is a standard color

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.580 
really so this is a standard color
scheme<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:21.540> stickers<00:03:21.930> are<00:03:22.019> really<00:03:22.260> popping

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
scheme the stickers are really popping

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.990 
scheme the stickers are really popping
out<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.920> me<00:03:23.010> like<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.220> really<00:03:23.430> like<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.670> blue<00:03:23.850> I

they mass-produced it and then Tony
Fisher<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.049> mass<00:03:37.709> produced<00:03:38.010> by<00:03:38.130> Calvin's
