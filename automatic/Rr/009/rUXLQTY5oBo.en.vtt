00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
to California for Christmas so I decided

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.099 
to California for Christmas so I decided
that<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.980> would<00:00:29.070> just<00:00:29.369> stay<00:00:29.580> local<00:00:30.060> plus<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.929> have

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
that I would just stay local plus I have

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.190 
that I would just stay local plus I have
not<00:00:31.320> seen<00:00:31.710> any<00:00:32.160> really<00:00:32.610> great<00:00:33.000> airline<00:00:33.540> deals

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200

going<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.890> Detroit<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.520> think<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.880> cheapest<00:00:36.270> i

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
going to Detroit I think the cheapest i

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.040 
going to Detroit I think the cheapest i
found<00:00:36.899> was<00:00:37.649> like<00:00:38.430> four<00:00:38.850> hundred<00:00:38.969> dollars<00:00:39.180> and

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
found was like four hundred dollars and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.190 
found was like four hundred dollars and
that's<00:00:40.410> not<00:00:40.590> cheap<00:00:40.860> because<00:00:41.250> my<00:00:41.930> ticket<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.079> go

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
that's not cheap because my ticket to go

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.650 
that's not cheap because my ticket to go
to<00:00:43.230> California<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:44.070> like<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:44.640> 60<00:00:45.090> round<00:00:45.360> trip

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
to California is like for 60 round trip

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.110 
to California is like for 60 round trip
so<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.469> do<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.649> math<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.160> one<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.640> I'll

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
so you do the math on that one so I'll

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.720 
so you do the math on that one so I'll
be<00:00:48.329> local<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:48.750> that's<00:00:49.020> fine<00:00:49.320> but<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.129> wanted<00:00:50.670> to

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
be local but that's fine but I wanted to

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.470
