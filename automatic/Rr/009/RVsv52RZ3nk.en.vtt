this

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.090

that's right would position the
helicopter<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> little<00:00:38.879> better<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.480> see

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
helicopter a little better so we see

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.180

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
both the firefighter the dog and the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.770 
both the firefighter the dog and the
helicopter<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:42.000> you're<00:00:42.090> right<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> dog<00:00:42.539> that

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
helicopter and you're right the dog that

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.840 
helicopter and you're right the dog that
firefighter<00:00:43.500> has<00:00:43.710> got<00:00:43.829> his<00:00:43.949> arms<00:00:44.309> around<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
firefighter has got his arms around the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.630 
firefighter has got his arms around the
dog<00:00:45.059> dog<00:00:45.750> seems<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> be<00:00:46.460> resisting<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
dog dog seems to be resisting the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.450 
dog dog seems to be resisting the
firefighter<00:00:48.300> as<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.199> seen<00:00:49.409> that<00:00:49.860> dog<00:00:50.100> do

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
firefighter as we have seen that dog do

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.719 
firefighter as we have seen that dog do
from<00:00:51.089> the<00:00:51.449> previous<00:00:51.839> effort<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.379> if<00:00:53.129> he<00:00:53.339> gets<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
from the previous effort so if he gets a

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:55.459 
from the previous effort so if he gets a
hold<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.089> the<00:00:54.180> dog<00:00:54.360> perhaps<00:00:54.750> brings<00:00:55.260> them<00:00:55.440> back

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
hold of the dog perhaps brings them back

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.069 
hold of the dog perhaps brings them back
up<00:00:55.890> into<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.129> helicopter<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.540> might<00:00:57.780> be<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
up into the helicopter this might be the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.539 
up into the helicopter this might be the
end<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.409> so<00:00:58.739> we're<00:00:58.890> hoping<00:00:59.219> for<00:00:59.280> that

00:00:59.539 --> 00:00:59.549 
end of it so we're hoping for that

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:00.889 
end of it so we're hoping for that
outcome<00:00:59.909> and<00:01:00.089> we're<00:01:00.210> probably<00:01:00.449> going<00:01:00.659> to<00:01:00.780> see

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
outcome and we're probably going to see

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.509 
outcome and we're probably going to see
here<00:01:01.049> in<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.440> moment<00:01:01.769> there<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.489> see
