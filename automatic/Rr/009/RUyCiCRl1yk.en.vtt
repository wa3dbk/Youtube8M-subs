00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.689
 hi guys are areas welcome to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.689
 this new unboxing 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:22.200
 and here we are for the last video of 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.930
 August and we are back in time again 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.509
 new among the beyblades before proceeding 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.000
 at the boxing but I wanted to remember a 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.489
 moment my last words about 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.720
 these key rings so in all they are 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.030
 seven 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.070
 I would miss 3 I did 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.290
 honestly a little thought to buy them 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.040
 but these four are enough for me 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.800
 main 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.870
 here is precisely how its empty me the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.960
 boys wallet does not know how to do 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.450
 no good but no more talk 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.190
 let's proceed to examine one by one i 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.060
 our key rings 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.560
 here we start from the one in the center 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.530
 we immediately go to remove it from the 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.510
 packaging in no uncertain terms like al 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.610
 usual 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.740
 and here we are with the usual key ring 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.799
 out of the box we go to 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.689
 remove the block and remove it from the 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.960
 launcher let's find out who he is 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.170
 and it is the board this is the beyblade of 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.110
 yuri the Russian team member on 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.720
 the team happens more precisely 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.320
 Russian takes the name of demolition boys 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.530
 or the borg and I am a team of 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.780
 ruthless, very cold fighters of which 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.950
 in the past ours was also a part 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.670
 ok let's see in more detail if 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.920
 yes the beat power is a wolf on the side the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.380
 the power of this beyblade is ice 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.799
 well there is not much to see how to 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.900
 usually the rope is also present 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.450
 the pitcher obviously I showed 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.600
 first with the usual block the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.820
 keychains and since they are three in 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.250
 past we have already seen four non 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.670
 I will dwell much on everyone we go to 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.280
 also open this always with a lot of 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.790
 to live 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.790
 without compromise 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.750
 and here it is out of the box 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.670
 usual rope 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.550
 let's zoom in on the launcher of the 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.270
 red matches the blade's goals we remove 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.480
 the block and here we go to discover 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.690
 who is and is between beyblade flights 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.520
 by michael sommers of the all stars 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.959
 or the team captain 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.940
 American 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.890
 the peculiarity of this beyblade was 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.970
 which was thrown like a ball from 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.350
 baseball its b.power is an eagle 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.790
 fiery wait until he puts it on 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.269
 fire maybe it's obviously the power is the 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.780
 fire 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.519
 the details are always normal but 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.650
 however, let us remember that it is large 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.900
 as much as a two euro coin 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.610
 and we immediately pass to the last of the three 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.160
 keychain we are going to open it and this 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.450
 always live 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:13.030
 here is the usual rope the pitcher 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.860
 let's zoom in and remove the block e 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.769
 let's find out who he is 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.170
 here are the guys there is a surprise I don't know 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.560
 as welcome because it doesn't make much sense 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.900
 in the collection it is sibur un 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.940
 another beyblade of demolition boys 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.660
 or of the Russian team whose 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.610
 owner being gay and I honestly 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.209
 I don't understand what another has to do with it 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.870
 Russian beyblade when they could put o 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.310
 a baby of the European team or 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.440
 especially I think he was there 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.010
 very well a team beyblade 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.680
 Chinese and not any baby but guyon 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.720
 or the beyblade of the captain of the 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.060
 Chinese team that is the one with the beat 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.040
 power of the black lion ok, but they have 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.260
 wanted to enter another Russian movement 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.450
 maybe I really liked it I don't know not 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.519
 I could say the reason and let's go to 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.260
 zoom the bi power it is a 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.600
 the power of this beyblade flashes 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.820
 obviously we have water the details 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.880
 already seen and there is nothing else to say 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.980
 as always these key rings in addition to 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.959
 be spectacular 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.220
 it must be said that they are produced by games 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.870
 precious cost two euros and fifty 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.150
 they were on offer I found them goes 2 euros 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.450
 and 50 but it's still very difficult 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.650
 find them and also products from the di 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.419
 wright 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.900
 here are guys, as you can see 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.240
 from my bowl we came to the 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.460
 your favorite part or the challenge 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.800
 among our beyblades this time 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.750
 I will try to make a three-way encounter too 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:53.820
 if I don't know how feasible it is 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:53.820
 but we will try vai simon weil boris 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:02.530
 rai three goals won drive will be because 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.659
 I definitely launched it last 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.300
 however it is still a victory 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:09.070
 Well guys, I hope you don't 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.190
 you have forgotten the current champion 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.590
 of the past real driver clash that 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.020
 also my favorite babe lille and for 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.659
 conclude our epic among these 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.700
 keychain seems to me right to make a 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:23.950
 encounter between the defending champion is the 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.370
 winner of the previous challenge or 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:31.090
 tribal and here is the final part is 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:34.630
 part dryer as first as always for 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:38.229
 don't cheat we lose we don't fall too much 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:41.860
 time and we throw between ior and viviano 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:44.320
 looks much more powerful tribal is firm 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.539
 in a corner driver moves a lot 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.550
 slowly 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.169
 I think that if he does not go to attack it will end 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.380
 with the tribal victory because I have it 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:56.789
 launched later here is the attack of 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:01.030
 plants driver between goals moves 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:02.080
 another response responds to the attack 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.000
 of drivers 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.310
 attention attention pay attention to 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.159
