make sure you get good height on your
cartwheel<00:00:24.689> Arabian<00:00:25.170> because<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.400> pretty

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
cartwheel Arabian because it's pretty

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.960 
cartwheel Arabian because it's pretty
much<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.939> cartwheel<00:00:27.710> Arabian<00:00:28.710> with<00:00:29.279> an<00:00:29.519> extra

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
much a cartwheel Arabian with an extra

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.569 
much a cartwheel Arabian with an extra
half<00:00:30.240> twist<00:00:30.630> after<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:32.340> you're<00:00:32.460> gonna

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
half twist after that so you're gonna

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.580 
half twist after that so you're gonna
start<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> exact<00:00:33.360> same<00:00:33.630> way<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.380> would

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
start the exact same way that you would

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.920 
start the exact same way that you would
for<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> cartwheel<00:00:35.160> Arabian<00:00:35.780> you're<00:00:36.780> gonna

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
for a cartwheel Arabian you're gonna

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.990 
for a cartwheel Arabian you're gonna
start<00:00:37.410> from<00:00:37.559> standing<00:00:38.040> because<00:00:38.550> that's<00:00:38.790> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
start from standing because that's the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.369 
start from standing because that's the
position<00:00:39.210> where<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> most<00:00:40.110> control

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
position where you have the most control

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.500 
position where you have the most control
in<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.460> if<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.730> do<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.940> from<00:00:42.030> running<00:00:42.390> you'll

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
in so if you do it from running you'll

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.660 
in so if you do it from running you'll
have<00:00:42.690> more<00:00:42.899> momentum<00:00:43.469> but<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.520> from

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
have more momentum but you do it from

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.779 
have more momentum but you do it from
standing<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.570> get<00:00:45.780> more<00:00:45.960> control<00:00:46.670> so<00:00:47.670> we're

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
standing you get more control so we're

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.900 
standing you get more control so we're
gonna<00:00:47.910> start<00:00:48.239> swing<00:00:49.140> your<00:00:49.320> arms<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:50.309> way

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
gonna start swing your arms this way

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.459 
gonna start swing your arms this way
this<00:00:51.180> one<00:00:51.420> goes<00:00:51.600> towards<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.050> ground<00:00:52.199> and

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
this one goes towards the ground and

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.619 
this one goes towards the ground and
this<00:00:53.039> one<00:00:53.250> goes<00:00:53.430> over<00:00:53.610> your<00:00:54.000> head<00:00:54.210> then

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
this one goes over your head then

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.779 
this one goes over your head then
towards<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> ground<00:00:55.440> they're<00:00:56.160> gonna<00:00:56.370> hit<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789

towards the ground they're gonna hit the
ground<00:00:56.940> at<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.660> separate<00:00:58.230> time<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.280> one

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
ground at a separate time so this one

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.569 
ground at a separate time so this one
first<00:00:59.820> then<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.899> one<00:01:01.079> comes<00:01:01.350> next<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.920> as

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
ground because they were here you're

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.940 
ground because they were here you're
gonna<00:01:51.210> push<00:01:51.509> off<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.869> ground<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.409> after

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
gonna push off the ground and after

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.560 
gonna push off the ground and after
you're<00:01:53.280> gonna<00:01:53.369> do<00:01:53.640> what<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.880> call<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.240> rain

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
you're gonna do what I call the rain

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.750 
you're gonna do what I call the rain
move<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.619> they<00:01:55.770> could<00:01:56.100> come<00:01:56.460> around<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.270> do

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
move so they could come around and do

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.750 
move so they could come around and do
motion<00:01:58.000> like<00:01:58.150> this<00:01:58.830> so<00:01:59.830> it's<00:01:59.980> basically<00:02:00.400> all

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
motion like this so it's basically all

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.180 
motion like this so it's basically all
like<00:02:01.000> a<00:02:01.030> cartwheel<00:02:01.450> Arabian<00:02:02.110> but<00:02:02.650> this<00:02:02.890> is

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
like a cartwheel Arabian but this is

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.910 
like a cartwheel Arabian but this is
where<00:02:03.490> it<00:02:03.790> changes<00:02:04.440> so<00:02:05.440> instead<00:02:05.650> of<00:02:05.710> going

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
where it changes so instead of going

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.890 
where it changes so instead of going
like<00:02:06.190> this<00:02:06.520> like<00:02:07.300> you<00:02:07.450> would<00:02:07.600> for<00:02:07.870> the

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
like this like you would for the

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.440 
like this like you would for the
cartwheel<00:02:08.380> Arabian<00:02:08.979> what<00:02:09.850> you<00:02:10.000> do<00:02:10.149> with<00:02:10.300> your

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
cartwheel Arabian what you do with your

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.930 
cartwheel Arabian what you do with your
hands<00:02:10.810> is<00:02:10.930> you<00:02:11.080> reach<00:02:11.380> up<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:12.310> get<00:02:12.520> your<00:02:12.700> height

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
hands is you reach up to get your height

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.830 
hands is you reach up to get your height
and<00:02:13.150> then<00:02:13.930> bring<00:02:14.350> them<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:14.950> on<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.520> side<00:02:16.450> so

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
and then bring them in on the side so

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.410 
and then bring them in on the side so
that<00:02:16.870> you<00:02:17.230> can<00:02:17.410> twist<00:02:17.820> it's<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:18.880> little<00:02:19.150> tricky

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
that you can twist it's a little tricky

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.630 
that you can twist it's a little tricky
at<00:02:19.630> first<00:02:19.660> but<00:02:20.140> it's<00:02:20.770> basically<00:02:21.160> just<00:02:21.460> like<00:02:21.580> a

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
at first but it's basically just like a

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.230 
at first but it's basically just like a
cartwheel<00:02:22.050> Arabian<00:02:23.050> with<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.410> half<00:02:23.590> twist

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
cartwheel Arabian with the half twist

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.120 
cartwheel Arabian with the half twist
it's<00:02:25.240> also<00:02:25.420> nice<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.750> have<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:26.050> front<00:02:26.470> foot<00:02:26.710> 180

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
it's also nice to have a front foot 180

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.750 
it's also nice to have a front foot 180
before<00:02:27.820> trying<00:02:28.090> this<00:02:28.240> trick<00:02:28.510> because

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
before trying this trick because

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.560 
before trying this trick because
basically<00:02:30.760> what<00:02:30.940> you're<00:02:31.060> doing<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.510> a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
basically what you're doing is a

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.170 
basically what you're doing is a
cartwheel<00:02:32.020> Arabian<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.100> from<00:02:33.460> here<00:02:33.760> you're

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
cartwheel Arabian and from here you're

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.930 
cartwheel Arabian and from here you're
basically<00:02:34.420> just<00:02:34.840> adding<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.680> half<00:02:35.980> twist<00:02:36.370> to

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
basically just adding a half twist to

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.960 
basically just adding a half twist to
the<00:02:37.090> cartwheel<00:02:37.780> Arabian<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:39.340> what's<00:02:39.760> nice

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
the cartwheel Arabian so what's nice

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.910 
the cartwheel Arabian so what's nice
about<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:40.390> is<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:40.690> can<00:02:40.930> actually<00:02:41.140> spot<00:02:41.710> the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
about this is you can actually spot the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.830 
about this is you can actually spot the
ground<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.280> whole<00:02:42.430> time<00:02:42.730> we<00:02:43.420> come<00:02:43.690> around

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
ground the whole time we come around

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.290 
ground the whole time we come around
here<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.950> spot<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.520> ground<00:02:45.640> then<00:02:46.120> you're

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
here you spot the ground then you're

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.860 
here you spot the ground then you're
gonna<00:02:46.450> rotate<00:02:46.810> around<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.620> point<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.870> land

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
gonna rotate around that point and land

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.620 
gonna rotate around that point and land
back<00:02:50.140> here<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.760> since<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:52.150> stopped<00:02:52.420> around

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
back here so since you stopped around

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.690 
back here so since you stopped around
the<00:02:52.780> whole<00:02:52.959> time<00:02:52.990> you<00:02:53.740> can<00:02:53.800> know<00:02:54.070> exactly<00:02:54.459> when

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
the whole time you can know exactly when

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.880 
the whole time you can know exactly when
to<00:02:54.850> open<00:02:55.180> up<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:55.570> went<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:55.870> land<00:02:56.140> I'll<00:02:56.650> show

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
to open up and went to land I'll show

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.910 
to open up and went to land I'll show
you<00:02:56.980> guys<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.160> few<00:02:57.400> examples
