00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.480
 like 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.500
 and still, how are you guys and berni is 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.050
 a new video and today my god 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.300
 how quickly that presentation goes 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.130
 today I come to bring you a very map 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.140
 great that as you can see is a world 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.900
 totally made of diamond too 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.989
 has little trees and that but probably 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.300
 I die so I do not like anything 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.280
 you can see is this great the trees 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.470
 here they are says of integrating people 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.239
 but calm that there is also a bit 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.360
 of earth do not worry and then if 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.489
 we look that they are going to find 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.470
 materials from huts 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.330
 the typical ok so do not worry 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.690
 they can still get what they want 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.710
 but there's because they were going to nominate if they have 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.680
 a damn world made of diamond 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.229
 in short so with the guys like 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.530
 can you see I'm going to make a region 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:15.360
 here tun tun tun again 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:19.860
 below because something so treat students 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:25.190
 and maybe if we go around like 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.190
 can see has all the same biomes 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:34.729
 hi here you have wood but for all 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.439
 life here has a biome the world 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.180
 that great are those that had not 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.130
 seen how can you see here too 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.689
 they have wood I guess it's like a 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.570
 plan to replace the fact that 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:48.140
 like everything there are so few trees 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.850
 here you have enough wood I would say 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.840
 so then nothing like they can see the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.280
 great answer can more than anything for 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.479
 to become a super world here in mante and 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.479
 they also have gold 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.259
 so then nothing guys want the 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.189
 English that makes this map have it here 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.690
 down in the description 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.420
 likewise a video in which 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.250
 We explain how to install it and after 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.819
 this video that good this video what 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.099
 I'll be going up at night so 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.050
 nothing else tomorrow will have a 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.850
 video in which 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.830
 well we also achieve with the tablet 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.990
 but that is the last video that is of 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.560
 that way of recording here so no 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.540
 worry do not hit me and finally it's 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.340
 a very cool video you are going to see what 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.680
 it is the best 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.860
 damn roller coaster that you are going to 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.300
 can see in this game and then nothing in 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.040
 its foundations I hope that they have 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.140
 liked this video remember to like 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.880

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.510
