00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
my second thought was very important

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:57.270 
my second thought was very important
because<00:01:32.749> I<00:01:32.899> think<00:01:33.140> do<00:01:33.319> meet<00:01:33.590> a<00:01:33.920> lot<00:01:34.460> of<00:01:34.490> friends

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
I think they they have chosen the right

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.470 
I think they they have chosen the right
way<00:02:12.439> to<00:02:13.010> make<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.670> drink<00:02:14.000> of<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.239> team<00:02:14.450> very

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
that and having easy games so I think

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:55.059 
that and having easy games so I think
it's<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.389> right<00:02:47.540> way<00:02:51.489> and<00:02:53.170> it<00:02:54.170> support<00:02:54.739> the

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
it's the right way and it support the

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.220 
it's the right way and it support the

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230

the<00:02:57.379> welcome<00:02:57.829> there's<00:02:58.280> no<00:02:58.400> guarantee<00:02:58.989> but<00:02:59.989> I

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
the welcome there's no guarantee but I

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.089 
the welcome there's no guarantee but I
think<00:03:00.560> it's<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.980> best<00:03:01.250> way<00:03:01.519> to<00:03:01.549> build<00:03:02.000> plays
