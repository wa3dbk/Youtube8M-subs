one of many books that have really
talked<00:00:39.239> about<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.719> although<00:00:39.960> each<00:00:40.260> book<00:00:40.530> has

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
talked about this although each book has

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.950 
talked about this although each book has
their<00:00:40.920> own<00:00:41.070> approach<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.480> you've<00:00:42.750> read

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
their own approach so if you've read

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.529 
their own approach so if you've read
made<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.379> stick<00:00:43.590> or<00:00:43.860> neuro<00:00:44.579> marketing<00:00:45.149> or

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539

you've<00:00:45.600> got<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.320> be<00:00:46.379> believed<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.770> be<00:00:46.860> heard

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
you've got to be believed to be heard

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.029
