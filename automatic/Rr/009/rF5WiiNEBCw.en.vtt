00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
steady hand as you cut so what we're

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.230 
steady hand as you cut so what we're
going<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.950> do<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:10.220> we're<00:01:11.220> going<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.490> carve<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
going to do is we're going to carve a

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.690 
going to do is we're going to carve a
groove<00:01:12.780> like<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.560> then<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:14.400> cut

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
groove like this and then this cut

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.060 
groove like this and then this cut
angles<00:01:15.150> back<00:01:15.390> towards<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:17.430> first<00:01:17.610> cut<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.939> made

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
angles back towards the first cut I made

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.010 
angles back towards the first cut I made
so<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.310> when<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> cuts<00:01:20.880> meet<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.720> piece

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
so that when the cuts meet this piece

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.469 
so that when the cuts meet this piece
will<00:01:22.290> lift<00:01:22.530> out<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.920> we're<00:01:23.610> left<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.450> a

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
will lift out and we're left with a

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.950 
will lift out and we're left with a
groove<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.020> our<00:01:25.140> carrot<00:01:25.500> like<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:26.750> so<00:01:27.750> we're

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
groove in our carrot like this so we're

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.800 
groove in our carrot like this so we're
going<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.110> do<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.530> all<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.009> way<00:01:29.520> around

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
going to do that all the way around

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.649 
going to do that all the way around
you'll<00:01:30.810> do<00:01:30.960> another<00:01:31.170> one<00:01:31.380> here<00:01:33.799> cut<00:01:34.799> here<00:01:35.250> and

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
you'll do another one here cut here and

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.840 
you'll do another one here cut here and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
soups or salads now let me show you an

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.510 
soups or salads now let me show you an
easier<00:01:54.299> way<00:01:54.590> this<00:01:55.590> time<00:01:55.829> I'm<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.219> start

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
easier way this time I'm going to start

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.670 
easier way this time I'm going to start
with<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.729> yellow<00:01:56.880> carrot<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.600> I'm<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.619> to

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
with the yellow carrot and I'm going to

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.359 
with the yellow carrot and I'm going to
use<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.719> V<00:02:00.719> cutter<00:02:01.020> tool<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.590> has<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:02.899> v-shaped

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
use a V cutter tool that has a v-shaped

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.980 
use a V cutter tool that has a v-shaped
cutting<00:02:05.369> surface<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.329> whole<00:02:06.509> tool<00:02:06.719> looks

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
cutting surface the whole tool looks

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.240 
cutting surface the whole tool looks
like<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:08.750> you<00:02:09.750> simply<00:02:10.229> cut<00:02:10.530> your<00:02:10.770> grooves<00:02:11.039> in

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
like this you simply cut your grooves in

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.820 
like this you simply cut your grooves in
your<00:02:11.370> carrot<00:02:11.700> using<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.209> tool<00:02:12.450> like<00:02:13.110> that

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
your carrot using the tool like that

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.040 
your carrot using the tool like that
so<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.280> faster<00:02:14.760> because<00:02:14.940> instead<00:02:15.450> of

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
so this is faster because instead of

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.480 
so this is faster because instead of
making<00:02:16.890> two<00:02:17.280> slices<00:02:18.120> for<00:02:18.840> each<00:02:19.020> groove<00:02:19.490> you're

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
making two slices for each groove you're

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.770 
making two slices for each groove you're
doing<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.940> in<00:02:21.090> one<00:02:23.210> one<00:02:24.210> action<00:02:25.020> one<00:02:25.890> cut<00:02:26.190> and

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
doing it in one one action one cut and

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:37.950 
doing it in one one action one cut and
you<00:02:27.780> do<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:28.110> all<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.410> way<00:02:28.500> around

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.170 

you<00:02:38.560> can<00:02:38.740> see<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.100> I'm<00:02:39.220> keeping<00:02:39.460> these<00:02:39.850> two

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
you can see that I'm keeping these two

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.290 
you can see that I'm keeping these two
fingers<00:02:40.510> on<00:02:40.990> the<00:02:41.590> carrot<00:02:41.920> or<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.370> my<00:02:42.640> hand<00:02:43.000> and

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
fingers on the carrot or on my hand and

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.930 
fingers on the carrot or on my hand and
that<00:02:43.990> serves<00:02:44.320> to<00:02:44.620> steady<00:02:44.920> my<00:02:45.130> hand<00:02:45.340> as<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:45.640> carve

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
that serves to steady my hand as I carve

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.130 
that serves to steady my hand as I carve
and<00:02:47.550> also<00:02:48.550> I'm<00:02:48.820> holding<00:02:49.180> my<00:02:49.270> carrots<00:02:49.630> I'm<00:02:49.870> not

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
and also I'm holding my carrots I'm not

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.990 
and also I'm holding my carrots I'm not
holding<00:02:50.500> my<00:02:50.530> carrot<00:02:50.950> like<00:02:51.070> this<00:02:51.310> if<00:02:51.580> I<00:02:51.670> held<00:02:51.850> my

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
holding my carrot like this if I held my

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.270 
holding my carrot like this if I held my
carrot<00:02:52.270> like<00:02:52.420> this<00:02:52.660> I'd<00:02:53.260> cut<00:02:53.560> my<00:02:53.590> finger<00:02:54.040> so

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
carrot like this I'd cut my finger so

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.070 
carrot like this I'd cut my finger so
you<00:02:54.730> want<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:54.940> keep<00:02:55.060> your<00:02:55.180> fingers<00:02:55.570> out<00:02:55.750> of<00:02:55.810> the

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
you want to keep your fingers out of the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:06.270 
you want to keep your fingers out of the
way<00:02:56.860> of<00:02:57.490> your<00:02:58.480> cutting<00:02:58.720> tool<00:03:04.830> so<00:03:05.830> now<00:03:05.980> we<00:03:06.040> have

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
way of your cutting tool so now we have

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.640 
way of your cutting tool so now we have
our<00:03:06.400> grooves<00:03:06.670> going<00:03:06.970> all<00:03:07.210> the<00:03:07.360> way<00:03:07.390> around<00:03:07.650> now

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
our grooves going all the way around now

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.050 
our grooves going all the way around now
we<00:03:08.710> can<00:03:09.040> cut<00:03:09.280> like<00:03:09.430> we<00:03:09.640> did<00:03:09.790> before<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:12.060> our

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
we can cut like we did before and our

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.920 
we can cut like we did before and our
flower<00:03:13.690> is<00:03:13.870> going<00:03:14.050> to<00:03:14.170> be<00:03:14.410> like<00:03:14.980> this<00:03:15.870> now<00:03:16.870> I'm

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
flower is going to be like this now I'm

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.630 
flower is going to be like this now I'm
going<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.140> show<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.320> an<00:03:17.470> easier<00:03:17.860> way<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.280> make

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
going to show you an easier way to make

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.330 
going to show you an easier way to make
very<00:03:19.090> thin<00:03:19.180> slices<00:03:19.870> this<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.980> called<00:03:21.250> a

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
very thin slices this is called a

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.810 
very thin slices this is called a
mandolin<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:21.970> it<00:03:22.060> allows<00:03:22.330> me<00:03:22.570> to<00:03:22.690> make<00:03:22.840> very

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
mandolin and it allows me to make very

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.110 
mandolin and it allows me to make very
narrow<00:03:24.820> slices<00:03:25.540> just<00:03:25.900> by<00:03:26.110> simply<00:03:26.850> running<00:03:27.850> the

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
narrow slices just by simply running the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.620 
narrow slices just by simply running the
carrot<00:03:28.890> across<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:30.130> surface<00:03:30.610> and<00:03:30.850> the<00:03:31.390> blade

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
carrot across the surface and the blade

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.730 
carrot across the surface and the blade
cuts<00:03:31.990> it<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:34.060> what<00:03:34.240> we<00:03:34.360> end<00:03:34.510> up<00:03:34.690> with<00:03:34.750> are<00:03:35.500> these

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
cuts it so what we end up with are these

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.960 
cuts it so what we end up with are these
nice<00:03:36.070> very<00:03:37.060> thin<00:03:37.420> pieces<00:03:38.280> these<00:03:39.280> thin<00:03:39.610> flower

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
nice very thin pieces these thin flower

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.900 
nice very thin pieces these thin flower
shapes<00:03:40.390> cut<00:03:41.080> with<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.290> mandolin<00:03:41.830> actually<00:03:42.730> have

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
shapes cut with a mandolin actually have

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.600 
shapes cut with a mandolin actually have
some<00:03:43.170> translucency<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.350> them<00:03:44.500> which<00:03:45.340> makes

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
some translucency to them which makes

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.080 
some translucency to them which makes
them<00:03:45.790> pretty<00:03:47.430> depending<00:03:48.430> on<00:03:48.550> your<00:03:48.670> style<00:03:48.970> of

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
them pretty depending on your style of

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.980 
them pretty depending on your style of
mandolin<00:03:49.600> you<00:03:49.810> can<00:03:50.230> also<00:03:50.380> just<00:03:50.710> tilt<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.460> up

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
mandolin you can also just tilt it up

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.380 
mandolin you can also just tilt it up
and<00:03:52.990> do<00:03:53.140> it<00:03:53.170> like<00:03:53.410> this<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:54.670> you<00:03:55.030> end<00:03:55.060> up<00:03:55.330> with

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
and do it like this and you end up with

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.920 
and do it like this and you end up with
lots<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:55.960> pretty<00:03:56.200> flowers<00:03:56.380> very<00:03:57.220> quickly<00:03:57.930> the

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
lots of pretty flowers very quickly the

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.780 
lots of pretty flowers very quickly the
easy<00:03:59.110> way<00:03:59.410> I'm<00:03:59.650> going<00:03:59.860> to<00:03:59.980> demonstrate<00:04:00.160> with

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
easy way I'm going to demonstrate with

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.580 
easy way I'm going to demonstrate with
this<00:04:00.940> purple<00:04:01.390> carrot<00:04:01.720> and<00:04:01.870> one<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:02.530> the

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
this purple carrot and one of the

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.080 
this purple carrot and one of the
reasons<00:04:02.890> purple<00:04:03.250> carrots<00:04:03.580> are<00:04:03.700> fun<00:04:03.880> for

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
reasons purple carrots are fun for

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.850 
reasons purple carrots are fun for
making<00:04:04.360> these<00:04:04.480> flowers<00:04:04.930> is<00:04:05.110> because<00:04:05.710> they

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
making these flowers is because they

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.880 
making these flowers is because they
have<00:04:06.010> yellow<00:04:06.280> centers<00:04:07.110> so<00:04:08.110> I<00:04:08.140> noticed<00:04:08.710> that<00:04:08.860> I

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
have yellow centers so I noticed that I

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.010 
have yellow centers so I noticed that I
haven't<00:04:09.160> peeled<00:04:09.550> this<00:04:09.790> yet<00:04:10.090> I'm<00:04:10.330> going<00:04:10.930> to

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
haven't peeled this yet I'm going to

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.770 
haven't peeled this yet I'm going to
peel<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:11.290> with<00:04:11.920> a<00:04:11.950> specialized<00:04:12.760> peeler<00:04:13.570> that

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
peel it with a specialized peeler that

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.950 
peel it with a specialized peeler that
has<00:04:14.620> a<00:04:14.650> wavy<00:04:15.100> blade<00:04:15.640> this<00:04:16.360> is<00:04:16.540> what<00:04:16.690> it<00:04:16.780> looks

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:16.960 
has a wavy blade this is what it looks

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.789 
has a wavy blade this is what it looks
