00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
just so you know the reason it's not set

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.870 
just so you know the reason it's not set
up<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:10.050> had<00:00:10.230> another<00:00:10.469> one<00:00:10.650> set<00:00:10.920> up<00:00:11.070> but<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.670> lost

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
up I had another one set up but I lost

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.299 
up I had another one set up but I lost
it<00:00:12.150> so<00:00:12.509> I'm<00:00:13.259> just<00:00:13.440> showing<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.769> my<00:00:13.950> other<00:00:14.070> one

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
it so I'm just showing you my other one

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.990 
it so I'm just showing you my other one
for<00:00:14.549> now<00:00:14.670> but<00:00:15.650> I<00:00:16.650> think<00:00:17.430> they<00:00:17.609> do<00:00:17.670> come<00:00:17.970> with

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
for now but I think they do come with

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.269 
for now but I think they do come with
bottom<00:00:18.510> flies<00:00:18.869> died<00:00:19.350> because<00:00:19.710> my<00:00:19.980> other<00:00:20.100> one

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
bottom flies died because my other one

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.750 
bottom flies died because my other one
is<00:00:20.400> yellow<00:00:20.760> but<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.779> one<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.050> just<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.289> blank

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
is yellow but this one is just a blank

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:31.870 
is yellow but this one is just a blank
they're<00:00:23.760> five<00:00:23.970> plies<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:26.599> polls<00:00:27.599> are<00:00:28.699> perfect

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.700 

nicely<00:00:32.880> aligned<00:00:33.270> everything<00:00:34.370> countersunk

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
nicely aligned everything countersunk

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.780 
nicely aligned everything countersunk
whole<00:00:37.710> thing<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.100> lacquered<00:00:38.550> really<00:00:38.850> well

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
whole thing is lacquered really well

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.970 
whole thing is lacquered really well
nice<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.030> shiny<00:00:43.910> really<00:00:44.910> solid<00:00:45.360> actually<00:00:45.980> I

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
nice and shiny really solid actually I

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.520 
nice and shiny really solid actually I
really<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:47.969> how<00:00:48.360> they<00:00:48.750> have<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> lot<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.200> pop

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
really like how they have a lot of pop

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.299 
really like how they have a lot of pop
compared<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.219> some<00:00:50.399> decks<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.170> the

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
compared to some decks and the

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.529 
compared to some decks and the
craftsmanship<00:00:53.309> overall<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.210> really<00:00:54.239> nice

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
craftsmanship overall is really nice

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.150 
craftsmanship overall is really nice
they<00:00:57.539> could<00:00:57.809> work<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.350> just<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.649> little<00:00:58.980> bit

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
they could work on it just a little bit

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.959 
they could work on it just a little bit
it's<00:00:59.460> kind<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.820> squared<00:01:00.420> off<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.710> nose

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
it's kind of squared off like the nose

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:10.910 
it's kind of squared off like the nose
but<00:01:02.969> not<00:01:03.780> too<00:01:04.049> bad<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:09.049> the<00:01:10.049> edges<00:01:10.439> could<00:01:10.710> be<00:01:10.890> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
but not too bad and the edges could be a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.160 
but not too bad and the edges could be a
little<00:01:11.220> more<00:01:11.400> rounded<00:01:11.909> maybe<00:01:12.180> actually<00:01:13.020> no

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
little more rounded maybe actually no

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.760 
little more rounded maybe actually no
they're<00:01:13.979> good<00:01:14.369> well<00:01:15.090> maybe<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.080> little<00:01:16.200> bit<00:01:16.530> but

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
they're good well maybe a little bit but

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.289 
they're good well maybe a little bit but
they're<00:01:17.490> not<00:01:17.700> bad

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
they're not bad

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.870 
they're not bad
um<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:20.790> wood<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.450> one<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:22.680> maple<00:01:23.130> my

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
um the wood on this one is just maple my

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.539 
um the wood on this one is just maple my
other<00:01:24.000> one<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.420> think<00:01:24.810> had<00:01:25.110> some<00:01:25.549> walnut

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
other one I think had some walnut

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.460 
other one I think had some walnut
applies<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> middle<00:01:27.570> I'm<00:01:27.659> not<00:01:27.840> sure<00:01:28.080> and

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.929 

basically<00:01:31.470> everything<00:01:31.799> about<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.400> nice<00:01:32.640> um

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
basically everything about it is nice um

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.719 
basically everything about it is nice um
a<00:01:33.270> concave<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.200> really<00:01:34.500> low<00:01:34.650> which<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.250> cuz

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
a concave is really low which I like cuz

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.929 
a concave is really low which I like cuz
I<00:01:36.030> don't<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.659> lot<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.930> concave<00:01:37.380> but

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.679 

anyways<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:43.460> Bowl<00:01:44.460> concave<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.509> nose

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
anyways it's Bowl concave but the nose

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.649 
anyways it's Bowl concave but the nose
and<00:01:45.899> tail<00:01:45.930> are<00:01:46.079> kind<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.590> steep<00:01:49.310> as<00:01:50.540> you<00:01:51.540> can

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
and tail are kind of steep as you can

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.859 
and tail are kind of steep as you can
see<00:01:51.840> they're<00:01:52.259> pretty<00:01:52.799> much<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.479> little<00:01:54.479> steeper

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
see they're pretty much a little steeper

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.109 
see they're pretty much a little steeper
than<00:01:54.990> my<00:01:55.170> preference<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.070> ride<00:01:56.909> pretty

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
than my preference but I ride pretty

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.539 
than my preference but I ride pretty
mellow<00:01:57.450> decks<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.430> yeah<00:02:00.920> anyways<00:02:01.920> that's

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
mellow decks so yeah anyways that's

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.819 
mellow decks so yeah anyways that's
basically<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.479> they're<00:02:04.070> perfect<00:02:05.070> decks

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
basically it they're perfect decks

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.660 
basically it they're perfect decks
nicely<00:02:07.829> made

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.900 

where<00:02:11.390> do<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:11.510> get<00:02:11.599> them<00:02:11.740> summit<00:02:12.740> FB<00:02:13.130> comm<00:02:13.610> is

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
where do you get them summit FB comm is

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
where do you get them summit FB comm is
gonna<00:02:14.480> sell<00:02:14.930> them<00:02:15.080> soon<00:02:16.239> I'm<00:02:17.239> not<00:02:17.480> sure<00:02:17.690> one

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
gonna sell them soon I'm not sure one

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.900 
gonna sell them soon I'm not sure one
but<00:02:18.170> probably<00:02:18.650> in<00:02:18.770> a<00:02:18.830> week<00:02:18.980> or<00:02:19.130> two<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.310> guess

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
but probably in a week or two I guess

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.309 
but probably in a week or two I guess
and<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.690> think<00:02:21.500> they're<00:02:22.510> 15<00:02:23.510> or<00:02:23.660> 20<00:02:23.959> dollars

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
and I think they're 15 or 20 dollars

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.199 
and I think they're 15 or 20 dollars
somewhere<00:02:24.590> around<00:02:24.800> there<00:02:25.099> not<00:02:25.580> exactly<00:02:25.940> sure

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
somewhere around there not exactly sure

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.690 
somewhere around there not exactly sure
but<00:02:26.420> they're<00:02:26.870> definitely<00:02:27.050> worth<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.830> I'd<00:02:28.040> pay

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
but they're definitely worth it I'd pay

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.270 
but they're definitely worth it I'd pay
up<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:29.030> like<00:02:29.209> 20<00:02:29.600> or<00:02:29.720> so<00:02:29.959> for<00:02:30.230> one<00:02:30.380> maybe<00:02:31.100> more

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
up to like 20 or so for one maybe more

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.400 
up to like 20 or so for one maybe more
actually<00:02:31.910> because<00:02:32.390> they<00:02:32.540> are<00:02:32.660> really<00:02:32.900> nice<00:02:33.170> as

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
actually because they are really nice as

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.240 
actually because they are really nice as
you<00:02:33.530> can<00:02:33.709> see<00:02:34.989> basically<00:02:35.989> just<00:02:36.530> about<00:02:36.739> perfect

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
you can see basically just about perfect

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.630 
you can see basically just about perfect
sanding<00:02:38.209> could<00:02:38.390> be<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.540> tiny<00:02:38.840> bit<00:02:39.110> better<00:02:39.640> see

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
sanding could be a tiny bit better see

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.610 
sanding could be a tiny bit better see
it's<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.910> little<00:02:41.180> bit<00:02:41.330> uneven<00:02:41.569> but<00:02:42.110> it's<00:02:42.290> very

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
it's a little bit uneven but it's very
