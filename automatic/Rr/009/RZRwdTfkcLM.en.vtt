100-plus<00:00:18.570> fail<00:00:18.930> basically<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.800> have<00:00:20.279> 89<00:00:20.640> kills

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
100-plus fail basically I have 89 kills

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.310 
100-plus fail basically I have 89 kills
during<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.420> course<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:21.840> domination

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
during the course of this domination

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.400 
during the course of this domination
game<00:00:22.650> on<00:00:22.890> hijacked<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.880> yeah<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:25.050> know<00:00:25.140> I

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
game on hijacked and yeah you know I

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.450 
game on hijacked and yeah you know I
think<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.830> if<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.010> would<00:00:26.130> have<00:00:26.189> had<00:00:26.279> at<00:00:26.430> least

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
think that if I would have had at least

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.189 
think that if I would have had at least
10<00:00:26.820> more<00:00:26.939> seconds<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.330> could<00:00:27.390> have<00:00:27.570> got<00:00:27.689> any<00:00:27.900> 11

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
10 more seconds I could have got any 11

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.900 
10 more seconds I could have got any 11
kills<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.680> 10<00:00:28.830> seconds<00:00:29.160> which<00:00:29.310> seems<00:00:29.849> a

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
kills in that 10 seconds which seems a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.040 
kills in that 10 seconds which seems a
little<00:00:29.939> bit<00:00:30.090> impossible<00:00:30.599> but<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.779> would<00:00:30.960> have

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
little bit impossible but I would have

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.910 
little bit impossible but I would have
done<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.289> yeah<00:00:31.380> for<00:00:31.619> sure

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
done it yeah for sure

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.860 
done it yeah for sure
but<00:00:32.520> no<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.669> mean<00:00:32.820> if<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.180> had<00:00:33.360> another<00:00:33.570> 30

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
but no I mean if I had another 30

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.060 
but no I mean if I had another 30
seconds<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.290> think<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.620> could<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:34.860> really

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
seconds I think that I could have really

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.650 
seconds I think that I could have really
popped<00:00:35.280> up<00:00:35.399> 100<00:00:35.730> plus<00:00:35.880> during<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.210> game<00:00:36.360> and

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.290 
because I think that my opinion will be
a<00:02:15.040> lot<00:02:15.250> different<00:02:15.430> than<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.760> lot<00:02:15.880> of<00:02:15.940> your<00:02:16.120> guys

a lot different than a lot of your guys

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.610 
a lot different than a lot of your guys

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620
