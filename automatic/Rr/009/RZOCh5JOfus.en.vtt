 website cookies make up is more or less 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.240
 a year ago I had already made a video to their 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.730
 topic just discover right now 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.809

 long a package with a few 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.340
 novelties of not had time for everything 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.289
 test but I tested some products 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.480
 and the only ones I tested I 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.190
 was too good and I thought 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.690
 the others I was going to discover with you 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.700

 especially in the eyes and 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.730
 great owl products that came out 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.190
 at the lips there are colors 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.320
 Summer is finding how quickly 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.930
 by two products for the complexion then 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.610
 first novelty their foundation 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.500
 perfect finish 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.260
 at first glance like that it's a little 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.370
 dark for me but it does not concern me 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.350
 too much so I do not want to be too sad at this 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.210
 level there then a pink blush that is 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.329
 here I removed the little brush that does not 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.820
 did not help me if peter chan hue 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.500
 209 I broke my blue favorite churros 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.840
 so I'm looking for a new 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.520
 blue too often reads and after that I get 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.280
 remember already a year ago I had been 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.759
 taped by the sensation the very finite 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.369
 powder blush from their blushes all have a finish 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.140
 very silky very powdery and in fact these 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.060
 blush incident names that task 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.470
 we go to the category for the eyes and 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.210
 this is the category that has the most 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.829
 seduced in the novelties and 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.479
 Norman products owl order to 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.890
 start with two award-winning baskets sent 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.470
 two maybe they have nothing to see a 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.250
 neon palette and a new palette of si 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.960
 my memories are good 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.720
 no my memories are good not at all 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.430
 news a breakdown is rather colorful but 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.710
 this is - arrow that this one maybe 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.950
 not be fluo it's the number palette 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.240
 are 7 and this one is the 03 worker 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.149
 in case you need a pallet 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.549
 fluo for your make-up more artistic 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.480
 there is one in them we have a whole 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.310
 palette of rosemont 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.550
 purple which means in a palette 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.320
 and this one it costs 14 euros 90 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.440
 then there is a new mascara this is the 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.450
 bucket need relay this volume 12 times 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.930
 there is a new liner that the golden 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.720
 pink precision liner waterproof and point 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.820
 positive there is black to the tip 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.860
 felt because usually we have 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.330
 wrong to have the product until the end what 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.890
 which means we can not get ready if 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.480
 we now go to the flagship products 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.740
 novelties that too much it does because 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.730
 yes I did not stay in passion 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.230
 you hold back from opening them 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.810
 they took out new pencils and 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.600
 liner for jumbo eyes for 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.160
 eyes nothing to a black and a rust more 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.870
 or less crazy loved rust so this 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.360
 is not a classic black it's a 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.550
 black who and glitter and the red in him 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.230
 I put once in base it is too much 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.030
 beautiful so I leave all the eyelid and 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.500
 then I wear makeup or not because 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.240
 that he may very well be sufficient for himself 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.270
 they are young beautiful and very very 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.860
 pigmented and the color is superb and 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.870
 we have the colors a bit metallic in everything 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.050
 case for their hearing and for the black bill 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.090
 and glittery so here again 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.040
 will surely be very pretty all over the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.050
 eyelid because suddenly we'll see 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.090
 glittery hamburger black would count 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.590
 liner very simple I think we'll see 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.850
 less glitter me who does not like 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.380
 too glitter I'm not a fan of 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.730
 glitter you know but here it's not 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.380
 that she has a ton it's really very 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.420
 subtle by the two following pencils 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.040
 are part of my favorites are 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.140
 pencils for the eyes to the ena 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.330
 worried a pencil again not 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.340
 summer and the other that is a liner pencil 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.720
 and but I'm not looking at the 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.400
 pigmentation actually because this is 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.170
 to go directly tried they are 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.150
 pigmented dehouche I find so much 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.420
 beautiful after I find that on my eyes 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.819
 green 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.480
 turquoise is not the color that me 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.090
 go best 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.660
 nor the blue in general I like to put 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.220
 from green to purple brown but blue 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.380
 I put it occasionally but I 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.360
 do not use as often as 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.160
 I would like to use it but on eyes 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.750
 blue it may be too good yes we can 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.280
 put bluish wound moms and the 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.060
 light green eyes and still 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.519
 turquoise is beautiful so why me 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.350
 then his habit and the blue him I 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:03.140
 is also super nice blue is very 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:05.350
 intense it's a real dark blue is 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.350
 the 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.540
 and now we go to my two for 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.699
 favorites of all 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.949
 novelties I think no I do not like 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:22.220
 produces more than these two ci they have 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:24.410
 out of metallized liners I have here a 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.789
 turquoise and a gray when I saw I 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.470
 I said to myself metallic liner 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:29.539
 surely be a little too lucid and not 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.820
 super opaque not only to achieve 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:34.430
 that we will sometimes see again not see 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.259
 that's brief but then when I put you on 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.599
 the back of my hand I was taped by 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.639
 opacity and by the pigmentation of its 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:41.750
 two little things and I have not yet 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.770
 and that's what annoys me because 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.120
 that every time I see them I am 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.860
 must tell the masters but I find 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.479
 not a makeup to put them at 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.310
 everyday meaning we were a 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.410
 cleansing just with a dash of 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.300
 turquoise liner and it's going to be too soft 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.039
 if you want to order do not hesitate to 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.780
 make a make up is attacked on 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.310
 instagram college could have that 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.270
 you did with it and it will give on 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.099
 my inspiration 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.750
 so here is now room for everything and 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:04.610
 new shades of products for 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.710
 lips i'll start with two 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.560
 pencils I have a new deal and a 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.120
 rather raspberry and pink level of 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.500
 game but almost every day so that 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.780
 I already used it I discovered it 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.400
 not today they are of an outfit in 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.530
 any case for this book I used they 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.300
 are held unbelievable and they are not 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.289
 at all that is unpleasant to blow 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.150
 of heart in any case for reaching 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.690
 news that I used against the 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.430
 raspberry 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.289
 I do not even swatch and so I will 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.669
 hands now and in fact he is very 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.110
 pretty e6 today colors that I like 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.720
 well they hold on very well and they have 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.070
 really a velvety finish and so puts 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.389
 it's still a pencil that holds well 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.009
 but who does not seat your lips 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.020
 I think these are made for 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.880
 you at the gloss level I have three 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.590
 hues and he without much surprise the 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.000
 nude shade that I had once or twice 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.650
 here you know I'm not too 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.780
 gloss so it's not believed that I liked the 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.639
 more everyday I was still 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.650
 try because here I am you dst 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.509
 they are not pantyhose on the student 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.570
 in fact I love their packaging 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:59.870
 I love the gloss trainer they are 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.919
 really great late I saw that my mother 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:05.180
 like many other days of ahmed this is 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:07.340
 what a garage remote control and 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.660
 Once again, what is it that scotche me thoroughly 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.539
 for disgusting but gloss that 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.430
 cost 3 euros is the opacity and the 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:14.960
 pigmentation they are opaque but kind 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.810
 we would not say it's bluff 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.490
 they are too much too opaque but the 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.070
 more opaque of all these are the dishes 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.320
 but i love them too much i blame myself 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.740
 to not like the gloss this is from 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.270
 madness 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.060
 and we end it suddenly the four 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:31.160
 lipsticks and 1/3 of the maths range 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.229
 and there is an ultra rich drain range 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.760
 so from the game the match I already 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:37.820
 tried the pink is the one I wear 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.010
 today and they emit but the 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.660
 dry blades and it holds but very very 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.139
 well and I put it quite often these 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.789
 last time 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:46.370
 on the other hand I have not tested the 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:47.690
 red and dark blue and matane favorite I 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.669
 think and that old rose because we 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.759
 do not easily find old rose that 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:54.349
 be clear but without doing barbie and 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:56.750
 that they are not too dark for 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:07:00.020
 partner a fuchsia pink of las blow
