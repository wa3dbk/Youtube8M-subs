00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
I'm feeling the tingle so it does work

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.900 
I'm feeling the tingle so it does work
and<00:02:41.940> again<00:02:42.720> lost<00:02:43.080> some<00:02:43.320> mom<00:02:43.530> um<00:02:43.770> her<00:02:44.490> hair<00:02:44.760> loss

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
coming back and that's partly because

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.150
