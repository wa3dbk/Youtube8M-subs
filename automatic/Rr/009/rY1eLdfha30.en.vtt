00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:30.210
 between information to our channel 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.310
 We thought about it when you have many 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.110
 to ask if you can not 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:38.660
 in the meantime once short videos 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:43.770
 distinctive and especially 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.620
 product info product launches the 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.870
 interrupted 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.920
 yes, ours would be generally right 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.010
 long was exciting after saving 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.960
 freeport burns around exactly and he 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.629
 in some things just fits better 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.600
 if only a short meaningful 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.129
 video is as zb but mine at 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.890
 I often used to plant it 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.840
 in between with one 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.100
 and I think it's easier 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.860
 clearer I are there 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.450
 in between a plant on the main 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.750
 video makes it very specific and we 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.140
 have really really public and the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.510
 free videos responded to that often 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.340
 Really great if you have a product whole 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.500
 can be targeted and that would be 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:38.180
 try to implement 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:41.460
 we have last song con 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:47.520
 sponsors in quotation marks man 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:51.890
 nothing but two partners 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.090
 found that support us and 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.850
 occasionally one or the other product 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.750
 to incorporate imagined advantages 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.060
 just disadvantage the whole 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.420
 we know a little bit of individuality 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.549
 not just this long 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.780
 extensive tours or a video at 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.220
 can we take 40 minutes once 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.510
 and that's why it keeps going 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:25.670
 in between five minutes so very roughly 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:29.020
 sport with influences of today always 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.910
 again little things than his knife 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.560
 for example , something with it 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.380
 would be equal to introduce an online 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.870
 Video 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:44.060
 I will believe in the future sometimes 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.160
 montage own rubric my own 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.630
 playlist for these five minute spots 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:54.320
 that is the primary survey and in 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.660
 thank you very much for that 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.120

 subscribers covered like you have no idea 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.950

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.530
 So thank you at this point again and 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:19.250

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:20.780
 even the little things the big videos 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.239
 of course stay with it very clear 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.260

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.100
 our tours with the camera too 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:35.799
 accompany 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:35.799
 is now gone through last weeks 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.180
 a great effort to cut the office 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.350
 and edit but to all 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.859
 wellness is already so on the computer 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:56.060
 cached 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:59.239
 strictly speaking, in this sense remains to be 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.260
 hold and we are happy about each one 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:09.859
 message always quite a lot of messages e 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:11.750
 mail and of course something special 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.310

 We'll gladly agree with that 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:22.590
 More precisely, I have sometime in 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:26.100
 some video too 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.139
 self- same mobile smartphone apps 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.949
 have said that there are really great things 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:34.350

 japan dollar costs a nice man holding 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.260
 that still not noticed 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.479
 but that is really good idea and 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.419
 but will someday introduce so 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:47.510
