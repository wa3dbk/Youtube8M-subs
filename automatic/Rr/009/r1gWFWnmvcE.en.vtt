00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.390
 hello these blog lists the 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.740
 lise delicacies in this video I 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.430
 will teach you to make Caribbean 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.430
 what is known are you there 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.440
 to start we will prepare a dough to 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.460
 speculoos base it's going to be do it 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.869
 since this cake 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.150
 the ideal is to put and speculos 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.650
 directly in the mix art it will go 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.360
 much faster for those who have it 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.190
 not there is another technique that's 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.739
 already grind some of the speculoos to 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.860
 the hand and then do it with a 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.870
 the bottom of a glass and crush the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.699
 speculoos made to serve glass 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.860
 like a mortar so already I'm going 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.860
 cut the speculoos with my hands 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:01:00.690
 So then I'm going to use glass 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.030
 as a mortar and so I'm going 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.809
 come crush the speculoos the end that 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.809
 it becomes powder 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.340
 so now I'm going to melt the 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.080
 butter in the microwave 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.280
 I can also make it to the pan 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.720
 go back to the same one so we can do it 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.080
 microwaving about twenty 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.620
 seconds 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.620
 it will be enough 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.370
 so now i'm going to add the 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.180
 ham boy and speculos crumbled no 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.760
 now I'm going to mix the 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.010
 preparation of speculoos and butter 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.290
 to get a fairly homogeneous paste and 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.810
 with really speculoos powder 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.360
 and butter I'll come and spread it 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.210
 in the mold with removable edge and I'm going 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.820
 come to crush the preparation with oneself 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.280
 a big spoon either with the bottom 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.870
 a glass or cup to crush 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.590
 spÃ©culoos for snug 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.120
 in the bottom of the mold 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.460
 so then will come and put this 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.360
 preparation are made speculoos in the 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.580
 fridge 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.310
 about half an hour half an hour 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.570
 at one o'clock so that the preparation 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.570
 harden and can fix 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.840
 then the second step of the cheesecake 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.120
 it is the preparation with cream 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.760
 so we'll start with 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.540
 fresh cheese then add the 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.150
 white cheese 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.860
 then we add the caster sugar and 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.760
 will eventually put the work all to 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.390
 time but first we will mix 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.390
 this preparation 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.640
 so once we get one 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.780
 smooth and homogeneous preparation he 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.780
 just add the ofs 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.920
 so now we have finished 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.800
 cream-based preparation we're going 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.930
 add the nutella to get our 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.850
 preparation in August so she put 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.410
 about a big spoon at 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.970
 nutella soup in the preparation 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.160
 so for accor could the nutella to 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.050
 the preparation you can use a 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.160
 electric beater or whisk and if 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.350
 you have none you can very well 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.560
 use a fork or a large 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.560
 spoon 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.380
 so now it remains more than 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.569
 put the nutella preparation on the 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.640
 bottom of speculoos and then stuffed 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.640
 will have the 40-minute hole at 160 degrees 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.450
 so now that we have finished doing 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.520
 600 nutella cream base 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.560
 we will add the topping from above 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.209
 so it's melted nutella so it 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.900
 just enough background of the nutella at the microphone 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.900
 waves or pan 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.780
 not 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.190
 now you have all the 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.930
 tricks to achieve a since is 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.130
