 it's difficult because we are in Italy anyway 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:45.099
 and the culture in Italy now in my opinion 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.569
 it has not however comparable to the 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.860

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.770
 United States 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.050
 in Italy everything is still in my opinion a world to discover 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.919
 always staying modestly with your feet on the ground 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.169
