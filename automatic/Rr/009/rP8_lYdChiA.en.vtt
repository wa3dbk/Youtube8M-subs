it's a buildable but this category is

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.799 
it's a buildable but this category is
going<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.379> go<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.620> sliquifier<00:00:53.809> next

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
going to go to the sliquifier next

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.660 
going to go to the sliquifier next
category<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.350> which<00:00:55.770> one<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.070> easier<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.430> get

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
category is which one is easier to get

it's<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.620> free<00:01:01.829> buildable<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.090> category

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
it's a free buildable so this category

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.000 
it's a free buildable so this category
is<00:01:03.600> obviously<00:01:04.229> going<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> go<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.710> soco

is obviously going to go to the soco
fire<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.880> easily<00:01:06.060> build<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.510> sukkah

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
fire you can easily build the sukkah

going<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.549> go<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.790> thundergun<00:01:15.210> because

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
going to go to the thundergun because

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.539 
going to go to the thundergun because

whatever you guys want to call it that

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.940 
whatever you guys want to call it that
comes<00:01:21.390> out<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> thundergun<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.830> can

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
comes out of the thundergun and it can

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.179 
comes out of the thundergun and it can
kill<00:01:23.070> an<00:01:23.189> entire<00:01:23.430> horde<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.299> one<00:01:24.450> shot

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
kill an entire horde in just one shot

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.859 
kill an entire horde in just one shot
the<00:01:26.189> second<00:01:26.460> category<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.909> most<00:01:27.240> powerful<00:01:27.689> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
the second category is most powerful and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.510 
the second category is most powerful and
this<00:01:28.200> one<00:01:28.380> again<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.650> going<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.100> thundergun

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
this one again is going to thundergun

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.580 
this one again is going to thundergun
obviously<00:01:30.509> because<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.780> still<00:01:31.140> had<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.409> best

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
obviously because it still had the best

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.170 
obviously because it still had the best
kill<00:01:31.799> speed<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.490> it's<00:01:32.640> going<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
kill speed so it's going to have the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.569 
kill speed so it's going to have the
most<00:01:33.509> power<00:01:33.780> because<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.829> can<00:01:34.950> take<00:01:35.189> out<00:01:35.369> a

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
most power because it can take out a

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.520 
most power because it can take out a
whole<00:01:35.790> horde<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.210> zombies<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:37.049> one<00:01:37.320> bullet

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
whole horde of zombies just one bullet

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.469 
whole horde of zombies just one bullet
unlike<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.400> local<00:01:38.729> fire<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.210> needs<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
unlike this local fire that needs the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.719 
unlike this local fire that needs the
chain<00:01:39.750> reaction<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.259> occur<00:01:40.560> before<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.460> and

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
chain reaction to occur before that and

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.420 
chain reaction to occur before that and
the<00:01:42.049> super<00:01:43.049> fire<00:01:43.200> only<00:01:43.409> takes<00:01:43.619> out<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:43.799> zombie

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
the super fire only takes out one zombie

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.850 
the super fire only takes out one zombie
at<00:01:44.549> first<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:46.259> least<00:01:46.439> amount<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.710> splash

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
at first the least amount of splash

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.920 
at first the least amount of splash
damage<00:01:47.250> goes<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.790> thundergun<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.750> gun

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
damage goes to the thundergun this gun

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.289 
damage goes to the thundergun this gun
has<00:01:48.960> absolutely<00:01:49.649> no<00:01:49.979> splash<00:01:50.399> damage<00:01:50.700> at<00:01:51.030> all

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
has absolutely no splash damage at all

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.690 
has absolutely no splash damage at all
but<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.290> soca<00:01:52.500> fire<00:01:52.740> actually<00:01:53.189> does<00:01:53.460> have

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
but the soca fire actually does have

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.639 
but the soca fire actually does have
some<00:01:53.850> splash<00:01:54.119> damage<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.079> category<00:01:55.229> is

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
some splash damage so this category is

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.819 
some splash damage so this category is
going<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.159> go<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.579> thundergun<00:01:57.829> next

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
going to go to the thundergun next

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.920 
going to go to the thundergun next
category<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.340> most<00:01:59.759> fun<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.360> use<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
category is most fun to use the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.959 
category is most fun to use the
thundergun<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.890> going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.189> win<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.460> category

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
thundergun is going to win this category

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.080 
thundergun is going to win this category
because<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:04.049> gun<00:02:04.350> has<00:02:04.380> no<00:02:04.530> negatives<00:02:05.250> unlike

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
because this gun has no negatives unlike

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.600 
because this gun has no negatives unlike
the<00:02:06.119> sloka<00:02:06.600> fire<00:02:06.810> where<00:02:07.439> its<00:02:07.680> slime<00:02:08.039> can<00:02:08.399> cause

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
the sloka fire where its slime can cause

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.369 
the sloka fire where its slime can cause
you<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.819> slip<00:02:09.149> into<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.450> horde<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.840> zombies<00:02:09.899> or

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
you to slip into a horde of zombies or

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.460 
you to slip into a horde of zombies or
fall<00:02:10.770> off<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.099> map<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:12.120> thundergun<00:02:12.840> has

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
fall off the map so thundergun has

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.680 
fall off the map so thundergun has
in<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.650> most<00:02:13.830> fun<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.160> use<00:02:14.310> category<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.060> it's

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
in the most fun to use category and it's

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.720 
in the most fun to use category and it's
more<00:02:15.930> original<00:02:16.380> than<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.280> super<00:02:17.520> fire

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
more original than the super fire

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.730 
more original than the super fire
because<00:02:18.210> it<00:02:18.330> was<00:02:18.420> one<00:02:18.570> of<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.780> first<00:02:19.230> wonder

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
because it was one of the first wonder

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.970 
because it was one of the first wonder
weapons<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:21.630> next<00:02:21.870> category<00:02:21.960> is<00:02:22.380> most<00:02:22.710> kills

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
weapons the next category is most kills

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.920 
weapons the next category is most kills
with<00:02:23.130> one<00:02:23.310> shot<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.790> once<00:02:24.270> again<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.870> is

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
with one shot and once again this is

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.840 
with one shot and once again this is
going<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.200> go<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.710> Thunder<00:02:25.980> done<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.640> can

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
going to go to the Thunder done it can

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.430 
going to go to the Thunder done it can
kill<00:02:27.000> an<00:02:27.120> entire<00:02:27.360> horde<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:27.750> zombies<00:02:27.810> with<00:02:28.230> one

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
kill an entire horde of zombies with one

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.530 
kill an entire horde of zombies with one
shot<00:02:28.680> as<00:02:28.920> long<00:02:29.370> as<00:02:29.400> your<00:02:29.640> accuracy<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.330> good

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
shot as long as your accuracy is good

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.210 
shot as long as your accuracy is good
but<00:02:31.020> it's<00:02:31.170> pretty<00:02:31.320> hard<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.650> miss<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:31.980> because

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
but it's pretty hard to miss it because

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.890 
but it's pretty hard to miss it because
the<00:02:32.460> Gustav<00:02:32.820> when<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:33.030> comes<00:02:33.210> out<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.570> really

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
the Gustav when that comes out is really

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.350 
the Gustav when that comes out is really
big<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.230> carries<00:02:34.770> out<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.130> covers<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.090> large

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
big and carries out and covers a large

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
big and carries out and covers a large
radius<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:38.150> sloka<00:02:39.150> fire<00:02:39.390> can<00:02:39.690> kill<00:02:39.870> 20<00:02:40.290> to

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
radius and the sloka fire can kill 20 to

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.070 
radius and the sloka fire can kill 20 to
25<00:02:40.800> zombies<00:02:41.550> with<00:02:41.760> one<00:02:41.970> shot<00:02:42.210> but<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.900> does

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
25 zombies with one shot but it does

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.900 
25 zombies with one shot but it does
need<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.620> chain<00:02:43.980> reaction<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.430> occur<00:02:44.670> first

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
need the chain reaction to occur first

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.940 
need the chain reaction to occur first
so<00:02:45.420> it's<00:02:45.600> not<00:02:45.780> instant<00:02:46.260> like<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.530> thundergun

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
so it's not instant like the thundergun

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.330 
so it's not instant like the thundergun
and<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.459> Thunder<00:02:47.730> gun<00:02:47.910> can<00:02:48.150> kill<00:02:48.180> more<00:02:48.630> I

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
and the Thunder gun can kill more I

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.270 
and the Thunder gun can kill more I
believe<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.870> final<00:02:52.200> category<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.920> slime

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
believe and the final category is slime

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.060 
believe and the final category is slime
vs.<00:02:53.820> wind<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:55.050> thundergun<00:02:55.470> like<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:55.830> said

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
vs. wind the thundergun like I said

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.830 
vs. wind the thundergun like I said
before<00:02:56.190> does<00:02:56.760> not<00:02:56.940> have<00:02:57.150> any<00:02:57.360> negatives

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
before does not have any negatives

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.780 
before does not have any negatives
except<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.590> can't<00:02:58.890> reload<00:02:59.280> mid<00:02:59.520> clip

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
except that you can't reload mid clip

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.580 
except that you can't reload mid clip
which<00:03:00.060> really<00:03:00.300> isn't<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.630> problem<00:03:00.840> but<00:03:01.500> the

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
which really isn't a problem but the

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.290 
which really isn't a problem but the
sukkah<00:03:01.830> fire<00:03:02.070> however<00:03:02.310> can<00:03:02.910> cause<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.240> to

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
sukkah fire however can cause you to

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.540 
sukkah fire however can cause you to
slip<00:03:03.600> into<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:04.020> horde<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.440> zombies<00:03:04.500> or<00:03:05.100> slip<00:03:05.430> off

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
slip into a horde of zombies or slip off

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.000 
slip into a horde of zombies or slip off
the<00:03:05.580> map<00:03:05.850> because<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.420> slime<00:03:06.690> is<00:03:06.870> slippery<00:03:07.110> so

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
the map because the slime is slippery so

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.370 
the map because the slime is slippery so
guys<00:03:08.220> obviously<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:09.420> thundergun<00:03:09.870> has<00:03:10.110> won

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
guys obviously the thundergun has won

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.980 
guys obviously the thundergun has won
this<00:03:11.010> category<00:03:11.640> wind<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.240> better<00:03:12.450> than<00:03:12.660> slime

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
this category wind is better than slime

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.890 
this category wind is better than slime
because<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.470> has<00:03:13.620> no<00:03:13.890> negatives<00:03:14.750> anyways<00:03:15.750> guys

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
because it has no negatives anyways guys

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.620 
because it has no negatives anyways guys
after<00:03:16.530> tallying<00:03:16.830> up<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.220> score<00:03:17.700> the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
after tallying up the score the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.460 
after tallying up the score the
thundergun<00:03:18.989> has<00:03:19.170> six<00:03:19.470> categories<00:03:20.070> one<00:03:20.640> and

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
thundergun has six categories one and

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.560 
thundergun has six categories one and
the<00:03:22.470> sloka<00:03:22.739> fire<00:03:23.010> only<00:03:23.430> has<00:03:23.640> two<00:03:23.940> categories

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
the sloka fire only has two categories

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.140 
the sloka fire only has two categories
one<00:03:24.800> so<00:03:25.800> yeah<00:03:25.980> guys<00:03:26.190> that<00:03:26.550> is<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.910> end<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.090> the

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
one so yeah guys that is the end of the
