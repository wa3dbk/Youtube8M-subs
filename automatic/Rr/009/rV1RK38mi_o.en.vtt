just like brains up my waterline but
this<00:01:19.650> one<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.369> think<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.119> supposed<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.450> be

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
this one I think this is supposed to be

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.980 
this one I think this is supposed to be
black<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.320> we<00:01:23.220> will<00:01:23.400> see<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.840> nice

black so we will see but this is nice

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.190 
black so we will see but this is nice
because<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.560> natural<00:01:25.770> eyeliner<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.200> it's

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
because it's a natural eyeliner and it's

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.420 
because it's a natural eyeliner and it's
gentle<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.710> your<00:01:28.829> eyes<00:01:28.979> if<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.340> have
