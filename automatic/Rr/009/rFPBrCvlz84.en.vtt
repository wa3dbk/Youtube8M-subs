00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
forest weapons goes I mean her costume

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.290

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.569 
definitely looks tight have you know
what<00:00:35.420> I<00:00:35.450> mean<00:00:35.600> but<00:00:36.230> as<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:36.860> only<00:00:36.950> thing<00:00:37.190> I<00:00:37.340> see

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
what I mean but as the only thing I see

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.700 
what I mean but as the only thing I see
weapon<00:00:37.970> wise<00:00:38.120> actually<00:00:38.750> just<00:00:38.899> that<00:00:39.079> stick<00:00:39.440> so

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
weapon wise actually just that stick so

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.500 
weapon wise actually just that stick so
she'll<00:00:40.220> probably<00:00:40.250> be<00:00:40.640> a<00:00:40.850> lot<00:00:41.059> of<00:00:41.120> hand-to-hand

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
she'll probably be a lot of hand-to-hand

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.319 
she'll probably be a lot of hand-to-hand
combat<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:42.559> I'm<00:00:43.370> guessing<00:00:43.940> that<00:00:43.970> she'll<00:00:44.180> be

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
combat and I'm guessing that she'll be

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.000 
combat and I'm guessing that she'll be
putting<00:00:44.570> on<00:00:44.660> this<00:00:44.750> costume<00:00:45.260> towards<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:45.800> end

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
putting on this costume towards the end

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.490 
putting on this costume towards the end
of<00:00:46.190> the<00:00:46.250> season<00:00:46.520> I<00:00:46.910> mean<00:00:47.480> seriously<00:00:47.660> she<00:00:48.260> just

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
of the season I mean seriously she just

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.319 
of the season I mean seriously she just
started<00:00:48.710> training<00:00:48.980> now<00:00:49.309> I'm<00:00:49.579> I<00:00:49.940> know<00:00:50.149> she

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
started training now I'm I know she

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.080 
started training now I'm I know she
probably<00:00:50.690> has<00:00:51.020> some<00:00:51.380> training<00:00:51.829> of<00:00:51.980> you<00:00:52.940> know

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
probably has some training of you know

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.000 
probably has some training of you know
some<00:00:53.420> martial<00:00:53.570> arts<00:00:53.870> but<00:00:54.290> probably<00:00:54.680> barely

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
some martial arts but probably barely

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.970 
some martial arts but probably barely
like<00:00:55.550> none<00:00:55.940> at<00:00:56.120> all<00:00:56.239> anything<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.230> obviously

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
like none at all anything so obviously

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.590 
like none at all anything so obviously
she<00:00:58.250> has<00:00:58.340> to<00:00:58.460> go<00:00:58.550> through<00:00:58.790> at<00:00:58.879> least<00:00:59.090> a<00:00:59.300> full

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
she has to go through at least a full

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.360 
she has to go through at least a full
season<00:00:59.930> of<00:01:00.260> training<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:00.950> then<00:01:01.070> she<00:01:01.219> could

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
season of training and then she could

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.850 
season of training and then she could
put<00:01:01.520> all<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:01.730> costume<00:01:02.260> my<00:01:03.260> guess<00:01:03.469> is<00:01:03.500> she'll

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
put all the costume my guess is she'll

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.560 
put all the costume my guess is she'll
find<00:01:04.129> out<00:01:04.309> who<00:01:04.460> arrow<00:01:04.670> is<00:01:04.939> or<00:01:05.180> she<00:01:05.420> already

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
find out who arrow is or she already

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.450 
find out who arrow is or she already
does<00:01:05.840> know<00:01:05.990> who<00:01:06.110> our<00:01:06.140> oh<00:01:06.320> is<00:01:06.530> but<00:01:06.829> of<00:01:07.250> course

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
does know who our oh is but of course

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.950 
does know who our oh is but of course
will<00:01:07.610> probably<00:01:07.880> join<00:01:08.090> up<00:01:08.270> with<00:01:08.299> arrow<00:01:08.570> because

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
will probably join up with arrow because

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.020 
will probably join up with arrow because
she's<00:01:09.440> wearing<00:01:09.710> a<00:01:09.770> costume<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.430> she

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
she's wearing a costume and she

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.130 
she's wearing a costume and she
definitely<00:01:11.119> isn't<00:01:11.479> gonna<00:01:11.600> be<00:01:11.780> wearing<00:01:12.020> this

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
definitely isn't gonna be wearing this

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.750 
definitely isn't gonna be wearing this
costume<00:01:12.320> alone<00:01:12.830> my<00:01:13.070> guess<00:01:13.250> is<00:01:13.430> that<00:01:13.460> arrow

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
costume alone my guess is that arrow

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.330 
costume alone my guess is that arrow
will<00:01:14.030> approve<00:01:14.420> of<00:01:14.750> this<00:01:15.200> costume<00:01:15.440> and<00:01:15.950> then

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
will approve of this costume and then

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.770 
will approve of this costume and then
approve<00:01:16.670> of<00:01:16.850> her<00:01:17.000> you<00:01:17.180> know<00:01:17.210> being<00:01:17.600> a
