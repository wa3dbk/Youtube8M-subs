00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.420
 instagram will reach windows phone a 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.760
 end of year Instagram follows 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.930
 expanding platforms a few months ago 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.570
 in March of this year 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.279
 instagram ends with exclusivity for 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.830
 iphone users taking a version 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.440
 for android and has not owed them from 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.760
 they like the experience because according to 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.199
 the last numbers the users of 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.960
 windows phone we will have a version 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.989
 installed before the end of the year 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.180
 tracks come on two sides for one a 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.640
 video from nokia where you can see a 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.860
 dan light showing information of a 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.050
 instagram image on the other hand some 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.300
 stonewall sources among bears that 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.680
 hits almost every time 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.809
 that spread related rumors 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.550
 converso install would be available 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.170
 for windows 8 and I imagine that no 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.300
 I would make the mistake of leaving all 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.340
 users of windows 7 back do not 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.380
 discards that they are judgment for the Libyans 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.820
 for a while since it would be a 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.070
 Perfect companion for the camera that 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.750
 it brings what does surprise me is the little 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.100
 that have been slow to develop it over 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.160
 everything considering that they took 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.670
 almost two years in passing and to move to 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.670
 android 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.940
 firefox show you their progress in video 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.700
 mozilla and telephone decided to bet 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.010
 to the mobile market with firefox 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.600
 so every reason based on web standards 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.420
 he also wants to promise fluency 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.070
 good applications and an ecosystem 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.380
 complete able to be handled with hardware 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.710
 decent not necessarily high- end 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.880
 with what includes the galaxy s3 or the htc 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.410
 which x for example in the development is 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.090
 in the process and every time they leave 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.860
 seeing new advances as for example 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.890
 a quite advanced version in 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.960
 comparison to what we saw at the beginning of 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.090
 this year in the top video you see a 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.690
 pretty stable version of firefox 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.830
 2 and fluency is more than interesting if 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.140
 we compare it with the new blackberry 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.810
 days or even android for which is more 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.920
 similar but perhaps the most important 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.630
 that we see in this team for 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.730
 developers is that they were doing 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.430
 a new very good job on the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.410
 applications and cobos to get them the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.630
 I really did not think I made a system 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.670
 operative as complete as there is that 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.739
 andrew but fortunately everything seems 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.210
 which is pointing up the store of 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.490
 applications that seeps 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.350
 can be detailed in the video and how it was 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.060
 to be expected is not very different from 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.940
 current mobile platforms 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.800
 firefox has all the potential for 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.320
 be planted as a viable alternative 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.810
 but we can not expect that good to 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.210
 first of this market to ios and much 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.860
 less to Andrew the strong point is in 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.660
 which will be directed in the first place to 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.550
 markets with great potential and 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.340
 growth like the Brazilian and by 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.190
 course in europe the first teams 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.920
 will come from the hand of zte alcatel 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.510
 Huawei and others you just have to see others 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.280
 manufacturers are encouraged to promote a 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.750
 new is operating in a market that 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.750
 has dominant clear 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:17.350
 the living arrives at galaxy tab 2 and the 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.720
 galaxy 10.1 continues to dominate and in 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.090
 Sandwich has only grown 20% in 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.070
 almost a year for samsung after 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.110
 present the galaxy it was clear to us that 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.030
 they opened the date for their teams 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.410
 previous ones were much closer to 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.830
 have the latest version of android 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:36.220
 4.1 alias gely ping the following in the 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.370
 list are the galaxy tab 2 say vulgar and 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.440
 the galaxy 10.1 the utilization will be like 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.570
 usual via ota but not yet 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.500
 available however the reason for 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.840
 why geely min 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.790
 already reached these teams is because the 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.580
 official wheel is from those not from samsung 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.650
 they leaked and for those interested 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.410
 can be commissioned installed now 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.240
 same as well as taking into account that 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.770
 it deals with the official versions but in 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.570
 your first steps and you could have 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.980
 several bots 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.500
 They are also only compatible with 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.000
 3g versions of these equipment since 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.200
 the galaxy was announced the galaxy 10.1 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.360
 we knew that I would have 10 living in 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.380
 any time but you did not have 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.970
 no kind of details about 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.400
 authorization 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.780
 the recommendation is obviously to wait 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.430
 the official version is set to 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.430
 layout directly by samsung 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.290
 but we know that this may may take 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.080
 a couple of weeks the action for 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.970
 guarantee and garages the 10 according to mobile 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.730
 they are fully functional so 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.030
 both the load links are active 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:39.220
 and they could start to try the best 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.760
 the best that android gaming brings to 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.760
 their teams 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.590
 samsung wanted to put 13 megapixels in 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.080
 the galaxy 22 camera to samsung 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.180
 galaxy 22 as the high-end android 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.460
 that come out lately does not lack 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.620
 technical specifications in the hardware 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.900
 although the rumors pointed to a 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.180
 3 megapixel camera present in 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.030
 determine many we take a cut 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.580
 when we knew that I was going to dodge 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.830
 more 8 megapixel standards in its 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.500
 sensor the problem was not by samsung 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.300
 think about reducing the cost determine the 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.060
 economy but to their 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.920
 cms sensor providers unable to 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.360
 provide people with the same amount 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.340
 is that samsung required for the 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.130
 manufacture of its second terminal 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.870
 logo what's curious is that the samsung is 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.870
 who will provide these sensors for him 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.880
 and for your next bus that one of the 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.340
 rumors candidates to make the terminal 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.260
 of facts and maybe we will see a version 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.510
 Very effective galaxy 22 with better 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.160
 sensor in the camera given the recent 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.430
 launch of the terminal I doubt it to be 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.110
 well on the other hand the camera of 22 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.880
 it's good enough to 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.710
 to keep your head up during 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:54.250
 this generation of mobile 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.250
 until the Lumia 920 comes to the fire 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.650
 more features for windows phones 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.240
 7.8 are increasingly insistent 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.800
 rumors that point to windows phones 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.360
 7.8 will be more than just a simple 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.790
 remodeling the home screen 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.380
 still enlarged to windows 8 functions not 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.020
 presented technical plan problems for 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.880
 to be able to implement it in windows phone 7.8 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.410
 such as presentations 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.600
 notifications in the plant in the 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.640
 lock screen this rumor has 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.770
 received a powerful impulse when today 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:25.070
 we saw the friends of platform have seen 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.720
 how in windows phone justice voice one 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.540
 of the administrators in response to a 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.400
 user requesting more functions in 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.530
 windows phones 7.8 than the current 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.020
 hardware would support showed what 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.900
 next as you know windows 8 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.520
 it's a technological generational change what 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.680
 which means that it will not work in 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.230
 the existing hardware but we 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.730
 we care deeply for our 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.140
 clients and we would like to know is 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.990
 also what features you 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:53.510
 like to see the 7.8 and vote 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.430
 individually so you want more 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.110
 it's still early to launch the campaigns 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.970
 grandfather but for scheme even he 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.849
 it raises bring something more than a simple 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.409
 home screen windows 7.8 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:05.330
 complaints from actuaries users who 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:07.939
 they placed their trust in windows 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.529
 phone 7 on windows phone 7 and that now 

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:12.619
 they feel betrayed they have served 

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:14.990
 for the kingdoms to rethink in their 

00:07:12.619 --> 00:07:18.789
 attitude and plan to offer us something more in 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.789
 windows phones 7.8
