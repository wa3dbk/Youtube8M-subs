00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
maybe like this thing and then i clamp

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.389 
maybe like this thing and then i clamp
it<00:00:59.850> Raila<00:01:00.300> here<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.410> me<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.770> link<00:01:01.980> goes

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
it Raila here and for me the link goes

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.329 
it Raila here and for me the link goes
down<00:01:02.640> about<00:01:02.850> here<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:04.290> point<00:01:04.769> i<00:01:04.979> start

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
down about here and that point i start

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.250 
down about here and that point i start
twisting<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:07.010> turning<00:01:08.270> this<00:01:09.270> hair

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
twisting and turning this hair

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.840 
twisting and turning this hair
straightener<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:11.280> kind<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.549> pulled

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
straightener and I just kind of pulled

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.560 
straightener and I just kind of pulled
it<00:01:11.970> down<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:14.520> then<00:01:14.640> there<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:14.939> angle<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.450> this

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
it down and then there I angle is this

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.810 
it down and then there I angle is this
way<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.680> kind<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.920> cruel<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.310> down<00:01:17.520> and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
way and I just kind of cruel it down and

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.429 
way and I just kind of cruel it down and
continue<00:01:18.000> curling<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:20.990> twist<00:01:21.990> like<00:01:22.229> their

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
continue curling it and twist like their

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.890 
continue curling it and twist like their
hair<00:01:22.650> straighteners<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.610> guess

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
hair straighteners I guess

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.450 
hair straighteners I guess
then<00:01:25.110> let<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.680> go<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:28.100> there's<00:01:29.100> lots<00:01:29.280> of

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
then let it go and there's lots of

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.160 
then let it go and there's lots of
little<00:01:29.700> curl<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.330> it's<00:01:30.450> not<00:01:30.510> like<00:01:30.720> one<00:01:30.990> big

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
little curl so it's not like one big

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.220 
little curl so it's not like one big
club<00:01:31.470> prefer<00:01:31.830> to<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.130> lots<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.720> messy<00:01:33.720> uneven

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
club prefer to have lots of messy uneven

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.260 
club prefer to have lots of messy uneven
curls<00:01:34.560> as<00:01:34.860> versus<00:01:35.700> um<00:01:36.230> one<00:01:37.230> big<00:01:37.470> straight<00:01:37.830> curl

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
curls as versus um one big straight curl

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.170 
curls as versus um one big straight curl
I'm<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:39.660> clip<00:01:39.870> that<00:01:39.990> out<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.260> the<00:01:40.320> way<00:01:44.150> so<00:01:45.150> I

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
I'm so we clip that out of the way so I

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.140 
I'm so we clip that out of the way so I
don't<00:01:45.240> know<00:01:45.450> way<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.630> do<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:50.000> that<00:01:51.000> you're

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
don't know way to do it is that you're

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.320 
don't know way to do it is that you're
doing<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.510> pitcher<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:53.040> clamp<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.430> into

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
doing the pitcher and you clamp it into

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.750 
doing the pitcher and you clamp it into
the<00:01:54.450> canola<00:01:54.900> or<00:01:55.080> study<00:01:55.410> or<00:01:55.470> hair<00:01:55.950> curler<00:01:56.340> into

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
the canola or study or hair curler into

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.800 
the canola or study or hair curler into
it<00:01:57.510> and<00:01:58.440> then<00:01:59.000> curl<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.090> one<00:02:00.210> more<00:02:00.300> time<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
it and then curl it one more time and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.260 
it and then curl it one more time and
you<00:02:00.990> kind<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.290> split<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.800> whole<00:02:02.040> thing<00:02:02.400> roll

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
you kind of split the whole thing roll

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.410 
you kind of split the whole thing roll

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
of just hold it for a bit and then when
you<00:02:09.750> pull<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.679> down<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:10.920> release<00:02:12.260> is<00:02:13.260> another

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
you pull it down and release is another

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.449 
you pull it down and release is another
way<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.610> curling<00:02:15.480> your<00:02:15.840> hair<00:02:16.230> oh<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:19.830> yeah<00:02:20.100> so

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
way of curling your hair oh and yeah so

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.210 
way of curling your hair oh and yeah so
I<00:02:20.490> guess<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.150> last<00:02:21.420> way<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:22.200> really<00:02:22.620> do<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:22.920> is

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
I guess the last way I really do it is

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.560 
I guess the last way I really do it is
using<00:02:25.010> hair<00:02:26.010> straightener<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.640> usually

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
using hair straightener and usually

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.210 
using hair straightener and usually
actually<00:02:27.720> do<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.050> little<00:02:28.290> bit<00:02:28.470> less<00:02:28.709> than<00:02:28.980> hair

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
actually do a little bit less than hair

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.970 
actually do a little bit less than hair
for<00:02:29.550> this<00:02:29.730> part<00:02:30.350> another<00:02:31.350> way<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.470> do<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.800> is<00:02:31.950> to

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
for this part another way to do it is to

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.730 
for this part another way to do it is to
play

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
play

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.880 
play
pull<00:02:33.740> it<00:02:33.860> down<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:34.460> then<00:02:35.030> just<00:02:35.390> kind<00:02:35.540> of<00:02:35.890> sit

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
pull it down and then just kind of sit

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.130 
pull it down and then just kind of sit
down<00:02:37.220> keeping<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.880> hair<00:02:38.120> clips<00:02:38.450> in<00:02:38.690> between

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
down keeping the hair clips in between

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.970 
down keeping the hair clips in between
ya<00:02:39.550> neck<00:02:40.550> straight<00:02:40.850> I<00:02:41.210> just<00:02:41.420> rolled<00:02:41.800> from<00:02:42.800> a

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
ya neck straight I just rolled from a

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.740 
ya neck straight I just rolled from a
little<00:02:43.250> more<00:02:43.400> subtle<00:02:43.640> but<00:02:44.120> it's<00:02:44.480> more<00:02:44.690> just

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
little more subtle but it's more just

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.550 
little more subtle but it's more just
like<00:02:45.020> that<00:02:45.080> kind<00:02:45.440> of<00:02:45.520> wavy<00:02:46.520> care<00:02:46.960> that<00:02:47.960> is<00:02:48.260> an

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
like that kind of wavy care that is an

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.370
