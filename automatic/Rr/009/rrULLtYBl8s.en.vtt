00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
going to have to turn the power on

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.020 
going to have to turn the power on
before<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.799> finish<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.340> same<00:01:44.700> with<00:01:44.850> two

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
before you finish it same with two

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.429 
before you finish it same with two
people<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.600> if<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.750> do<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:45.990> one<00:01:46.200> person

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
people and if you do with one person

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.780 
people and if you do with one person
you're<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.250> literally<00:01:47.490> do

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
you're going to have to literally do

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.389 
you're going to have to literally do
four<00:01:48.720> times<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.320> coming<00:01:49.649> back<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.040> top<00:01:50.250> and

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
four times of coming back to the top and

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.130 
four times of coming back to the top and
grabbing<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.850> part<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.299> makes<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.780> really

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
grabbing a part that makes it really

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.389 
grabbing a part that makes it really
difficult<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.100> going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.280> be<00:01:53.340> a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
difficult and it's just going to be a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.569 
difficult and it's just going to be a
waste<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.820> time<00:01:54.560> so<00:01:55.560> i<00:01:55.590> really<00:01:55.890> suggest<00:01:56.040> going

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
waste of time so i really suggest going

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.359 
waste of time so i really suggest going
with<00:01:56.790> four<00:01:57.000> next<00:01:57.500> slowly<00:01:58.500> go<00:01:58.860> off<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.159> edge

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
with four next slowly go off this edge

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.160 
with four next slowly go off this edge
right<00:01:59.399> here<00:01:59.640> don't<00:02:00.000> go<00:02:00.540> too<00:02:00.600> hard<00:02:00.750> he<00:02:00.990> going<00:02:01.110> to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
right here don't go too hard he going to

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.260 
right here don't go too hard he going to
fall<00:02:01.350> off<00:02:01.560> then<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.490> want<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.700> add<00:02:02.820> your<00:02:03.030> part

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
fall off then you want to add your part

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.999 
fall off then you want to add your part
right<00:02:03.479> here<00:02:03.509> basically<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
right here basically this is the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.889 
right here basically this is the
workbench<00:02:05.490> i<00:02:05.790> don't<00:02:06.360> know<00:02:06.479> if<00:02:06.509> there's<00:02:06.719> any

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
workbench i don't know if there's any

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.270 
workbench i don't know if there's any
others<00:02:07.229> other<00:02:07.500> than<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.890> one

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
then just stand on top of it as you can

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.710 
then just stand on top of it as you can
see<00:02:29.040> in<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.190> second<00:02:29.580> my<00:02:29.670> teammates<00:02:30.120> not<00:02:30.420> really

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
see in a second my teammates not really

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.210 
see in a second my teammates not really
paying<00:02:30.900> attention<00:02:31.050> he<00:02:31.500> kind<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:31.739> just<00:02:31.860> jumps

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
paying attention he kind of just jumps

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.910 
paying attention he kind of just jumps
off<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.400> map<00:02:32.760> um<00:02:33.510> like<00:02:34.350> that<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.750> just<00:02:37.590> kind<00:02:37.830> of

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
off the map um like that so just kind of

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.440 
off the map um like that so just kind of
stand<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.430> top<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.180> will<00:02:39.239> launch

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
stand on top of it and it will launch

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.009 
stand on top of it and it will launch
you<00:02:39.750> over<00:02:40.430> it's<00:02:41.430> not<00:02:41.670> very<00:02:41.880> difficult<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.600> do<00:02:42.750> I

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
you over it's not very difficult to do I

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.470 
you over it's not very difficult to do I
can't<00:02:43.410> wait<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.590> try<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:43.950> out<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.190> see<00:02:44.790> what

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
can't wait to try it out and see what

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.670 
can't wait to try it out and see what
else<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.750> can<00:02:45.780> do<00:02:46.080> with<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.320> because<00:02:46.500> i'm<00:02:46.650> sure

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
else you can do with it because i'm sure

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.470 
else you can do with it because i'm sure
you<00:02:46.920> can<00:02:47.040> put<00:02:47.220> all<00:02:47.370> kinds<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.760> crazy<00:02:47.940> places

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
you can put all kinds of crazy places

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.390 
you can put all kinds of crazy places
and<00:02:48.720> launch<00:02:49.350> yourself<00:02:49.500> from<00:02:49.920> one<00:02:50.070> part<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.310> the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
and launch yourself from one part of the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.310 
and launch yourself from one part of the
map<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.790> other<00:02:50.940> i<00:02:51.209> also<00:02:51.900> don't<00:02:52.140> know<00:02:52.200> how

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
map to the other i also don't know how

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.570 
map to the other i also don't know how
long<00:02:52.470> they<00:02:52.650> stay<00:02:52.890> there<00:02:53.040> whether<00:02:53.280> it's<00:02:53.489> the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
long they stay there whether it's the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.990 
long they stay there whether it's the
whole<00:02:53.730> game<00:02:54.090> or<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.860> set<00:02:55.860> time<00:02:56.100> span<00:02:56.519> so<00:02:56.760> if<00:02:56.819> it's

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
whole game or a set time span so if it's

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.580 
whole game or a set time span so if it's
the<00:02:57.090> whole<00:02:57.269> game<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.630> probably<00:02:57.989> really<00:02:58.350> cool

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
the whole game it probably really cool

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.800 
the whole game it probably really cool
to<00:02:58.739> put<00:02:58.890> them<00:02:59.010> all<00:02:59.519> over<00:02:59.580> the<00:03:00.060> place<00:03:00.269> going

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
to put them all over the place going

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.240 
to put them all over the place going
from<00:03:00.930> building<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.319> building<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.950> allowing

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
from building to building and allowing

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.840 
from building to building and allowing
yourself<00:03:02.700> those<00:03:03.030> easy<00:03:03.390> access<00:03:03.989> ways<00:03:04.230> out<00:03:04.530> of

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
yourself those easy access ways out of

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.340 
yourself those easy access ways out of
bad<00:03:05.850> situations<00:03:06.120> probably<00:03:06.870> make<00:03:06.989> it<00:03:07.019> really

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
bad situations probably make it really

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.040 
bad situations probably make it really
easy<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.800> camp<00:03:08.100> because<00:03:08.370> if<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:09.600> jump<00:03:09.900> over

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
easy to camp because if you jump over

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.390 
easy to camp because if you jump over
the<00:03:10.290> zombies<00:03:10.620> are<00:03:10.650> going<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:10.860> have<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.100> find<00:03:11.250> a

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
the zombies are going to have to find a
