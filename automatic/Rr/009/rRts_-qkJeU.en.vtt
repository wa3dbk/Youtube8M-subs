00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 I do not see it as a complexity 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:08.910
 sincerely the final match 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:12.769
 we are eleven players against eleven and good 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.619
 more what we participate in the show 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.939
 and I think we are enough 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.470
 professional to face this 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.330
 match of both the selection of 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.890
 Chile so much our selection 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.900
 I think we can make a good 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.060
 show and I think that 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.740
 I do not see it as something complex I see it as 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.210
 a football game that is going to face 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.400
 with total seriousness more than anything but it 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.579
 enable that generates I do not think the 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.380
 truth that I do not expand on the 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.430
 arbitrations 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.290
 I think you have to leave them alone 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.420
 they live intensely like us 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.040
 we live the matches so the most 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.230
 important that I can develop your 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.640
 I work with tranquility but that peru 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:00.660
 It is great in its history 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.890
 and well that is what enables us to 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.310
 we can hopefully be part of 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.200
 something something nice something we can face 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.840
 in the future and that allows us to go 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.670
 growing more and more but I think that 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.430
 we go away in my case in 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.490
 particular as a technician I think what's mine 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.050
 You can acquire a notoriety thanks to 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.509
 directing a country like peru chile is a 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.479
 important selection that by merit 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.220
 own has won it has earned a place 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:36.740
 important in everything that has 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:41.439
 happened in recent years and what 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:44.030
 it takes to analyze well to face them but 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.439
 we are in a stage more than anything of 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.159
 our in which we need 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.159
 consolidate 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:55.350
 our ours and our ideas our 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.350
 functioning 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.110
 and try to emphasize more what 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.450
 we need more 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.860
 regardless of good that always 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.170
 we analyze the rivals and always 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.740
 we respect every opponent that touches us 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.260
 face we are in that you are in that 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.050
 stage where we need to reaffirm 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.380
 also our concepts and try to 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.870
 put them in the field to work us what 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.030
 we want most is to try us 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.610
 that the Peruvian fans feel 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.340
 represented and well represented by a 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.900
 then both boys selection 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.060
 as we all of us who 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.890
 we are here in chile what we are dealing with 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.230
 above all things is that they 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.350
 be happy and good in a way 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.060
 be happy to win and try to make 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.720
 feel well represented now 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.660
 then if we achieve recognition of 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.340
 all good hopefully hopefully this will work 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.680
 to achieve recognition but 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.000
 we know that the road is very hard and that 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.700
 to have an obstacle and there are going to be 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.070
 problems all the time but 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.780
 that we have to get over it 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.800
 we've all put that in our heads 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.560
 is to overcome it 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.990
 this is something nice to live it 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.200
 but know that shortly 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.090
 ends and we have another challenge so 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.470
 important and much harder than 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.660
 the eliminatory ones are neither more nor less 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.920
 so well we're getting ready 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.920
 for all the challenges
