00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
much harder because because dieting is

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.469 
much harder because because dieting is
more<00:01:32.100> important<00:01:32.460> than<00:01:32.520> exercising<00:01:33.119> when<00:01:33.360> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
more important than exercising when it

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.390 
more important than exercising when it
comes<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.780> weight<00:01:33.990> loss<00:01:34.020> not<00:01:34.740> only<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.189> but

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
comes to weight loss not only that but

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.310 
comes to weight loss not only that but
once<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.880> good<00:01:36.180> healthy<00:01:36.570> diet<00:01:36.600> then

once you have a good healthy diet then

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.890
