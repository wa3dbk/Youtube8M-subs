or ductwork and when the pump is hangs

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.489 
or ductwork and when the pump is hangs
on<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.519> from<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.359> little<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.929> this<00:00:46.230> little

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:46.499 
on that from this little and this little

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:48.979 
on that from this little and this little
slot<00:00:46.739> that's<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.249> the<00:00:47.370> tank<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:48.120> slot<00:00:48.839> would

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
slot that's on the tank that slot would

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.900 
slot that's on the tank that slot would
be<00:00:49.109> on<00:00:49.199> both<00:00:49.440> sides<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.129> want<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.519> or

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
be on both sides so if you want to do or

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.029 
be on both sides so if you want to do or
tape<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.269> pump<00:00:51.480> 180<00:00:52.109> degrees<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.559> could<00:00:52.890> do

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
tape the pump 180 degrees you could do

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.549 
tape the pump 180 degrees you could do
that<00:00:53.159> real<00:00:53.370> easy<00:00:53.780> this<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.929> easier<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.289> install

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
that real easy this is easier to install

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.840 
that real easy this is easier to install
you<00:00:56.249> got<00:00:56.370> key<00:00:56.609> hold<00:00:57.019> screw<00:00:58.019> openings<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:59.010> on

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
you got key hold screw openings and on

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.389 
you got key hold screw openings and on
the<00:00:59.999> outside<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.539> pump<00:01:00.809> we've<00:01:01.769> located<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
the outside of the pump we've located a

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.149 
the outside of the pump we've located a
what<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.030> call<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.239> test<00:01:03.780> lever<00:01:04.199> when<00:01:05.040> you

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
what we call a test lever when you

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.039 
what we call a test lever when you
depress<00:01:05.579> this<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.030> raises<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.540> float<00:01:06.810> it

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
depress this it raises the float it

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.630 
depress this it raises the float it
activates<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.680> motor<00:01:07.829> so<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.159> can<00:01:08.399> verify

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
activates the motor so you can verify

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.550 
activates the motor so you can verify
that<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.210> you've<00:01:09.750> got<00:01:09.930> power<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
that you you've got power and that the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.850 
that you you've got power and that the
pump<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.070> working<00:01:11.540> also<00:01:12.540> before<00:01:13.170> servicing

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
pump is working also before servicing

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.920 
pump is working also before servicing
this<00:01:13.979> pump<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.430> run<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> motor<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
this pump you can run the motor and the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.520 
this pump you can run the motor and the
hood<00:01:16.189> evacuate<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.990> leftover<00:01:18.990> condensate

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
hood evacuate the leftover condensate

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.990 
hood evacuate the leftover condensate
that<00:01:19.560> would<00:01:19.890> collect<00:01:20.070> down<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> bottom<00:01:20.909> of

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
that would collect down in the bottom of

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.480 
that would collect down in the bottom of
the<00:01:21.090> tank<00:01:21.329> thanks<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.469> you<00:01:22.530> don't<00:01:22.770> end<00:01:23.009> up

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
the tank thanks so you don't end up

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.940 
the tank thanks so you don't end up
spilling<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.210> yourself<00:01:24.659> when<00:01:25.649> you<00:01:25.770> go<00:01:25.890> to

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
spilling that on yourself when you go to

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.560 
spilling that on yourself when you go to
clean<00:01:26.219> one<00:01:26.399> of<00:01:26.520> these<00:01:26.549> pumps<00:01:27.030> service<00:01:27.420> it

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
clean one of these pumps service it

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.899 
clean one of these pumps service it
basically<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.170> cleaning<00:01:28.469> it<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:29.579> have<00:01:29.789> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
basically is cleaning it you can have to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.999 
basically is cleaning it you can have to
carry<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.270> away<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.600> some<00:01:30.930> place<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.619> wash

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
carry it away to some place and and wash

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.170 
carry it away to some place and and wash
it<00:01:32.250> out<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.610> you're<00:01:32.789> going<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:32.969> have<00:01:33.060> to

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
it out so you're going to have to

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.800 
it out so you're going to have to
disconnect<00:01:33.689> your<00:01:33.869> discharge<00:01:34.530> tubing

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
disconnect your discharge tubing

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.940 
disconnect your discharge tubing
normally<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.930> would<00:01:37.049> have<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.320> cut<00:01:37.590> off<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
normally you would have to cut off the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.109 
normally you would have to cut off the
tube<00:01:38.159> because<00:01:38.340> you're<00:01:38.640> not<00:01:38.729> going<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.969> be<00:01:39.060> able

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
tube because you're not going to be able

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.539 
tube because you're not going to be able
to<00:01:39.390> pull<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> vinyl<00:01:39.990> tube<00:01:40.320> that's<00:01:40.560> been<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:40.890> this

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
to pull a vinyl tube that's been on this

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.340 
to pull a vinyl tube that's been on this
barbed<00:01:41.850> fitting<00:01:42.299> for<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.630> long<00:01:42.810> time<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.289> you

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
barbed fitting for a long time so you

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.770 
barbed fitting for a long time so you
have<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.619> cut<00:01:43.859> that<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.280> then<00:01:44.539> remove<00:01:45.539> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
have to cut that and then remove the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.270 
have to cut that and then remove the
vinyl<00:01:46.109> tube<00:01:46.259> that's<00:01:46.500> stuck<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.070> check

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
vinyl tube that's stuck on the check

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.459 
vinyl tube that's stuck on the check
valve<00:01:47.310> but<00:01:47.789> in<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.509> case<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.109> quarter

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
valve but in this case it's a quarter

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.709 
valve but in this case it's a quarter
turn<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.609> turn<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.880> out<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.570> can

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
turn you just turn it out and you can

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.830
