the other opposite brake pads very easy

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.619 
the other opposite brake pads very easy
to<00:02:25.200> do<00:02:25.349> so<00:02:26.280> we're<00:02:26.790> gonna<00:02:26.879> do<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.269> and<00:02:27.540> then

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
to do so we're gonna do that and then

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.210 
to do so we're gonna do that and then
we're<00:02:27.810> gonna<00:02:27.900> remove<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.379> carrier<00:02:28.620> assembly

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
we're gonna remove the carrier assembly

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.670 
we're gonna remove the carrier assembly
and<00:02:29.519> pull<00:02:29.819> off<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.120> disc<00:02:30.500> you're<00:02:31.500> going<00:02:31.620> to

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
and pull off the disc you're going to

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.270 
and pull off the disc you're going to
use<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.890> 18<00:02:32.849> millimeter<00:02:33.440> driver<00:02:34.440> now<00:02:34.709> six-point

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
use a 18 millimeter driver now six-point

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.149 
use a 18 millimeter driver now six-point
driver<00:02:35.489> to<00:02:35.879> remove<00:02:36.379> two<00:02:37.379> bolts<00:02:37.890> from<00:02:38.069> the

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
driver to remove two bolts from the

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.610 
driver to remove two bolts from the
caliper<00:02:38.640> carrier<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:40.109> you'll<00:02:40.260> take<00:02:40.409> those

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
caliper carrier and so you'll take those

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.680 
caliper carrier and so you'll take those
off<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.159> then<00:02:41.959> you're<00:02:42.959> gonna<00:02:43.049> remove<00:02:43.439> one

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
off and then you're gonna remove one

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.680 
off and then you're gonna remove one
posi<00:02:45.690> drive<00:02:46.049> or<00:02:46.349> phillips<00:02:46.709> type<00:02:46.920> screw<00:02:47.400> on<00:02:47.730> the

posi drive or phillips type screw on the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.750 
posi drive or phillips type screw on the
disc<00:02:49.230> assembly<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:49.920> then<00:02:50.310> hopefully

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
disc assembly and then hopefully

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.089 
disc assembly and then hopefully
everything<00:02:51.000> will<00:02:51.060> come<00:02:51.269> loose<00:02:51.680> okay<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:52.739> right

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
everything will come loose okay so right

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.599 
everything will come loose okay so right
now<00:02:53.310> we're<00:02:53.609> going<00:02:53.849> to<00:02:54.209> clean<00:02:54.629> up<00:02:54.659> this

that<00:03:03.959> we'll<00:03:04.109> have<00:03:04.139> to<00:03:05.120> release<00:03:06.120> some<00:03:06.359> pressure

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
that we'll have to release some pressure

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.319 
that we'll have to release some pressure
and<00:03:07.650> we<00:03:07.829> have<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.040> use<00:03:08.159> a<00:03:08.190> special<00:03:08.639> kit<00:03:08.909> so<00:03:09.180> when

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.920 
that and then we'll be ready to start
assembly<00:03:50.639> we've<00:03:51.480> now<00:03:51.690> installed<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.609> disc

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
assembly we've now installed the disc

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.059 
assembly we've now installed the disc
itself<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:56.090> we<00:03:57.090> just<00:03:57.359> snugged<00:03:58.139> the<00:03:58.470> screw<00:03:58.889> and

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
itself and we just snugged the screw and

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.640 
itself and we just snugged the screw and
roll<00:03:59.310> good<00:03:59.669> and<00:03:59.819> snug<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:01.079> kit<00:04:01.290> came<00:04:01.440> with<00:04:01.500> a

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
roll good and snug the kit came with a

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.259 
roll good and snug the kit came with a
new<00:04:01.889> screw<00:04:02.159> but<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.400> was<00:04:02.489> too<00:04:02.639> long<00:04:02.819> so<00:04:02.879> we<00:04:03.150> use

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
new screw but it was too long so we use

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.849 
new screw but it was too long so we use
the<00:04:03.329> old<00:04:03.449> screw<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:03.989> put<00:04:04.199> some<00:04:04.409> low<00:04:04.560> strength

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
the old screw and put some low strength

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.309 
the old screw and put some low strength
Loctite<00:04:05.310> on<00:04:05.459> it<00:04:05.639> and<00:04:05.790> then<00:04:06.720> we<00:04:06.840> installed<00:04:07.199> the

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
Loctite on it and then we installed the

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.509 
Loctite on it and then we installed the
carrier<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.919> we're<00:04:08.129> getting<00:04:08.310> ready<00:04:08.370> to

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
carrier and we're getting ready to

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.069 
carrier and we're getting ready to
torque<00:04:08.849> it<00:04:09.000> and<00:04:09.180> I'll<00:04:09.389> give<00:04:09.540> you<00:04:09.629> those<00:04:09.750> torque

get 92 foot-pounds of
Tork<00:04:26.169> and<00:04:27.169> that<00:04:27.650> should<00:04:27.830> be<00:04:27.919> about<00:04:28.099> everything

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
Tork and that should be about everything

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.959 
Tork and that should be about everything
and<00:04:29.409> I'll<00:04:30.409> show<00:04:30.650> you<00:04:30.740> how<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:30.949> spring<00:04:31.460> goes<00:04:31.729> on

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:31.969 
and I'll show you how the spring goes on

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:36.070 
and I'll show you how the spring goes on
here<00:04:32.650> see<00:04:33.650> how<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.770> spring<00:04:34.159> is<00:04:34.310> located<00:04:35.080> so

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
here see how the spring is located so

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.679 
here see how the spring is located so
that<00:04:36.289> you<00:04:36.439> can<00:04:36.740> put<00:04:37.219> that<00:04:37.370> back<00:04:37.430> on<00:04:37.639> I'll<00:04:38.569> get

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:38.689 
that you can put that back on I'll get

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:40.719 
that you can put that back on I'll get
it<00:04:38.810> from<00:04:38.900> a<00:04:38.990> different<00:04:39.169> angle<00:04:39.409> okay<00:04:40.340> so<00:04:40.400> here's

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
it from a different angle okay so here's

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.279 
it from a different angle okay so here's
the<00:04:40.819> anti-rattle<00:04:41.270> spring<00:04:41.719> but<00:04:41.960> from<00:04:42.199> a

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
the anti-rattle spring but from a

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:43.719 
the anti-rattle spring but from a
different<00:04:42.469> angle<00:04:42.710> and<00:04:43.099> you<00:04:43.219> can<00:04:43.370> see<00:04:43.520> how<00:04:43.610> it

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
different angle and you can see how it

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.659 
different angle and you can see how it
goes<00:04:43.909> on<00:04:44.530> so<00:04:45.530> basically<00:04:45.919> this<00:04:46.189> side<00:04:46.430> is<00:04:46.639> done

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
goes on so basically this side is done

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.189 
goes on so basically this side is done
except<00:04:47.120> for<00:04:47.150> putting<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:47.509> wheel<00:04:47.659> on<00:04:47.900> and

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
except for putting the wheel on and

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:49.809 
except for putting the wheel on and
we're<00:04:48.469> going<00:04:48.620> to<00:04:48.680> do<00:04:49.009> the<00:04:49.129> other<00:04:49.250> side<00:04:49.520> and

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:49.819 
we're going to do the other side and

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:50.920 
we're going to do the other side and
that'll<00:04:50.000> take<00:04:50.210> care<00:04:50.240> of<00:04:50.389> the<00:04:50.479> front<00:04:50.599> brakes

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
that'll take care of the front brakes

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.050 
that'll take care of the front brakes
one<00:04:51.860> more<00:04:52.009> thing<00:04:52.189> I<00:04:52.250> wanted<00:04:52.430> to<00:04:52.490> mention<00:04:52.639> is

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
when you put these covers on there's a

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:57.640 
when you put these covers on there's a
picture<00:04:56.120> of<00:04:56.270> where<00:04:56.539> the<00:04:56.629> valve<00:04:56.810> stem<00:04:57.110> goes<00:04:57.379> on

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
picture of where the valve stem goes on

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.649 
picture of where the valve stem goes on
the<00:04:57.800> cover<00:04:57.979> and<00:04:58.699> if<00:04:59.090> you<00:04:59.150> don't<00:04:59.300> put<00:04:59.449> them<00:04:59.569> on

right they get damaged you'll see
there's<00:05:01.400> some<00:05:01.520> damage<00:05:01.909> on<00:05:02.180> that<00:05:02.210> one<00:05:02.539> where

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
there's some damage on that one where

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.339 
there's some damage on that one where
the<00:05:04.310> tire<00:05:04.520> shop<00:05:04.550> didn't<00:05:05.090> put<00:05:05.240> it<00:05:05.330> on<00:05:05.449> right<00:05:05.689> it
