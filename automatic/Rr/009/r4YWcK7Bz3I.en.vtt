00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.980
 Hi everyone, guys are welcome 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.100
 This brand new video is here today 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.780
 with a pip in with new character 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.670
 of the architect in the giggs we are here with 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.640
 lance black to see it tested 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.150
 explain to you all the shoes that will come 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.890
 my what is so much about the banner 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.410
 let's see jing if we go and tell 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.260
 immediately what it is is one of carrie that 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.770
 which he presses very strongly is similar to 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.670
 tristana for some cases we say that 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.380
 it's a mix 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:44.360
 I saw a little bit of everything is tired cdx 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.700
 some of us anyway let's start 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.220
 immediately explaining the skills then 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.740
 passive is that it is called meanwhile that 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.650
 emotion every time we destroy 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.399
 a tower or kill an enemy now 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:01.220
 I show 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:03.530
 we earn a bonus taxi movement 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.180
 speed for four seconds really 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.159
 high look see our bonus 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.820
 spit that will gradually be decaying 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.590
 we say that it is very useful to escape and 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.560
 maybe give the last shots the turret 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.720
 and fifth can leave or maybe but 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.030
 let's say even though I think it's more useful 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.810
 to escape maybe we can give a 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.770
 last enemy blow run away fast 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.970
 and the cure instead is we will have two 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.470
 possibility 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.899
 as you can see now we have a gating if 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.840
 we hope with the glasses we will appear 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.590
 above the stacks those states 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.289
 they will be used to increase the atac spit 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.560
 of 90 percent of 50 percent to 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.720
 little more we go more obviously 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.950
 expeed we will earn you see in so much more 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:58.039
 look at that floor look at the 92 111 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.270
 we have so many attacks pitt bonus instead 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:05.299
 if we press, we change, we change 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.189
 weapon and let's go with the rocket launcher 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.799
 rocket launcher instead shoot as you can 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.799
 see rays that consume at the level 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:16.270
 1 20 manna per radio make a small one 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:19.030
 giving away and for today 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.800
 less atac speed than the others 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.750
 let's say these are rocket launchers 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.100
 it would be useful to create the big ones 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.000
 millions of which vwd other than you do 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.800
 the futur who is really fast 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.190
 a zap scheme 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.770
 and we launch an electric plug like 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.120
 written here on shot and net on the back 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:42.370
 a stopper will threaten an electric strike 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.970
 that on the water and makes us see enemy if 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.770
 now enter the bush to provide us it 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.950
 let's see we don't see it let's launch a 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.770
 tap here to do it we see it does us 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.480
 see where it is and do the good ones give me the 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.010
 cool they gave is really 8 in fact I think 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.040
 that this one was written in bra max 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.740
 adler first you see it slows down a lot 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.030
 also and makes us invisible to the cilento and does 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.980
 really a lot of damage and on that that 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.800
 this one was a good skin in here 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.900
 good dodging space instead she is like 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.720
 one of zisis elected in we are three 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.370
 our copies on the ground like traps and 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.110
 if the enemy is trampled on, he overcomes 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.200
 Rossoneri have little to do 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.180
 1.5 seconds you see trapped and makes us 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.450
 a small doctor's 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:35.830
 wertheimer the r instead is called super 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:38.170
 mega rocket of death at 87 seconds 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.350
 cooldown is not there is not even so much e 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.920
 we hope for a rocket that has all the 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:47.320
 city ta of the map and pat years in base 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.740
 at the speed that the rocket has reached 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.540
 that reaches her after so long and years 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.990
 to the missing health in the entrance to us 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:00.190
 we will hit angel you see how much ours 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:04.360
 the colored that destroyed part this 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.760
 skill the yes of the damage that I really am 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.650
 huge and also useful to finish a 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.720
 enemy or throw a vehicle at him 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.420
 melee since if we have enemies 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.030
 close when he hits an opponent 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:19.209
 will spread eighty percent of the damage 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.250
 who did everything around it 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.840
 thus striking also affecting all 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.720
 enemies and maybe making the top only 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.360
 at home anyway guys for this video 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:33.740
 it's all i showed you just giggs 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.870
 will obviously come out on the officer vi 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:40.360
 I will also do a nice video review of 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:43.910
 this chocolate as the entity calls it 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.030
 so from pay there is everything we see 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.690
 tomorrow maybe with a review of a 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:56.110
 character they kill me and from this 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.110
 video is all good bye then
