I thought might as well anyway though uh

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.910 
I thought might as well anyway though uh
some<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:12.480> older<00:00:12.780> news<00:00:12.960> but<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.679> was

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
some of this is older news but I was

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.320 
some of this is older news but I was
figuring<00:00:14.280> maybe<00:00:14.519> there<00:00:14.969> are<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> few<00:00:15.179> people

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
figuring maybe there are a few people

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.640 
figuring maybe there are a few people
out<00:00:15.599> there<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.929> haven't<00:00:16.170> heard<00:00:16.320> about<00:00:16.500> this
