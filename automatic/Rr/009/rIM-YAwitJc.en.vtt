00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello everyone from antonietta welcome 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.450
 in my kitchen 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.950
 today we prepare therefore full with 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.950
 potato side dish 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:23.570
 ingredients 4 artichokes 100 grams of 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:28.880
 garlic minced bread grated meat 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:33.760
 parsley grated cheese 25 g of 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:37.210
 parmesan 25 grams of pecorino a man 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:41.540
 milk salt extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:46.489
 pepper to the side the two potatoes 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:52.899
 the first thing to cut off the stems we pull out 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.899
 away a bit of leaves like that 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.550
 let's put a finger so that it must remain the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.550
 snippet 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.760
 otherwise we vote for all the artichokes 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.860
 let's keep our finger like this 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.200
 cut off at the top 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.570
 we have to let the leaves say more 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.820
 to keep 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.450
 when they are cleaned today they are tinged 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.450
 of alliances you have to try to open them 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.450
 future 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:36.620
 and clean them in this way because there is the 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:41.000
 Mom, let's take this away 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:43.220
 greenish which is a little hard so it is too 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.280
 worthwhile I recommend that they have had 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.450
 obliges all the artichoke is here I already have it 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.240
 clean let's go and put some water e 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:56.479
 lemon and otherwise donate and become 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.259
 let us proceed with the others until 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:03.190
 we have finished cleaning them all 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:07.490
 we await the first stages we say 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:11.260
 after the Italian to big tocchetti that 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:17.380
 they must be cooked together with artichokes 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:20.720
 meanwhile we prepare the filling the mince 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:26.200
 grated bread enough after 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:29.920
 we see martino a man is enough 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.920
 instead flight 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:40.470
 a crushed clove of garlic 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.630
 crush cut so it stays inside the 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.630
 freedom of the cut and piano 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:03:13.099
 so it is enough pepper cheese 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:16.940
 grated a pinch of salt and a little 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:21.260
 milk should be enough 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:27.709
 soft mix everything well 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:29.599
 so it must not be in future 3 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:34.730
 low modeling game because we have to 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:38.410
 we have to fill the artichokes 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:44.079
 let the artichokes taste let's see 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.079
 how the salts go is fine 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:54.330
 and we're going to fill them 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.330
 this song is put inside 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.190
 we have so 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.300
 after filling it well we put it 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:11.540
 so in the straight casserole mi 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.600
 I recommend if you are not straight we pay a 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.489
 piece of gabetto still to do it 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.959
 feel good leaning because he has to 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.959
 cook it on TV 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.050
 over there we are fine with the hand there 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:28.220
 we help with the hand thus adjusting them 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:31.640
 well with potatoes together and legs like that 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:35.110
 the potatoes take the taste of the artichoke 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:45.040
 we also put them together with grammy 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:45.040
 then we make mistake we put the oil 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.920
 and again a pinch of salt for the salt 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:02.970
 potatoes especially then we put it that way 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:06.360
 so no on the filling is that already tasty 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.360
 just a little bit 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:14.560
 the glass of water we cover that 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.310
 we always cook in the color 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.310
 mezz'oretta 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.010
 twenty-five minutes have now passed 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:34.630
 already Christ course she the covered seats e 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:38.410
 water so he raised the stove and the 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:41.820
 let it dry well, it should remain little 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:46.960
 brodino not dead a brodino the change 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:49.500
 let's put on the stuffing stuffed flavor 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.500
 better 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:05.270
