 production 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.290
 however alone without state help 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.750
 make it unlikely to turn out a

 breeding fish two years ago 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.860
 production established near the village 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.680
 temirgoi Kumtorkalinsky district took in

 renting 25 hectares of land from the agricultural company chok 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.180

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.820
 who attracted but entrepreneurs it 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.550
 didn't stop the place with cleared created 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.899
 several ponds and work boiled over 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.000
 now at the factory goes 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.420
 forming uterine flock biology 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.550
 Russian sturgeon in 2013 already 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.770
 noted in the maturation of the first individuals 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.899
 Russian sturgeon so in the coming years 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.449
 we can refuse to purchase 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.750
 planting material in other regions 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.070
 The main goal of our factory is 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.790
 productive formation broodstocks 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.939
 especially valuable species of fish is sturgeon and in 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.930
 immediate prospects we also have plans 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.210
 forming uterine 100 species 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.540

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.290
 two by two meters constantly hits 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.570
 clean water then as waste 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.119
 the material is piped when the fish 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.630
 pick up 30 50 grams and and translates into 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.610
 satka 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.759

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.920
 further each instance has its own 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.020
 fate here please this and then

 This item is a nasal septum anomaly 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.230
 here we are probably leaving our bodies 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.100
 the horse is complete 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.930
 one of the main activities 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.510
 plant reproduction aquatic 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.020
 kospi bioresources they fight it 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.230
 release of life in such fry so in 2010 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.670
 sent to sea free swimming 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.979
 200,000 3 g young 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.900

 release another 100,000 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.000
 completely free and without compensation 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.160
 did not receive money for the implementation of the 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.650
 the project as a whole today and the desire 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.080
 expand production but look like it 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.100
 we will have to find the means ourselves 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.000
 little by little 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.069
 we want to work now understand 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.890
 reproduction goes 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:38.079
 cultivation based and ready but also not 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:43.389

 280 million business plan if for 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.650
 this need state subsidy 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.749
 help but if it doesn't work out with us 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.969
 also slowly expanding it 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:06.280
 your capabilities with your bodies 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:08.620

 business to expand if we need 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.790
 the land is still to create cascades ponds 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.879
 We want to create ponds so that even more 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.750
 means to run the fish there and create 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:33.879
 also jobs natural and 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.069

 artificial reefs for growing 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.259
 clam water filtering benefit from these 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.569
 small creatures as scientists proved 

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:48.939
 a huge one can per day 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.620
 cleans up to 5 liters of water on all this 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.959
