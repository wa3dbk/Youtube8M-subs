been<00:00:30.720> shifted<00:00:31.199> right<00:00:31.349> above<00:00:31.710> zero<00:00:32.219> read<00:00:32.399> about

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
been shifted right above zero read about

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.639 
been shifted right above zero read about
the<00:00:32.759> keyboard<00:00:33.149> okay<00:00:33.510> because<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.380> want<00:00:34.590> to

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
the keyboard okay because we want to

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.740 
the keyboard okay because we want to
bring<00:00:34.829> touch<00:00:35.130> closer<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.790> customer<00:00:36.210> so
