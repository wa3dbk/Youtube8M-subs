can<00:04:29.870> do<00:04:30.340> and<00:04:32.020> just<00:04:33.020> do<00:04:33.199> this<00:04:35.440> I'm<00:04:36.440> going

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
can do and just do this I'm going

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.960 
can do and just do this I'm going
to<00:04:36.620> show<00:04:36.740> you<00:04:36.770> about<00:04:36.889> how<00:04:37.099> much<00:04:37.250> actually<00:04:37.639> go

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
to show you about how much actually go

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:50.250 
to show you about how much actually go
up<00:04:43.810> let's<00:04:44.810> go<00:04:44.930> is<00:04:44.990> dead

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.640

it<00:04:54.650> also<00:04:54.770> depends<00:04:55.100> on<00:04:55.190> how<00:04:55.250> many<00:04:55.400> monsters

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
it also depends on how many monsters

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.450 
it also depends on how many monsters
spawn<00:04:56.060> at<00:04:56.300> certain<00:04:56.870> times<00:04:57.080> for<00:04:57.260> me<00:04:57.460> my

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150

common debris falling as well so you can

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.360 
common debris falling as well so you can
you<00:05:24.680> can<00:05:25.570> farm<00:05:26.570> those<00:05:26.840> as<00:05:26.990> well<00:05:27.170> from<00:05:27.350> here<00:05:27.650> I

you can farm those as well from here I

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.760 
you can farm those as well from here I
still<00:05:29.300> don't<00:05:29.420> get<00:05:29.480> any<00:05:29.630> legendaries<00:05:30.080> on<00:05:30.590> this

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
still don't get any legendaries on this

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.380 
still don't get any legendaries on this
run<00:05:30.950> so<00:05:30.980> I'm<00:05:31.400> not<00:05:31.610> sure<00:05:31.670> what's<00:05:32.030> dodging<00:05:32.300> the

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
run so I'm not sure what's dodging the

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.200 
run so I'm not sure what's dodging the
drop<00:05:32.690> here<00:05:33.530> we<00:05:33.590> go<00:05:33.740> to<00:05:34.310> grading<00:05:34.610> chest<00:05:34.910> as<00:05:35.060> were

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
drop here we go to grading chest as were

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.830 
drop here we go to grading chest as were
again<00:05:36.310> and<00:05:37.310> get<00:05:37.490> some<00:05:37.640> get<00:05:38.000> those<00:05:38.210> items<00:05:38.390> and

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
again and get some get those items and

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.930 
again and get some get those items and
there<00:05:39.230> you<00:05:39.320> go<00:05:39.470> and<00:05:40.010> you<00:05:40.400> just<00:05:40.580> rinse<00:05:40.790> and

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
there you go and you just rinse and

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.670 
there you go and you just rinse and
repeat<00:05:41.210> that<00:05:41.390> and<00:05:41.600> as<00:05:41.930> you<00:05:42.050> can<00:05:42.170> see<00:05:42.230> I<00:05:42.410> just

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
repeat that and as you can see I just

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.890 
repeat that and as you can see I just
went<00:05:42.830> up<00:05:42.950> by<00:05:43.070> two<00:05:43.130> bars<00:05:43.490> again<00:05:43.760> or<00:05:43.940> or<00:05:44.540> one<00:05:44.780> and

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
went up by two bars again or or one and

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.800 
went up by two bars again or or one and
a<00:05:44.990> half<00:05:45.140> so<00:05:45.700> this<00:05:46.700> is<00:05:46.820> the<00:05:46.910> fastest<00:05:47.300> way<00:05:47.480> of

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
a half so this is the fastest way of

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.870 
a half so this is the fastest way of
course<00:05:48.050> you<00:05:48.260> can<00:05:48.410> can<00:05:48.560> enhance<00:05:48.980> your<00:05:49.100> XP<00:05:49.640> per

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
course you can can enhance your XP per

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.510 
course you can can enhance your XP per
per<00:05:50.600> hour<00:05:50.750> if<00:05:51.050> you<00:05:51.200> put<00:05:51.500> all<00:05:51.680> if<00:05:52.010> you<00:05:52.100> slap<00:05:52.370> on

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
per hour if you put all if you slap on

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.060 
per hour if you put all if you slap on
like<00:05:52.700> hellfire<00:05:53.600> ring<00:05:53.840> or<00:05:54.080> cane<00:05:54.350> set<00:05:54.710> maybe<00:05:54.950> a

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
like hellfire ring or cane set maybe a

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.580 
like hellfire ring or cane set maybe a
good<00:05:55.580> King<00:05:55.820> set<00:05:56.120> would<00:05:56.720> help<00:05:56.990> although<00:05:57.470> I'm

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
good King set would help although I'm

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.030 
good King set would help although I'm
not<00:05:57.770> sure<00:05:58.010> how<00:05:58.430> that<00:05:58.460> will<00:05:58.670> work<00:05:59.770> some<00:06:00.770> people

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 
not sure how that will work some people

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.220 
not sure how that will work some people
are<00:06:01.220> actually<00:06:01.310> good<00:06:01.610> enough<00:06:01.700> a<00:06:02.050> good<00:06:03.050> way<00:06:03.170> to

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
are actually good enough a good way to

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.230 
are actually good enough a good way to
do<00:06:03.470> as<00:06:03.650> well<00:06:03.830> is<00:06:04.070> if<00:06:04.310> you<00:06:04.460> have<00:06:04.580> four<00:06:04.910> peoples

do as well is if you have four peoples
in<00:06:05.330> the<00:06:05.390> party<00:06:06.580> then<00:06:07.580> there's<00:06:08.480> much<00:06:08.690> more<00:06:08.870> XP

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
in the party then there's much more XP
