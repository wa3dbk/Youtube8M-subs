00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 a question if cartoon network is in 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.440
 spanish network of cartoons someone me 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.200
 can explain why the fuck they do 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.969
 Fuck life exxon that neither the case seriously 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.130
 I do not know what the directors of the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.109
 channel in the head and we are improving 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.630
 little by little putting more and more 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.640
 good series and suddenly we get out with 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.619
 kamen rider the dragon knights the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.510
 which was not so bad but did not have the same 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.029
 nothing to do in the cartoon network 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.460
 I think this was in early 2010 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.289
 then they put the guy from 8 and the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.300
 chapulÃ­n colorado 'which are 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.579
 excellent but in my opinion not 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.500
 They should be in cartoon network but 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.260
 everything went to the cock with that shit of 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.570
 secret secondary I say the series was a 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.480
 fucking failure in his native country and the very 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.700
 fuckers bring them here what would happen and 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.710
 destroy build destroy never saw them 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.930
 but if they were removed from the programming 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.239
 They must have been well shit for 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.820
 have removed them afterwards comes a 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.739
 shit series called mystery which 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.199
 It's a Canadian series of very bad 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.940
 quality and in August of this year we 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.589
 they brought the worst they could have 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.510
 made the bastards 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.880
 the cecu was released and had a story 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.760
 high audiences for the simple fact of 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.710
 that they passed it about nine times a day 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.810
 opaque series that in themselves had a 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.030
 even higher audience and that they were 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.400
 passed by an almost inaccessible schedule 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.740
 but they still had more audience than 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.920
 this shit now we're all happy 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.450
 because they only pass it twice a day and 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.210
 you see the series no longer has audience 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.460
 high ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha but 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.590
 recently an abomination called 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.510
 level to fuck I do not know why like the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.310
 cartoon network weones are not given 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.290
 realize that nobody cares 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.600
 he cumin his live exxon and that thanks to 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.820
 that has lost thousands of followers the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.979
 truth is that if cartoon network follows 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.680
 with this stupidity in about two years it 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.690
 is going to turn into a zombie espn2 fuck 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.000
 they do not bring us back to all nani and the 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.680
 very snotty bring us that thing leaves the 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.200
 gamers like if someone is interested 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.060
 watch sports and music in a channel 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.979
 supposed to be for cartoons so 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.250
 cartoon networks for me you can go to 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.250
 the shit
