that<00:01:48.700> I<00:01:49.000> should<00:01:49.750> focus<00:01:49.990> on<00:01:50.259> like<00:01:50.409> having<00:01:50.590> it

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
that I should focus on like having it

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.740 
that I should focus on like having it
better<00:01:50.979> negative<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:51.670> even<00:01:51.939> like<00:01:52.060> get<00:01:52.420> more

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750

sense<00:02:02.649> I<00:02:02.740> did<00:02:03.069> five<00:02:03.280> sets<00:02:03.490> of<00:02:03.580> seven<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:04.119> get<00:02:04.240> my

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
sense I did five sets of seven to get my

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.090 
sense I did five sets of seven to get my
35<00:02:04.720> reps<00:02:04.960> at<00:02:05.200> seventy<00:02:05.649> seven<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.009> a<00:02:06.069> half

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
35 reps at seventy seven and a half

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.719 
35 reps at seventy seven and a half
pounds<00:02:06.399> and<00:02:06.789> I<00:02:07.539> did<00:02:07.690> these<00:02:07.780> all<00:02:08.019> belt<00:02:08.259> lifts<00:02:08.560> I

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
pounds and I did these all belt lifts I

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.979 
pounds and I did these all belt lifts I
don't<00:02:09.729> have<00:02:09.819> a<00:02:09.880> consistent<00:02:10.450> method<00:02:10.600> of<00:02:10.869> doing

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
don't have a consistent method of doing

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.880 
don't have a consistent method of doing
it<00:02:11.230> but<00:02:11.470> today<00:02:11.739> I<00:02:11.769> decided<00:02:12.069> to<00:02:12.190> go<00:02:12.370> beltless

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
it but today I decided to go beltless

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.020 
it but today I decided to go beltless
whenever<00:02:14.890> I<00:02:14.980> go<00:02:15.519> for<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.950> higher<00:02:18.030> higher

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
whenever I go for a higher higher

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.699 
whenever I go for a higher higher
intensity<00:02:19.690> so<00:02:19.840> like<00:02:19.959> if<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.200> go<00:02:20.350> for<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.560> heavy

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
intensity so like if I go for a heavy

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.860 
intensity so like if I go for a heavy
single<00:02:21.130> or<00:02:21.250> double<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.730> probably<00:02:22.299> will<00:02:22.600> throw

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
single or double I probably will throw

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.440 
single or double I probably will throw
on<00:02:22.959> a<00:02:23.019> belt<00:02:23.580> but<00:02:24.580> this<00:02:24.790> movement<00:02:25.120> still<00:02:25.239> new<00:02:25.420> to

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
on a belt but this movement still new to

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.809 
on a belt but this movement still new to
me<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:25.840> think<00:02:26.049> going<00:02:26.650> without<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.280> belt<00:02:27.549> will

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
me and I think going without a belt will

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.610 
me and I think going without a belt will
will<00:02:28.180> help<00:02:28.269> me<00:02:28.450> in<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.540> long<00:02:28.600> run<00:02:28.989> and<00:02:29.319> like

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
will help me in the long run and like

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.750 
will help me in the long run and like
focus<00:02:30.370> on<00:02:30.489> my<00:02:30.609> core<00:02:31.239> strength<00:02:32.340> then<00:02:33.340> for<00:02:33.670> my

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
focus on my core strength then for my

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.849 
focus on my core strength then for my
bra<00:02:33.970> stuff<00:02:34.269> I<00:02:34.480> went<00:02:34.690> on<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:35.019> do<00:02:35.200> three<00:02:35.530> sets<00:02:35.680> of

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
bra stuff I went on to do three sets of

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.970 
bra stuff I went on to do three sets of
twelve<00:02:36.160> dips<00:02:36.810> I've<00:02:37.810> been<00:02:38.170> trying<00:02:38.920> to

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
twelve dips I've been trying to

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.970 
twelve dips I've been trying to
incorporate<00:02:39.280> well<00:02:39.850> I've<00:02:40.060> been<00:02:40.329> definitely

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
incorporate well I've been definitely

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.099 
incorporate well I've been definitely
incorporating<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.070> lot<00:02:42.220> of<00:02:42.340> dips<00:02:42.549> and<00:02:42.840> push<00:02:43.840> the

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
incorporating a lot of dips and push the

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:46.650 
incorporating a lot of dips and push the
pull-ups<00:02:45.010> in<00:02:45.220> my<00:02:45.640> programming<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:46.359> think<00:02:46.570> it's

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
pull-ups in my programming I think it's

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.479 
pull-ups in my programming I think it's
just<00:02:46.840> good<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.470> have<00:02:47.769> general<00:02:48.420> basic<00:02:49.420> strength

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
just good to have general basic strength

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.880 
just good to have general basic strength
and<00:02:51.489> those<00:02:51.970> are<00:02:52.150> two<00:02:52.420> like<00:02:53.140> very<00:02:53.650> basic

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
and those are two like very basic

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.650 
and those are two like very basic
movements<00:02:54.489> and<00:02:54.640> I<00:02:54.670> think<00:02:54.850> everyone<00:02:55.390> should<00:02:55.420> be

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
movements and I think everyone should be

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.449 
movements and I think everyone should be
able<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.840> do<00:02:56.019> so<00:02:56.530> it's<00:02:56.920> good<00:02:57.100> that<00:02:57.220> I'm<00:02:57.310> keeping

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
able to do so it's good that I'm keeping

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.789 
able to do so it's good that I'm keeping
those<00:02:57.790> in<00:02:58.239> my<00:02:58.660> program<00:02:59.019> and<00:02:59.200> that's<00:02:59.350> like<00:02:59.769> a

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
those in my program and that's like a

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.940 
those in my program and that's like a
great<00:03:00.190> assistance<00:03:00.760> for<00:03:01.390> for<00:03:02.380> benching

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
great assistance for for benching

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:03.700 
great assistance for for benching
because

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
because

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.630 
because
I'm<00:03:03.860> trying<00:03:04.220> it's<00:03:04.580> strong<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:07.010> then<00:03:07.220> I<00:03:07.250> moved

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
I'm trying it's strong and then I moved

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.820 
I'm trying it's strong and then I moved
on<00:03:07.820> to<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.270> hammer<00:03:08.480> strength<00:03:08.810> incline<00:03:09.320> press

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
on to the hammer strength incline press

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.230 
on to the hammer strength incline press
I<00:03:10.070> don't<00:03:10.220> normally<00:03:10.400> do<00:03:10.730> this<00:03:10.790> but<00:03:10.940> I<00:03:11.150> think

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
I don't normally do this but I think

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.890 
I don't normally do this but I think
it's<00:03:11.480> good

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
it's good

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.110 
it's good
a<00:03:11.950> secondary<00:03:12.950> assistance<00:03:13.460> for<00:03:13.730> some<00:03:13.880> extra

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
a secondary assistance for some extra

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.630 
a secondary assistance for some extra
Braille<00:03:14.360> stuff<00:03:14.660> I<00:03:14.870> then<00:03:15.380> did<00:03:15.680> superset<00:03:16.490> those

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
Braille stuff I then did superset those

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.840 
Braille stuff I then did superset those
with<00:03:16.850> tricep<00:03:17.390> extensions<00:03:18.320> and<00:03:18.740> then<00:03:19.610> I<00:03:19.640> did

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
with tricep extensions and then I did

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.080 
with tricep extensions and then I did
some<00:03:20.000> biceps<00:03:20.360> so<00:03:20.920> for<00:03:21.920> me<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.040> bicep<00:03:22.580> curl<00:03:22.610> is

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
some biceps so for me a bicep curl is

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.510 
some biceps so for me a bicep curl is
one<00:03:24.050> of<00:03:24.200> my<00:03:24.320> favorite<00:03:24.710> things<00:03:24.890> to<00:03:25.010> do<00:03:25.100> I<00:03:25.130> just

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
one of my favorite things to do I just

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.690 
one of my favorite things to do I just
think<00:03:25.700> generally<00:03:26.090> it's<00:03:26.210> a<00:03:26.450> lot<00:03:26.900> of<00:03:27.050> fun<00:03:27.260> and

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
think generally it's a lot of fun and

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.960 
think generally it's a lot of fun and
also<00:03:28.840> just<00:03:29.840> having<00:03:30.200> defined<00:03:30.920> arms<00:03:31.580> and<00:03:31.820> a

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
also just having defined arms and a

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.060 
also just having defined arms and a
little<00:03:32.180> bit<00:03:32.300> of<00:03:32.390> a<00:03:32.450> bicep<00:03:32.810> pump<00:03:33.050> honestly<00:03:33.950> it

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
little bit of a bicep pump honestly it

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.830 
little bit of a bicep pump honestly it
really<00:03:34.100> makes<00:03:34.580> me<00:03:34.790> feel<00:03:34.940> pretty<00:03:35.240> and<00:03:35.600> it<00:03:35.690> makes

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
really makes me feel pretty and it makes

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.460 
really makes me feel pretty and it makes
you<00:03:35.930> feel<00:03:36.080> good<00:03:36.230> inside<00:03:36.380> so<00:03:37.220> if<00:03:37.640> I<00:03:37.910> can<00:03:38.180> suggest

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
you feel good inside so if I can suggest

getting<00:03:43.040> into<00:03:43.490> working<00:03:43.970> out<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:45.380> if<00:03:45.530> you<00:03:45.650> find

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
getting into working out and if you find

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.550 
getting into working out and if you find
an<00:03:46.220> exercise<00:03:46.520> that<00:03:46.760> works<00:03:47.600> a<00:03:48.020> certain<00:03:48.410> muscle

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
an exercise that works a certain muscle

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.480 
an exercise that works a certain muscle
that<00:03:49.370> you<00:03:50.090> want<00:03:50.510> to<00:03:50.690> improve<00:03:51.310> for<00:03:52.310> me<00:03:52.460> I

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
that you want to improve for me I

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.010 
that you want to improve for me I
wouldn't<00:03:52.820> mind<00:03:53.030> if<00:03:53.180> my<00:03:53.330> biceps<00:03:53.690> were<00:03:53.840> a<00:03:53.870> little

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
wouldn't mind if my biceps were a little

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.810 
wouldn't mind if my biceps were a little
bit<00:03:54.200> bigger<00:03:54.410> and<00:03:54.800> my<00:03:54.980> shoulder<00:03:55.400> had<00:03:55.550> a<00:03:55.580> little

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
bit bigger and my shoulder had a little

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.940 
bit bigger and my shoulder had a little
