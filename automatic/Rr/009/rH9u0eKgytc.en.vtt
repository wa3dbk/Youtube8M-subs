I'll<00:00:09.420> be<00:00:09.510> going<00:00:09.690> over<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.080> exotic<00:00:10.620> support

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
I'll be going over the exotic support

you're probably wondering what these
things<00:00:12.990> are<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.290> my<00:00:13.380> hand<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:13.769> fact<00:00:14.009> in<00:00:14.130> fact

things are in my hand in fact in fact
these<00:00:14.370> are<00:00:14.429> controllers<00:00:14.969> for<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.540> system<00:00:15.870> for

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
these are controllers for the system for

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.849 
these are controllers for the system for
two<00:00:16.139> different<00:00:16.260> games

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
two different games

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.400 
two different games
the<00:00:17.340> exotic<00:00:17.640> sport<00:00:18.029> came<00:00:18.150> out<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.510> 2004<00:00:19.199> two

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
the exotic sport came out in 2004 two

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.990 
the exotic sport came out in 2004 two
years<00:00:19.590> before<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.100> Tendo<00:00:20.310> we<00:00:20.430> hit<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.670> market

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
years before the Tendo we hit the market

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.540 
years before the Tendo we hit the market
it<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.930> first<00:00:22.230> system<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.800> ever<00:00:23.010> utilize

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
it is the first system to ever utilize

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.240 
it is the first system to ever utilize
full<00:00:24.150> motion<00:00:24.390> control<00:00:24.869> controllers<00:00:25.680> kind<00:00:26.189> of

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
full motion control controllers kind of

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.830 
full motion control controllers kind of
like<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.430> Wii<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.939> Kinect<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.599> Sony

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
like the Wii and Kinect and the Sony

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.080 
like the Wii and Kinect and the Sony
move<00:00:28.080> today<00:00:28.260> obviously<00:00:28.830> there<00:00:29.490> were<00:00:29.580> devices

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
move today obviously there were devices

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.970 
move today obviously there were devices
for<00:00:30.300> other<00:00:30.420> systems<00:00:30.630> prior<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.769> exotic

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
for other systems prior to the exotic

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.770 
for other systems prior to the exotic
sport<00:00:32.369> you've<00:00:32.520> got<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.880> u4<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.510> you've<00:00:33.630> got

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
sport you've got the u4 so you've got

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.630 
sport you've got the u4 so you've got
the<00:00:33.899> power<00:00:34.110> go<00:00:34.320> up<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.559> name<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.770> few<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.190> this

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
the power go up to name a few but this

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.850 
the power go up to name a few but this
is<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.969> first<00:00:36.180> system<00:00:36.450> ever<00:00:36.780> dedicated<00:00:37.410> fully

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
is the first system ever dedicated fully

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.799 
is the first system ever dedicated fully
to<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.820> let's<00:00:38.850> take<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> closer<00:00:39.360> look<00:00:39.540> at<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
to it so let's take a closer look at the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.030 
to it so let's take a closer look at the
exotic<00:00:40.140> sport<00:00:40.410> let's<00:00:40.559> talk<00:00:40.710> about<00:00:40.800> the

exotic sport let's talk about the
history<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.520> system<00:00:41.700> let's<00:00:42.390> show<00:00:42.510> you

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
history of the system let's show you

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.360 
history of the system let's show you
some<00:00:42.780> other<00:00:42.899> controllers<00:00:43.410> I'll<00:00:44.160> show<00:00:44.280> you

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
some other controllers I'll show you

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.299 
some other controllers I'll show you

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
is the exotics tennis starter kit you

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.290 
is the exotics tennis starter kit you
get<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.530> systems<00:00:50.190> I've<00:00:50.579> explored<00:00:51.000> right<00:00:51.180> here

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
get the systems I've explored right here

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.610 
get the systems I've explored right here
this<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.539> about<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> same<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.379> micro

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
this is about the same so this is micro

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.049 
this is about the same so this is micro
sized<00:00:52.829> actual<00:00:53.190> size<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> system<00:00:53.820> it's

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
sized actual size of the system it's

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.520 
sized actual size of the system it's
very<00:00:54.120> small<00:00:54.600> I'll<00:00:55.079> show<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.469> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
very small I'll show you that in a

I<00:01:09.659> believe<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> system<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.439> still<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:10.799> sale

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
I believe the system is still for sale

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.330 
I believe the system is still for sale
you<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.000> go<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.210> exotics<00:01:12.930> combo<00:01:13.650> put<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> link

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340

below<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.970> didn't<00:01:15.390> want<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.570> say<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.840> system<00:01:16.110> is

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
below I didn't want to say the system is

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.260 
below I didn't want to say the system is
not<00:01:16.350> pal<00:01:16.619> compatible<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.369> if<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:18.000> live<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.180> a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
not pal compatible so if you live in a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.160 
not pal compatible so if you live in a
region<00:01:18.390> that's<00:01:18.659> pal

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
region that's pal

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.899 
region that's pal
unfortunately<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.040> will<00:01:20.220> not<00:01:20.340> work<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.640> pal

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
unfortunately this will not work on pal

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.230 
unfortunately this will not work on pal
TVs<00:01:21.540> okay<00:01:21.990> here's<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.830> back<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.880> your

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
TVs okay here's the back this is your

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.330 
TVs okay here's the back this is your
you<00:01:24.540> get<00:01:24.689> screenshots<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.920> tennis<00:01:26.250> game

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
you get screenshots of a tennis game

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.880 
you get screenshots of a tennis game
that<00:01:27.090> comes<00:01:27.210> with<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.750> hey<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.350> graphics<00:01:28.770> are

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
that comes with it hey it's graphics are

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.920 
that comes with it hey it's graphics are
equivalent<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> maybe<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.759> 3do<00:01:30.210> they're

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
equivalent to maybe like a 3do they're

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
very similar to the Wii Fit in fact it's

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.460

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
sponsored to kind of promote it so I

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.940

think<00:02:54.909> Nintendo<00:02:55.150> didn't<00:02:55.780> necessary<00:02:56.019> copy<00:02:56.290> his

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
think Nintendo didn't necessary copy his

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.140 
think Nintendo didn't necessary copy his
Alex<00:02:57.310> but<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.489> definitely<00:02:57.639> think<00:02:57.970> they<00:02:58.060> were

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
Alex but I definitely think they were

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.270 
Alex but I definitely think they were
