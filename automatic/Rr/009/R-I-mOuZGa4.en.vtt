00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.870 
be a couple of job a little bit jumping
about<00:02:02.219> but<00:02:02.369> I'll<00:02:02.430> try<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.579> keep<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.820> as

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
about but I'll try to keep it as

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.639 
about but I'll try to keep it as
straight<00:02:03.420> forward<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.049> can<00:02:04.290> for<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.500> guys

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
watching now the person who submitted

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.320 
watching now the person who submitted
this<00:02:07.229> replay<00:02:07.500> did<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.860> probably<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.520> understand

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
this replay did it probably I understand

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.609 
this replay did it probably I understand
why<00:02:09.479> he<00:02:09.690> did<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:10.020> way<00:02:10.200> but<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.410> makes<00:02:10.530> it

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
why he did it this way but it makes it

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.839 
why he did it this way but it makes it
kind<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.770> difficult<00:02:10.860> for<00:02:11.160> me<00:02:11.250> instead<00:02:11.760> of

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
kind of difficult for me instead of

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.190 
kind of difficult for me instead of
saying<00:02:11.970> how<00:02:12.090> many<00:02:12.270> turns<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.660> use<00:02:12.780> he's<00:02:12.989> put

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
saying how many turns to use he's put

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.790 
saying how many turns to use he's put
how<00:02:13.319> many<00:02:13.349> foreign

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
how many foreign

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.710 
how many foreign
to<00:02:13.920> get<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.730> makes<00:02:15.000> sense<00:02:15.210> because<00:02:15.450> there's

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
to get to it makes sense because there's

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.540 
to get to it makes sense because there's
actually<00:02:15.990> quite<00:02:16.020> an<00:02:16.470> odd<00:02:16.650> number<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:17.070> frame<00:02:17.340> so

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
actually quite an odd number of frame so

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.710 
actually quite an odd number of frame so
I<00:02:17.610> understand<00:02:17.910> why<00:02:18.000> he<00:02:18.060> did<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.330> but<00:02:18.450> I'm<00:02:18.600> gonna

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
I understand why he did it but I'm gonna

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.210 
I understand why he did it but I'm gonna
try<00:02:18.900> my<00:02:18.960> best<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.560> make<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.800> simple<00:02:20.100> so<00:02:20.160> you
