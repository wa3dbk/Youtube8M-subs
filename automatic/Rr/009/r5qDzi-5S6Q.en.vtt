process because we could never get it
quite<00:01:33.570> right<00:01:33.630> because<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> timelines<00:01:34.860> and

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
quite right because of the timelines and

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.260 
quite right because of the timelines and
this<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.640> there's<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.909> few<00:01:36.090> pieces

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
this and that and there's a few pieces

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.609 
this and that and there's a few pieces
that<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.600> wasn't<00:01:36.869> happy<00:01:37.049> with<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:37.380> there's<00:01:37.560> a
