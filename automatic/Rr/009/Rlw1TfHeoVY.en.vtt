00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.880 
sure that's what they're for it looks
like<00:01:37.630> it<00:01:39.899> but<00:01:40.899> we'll<00:01:41.079> watch<00:01:41.259> them<00:01:41.530> go<00:01:41.679> through

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
like it but we'll watch them go through

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.330 
like it but we'll watch them go through
a<00:01:41.950> whole<00:01:42.219> cycle<00:01:42.549> here<00:01:43.829> because<00:01:44.829> I<00:01:44.890> don't<00:01:45.130> think

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
a whole cycle here because I don't think

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.949 
a whole cycle here because I don't think
he<00:01:45.429> lets<00:01:45.670> grass<00:01:45.969> grow<00:01:46.270> under<00:01:46.299> his<00:01:46.599> feet<00:01:46.929> I

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959 
he lets grass grow under his feet I

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:48.599 
he lets grass grow under his feet I
