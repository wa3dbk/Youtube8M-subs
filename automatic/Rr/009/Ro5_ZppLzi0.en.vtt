we're going to click the device we want
get<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.110> location<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.930> we<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.049> go<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.170> map

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
get the location and we can go to map

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.200 
get the location and we can go to map
views<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.979> it's<00:01:35.130> exact<00:01:35.520> if<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.180> a

the system and the key is is to have a

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
system that is not just cost effective

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.470 
system that is not just cost effective
but<00:02:37.379> you<00:02:37.680> cannot<00:02:38.430> look<00:02:38.670> at<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:38.940> as<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.330> much

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
but you cannot look at this as so much

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.930 
but you cannot look at this as so much
cost<00:02:40.049> but<00:02:40.470> an<00:02:40.560> investment<00:02:41.099> we<00:02:41.489> also<00:02:41.670> have

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
cost but an investment we also have

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.240 
cost but an investment we also have
payment<00:02:42.330> reminders<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.230> can<00:02:43.560> alert<00:02:44.069> your

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
payment reminders so you can alert your

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.000 
payment reminders so you can alert your
customers<00:02:44.819> when<00:02:45.390> their<00:02:45.510> payments<00:02:45.840> are<00:02:45.930> due

customers when their payments are due

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.420 
customers when their payments are due
most<00:02:47.010> likely<00:02:47.310> they<00:02:47.430> do<00:02:48.260> but<00:02:49.260> we<00:02:50.040> also<00:02:50.190> have

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
most likely they do but we also have

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.490 
most likely they do but we also have

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
detailed reporting so the reports are

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.069 
detailed reporting so the reports are
going<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.680> allow<00:02:52.829> you<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.040> let<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.940> see<00:02:54.239> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
and what its status was so like on this

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.300 
and what its status was so like on this
one<00:03:00.360> it<00:03:00.510> will<00:03:00.599> show<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:01.319> scheduled<00:03:01.890> check-in

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
one it will show a scheduled check-in

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.789

backup<00:03:09.540> battery<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.110> toe<00:03:10.319> alerts<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:11.310> what

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
backup battery and toe alerts so what

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.009 
backup battery and toe alerts so what
we've<00:03:11.640> done<00:03:11.819> is<00:03:12.060> created<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.510> system<00:03:12.690> where

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
we've done is created a system where

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.300 
we've done is created a system where
it's<00:03:13.230> going<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.500> let<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.769> know<00:03:13.920> when<00:03:14.190> those

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
it's going to let you know when those

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.250 
it's going to let you know when those
things<00:03:14.579> happen<00:03:14.940> so<00:03:15.510> it's<00:03:15.660> great<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:15.989> be<00:03:16.110> able

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
things happen so it's great to be able

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.440 
things happen so it's great to be able
to<00:03:16.410> just<00:03:16.709> go<00:03:16.890> in<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.160> backend<00:03:17.609> and<00:03:17.819> say<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.090> want

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
to just go in the backend and say I want

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.599 
to just go in the backend and say I want
to<00:03:18.510> know<00:03:18.690> when<00:03:19.500> my<00:03:19.650> car<00:03:19.920> has<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.160> low<00:03:20.430> battery

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
to know when my car has a low battery

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.059 
to know when my car has a low battery
it's<00:03:21.150> running<00:03:21.900> off<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.019> backup<00:03:22.530> battery<00:03:22.680> Oh<00:03:22.920> a
