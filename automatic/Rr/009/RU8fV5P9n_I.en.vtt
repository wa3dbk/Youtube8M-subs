00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.320 
and PC review today I'm going to be
showing<00:00:14.349> you<00:00:14.500> guys<00:00:14.559> how<00:00:14.920> to<00:00:15.309> jumpstart<00:00:16.090> your

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
showing you guys how to jumpstart your

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.920 
showing you guys how to jumpstart your
power<00:00:16.779> supply<00:00:17.200> now<00:00:18.300> why<00:00:19.300> would<00:00:19.509> you<00:00:19.540> want<00:00:19.810> to

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
power supply now why would you want to

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.230 
power supply now why would you want to
jumpstart<00:00:20.380> your<00:00:20.439> power<00:00:20.680> supply<00:00:20.830> now<00:00:21.520> it<00:00:22.060> could

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
jumpstart your power supply now it could

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.620 
jumpstart your power supply now it could
range<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:24.039> know<00:00:24.160> it's<00:00:24.310> pretty<00:00:24.520> much<00:00:24.669> so<00:00:25.540> you

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
range you know it's pretty much so you

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.720 
range you know it's pretty much so you
can<00:00:25.779> test<00:00:25.989> the<00:00:26.169> power<00:00:26.349> supply<00:00:26.739> or<00:00:27.369> so<00:00:27.520> you<00:00:27.579> can

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
can test the power supply or so you can

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.249 
can test the power supply or so you can
test<00:00:27.939> some<00:00:28.149> fans<00:00:28.450> or<00:00:29.610> pretty<00:00:30.610> much<00:00:31.259> anything

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
test some fans or pretty much anything

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.880 
test some fans or pretty much anything
you<00:00:33.160> want<00:00:33.370> to<00:00:33.460> do<00:00:33.579> that<00:00:33.850> bypasses<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
you want to do that bypasses the

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.130 
you want to do that bypasses the
connection<00:00:36.370> to<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:36.820> motherboard<00:00:37.090> so<00:00:38.020> that

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
connection to the motherboard so that

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.290 
connection to the motherboard so that
you<00:00:38.260> don't<00:00:38.500> have<00:00:38.649> to<00:00:38.829> actually<00:00:38.980> mount<00:00:39.399> the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
you don't have to actually mount the

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.299 
you don't have to actually mount the
power<00:00:40.480> supply<00:00:41.190> 24<00:00:42.190> or<00:00:42.489> 20<00:00:42.879> pin<00:00:43.260> adapter<00:00:44.260> to<00:00:44.559> the
