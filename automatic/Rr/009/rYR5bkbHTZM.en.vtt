00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.450
 and good to all of us today we are in a new 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:09.290
 video of a new mode that is called mc 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.770
 elite and this is about this 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.799
 guys planes a lot of fighters a few 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.050
 how many helicopters and guys are we 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.990
 man sung although I have some 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.930
 criticism for the behavior the 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.149
 driving and such but good is a 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.180
 gorgeous in the details all for six 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:32.500
 for networks from within 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.400
 and we're going to try it for example I do not know 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.400
 this same 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.890
 that all this 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.000
 I also do not like the shape 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.370
 to enter 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.850
 it takes a specific place now 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.850
 we started 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.590
 white 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.199
 and it is very good 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:07.810
 and press the right click we shoot 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.810
 in a burst 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.540
 I love seeing and I'm going to put 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.140
 I'm going to put more than one 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.430
 but now I'm in survival mode 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.159
 so now what happens if I jump 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.649
 Well, look 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.649
 there parachute 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.159
 it is very well implements many things 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.159
 this way to go back 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:58.400
 around here he has a lot of things but 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.200
 a lot of turrets 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.960
 a lot of now is very serious 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.960
 pimp sting that to destroy them and such 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.000
 ok we have already returned to leave here 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.090
 see you later 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.670
 it's worth criticizing the helicopters to see 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.220
 they are very well made it is true but what 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.280
 that I do not like is your driving we're going to 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.950
 enter looks is conducted just like a 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.090
 plane goes forward only there is no way 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.090
 to go down 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.580
 I do not know 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.900
 it's worth it in minecraft that's what 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.280
 I understand why I think it's a game 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.840
 so very 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.840
 very cubic and hard to do 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.750
 and well it is not, I do not like it much 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.210
 You can also shoot as you see 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.630
 well it's very cool we will understand 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.630
 to land 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.060
 so much in the cool 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.950
 there is not a great variety of both 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.080
 fighters normal and coastal planes 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.870
 It's very good, I hope that I have 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.720
 I will leave you in the description how 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.540
 install it or download it and that is if 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.770
 you want me to upload more mods decided 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.220

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:26.670
