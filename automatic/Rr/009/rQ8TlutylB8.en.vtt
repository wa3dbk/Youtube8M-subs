00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.720
 if I 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.290

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.160
 1 we have fantastic week behind us we have a lot of good ones 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.630
 Things we saw were in Paris he was once before for a highlight 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.929
 of course in Berlin and in clubs 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.890
 we have seen fantastic themes as we find 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.099
 and if you want to fit together a bit, it's probably 3 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.099
 Direction the seven also do not crystallize 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.969
 It is clear that there is a strong trend towards 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.800
 For masculinity so much rusty almost rustic Lux concerns that such a 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.790
 little bit 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.000
 at the ski hit percent campfire Canada so 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.830
 OTB kinda a bit 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.940
 rustic atmosphere Remember a look that is made up of 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.510
 plaid shirts washed a bit of flat that way around Dekker 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.470
 he strives loyally rose Polo was 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.720
 Of course, each of the four washed leather jackets 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.130
 Landwehr leather jacket of course, the shack to them include this the subject in 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.440
 this scenery with into it of course life completely big 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.160
 everything a bit rough Rough a bit pithy 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.370
 This is a very strong for us and also find ways commercially 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.370
 highly interesting development 1 8 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.520
 if I 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.090
 on 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.560
 1 dapd 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.540
 there is one in the second quarter 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.240
 we just want it so much harder. " 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.190
 bit edgier have a bit more aggressive 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.600
 Location the color image is also clear 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.160
 Picture darker in this picture are for us then crisp biker leather jackets 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.450
 of course with rivets strict edged coats so a bit with 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.490
 Some of the military aspects include leather pants and China 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.870
 combat boots 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.220
 depending on how Hartmann would like to have and we also see in this 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.360
 Spectrum all that Dreikorn for example as a young man with 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.620
 very successful 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.710
 No person of the collection so for the suit range turns slimmer 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.719
 make little sense tell fiction nothing 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:16.610
 for the driver 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.610
 receipt 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.209
 on 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.689
 1 remained 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.230
 he really did want it 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.339
 again we find something that has long been considered old and outmoded 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:35.429
 Classics are back 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:37.179
 as a pastor in Milan 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:41.749
 really nice and smart almost well dressed Bubis before the international 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:43.699
 Audience sent 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:46.559
 against a murmur from the project Orion 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:50.279
 and you got the feeling people are in the mood for the war again 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.029
 classically 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:56.149
 Good money is what almost trip leads good taste 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:03:01.649
 By the way, both Prader and Gucci are two brands which are very strong 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:05.409
 as a driving force in the menswear and also in the future 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.069
 have become influential 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.709
 For products I believe everyone somehow quite happy again in the closet 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:12.280
 would have 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.619
 if I have camel experienced short coat 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:19.390
 the stuff percent rose or jersey jacket 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.979
 a bit of free stretch 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:25.019
 Prison percent Honda 2 major to make a password change 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:30.030
 All this has nothing to do with the business-class way 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.649
 that is why it is so interesting and so new because it is 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:37.680
 a lot younger many people are much fresher and it will be one 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.049
 reach new audiences
