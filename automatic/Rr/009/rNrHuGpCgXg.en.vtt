 how to watch TV from both 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.540
 everything started when this school presented

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.380
 implemented with multimedia equipment 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.660
 well of the 14 classrooms 12 have 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.060
 multimedia we are located in the third 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.540
 put the level of metropolitan Lima 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.729
 03 in reading comprehension for children 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.220
 it's like watching TV if they learn more 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.160
 quick and easy also from the 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.820
 differences in baby the child who wants 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.820
 be famous here 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.140
 and the child in bed who can say 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.570
 that once did not also hit the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.759
 math opens these children also the 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:51.210
 learn the problem is that the new 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.210
 born 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.159
 the reading of classes becomes a 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.649
 math exercise where they add up 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.810
 typical and subtraction we work the understanding 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.820
 reader is that upon the arrival of a 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.500
 new baby to the family we have talked 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.580
 to see what a baby needs 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.350
 when just it is doing the basic or 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.080
 they did not themselves chocón cited 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.840
 a bottle and wake rök and as it goes 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.989
 passing the class you are putting together 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.489
 it's clear and it's a debate a child 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.880
 means that cutting 10 soles does not 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.670
 We will check the price little sister 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.390
 of avoids and which he bought a in this 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.340
 coupon and because it costs 45 solids 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.740
 and the children themselves are the ones who leave me 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.569
 the computer for everyone in the class of 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.690
 religion you learn the parable of the 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.690
 talents 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.280
 after having understood the parable 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.380
 that he reads look for the graph that he and his 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.780
 classmates should draw to illustrate 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.660
 the relationship reading has become 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.760
 agile pleasant and actually one is motivated 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.040
 so much that he wanted to admit going 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.319
 writing the six I actually be 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.190
 Enchanted has changed the practice 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:07.140
 pedagogical has changed a lot because the 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.090
 children you see much more motivated the 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.340
 teacher maybe 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.260
 even parents of families and motivated 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.670
 with this new system so that in 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.099
 reality it would not be nor turn on a 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.780
 computer since there was multimedia 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.970
 my son has taught me what he has 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.550
 learned even in school and 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.099
 We are fun meetings and here we go 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.510
 the stage of speech and rely on them 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.519
 the avalanches those who are looking at all 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:35.830
 the things that we are responding from 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:38.020
 the second grade meeting 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.180

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.870
 an alumnus that today is a brand new and 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.870
 excellent 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.319
 today we speak the lord of miracles 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:54.680
 now we see that the blackboard exists 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.690
 acrylic especially in multimedia that is 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.110
 of great help to us the 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:04.750
 teachers to make a dynamic class 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.750
 in the 3rd grade you learn the colors 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:23.690
 and the images to motivate and collect them 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:26.500
 the previous knowledge and also for this 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.500
 oral expression 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.440
 because I would have to win school 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.300
