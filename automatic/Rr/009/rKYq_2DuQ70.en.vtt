in this tutorial I'm going to show you
how<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.659> put<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.290> background<00:00:04.859> image<00:00:05.400> a

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
how to put a background image a

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.330 
how to put a background image a
photograph<00:00:06.569> so<00:00:07.049> that<00:00:07.259> when<00:00:07.440> you<00:00:07.589> render<00:00:07.919> this

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
photograph so that when you render this

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.940 
photograph so that when you render this
scene<00:00:09.080> the<00:00:10.080> cube<00:00:10.320> will<00:00:10.440> be<00:00:10.530> in<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.710> foreground

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
scene the cube will be in the foreground

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.680 
scene the cube will be in the foreground
and<00:00:11.340> there'll<00:00:11.519> be<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.610> photograph<00:00:11.880> in<00:00:12.420> the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
and there'll be a photograph in the

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.570 
and there'll be a photograph in the
background<00:00:14.150> okay<00:00:15.150> before<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:16.460> put<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
background okay before I put the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.189 
background okay before I put the
photograph<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.180> background<00:00:18.660> I'm<00:00:18.869> going

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
photograph in the background I'm going

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.140 
photograph in the background I'm going
to<00:00:19.260> add<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> material<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.490> texture<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:20.970> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
to add a material and a texture to the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.060 
to add a material and a texture to the
cube<00:00:21.510> because<00:00:21.900> there's<00:00:22.230> some<00:00:22.439> things<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.859> want

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
cube because there's some things I want

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.300 
cube because there's some things I want
to<00:00:23.279> go<00:00:23.609> over<00:00:23.939> first<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.859> I'm<00:00:25.859> clicking<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
to go over first so I'm clicking the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.009 
to go over first so I'm clicking the
material<00:00:26.789> button<00:00:27.769> at<00:00:29.119> this<00:00:30.119> line<00:00:30.449> I'm<00:00:30.810> going

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
material button at this line I'm going

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.959 
material button at this line I'm going
to<00:00:31.080> refer<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.560> couple<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.920> times<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.669> gives

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
to refer to a couple of times it gives

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.780 
to refer to a couple of times it gives
the<00:00:33.120> context<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.989> what<00:00:34.829> we're<00:00:34.980> doing<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.520> we

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
the context of what we're doing and we

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.100 
the context of what we're doing and we
we're<00:00:36.450> setting<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.050> material<00:00:37.950> for<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.610> cube

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
we're setting up a material for the cube

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.119 
we're setting up a material for the cube
so<00:00:40.110> if<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.410> click<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> plus<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.320> give<00:00:44.100> a

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
so if I click the plus and I give a

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.010 
so if I click the plus and I give a
meaningful<00:00:44.550> name<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.149> material<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:45.930> I'll

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
meaningful name to the material so I'll

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.389 
meaningful name to the material so I'll
call<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.289> matte<00:00:46.920> cube<00:00:50.270> and<00:00:52.070> there<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.250> got

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
call this matte cube and there we got

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.310 
call this matte cube and there we got
the<00:00:53.520> cube<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.059> there<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> material

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the cube and there is the material

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.430 
the cube and there is the material
linked<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:56.780> okay<00:00:57.780> then<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.109> click<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
linked to it okay then I click the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.099 
linked to it okay then I click the
texture<00:00:58.920> button<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.520> again<00:00:59.789> I<00:01:00.000> click<00:01:00.239> plus

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
texture button and again I click plus

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.060 
texture button and again I click plus
and<00:01:01.489> I<00:01:02.489> name<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.940> texture<00:01:03.570> do<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.920> name

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
and I name the texture do I have to name

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.340 
and I name the texture do I have to name
a<00:01:05.100> texture<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.750> don't<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.170> name

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
a texture but you don't have to name

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.750 
a texture but you don't have to name
anything<00:01:07.650> but<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.460> does<00:01:08.939> help<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.369> call<00:01:11.610> this

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
anything but it does help so I call this

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:19.969 
anything but it does help so I call this
texture<00:01:12.330> cube<00:01:13.760> and<00:01:17.570> again<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
texture cube and again it's in the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.240 
texture cube and again it's in the
breadcrumb<00:01:20.430> trail<00:01:20.460> here<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.240> linkage<00:01:21.630> of

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
breadcrumb trail here the linkage of

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.490 
breadcrumb trail here the linkage of
those<00:01:23.630> materials<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.840> texture<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.659> if<00:01:27.659> I

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
those materials and texture and if I

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.170 
those materials and texture and if I
render<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.040> scene<00:01:29.280> if<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.670> click<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> render

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
render the scene if I click the render

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.999 
render the scene if I click the render
button<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:32.450> do<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.570> image<00:01:33.840> render<00:01:34.350> there<00:01:34.710> is

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
the cube with the material and the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.290 
the cube with the material and the
texture<00:01:38.880> added

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300

and<00:02:49.280> this<00:02:49.400> is<00:02:49.520> the<00:02:49.640> texture<00:02:50.150> linked<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.570> that

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
and this is the texture linked to that

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.440 
and this is the texture linked to that
material<00:02:51.410> so<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:52.580> click<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.910> plus<00:02:53.090> button<00:02:53.360> and

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
material so I click the plus button and

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.670 
material so I click the plus button and
this<00:02:56.450> displays<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:56.930> texture<00:02:57.470> in<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.650> preview

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
this displays the texture in the preview

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.000 
this displays the texture in the preview
window<00:02:58.190> if<00:02:58.520> I<00:02:58.640> click<00:02:58.850> both<00:02:59.680> that<00:03:00.680> at<00:03:00.890> the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
window if I click both that at the

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.280 
window if I click both that at the
moment<00:03:01.190> if<00:03:01.580> I<00:03:01.700> rendered<00:03:02.150> now<00:03:02.330> would<00:03:02.750> be<00:03:02.780> the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
moment if I rendered now would be the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.920 
moment if I rendered now would be the
gray<00:03:03.500> background<00:03:04.070> that<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.340> would<00:03:04.520> get<00:03:04.870> how<00:03:05.870> do

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
gray background that I would get how do

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.600 
gray background that I would get how do
I<00:03:06.110> get<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.350> photograph<00:03:06.890> in<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.130> background

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
I get a photograph in the background

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.240 
I get a photograph in the background
well<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.630> first<00:03:08.840> thing<00:03:09.020> I<00:03:09.170> need<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.500> do<00:03:09.709> is<00:03:09.980> to

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
well the first thing I need to do is to

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.290 
well the first thing I need to do is to
change<00:03:10.550> the<00:03:11.000> type<00:03:11.239> of<00:03:11.270> texture<00:03:12.050> from<00:03:12.410> clouds

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
change the type of texture from clouds

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.680 
change the type of texture from clouds
to<00:03:14.300> an<00:03:14.690> image<00:03:15.020> or<00:03:15.290> movie<00:03:15.610> now<00:03:16.610> when<00:03:16.820> I<00:03:16.850> select

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
to an image or movie now when I select

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.190 
to an image or movie now when I select
that<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:18.230> get<00:03:18.709> an<00:03:18.980> extra<00:03:19.400> panel<00:03:19.640> that<00:03:20.630> allows<00:03:20.870> me

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
that I get an extra panel that allows me

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:30.360 
that I get an extra panel that allows me
to<00:03:21.410> open<00:03:21.860> an<00:03:22.010> image<00:03:23.080> so<00:03:24.080> I<00:03:24.470> find<00:03:25.459> an<00:03:25.670> image

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.140 

and<00:03:30.720> there's<00:03:31.720> my<00:03:32.230> texture<00:03:32.769> which<00:03:33.010> is<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.550> bitmap

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
and there's my texture which is a bitmap

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.680 
and there's my texture which is a bitmap
which<00:03:34.420> is<00:03:34.629> a<00:03:34.840> photo<00:03:35.940> but<00:03:36.940> still<00:03:37.300> it<00:03:37.540> won't

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
which is a photo but still it won't

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.830 
which is a photo but still it won't
render<00:03:38.560> this<00:03:39.550> is<00:03:39.760> what<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.120> world<00:03:40.300> background

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
render this is what the world background

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.290 
render this is what the world background
looks<00:03:41.080> like<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.650> it's<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.550> gray<00:03:42.760> square<00:03:43.090> at<00:03:43.239> the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
looks like and it's a gray square at the

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.780 
looks like and it's a gray square at the
moment<00:03:43.690> so<00:03:43.870> how<00:03:44.080> do<00:03:44.140> I<00:03:44.349> get<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.769> picture<00:03:45.280> in<00:03:45.489> in

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
moment so how do I get the picture in in

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.880 
moment so how do I get the picture in in
that<00:03:46.209> side<00:03:48.540> it's<00:03:49.540> in<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.840> influence<00:03:50.410> panel

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
that side it's in the influence panel

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.780 
that side it's in the influence panel
simply<00:03:51.519> if<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.030> take<00:03:52.450> horizon<00:03:53.200> which<00:03:53.860> affects

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
simply if you take horizon which affects

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.640 
simply if you take horizon which affects
the<00:03:55.030> color<00:03:55.269> of<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.660> horizon<00:03:55.810> but<00:03:56.379> as<00:03:56.470> soon<00:03:56.590> as

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
the color of the horizon but as soon as

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.640 
the color of the horizon but as soon as
you<00:03:56.799> click<00:03:57.010> that<00:03:59.340> the<00:04:00.340> image<00:04:00.790> is<00:04:01.080> used<00:04:02.080> as<00:04:02.500> the

you click that the image is used as the

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.780 
you click that the image is used as the
background<00:04:03.959> and<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:05.709> demonstrate<00:04:05.860> that<00:04:06.459> I'll

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
background and to demonstrate that I'll

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.990

just<00:04:07.180> click<00:04:07.420> render<00:04:09.660> and<00:04:10.660> there's<00:04:11.049> our<00:04:11.319> cube

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
just click render and there's our cube

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.490 
just click render and there's our cube
with<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.180> photograph<00:04:13.720> in<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.230> background

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.529 

we've<00:04:20.500> got<00:04:20.680> our<00:04:20.799> background<00:04:21.280> image<00:04:21.459> but<00:04:22.330> we're

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
we've got our background image but we're

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.990 
we've got our background image but we're
very<00:04:23.080> zoomed<00:04:23.380> into<00:04:23.680> the<00:04:23.919> central<00:04:24.340> part<00:04:24.580> of<00:04:24.820> the

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.120 
very zoomed into the central part of the
image<00:04:25.330> how<00:04:25.810> do<00:04:25.870> we<00:04:26.139> zoom<00:04:26.440> out<00:04:28.020> basically<00:04:29.130> by

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
image how do we zoom out basically by

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.390 
image how do we zoom out basically by
messing<00:04:30.610> about<00:04:30.699> with<00:04:30.880> settings<00:04:31.539> so<00:04:32.250> one<00:04:33.250> of

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
messing about with settings so one of

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.490 
messing about with settings so one of
the<00:04:33.460> settings<00:04:33.699> I<00:04:33.910> will<00:04:34.090> alter<00:04:34.300> is<00:04:34.750> the<00:04:35.139> render

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
the settings I will alter is the render

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.790 
the settings I will alter is the render
settings<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:36.340> will<00:04:36.669> change<00:04:38.430> it's<00:04:39.430> quite<00:04:39.820> a<00:04:39.850> big

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
settings I will change it's quite a big

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.750 
settings I will change it's quite a big
high-resolution<00:04:41.800> image<00:04:42.100> we're<00:04:42.520> rendering

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
high-resolution image we're rendering

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.279 
high-resolution image we're rendering
too<00:04:43.240> so<00:04:43.600> I'll<00:04:43.720> change<00:04:43.990> that<00:04:44.169> to<00:04:45.870> 640<00:04:46.870> by<00:04:46.990> 480

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
too so I'll change that to 640 by 480

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:52.409 
too so I'll change that to 640 by 480
but<00:04:47.680> I<00:04:47.710> will<00:04:47.950> up<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.930> size<00:04:49.930> to<00:04:50.200> 100%<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:52.120> if<00:04:52.300> I

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
but I will up the size to 100% and if I

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.240 
but I will up the size to 100% and if I
render<00:04:52.840> that<00:04:54.630> it's<00:04:55.680> slightly<00:04:56.680> alter<00:04:57.130> the

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
render that it's slightly alter the

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.339 
render that it's slightly alter the
proportion<00:04:57.789> the<00:04:57.970> portion<00:04:58.450> of<00:04:58.599> the<00:04:58.870> image<00:04:58.990> that

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
proportion the portion of the image that

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:01.050 
proportion the portion of the image that
we're<00:04:59.500> seeing<00:04:59.740> is<00:04:59.950> the<00:05:00.070> background<00:05:00.550> but<00:05:00.789> we

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
we're seeing is the background but we

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.330 
we're seeing is the background but we
still<00:05:01.270> need<00:05:01.450> to<00:05:01.479> zoom<00:05:01.750> out<00:05:01.930> quite<00:05:02.229> a<00:05:02.260> bit<00:05:02.380> how

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
still need to zoom out quite a bit how

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.940 
still need to zoom out quite a bit how
do<00:05:03.400> we<00:05:03.639> zoom<00:05:03.910> out<00:05:04.120> well<00:05:04.750> if<00:05:04.900> you<00:05:05.050> go<00:05:05.289> to<00:05:05.349> the

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
do we zoom out well if you go to the

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.000 
do we zoom out well if you go to the
texture<00:05:06.430> button<00:05:07.229> but<00:05:08.229> as<00:05:08.349> I<00:05:08.500> do<00:05:08.560> that<00:05:08.860> I've

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
texture button but as I do that I've

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.909 
texture button but as I do that I've
gone<00:05:09.190> into<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.580> texture<00:05:10.090> for<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.389> cube<00:05:10.889> so<00:05:11.889> I

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
gone into the texture for the cube so I

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.250 
gone into the texture for the cube so I
need<00:05:12.310> to<00:05:12.400> go<00:05:12.490> to<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.760> world<00:05:13.000> first<00:05:13.479> and<00:05:13.840> then

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
need to go to the world first and then

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.250 
need to go to the world first and then
go<00:05:14.500> to<00:05:14.560> the<00:05:14.770> texture<00:05:15.190> button<00:05:15.580> I<00:05:16.169> didn't<00:05:17.169> give

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
go to the texture button I didn't give

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.170 
go to the texture button I didn't give
the<00:05:17.380> texture<00:05:18.010> a<00:05:18.039> very<00:05:18.280> meaningful<00:05:18.520> name<00:05:18.940> out

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
the texture a very meaningful name out

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.200 
the texture a very meaningful name out
I'll<00:05:19.360> do<00:05:19.630> that<00:05:19.810> now<00:05:20.820> txr<00:05:22.380> wld<00:05:24.000> texture<00:05:25.000> for<00:05:25.150> the

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
I'll do that now txr wld texture for the

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.000 
I'll do that now txr wld texture for the
world<00:05:25.419> and<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:28.380> settings<00:05:29.380> we<00:05:29.530> need<00:05:29.560> to<00:05:29.800> change

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
world and the settings we need to change

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.330 
world and the settings we need to change
the<00:05:30.280> zoom<00:05:30.490> out<00:05:30.729> our<00:05:31.060> in<00:05:31.360> mapping<00:05:32.110> and<00:05:32.650> it's<00:05:33.160> the

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
the zoom out our in mapping and it's the

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.390 
the zoom out our in mapping and it's the
size<00:05:33.580> settings<00:05:34.180> here<00:05:34.570> the<00:05:35.410> size<00:05:35.710> of<00:05:35.919> the<00:05:36.010> X<00:05:36.160> and

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
size settings here the size of the X and

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.649 
size settings here the size of the X and
the<00:05:36.460> y<00:05:38.130> it's<00:05:39.130> handy<00:05:39.640> to<00:05:39.760> see<00:05:39.969> the<00:05:40.090> preview<00:05:40.570> as

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
the y it's handy to see the preview as

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:42.330 
the y it's handy to see the preview as
you<00:05:40.810> alter<00:05:41.140> these<00:05:41.289> so<00:05:41.770> I'm<00:05:41.890> going<00:05:42.039> to<00:05:42.070> close

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
you alter these so I'm going to close

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.640 
you alter these so I'm going to close
that<00:05:42.669> up

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
that up

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.100 
that up
so<00:05:43.860> that<00:05:44.070> I<00:05:44.220> can<00:05:44.280> alter<00:05:44.820> now<00:05:45.750> you<00:05:45.810> might<00:05:46.080> think

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
so that I can alter now you might think

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.610 
so that I can alter now you might think
make<00:05:46.889> X<00:05:47.190> smaller<00:05:47.699> you<00:05:48.360> would<00:05:48.570> see<00:05:48.930> more<00:05:49.350> of<00:05:49.530> the

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
make X smaller you would see more of the

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.879 
make X smaller you would see more of the
picture<00:05:50.100> but<00:05:50.850> if<00:05:51.150> you<00:05:52.050> look<00:05:52.229> at<00:05:52.320> the<00:05:52.410> preview

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
picture but if you look at the preview

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.270 
picture but if you look at the preview
as<00:05:53.070> I<00:05:53.250> make<00:05:53.580> X<00:05:53.850> smaller<00:05:54.300> at<00:05:55.080> the<00:05:55.280> background

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
as I make X smaller at the background

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.820 
as I make X smaller at the background
image<00:05:56.490> actually<00:05:56.669> zooms<00:05:57.479> in<00:05:57.780> and<00:05:58.440> I<00:05:58.530> want<00:05:58.740> to

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
image actually zooms in and I want to

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.500 
image actually zooms in and I want to
zoom<00:05:59.010> out<00:06:00.139> to<00:06:01.139> render<00:06:01.680> f12<00:06:02.490> is<00:06:02.639> a<00:06:02.699> shortcut<00:06:03.120> key

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
zoom out to render f12 is a shortcut key

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.870 
zoom out to render f12 is a shortcut key
for<00:06:03.540> that<00:06:03.810> and<00:06:05.000> I<00:06:06.000> need<00:06:06.840> to<00:06:06.990> zoom<00:06:07.260> out<00:06:07.500> so<00:06:07.889> I

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
for that and I need to zoom out so I

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.219 
for that and I need to zoom out so I
need<00:06:09.120> to<00:06:09.240> go<00:06:09.449> greater<00:06:09.900> than<00:06:10.229> one<00:06:10.470> so<00:06:11.990> now<00:06:12.990> if<00:06:13.139> I

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
need to go greater than one so now if I

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:16.820 
need to go greater than one so now if I
press<00:06:13.410> the<00:06:13.590> valve<00:06:14.389> in<00:06:15.389> the<00:06:15.990> X<00:06:16.139> direction<00:06:16.710> we're

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
press the valve in the X direction we're

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.580 
press the valve in the X direction we're
getting<00:06:17.070> a<00:06:17.160> lot<00:06:17.370> more<00:06:17.400> the<00:06:17.820> image<00:06:18.120> in<00:06:18.360> now<00:06:18.630> I

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
getting a lot more the image in now I

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.040 
getting a lot more the image in now I
hand<00:06:20.039> altered<00:06:20.400> Y<00:06:20.580> so<00:06:20.940> it's<00:06:21.150> horribly

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
hand altered Y so it's horribly

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.560 
hand altered Y so it's horribly
stretched<00:06:22.669> so<00:06:23.669> if<00:06:23.820> I<00:06:23.940> increase<00:06:24.090> Y<00:06:25.520> and<00:06:26.570> press

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
stretched so if I increase Y and press

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.360 
stretched so if I increase Y and press
f12<00:06:30.110> we're<00:06:31.110> starting<00:06:31.560> to<00:06:31.650> get<00:06:31.740> a<00:06:31.800> lot<00:06:32.039> more<00:06:32.250> of

f12 we're starting to get a lot more of

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.990 
f12 we're starting to get a lot more of
the<00:06:32.520> imaging<00:06:33.229> now<00:06:34.229> if<00:06:34.830> there<00:06:35.280> is<00:06:35.370> a<00:06:35.400> scientific

method<00:06:36.330> there<00:06:36.479> maybe<00:06:38.090> or<00:06:39.090> you<00:06:39.449> can<00:06:39.630> just<00:06:39.810> do<00:06:39.960> it

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
method there maybe or you can just do it

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.870 
method there maybe or you can just do it
by<00:06:40.169> trial<00:06:40.470> and<00:06:40.620> error<00:06:40.770> keep<00:06:41.220> altering<00:06:41.760> the

the size for y + 2 as the size for X

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:58.460 
the size for y + 2 as the size for X
gave<00:06:55.010> most<00:06:56.010> of<00:06:56.220> the<00:06:56.340> image<00:06:56.930> without<00:06:57.930> repeating
