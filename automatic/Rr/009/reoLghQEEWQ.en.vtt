00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.980 
you will look Tanner than you were
previously<00:04:11.460> reason<00:04:12.450> why<00:04:12.540> is<00:04:12.600> because<00:04:12.720> it

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
previously reason why is because it

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.020 
previously reason why is because it
causes<00:04:13.200> that<00:04:13.410> contrast<00:04:13.950> light<00:04:14.280> of<00:04:14.400> hair<00:04:14.640> the

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
causes that contrast light of hair the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.550 
causes that contrast light of hair the
difference<00:04:15.390> in<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.540> contrast<00:04:16.019> with<00:04:16.170> the<00:04:16.200> skin

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
difference in the contrast with the skin

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.560 
difference in the contrast with the skin
and<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:16.980> makes<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.220> look<00:04:17.340> at<00:04:17.489> an<00:04:17.670> also<00:04:18.480> if

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
and it makes it look at an also if

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.729 
and it makes it look at an also if
you're<00:04:18.690> not<00:04:18.780> into<00:04:19.049> changing<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.470> color<00:04:19.680> of

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
you're not into changing the color of

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.979 
you're not into changing the color of
your<00:04:19.920> hair<00:04:19.980> you<00:04:20.400> can<00:04:20.579> always<00:04:20.730> curl<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.870> way

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
your hair you can always curl it the way

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.330 
your hair you can always curl it the way
the<00:04:22.170> hair<00:04:22.290> works<00:04:22.620> is<00:04:22.860> that<00:04:22.890> when<00:04:23.160> it's

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
the hair works is that when it's

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.060 
the hair works is that when it's
straight<00:04:23.850> it<00:04:24.240> deflects<00:04:24.660> less<00:04:25.020> light<00:04:25.290> how<00:04:26.010> do

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
straight it deflects less light how do

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.430 
straight it deflects less light how do
we<00:04:26.250> see<00:04:26.550> color<00:04:26.850> color<00:04:27.540> is<00:04:27.810> because<00:04:28.170> light

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
we see color color is because light

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.080 
we see color color is because light
bounces<00:04:29.070> off<00:04:29.070> something<00:04:29.220> in<00:04:29.790> a<00:04:29.850> certain

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
bounces off something in a certain

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.230 
bounces off something in a certain
wavelength<00:04:30.720> which<00:04:31.020> is<00:04:31.170> what<00:04:31.320> we<00:04:31.470> see<00:04:31.710> now<00:04:32.610> when

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
wavelength which is what we see now when

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.360 
wavelength which is what we see now when
light<00:04:33.480> bounces<00:04:33.510> off<00:04:33.990> straight<00:04:34.560> hair<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:35.190> hair

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
light bounces off straight hair the hair

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.950 
light bounces off straight hair the hair
is<00:04:35.550> so<00:04:35.760> straight<00:04:36.210> there's<00:04:36.540> not<00:04:36.690> a<00:04:36.720> lot<00:04:36.930> of

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
is so straight there's not a lot of

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.930 
is so straight there's not a lot of
kinks<00:04:37.440> so<00:04:37.680> it<00:04:37.770> bounces<00:04:37.920> off<00:04:38.280> pretty<00:04:38.580> evenly

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
kinks so it bounces off pretty evenly

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.600 
kinks so it bounces off pretty evenly
now<00:04:39.600> with<00:04:39.780> curly<00:04:40.200> hair<00:04:40.230> this<00:04:40.950> hair<00:04:40.980> is<00:04:41.460> all

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
now with curly hair this hair is all

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.100 
now with curly hair this hair is all
curled<00:04:41.940> up<00:04:42.120> it<00:04:42.330> has<00:04:42.540> a<00:04:42.570> bunch<00:04:42.840> of<00:04:42.930> different

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
curled up it has a bunch of different

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.260 
curled up it has a bunch of different
almost<00:04:43.860> like<00:04:43.980> mirrors<00:04:44.430> so<00:04:44.850> when<00:04:44.970> that<00:04:45.090> light

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
almost like mirrors so when that light

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.270 
almost like mirrors so when that light
comes<00:04:45.510> off<00:04:45.690> of<00:04:45.720> it<00:04:45.960> a<00:04:46.110> lot<00:04:46.380> more<00:04:46.410> light<00:04:46.830> bounces

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
comes off of it a lot more light bounces

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.940 
comes off of it a lot more light bounces
off the<00:04:47.400> curly<00:04:47.820> hair<00:04:48.030> so<00:04:48.990> if<00:04:49.230> half<00:04:49.440> of<00:04:49.590> my<00:04:49.710> hair

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
off the curly hair so if half of my hair

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.380 
off the curly hair so if half of my hair
was<00:04:50.100> straight<00:04:50.340> right<00:04:50.610> now<00:04:50.640> and<00:04:51.030> half<00:04:51.180> of<00:04:51.300> it

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
was straight right now and half of it

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.540 
was straight right now and half of it
was<00:04:51.450> curly<00:04:51.930> this<00:04:52.590> half<00:04:52.830> would<00:04:53.040> look<00:04:53.280> lighter

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
was curly this half would look lighter

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.070 
was curly this half would look lighter
and<00:04:53.850> this<00:04:54.030> half<00:04:54.150> would<00:04:54.330> look<00:04:54.450> darker<00:04:54.870> know

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
and this half would look darker know

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.720 
and this half would look darker know
that<00:04:55.230> the<00:04:55.320> same<00:04:55.500> color<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:56.250> reason<00:04:56.490> if<00:04:56.580> that

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
that the same color the reason if that

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.400 
that the same color the reason if that
happens<00:04:57.090> is<00:04:57.240> because<00:04:57.420> of<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:57.960> way<00:04:58.110> that<00:04:58.290> the

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
happens is because of the way that the

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.930 
happens is because of the way that the
light<00:04:58.560> bounces<00:04:59.160> off<00:04:59.160> of<00:04:59.370> these<00:04:59.730> different

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
light bounces off of these different

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.200 
light bounces off of these different
strands<00:05:00.750> and<00:05:01.050> different<00:05:01.700> kind<00:05:02.700> of<00:05:02.760> textures

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
strands and different kind of textures

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.670 
strands and different kind of textures
that<00:05:03.240> we<00:05:03.390> have<00:05:03.540> in<00:05:03.630> our<00:05:03.750> hair<00:05:03.900> so<00:05:04.380> those<00:05:04.530> are

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
that we have in our hair so those are
