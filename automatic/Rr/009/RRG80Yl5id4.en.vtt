00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.930
 in this audio video I'm going to tell you a little about the advantage of combining the 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.660
 exercise 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.259
 with the feeding plan 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:10.069
 First 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:13.069
 the exercise is a level of sugar 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.439
 and let me explain a bit because it's a sugar leveler when we 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.220
 we exercise 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.220
 although what redounds in the stomach our body another arrested 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.159
 will be ordered 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:26.380
 to replenish 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.509
 the energy in sugar that we have stored in a muscle 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.180
 and they were also giving rolling around in our shanghai system 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.010
 then while you are exercising 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.580
 you sugar the one you already have in the body naturally goes to 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.230
 lift up 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.690
 and that to say that while you to your elevated caste 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.690
 you will not suffer from hunger and that is very important 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.580
 when we have a high sugar in our blood system 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.130
 our body does not feel hungry 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.980
 only when we have a fall in his career is when when he feels hungry 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.360
 while you are exercising 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.380
 your body to regulate sugar and you will not feel hungry 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.380
 and how to finish exercising or to feel hungry 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.430
 during a 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.740
 with more or less long let's say 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.890
 ep another advantage also to combine 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.659
 of the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.680
 the exercise with the feeding plan that is 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.570
 that you 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.110
 percent through exercise 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.290
 you will feel motivated 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.369
 and better 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:29.510
 over you 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.100
 to be able to continue 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.690
 doing the activity 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.690
 you want home what do you want to do what is 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.149
 a weight reduction 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.430
 a body fat reduction sizes maybe 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.730
 and also p obviously 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.260
 feel you look better then 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.390
 through the exercise you will have 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.390
 that is information that your body needs 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.830
 or motivational information of what you're doing something worthwhile 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.600
 if you do nothing else the feeding plan 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.930
 and do not combine the exercise with this 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.470
 then you will miss that other part 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.540
 it was going to be like a resistance test 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.889
 it's going to be more of a mental effort 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:13.049
 if you combine the exercise this mental effort is totally changed 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.219
 and it's more motivation and it does not feel strong 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.379
 and the exercise does not have to be very elaborate or anything like that 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.799
 the simple fact of exercising in some way contemplate it 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:32.659
 third min very important through exercise develop muscle mass 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:36.929
 and it's there in the muscle mass where body fat is burned 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.959
 backup 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.059
 if you have a trained muscle mass 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:46.189
 then in the reserve of body fat 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.849
 they are going to be used inside that kettle of muscle kettle 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.509
 if you train your muscles that boiler will be bigger every time 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:57.589
 and with greater capacity to be able 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:59.569
 burn reserve calories 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.639
 if you do not train then imagine you're going to have a boiler like that 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.899
 because they have muscle at the end of the day 

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:09.299
 but a boiler maybe working at 10 percent of its capacity 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:13.279
 it's going to cost you work but cost more work 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:16.709
 be able to reduce the reserve of body fat 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.710
 if you have that kettle train 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.339
 then it means 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:23.339
 that could be working 90 a 100% 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.159
 and it will be much easier 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.249
 be able to make that traffic reduction by art 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:31.349
 and especially the country because 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.419
 body fat the final volume of accounts 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:37.629
 and the muscle is not much volume in another video all explain a little bit 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:38.359
 plus 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.199
 highlighted by action comparison between body fat and muscle mass 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:46.979
 for now until there we leave it in the boiler 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:49.119
 of the muscle as they are called 

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:52.789
 where they burn the calories in there burns more calories 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:56.919
 you have to train yourself to burn calories 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.479
 and if this is supported by a feeding plan prepared by then 

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:02.209
 will have better results
