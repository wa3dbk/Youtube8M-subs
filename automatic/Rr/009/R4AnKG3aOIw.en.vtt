okay what we have here is a oh three
chevy<00:00:03.629> s-10<00:00:04.080> and<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.410> problem<00:00:04.859> is<00:00:05.040> when<00:00:05.580> all

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
chevy s-10 and the problem is when all

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.419 
chevy s-10 and the problem is when all
the<00:00:05.819> complaint<00:00:06.299> was<00:00:06.480> no<00:00:06.660> four-wheel<00:00:07.109> drive<00:00:07.440> or

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
the complaint was no four-wheel drive or

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.030 
the complaint was no four-wheel drive or
four-wheel<00:00:08.820> drive<00:00:09.269> inoperative<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.200> it's

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
four-wheel drive inoperative and it's

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.650 
four-wheel drive inoperative and it's
kind<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.490> chain<00:00:11.730> reaction<00:00:11.880> which<00:00:12.330> starts

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
kind of a chain reaction which starts

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.379 
kind of a chain reaction which starts
here<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:13.019> start<00:00:13.349> with<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.820> vacuum<00:00:14.820> switch<00:00:15.120> that

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
here you start with a vacuum switch that

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.790 
here you start with a vacuum switch that
doesn't<00:00:16.820> want<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:18.260> switch<00:00:19.260> all<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.590> way<00:00:19.680> it

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
doesn't want to switch all the way it

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.650 
doesn't want to switch all the way it
will<00:00:19.920> go<00:00:20.130> into<00:00:20.490> four-wheel<00:00:21.090> drive<00:00:21.359> and

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
will go into four-wheel drive and

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.109 
will go into four-wheel drive and
obviously<00:00:22.170> now<00:00:22.410> but<00:00:22.680> when<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.100> sticks<00:00:23.369> when

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
obviously now but when it sticks when

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.210 
obviously now but when it sticks when
the<00:00:24.210> little<00:00:24.449> check<00:00:24.689> ball<00:00:24.930> there<00:00:25.140> sticks<00:00:25.500> then

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
the little check ball there sticks then

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.470 
the little check ball there sticks then
the<00:00:26.970> vacuum<00:00:27.180> ports<00:00:27.689> will<00:00:28.560> not<00:00:28.740> allow<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
the vacuum ports will not allow the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.930 
the vacuum ports will not allow the
quote<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.779> front<00:00:31.050> axle<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.560> disengage<00:00:32.130> or<00:00:32.460> at

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
quote the front axle to disengage or at

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.600 
quote the front axle to disengage or at
least<00:00:33.059> not<00:00:33.239> disengage<00:00:33.840> fully<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:35.100> what<00:00:35.370> ends

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
least not disengage fully so what ends

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.360 
least not disengage fully so what ends
up<00:00:35.670> happening<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.559> this<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.890> gear<00:00:38.129> that

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
up happening is this is the gear that

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.340 
up happening is this is the gear that
dry<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.940> runs<00:00:39.149> off<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.540> half<00:00:39.719> shaft<00:00:40.050> or<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
dry it runs off the half shaft or the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.010 
dry it runs off the half shaft or the
half<00:00:40.739> shaft<00:00:41.040> side<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.629> coupler

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
half shaft side of the of the coupler

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.740 
half shaft side of the of the coupler
assembly<00:00:43.140> for<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.890> front<00:00:44.280> axle<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.600> can

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
assembly for the front axle so you can

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.459 
assembly for the front axle so you can
see<00:00:45.960> here<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:48.300> edges<00:00:48.660> are<00:00:48.840> beveled<00:00:49.140> off

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
see here that the edges are beveled off

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.830 
see here that the edges are beveled off
from<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.920> grinding<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.270> what<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.660> been

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
from it grinding and what it's been

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.200 
from it grinding and what it's been
grinding<00:00:52.289> against<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.160> coupler<00:00:53.699> gear<00:00:54.000> and

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
grinding against is the coupler gear and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.479 
grinding against is the coupler gear and
if<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.050> look<00:00:55.230> closely<00:00:55.530> here<00:00:56.070> our<00:00:56.219> coupler

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
if you look closely here our coupler

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.069 
if you look closely here our coupler
gear<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.899> showing<00:00:58.410> evidence<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:59.870> grinding<00:01:00.870> -

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
gear is showing evidence of grinding -

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.340 
gear is showing evidence of grinding -
so<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.620> was<00:01:01.829> obviously<00:01:02.719> these<00:01:03.719> two<00:01:04.049> gears

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
so that was obviously these two gears

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.710 
so that was obviously these two gears
here<00:01:04.769> grind<00:01:05.159> or<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.909> coupler<00:01:06.299> grinding

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
here grind or the coupler grinding

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.530 
here grind or the coupler grinding
against<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.290> drive<00:01:08.220> gear<00:01:08.520> from<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.060> half

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
against the drive gear from the half

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.090 
against the drive gear from the half
shaft<00:01:09.930> side<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:12.380> side<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.920> is

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
shaft side this here is the side this is

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.219 
shaft side this here is the side this is
the<00:01:14.220> gear<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.670> goes<00:01:15.360> into<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.810> differential

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the gear that goes into the differential

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.780 
the gear that goes into the differential
carrier<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.009> there's<00:01:17.189> no<00:01:17.310> damage<00:01:17.759> there

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
carrier and there's no damage there

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.940 
carrier and there's no damage there
because<00:01:19.670> because<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.939> here<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.950> always

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
because because this here is always

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.969 
because because this here is always
engaged<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.850> but<00:01:24.180> when<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.950> switch<00:01:25.950> to

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
engaged to this but when you switch to

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.300 
engaged to this but when you switch to
four-wheel<00:01:26.490> drive<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:27.060> thick<00:01:28.189> when<00:01:29.189> you

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
four-wheel drive this thick when you

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.340 
four-wheel drive this thick when you
when<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> transfer<00:01:30.210> case<00:01:30.390> moves<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.930> cam<00:01:31.140> in

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
when the transfer case moves the cam in

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.740 
when the transfer case moves the cam in
the<00:01:31.439> transfer<00:01:31.890> case<00:01:32.070> will<00:01:32.369> push<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.240> ball<00:01:33.509> up

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the transfer case will push that ball up

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.249 
the transfer case will push that ball up
and<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.350> will<00:01:34.530> all<00:01:34.710> vacuum<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.400> go<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.259> to

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
and that will all vacuum to go to the to

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.810 
and that will all vacuum to go to the to
the<00:01:37.350> diaphragm<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.920> still<00:01:37.950> got<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.369> diaphragm

stuck or partially stuck what eventually
happens<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.450> partially<00:02:10.200> you

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
happens is that partially you

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.360 
happens is that partially you
run<00:02:11.379> it<00:02:11.500> long<00:02:11.620> enough<00:02:11.769> it<00:02:12.010> will<00:02:12.069> partially

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
run it long enough it will partially

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.149 
run it long enough it will partially
disengage<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.150> in<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:13.569> case<00:02:14.010> for<00:02:15.010> some

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159 
disengage and in this case for some

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.750 
disengage and in this case for some
reason<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:17.230> washer<00:02:17.799> broke<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.340> washer

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
reason this washer broke and the washer

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.000 
reason this washer broke and the washer
would<00:02:19.150> normally<00:02:19.599> sit<00:02:19.900> here<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:20.920> I'm

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
would normally sit here so I'm

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.720 
would normally sit here so I'm
suspecting<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:21.670> because<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.269> the<00:02:22.420> grinding

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
suspecting that because of the grinding

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.250 
suspecting that because of the grinding
that<00:02:24.730> was<00:02:24.909> going<00:02:25.209> on<00:02:25.359> and<00:02:25.569> eventually<00:02:26.079> the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
that was going on and eventually the

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.589 
that was going on and eventually the
vibration<00:02:27.129> or<00:02:27.250> something<00:02:27.640> broke<00:02:27.879> this<00:02:28.060> washer

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
vibration or something broke this washer

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.179 
vibration or something broke this washer
and<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.840> washer<00:02:29.230> i<00:02:29.260> think<00:02:29.560> actually<00:02:30.010> got

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189 
and the washer i think actually got

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.940 
and the washer i think actually got
jammed<00:02:31.120> between<00:02:31.390> two<00:02:31.900> gears<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.530> that

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
jammed between two gears and that

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.280 
jammed between two gears and that
prevented<00:02:33.489> it<00:02:33.670> from<00:02:33.700> engaging<00:02:34.239> so<00:02:35.019> what<00:02:35.140> we're

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
prevented it from engaging so what we're

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.720 
prevented it from engaging so what we're
going<00:02:35.409> to<00:02:35.439> do<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.680> we're<00:02:35.829> going<00:02:35.859> to<00:02:35.980> replace

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
going to do is we're going to replace

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.110 
going to do is we're going to replace
this<00:02:37.060> gear<00:02:37.359> replace<00:02:38.139> the<00:02:38.349> coupler<00:02:38.769> and

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
this gear replace the coupler and

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.390 
this gear replace the coupler and
replace<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.299> washer<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.959> I<00:02:41.829> think<00:02:42.099> that<00:02:42.250> all

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
replace the washer and I think that all

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.429 
replace the washer and I think that all
that<00:02:43.329> will<00:02:43.420> probably<00:02:43.720> fix<00:02:43.900> this<00:02:44.049> up<00:02:44.230> here

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
that will probably fix this up here

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.229 
that will probably fix this up here
we'll<00:02:44.530> put<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.709> new<00:02:44.859> seal<00:02:45.159> on<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.879> end<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.150> this

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
we'll put a new seal on the end of this

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.319 
we'll put a new seal on the end of this
thing<00:02:46.510> here<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:47.109> half<00:02:47.290> shaft<00:02:47.620> seems<00:02:47.980> okay<00:02:48.370> and

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
thing here the half shaft seems okay and

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:50.670 
thing here the half shaft seems okay and
that<00:02:49.540> should<00:02:49.750> get<00:02:49.900> us<00:02:50.019> back<00:02:50.230> on<00:02:50.439> the<00:02:50.470> road

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
that should get us back on the road

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.679 
that should get us back on the road
again<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.069> four<00:02:51.280> wheel<00:02:51.459> drive<00:02:51.669> maybe<00:02:52.000> before

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:52.689 
again and four wheel drive maybe before

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.589 
again and four wheel drive maybe before
the<00:02:52.900> snow<00:02:53.139> melts<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:54.700> should<00:02:54.879> be<00:02:55.000> that's

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
the snow melts that should be that's

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.569 
the snow melts that should be that's
probably<00:02:55.989> about<00:02:56.200> it's<00:02:56.439> pretty<00:02:56.739> simple<00:02:57.220> repair

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
probably about it's pretty simple repair

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.390 
probably about it's pretty simple repair
it<00:02:57.849> just<00:02:58.750> say<00:02:58.870> excuse<00:02:59.290> around<00:03:00.129> here<00:03:00.280> you

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
it just say excuse around here you

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.979 
it just say excuse around here you
always<00:03:00.549> got<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.790> order<00:03:01.060> your<00:03:01.299> parts<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:01.870> it

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
always got to order your parts so it

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.569 
always got to order your parts so it
takes<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.349> day<00:03:02.500> or<00:03:02.620> two<00:03:02.769> for<00:03:02.799> everything<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.459> get

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
takes a day or two for everything to get

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.309 
takes a day or two for everything to get
in<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:04.389> we're<00:03:04.510> going<00:03:04.629> to<00:03:04.720> replace<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.139> vacuum

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
in and we're going to replace the vacuum

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.710 
in and we're going to replace the vacuum
switch<00:03:05.680> too<00:03:06.069> because<00:03:06.489> you<00:03:07.090> can<00:03:07.269> clean<00:03:07.450> them<00:03:07.569> up

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
switch too because you can clean them up

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.420 
switch too because you can clean them up
and<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.049> might<00:03:08.200> work<00:03:08.409> for<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.709> while<00:03:08.919> but<00:03:09.189> just

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
and it might work for a while but just

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.129 
and it might work for a while but just
to<00:03:09.970> be<00:03:10.090> safe<00:03:10.299> about<00:03:10.599> it<00:03:10.659> we're<00:03:10.930> going<00:03:11.079> to

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
to be safe about it we're going to

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.679 
to be safe about it we're going to
replace<00:03:11.409> that<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:12.129> check<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.909> fluid<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.299> in

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:13.689 
replace that and check the fluid and in

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.179 
replace that and check the fluid and in
the<00:03:13.930> transfer<00:03:14.409> case<00:03:14.590> because<00:03:14.889> if<00:03:14.980> that's

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:15.189 
the transfer case because if that's

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.250 
the transfer case because if that's
dirty<00:03:15.519> that<00:03:16.419> could<00:03:16.629> be<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.810> contributing

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
dirty that could be a contributing

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.759 
dirty that could be a contributing
factor<00:03:17.979> to<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.810> switch<00:03:19.810> hanging<00:03:20.199> up<00:03:20.349> so

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
factor to the switch hanging up so

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.629 
factor to the switch hanging up so
that's<00:03:21.760> about<00:03:21.909> it<00:03:22.030> for<00:03:22.180> this
