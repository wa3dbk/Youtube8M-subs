trying to create something and you think

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.710 
trying to create something and you think
what<00:03:48.540> can<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:48.810> do<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:50.370> make<00:03:50.519> it<00:03:50.670> better<00:03:50.879> what

you make yourself happy there's a good

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.539 
you make yourself happy there's a good
chance<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.379> make<00:03:58.560> somebody<00:03:58.739> else<00:03:59.040> happy

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
chance you make somebody else happy

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.030 
chance you make somebody else happy
and<00:03:59.639> if<00:04:00.359> you're<00:04:00.540> cynical<00:04:01.290> enough<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.769> believe

hi hey mo garganta yeah I thought it

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.720 
hi hey mo garganta yeah I thought it

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
first why would anybody want to go back

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.449 
first why would anybody want to go back
and<00:04:18.940> look<00:04:19.150> at<00:04:19.359> an<00:04:19.600> ad<00:04:20.290> that<00:04:20.470> was<00:04:20.560> done<00:04:20.799> almost

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
and look at an ad that was done almost

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.670 
and look at an ad that was done almost
50<00:04:21.880> years<00:04:21.910> ago<00:04:22.150> and<00:04:22.540> I<00:04:22.660> thought<00:04:22.870> well<00:04:23.140> my

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
50 years ago and I thought well my

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.320 
50 years ago and I thought well my
goodness<00:04:24.040> it's<00:04:24.310> an<00:04:24.430> interesting<00:04:24.850> idea<00:04:25.000> that

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
goodness it's an interesting idea that

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.270 
goodness it's an interesting idea that
someone<00:04:25.630> would<00:04:25.660> try<00:04:26.020> to<00:04:26.050> resurrect<00:04:26.650> work<00:04:26.980> and

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
someone would try to resurrect work and

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.340 
someone would try to resurrect work and
see<00:04:28.060> if<00:04:28.120> they<00:04:28.270> could<00:04:28.420> use<00:04:28.450> that<00:04:28.630> as<00:04:28.930> a<00:04:28.960> bridge

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
see if they could use that as a bridge

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.150 
see if they could use that as a bridge
to<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:30.420> current<00:04:31.420> Volvo<00:04:31.870> marketing<00:04:32.650> and
