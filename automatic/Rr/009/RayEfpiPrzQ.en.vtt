00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.299
 good afternoon my name is ilya shattering and 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.369
 you are watching test tv wedding us at a party 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.860
 smartphone htc one mini 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:18.260
 samsung idea of â€‹â€‹releasing mini versions of their 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.119
 flagships proved successful therefore 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.920
 contagious today many 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.259
 manufacturers are trying to produce 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.750
 mini versions of their top devices 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.089
 recipe for success is simple we make a smartphone with 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.429
 in the same design only a little smaller 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:33.500
 add the word mini to the name 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.989
 reduce the price and wait for the crowd of buyers 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.910
 thinking that they get the same flagship 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.440
 only smaller and therefore cheaper 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.090
 truth maker is not at all 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.980
 focuses on that 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.230
 stuffing then i'm actually in the smartphone 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.870
 completely different and in common with the flagship 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.359
 Perhaps only the design but it worries 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.219
 Unfortunately only htc one back answers 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.949
 mini got aluminum case noticeably 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.469
 elongated due to the small width 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.780
 he doesn't seem shovel but location 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.300
 top left unlock buttons 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.679
 force a finger to her that 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.170
 especially not convenient if you hold 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.820
 smartphone in the left hand ie ergonomics 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.130
 clearly designed for right handed 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.159
 competitors have this body length 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.530
 smartphones with screen sizes 46 4.7 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.790
 inches with this unlock button they 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.299
 have side 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.829
 here the screen is only 4.3 inches the rest 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.689
 place occupied by the touch keys 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.790
 located under the display 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.250
 other manufacturers start from them 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.320
 refuse but here their use 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.299
 that's a plus since they don't eat the place 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.700
 on the already small display and 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.600
 Of course a lot of space given to the speaker 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.090
 boomsound 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.310
 which besides big and honored sevan not 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.409
 no other smartphone can boast 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.780
 they provide really juicy and 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.170
 powerful sound so no other sounds 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.170
 smartphone 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.890
 As for the sound, that is, if of course 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.780
 same not without its proprietary 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.939
 beats audio technology 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.710
 which is rather marketing 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.270
 I'll explain a huge trick 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.310
 sound enhancement is today 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.590
 in almost all smartphones as well 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.660
 software players hardware plan 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.780
 Good to do glad to present today 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.150
 and in sony and nokia smartphones and many 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.069
 other cars and such wonders subtract tits 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.260
 Is that very decent headphones 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.150
 qualities are bundled they can not 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.250
 buy a separate camera for everything 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.170
 4 megapixel but if all this 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.959
 especially does not advertise and call it 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.900
 ultra pixel essence of the idea is that 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.209
 the pixels in the matrix are smaller therefore 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.400
 sizes are larger i.e. they fall 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.860
 more light means better camera 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.739
 take off in the dark it really is 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.680
 but unfortunately in good light 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.140
 camera shoots worse than other models 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.299
 due to less resolution besides me 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.370
 it seemed that the big honor Sevan 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.860
 The little ones are still better, although in general 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.190
 the quality is still very very good 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.440
 I would also point out the program functions. 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.720
 cameras such as eat season 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.489
 i.e. the camera takes a few pictures 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.810
 contract 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.030
 allowing later for example to choose from them 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.980
 best or even delete accidentally 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.680
 processor object 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.959
 dual core qualcomm 8930 on it 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.850
 flagships of 2012 were built on 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.350
 to today's standards it provides 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.519
 sufficient performance for 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.470
 everyday tasks 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.630
 that is of course outdated it is not 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.190
 would you call but modern flagships 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.870
 work twice as fast 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.450
 also worth noting is the presence of support 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.940
 fourth generation networks lt and 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.310
 internal memory here is 16 gigabytes 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.109
 no expansion card support but if we 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.239
 look at the owners of iPhones then 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.290
 we understand that a normal person is in 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.120
 principle enough 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.790
 but what is missing unfortunately so 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.010
 This is the battery life of the smartphone in 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.380
 Intensive mode will hold a total of eight 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.870
 nine hours that is battery capacity 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.760
 1800 milliampere hours for him clearly 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.410
 not much better to make the body a little 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.480
 thicker but not forced to put 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.849
 smartphone on the charge in the middle of the work 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.319
 of the day is worth and slime and you mini 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.389
 twenty thousand rubles 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.609
 considering its characteristics or price 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.470
 overestimated for example similar sony 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.290
 xperia 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.120
 can be bought for 15 thousand for 16 more 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.390
 powerful lg optimus g 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.430
 but for 17 total iphone 4s in general I think 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.540
 Taiwanese can reconsider their 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.790
 pricing policy 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.190
 in the meantime, still a little expensive anyway 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.489
 it's up to you but before you buy look 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.489
 test
