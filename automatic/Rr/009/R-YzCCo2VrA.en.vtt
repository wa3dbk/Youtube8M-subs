does require some some force there you
go<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:46.299> will<00:02:46.540> snap<00:02:47.160> snap<00:02:48.209> there<00:02:49.209> you<00:02:49.299> have<00:02:49.480> it

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
go it will snap snap there you have it

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.750 
go it will snap snap there you have it
so<00:02:50.320> so<00:02:50.470> far<00:02:50.680> what<00:02:50.920> do<00:02:51.010> I<00:02:51.100> give<00:02:51.280> this<00:02:51.400> it's

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
so so far what do I give this it's

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.190 
so so far what do I give this it's
completely<00:02:52.030> identical<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.200> like<00:02:53.410> proof<00:02:54.070> case

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
completely identical to like proof case

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.130 
completely identical to like proof case
like<00:02:56.200> proof<00:02:56.769> case<00:02:57.100> retails<00:02:57.730> for<00:02:57.880> about<00:02:58.299> $80

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
like proof case retails for about $80

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.420 
like proof case retails for about $80
and<00:03:00.450> here<00:03:01.450> I<00:03:01.600> got<00:03:01.930> this<00:03:02.080> for<00:03:02.140> under<00:03:02.380> $10<00:03:03.160> on

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
and here I got this for under $10 on

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.660 
and here I got this for under $10 on
ebay<00:03:04.360> exact<00:03:05.320> same<00:03:05.590> thing<00:03:06.180> it's<00:03:07.180> up<00:03:07.330> to<00:03:07.480> you
