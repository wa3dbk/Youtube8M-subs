00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 most open television chain that 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.089
 never and look at this is an example of 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.360
 abuse and the tortures to which they are 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.960
 subdued the animals in some circuses 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.100
 fortunately a citizen complaint 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.560
 put an end to the suffering of this bear 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.310
 at first glance it looks like a black bear a 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.859
 normal american bear 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.720
 but that unfortunately had the bad 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:28.820
 fortunate to cross in the way of 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.289
 harley circus being a male was 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.860
 baptized with the stage name of 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.860
 dancer night function after function 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.510
 village in town was dressed as a skirt and 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.239
 forced with torture to walk in a 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.400
 small bicycle and juggling the 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.829
 life of the American bear passed in 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.329
 a small cage of 2 x 2 meters and only 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.140
 He left his confinement to give a function 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.760
 until one day he was mutilated I do not know if 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.400
 was for wanting to extract it in 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.159
 fangs I do not know if it was because no 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.049
 I would bite again because all those 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.210
 versions only I know I was not 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:04.640
 justified the mutilation of that body 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.210
 in the surgery they removed the maxilla 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.530
 lower part of the jaw is spoken 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.300
 that he was a veterinarian who attended 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.000
 only horses 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.670
 and so he continued working pulling the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.990
 laughter and applause from a public that does not 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.270
 knows what happens when the lights go out 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.550
 of the carp the cruelty for which it was 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.190
 treated this animal really does not have 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.670
 background he was still working with 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.740
 this chained situation was put on a 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.500
 veil so you would not see a 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.930
 lucky citizen complaint put an end 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.570
 to the martyrdom of the animal now renamed 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.520
 as invictus the federal attorney's office 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.920
 protection to the environment assured the 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.720
 copy of black bear in yucatan and 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.280
 initiated criminal and administrative proceedings 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.900

 owner of the traveling show 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.980
 called harley circus because because 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.310
 if we can see that it's a circus that does not 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.770
 is having an adequate management of its 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.150
 copies and so it is so that's why 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.340

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.560
