00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
though the most arcane code but maybe

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.700

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
riders to Huambo which I think would be

don't<00:01:40.499> know<00:01:40.679> all<00:01:40.950> these<00:01:41.039> different<00:01:41.310> types<00:01:41.640> of

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
don't know all these different types of

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.639 
don't know all these different types of
mobs<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.179> you<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.539> introduce<00:01:42.840> with<00:01:43.289> a<00:01:43.409> boat

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
mobs that you can introduce with a boat

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.679 
mobs that you can introduce with a boat
but<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.920> boat<00:01:43.950> itself<00:01:44.399> looks<00:01:45.030> different<00:01:45.600> it

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
but the boat itself looks different it

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.050 
but the boat itself looks different it
does<00:01:45.899> vary<00:01:46.200> look<00:01:46.439> similar<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> minecart

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
does vary look similar to a minecart

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.789 
does vary look similar to a minecart
that's<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.450> my<00:01:48.600> take<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.109> I<00:01:49.380> don't<00:01:49.710> know

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
that's just my take on it I don't know

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.929 
that's just my take on it I don't know
if<00:01:49.920> they're<00:01:50.039> gonna<00:01:50.100> be<00:01:50.280> changing<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.759> up<00:01:50.819> a

actual mob calm such as a dog and they
go<00:02:35.180> up<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.480> down<00:02:35.600> in<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:35.930> water<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.500> then<00:02:36.680> you

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
go up and down in the water and then you

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.980 
go up and down in the water and then you
go<00:02:36.980> far<00:02:37.280> far<00:02:37.490> away<00:02:37.550> and<00:02:38.030> then<00:02:38.090> eventually<00:02:38.540> they

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
go far far away and then eventually they

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.600 
go far far away and then eventually they
do<00:02:39.050> teleport<00:02:39.770> to<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.010> so<00:02:40.160> i<00:02:40.220> think<00:02:40.280> this<00:02:40.460> would

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
do teleport to you so i think this would
