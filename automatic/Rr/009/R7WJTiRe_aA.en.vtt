now<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.640> sensitivity<00:03:45.420> your<00:03:45.750> looks

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
now the sensitivity your looks

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.740 
now the sensitivity your looks
sensitivity<00:03:47.130> it's<00:03:47.340> critical<00:03:48.000> it<00:03:48.360> has<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.660> be

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
sensitivity it's critical it has to be

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.480 
sensitivity it's critical it has to be
really<00:03:49.050> really<00:03:49.170> high<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.710> mean<00:03:49.920> it<00:03:50.100> has<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.370> be

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
really really high I mean it has to be

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.360 
really really high I mean it has to be
at<00:03:50.580> least<00:03:50.760> four<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.710> mean<00:03:52.710> three<00:03:53.040> if<00:03:53.190> you're

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
at least four I mean three if you're

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.370 
at least four I mean three if you're
really<00:03:53.700> kind<00:03:53.970> of<00:03:54.030> like<00:03:54.270> not<00:03:54.660> feeling<00:03:55.290> the

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
really kind of like not feeling the

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.650 
really kind of like not feeling the
floor<00:03:55.620> but<00:03:56.220> if<00:03:56.550> you're<00:03:56.760> like<00:03:57.060> me<00:03:57.270> you're<00:03:57.510> Pro

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
floor but if you're like me you're Pro

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.730 
floor but if you're like me you're Pro
like<00:03:57.840> me<00:03:57.990> you're<00:03:58.080> gonna<00:03:58.170> go<00:03:58.350> really<00:03:58.530> high

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
like me you're gonna go really high

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.560 
like me you're gonna go really high
sensitivity<00:03:59.250> have<00:03:59.610> it<00:03:59.700> at<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.820> four<00:04:00.090> setting

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
sensitivity have it at a four setting

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.450 
sensitivity have it at a four setting
that's<00:04:00.960> what<00:04:01.200> I<00:04:01.290> use<00:04:01.530> that's<00:04:01.830> what<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.040> rock<00:04:02.280> out

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
that's what I use that's what I rock out

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.100 
that's what I use that's what I rock out
with<00:04:02.490> because<00:04:03.030> that's<00:04:03.210> like<00:04:03.390> a<00:04:03.420> pro<00:04:03.690> setting

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
with because that's like a pro setting

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.320 
with because that's like a pro setting
there<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:04.890> having<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.280> four<00:04:05.490> sensitivity<00:04:06.120> makes

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
there so having a four sensitivity makes

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.390 
there so having a four sensitivity makes
the<00:04:06.720> quickscoping<00:04:07.350> a<00:04:07.500> lot<00:04:07.770> easier<00:04:08.220> because

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
the quickscoping a lot easier because

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.390 
the quickscoping a lot easier because
you<00:04:09.210> can<00:04:09.390> look<00:04:09.570> faster<00:04:10.290> yeah<00:04:10.800> that's<00:04:11.220> how<00:04:11.340> that

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
you can look faster yeah that's how that

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.870 
you can look faster yeah that's how that
works

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
works

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.450 
works
I<00:04:12.420> also<00:04:12.990> for<00:04:13.320> my<00:04:13.380> killstreaks<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:13.950> use<00:04:14.130> only<00:04:14.280> the

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
I also for my killstreaks I use only the

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.280 
I also for my killstreaks I use only the
UAV<00:04:14.910> because<00:04:15.330> all<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.630> others<00:04:15.840> really<00:04:16.080> suck

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
UAV because all the others really suck

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.960 
UAV because all the others really suck
and<00:04:16.560> I<00:04:16.739> want<00:04:16.980> to<00:04:17.040> save<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.459> kills<00:04:17.670> for<00:04:17.880> my

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
and I want to save the kills for my

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.000 
and I want to save the kills for my

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
quick scoping explosive rounds not for
