so the first one is in one of the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.729 
so the first one is in one of the
tunnels<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.969> start<00:00:39.239> out<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.629> wayne<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.469> being

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
tunnels you start out in wayne to being

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.020 
tunnels you start out in wayne to being
a<00:00:40.950> darice<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.870> if<00:00:42.980> get<00:00:43.980> there<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.370> one<00:00:44.399> second

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
a darice and if get there in one second

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.410 
a darice and if get there in one second
I'm<00:00:45.149> trying<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.140> locate<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:47.960> so<00:00:50.420> the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
I'm trying to locate it so the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.229 
I'm trying to locate it so the
Illuminati<00:00:51.899> code<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.710> there<00:00:53.340> was<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> coding

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
Illuminati code is there was a coding

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.330 
Illuminati code is there was a coding
sheet<00:00:54.480> released<00:00:54.629> by<00:00:54.930> treyarch<00:00:55.350> for<00:00:55.980> people<00:00:56.219> to

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
sheet released by treyarch for people to

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.970 
sheet released by treyarch for people to
decipher<00:00:57.030> what<00:00:57.629> these<00:00:57.809> codes<00:00:58.109> really<00:00:58.530> meant<00:00:58.800> I

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
decipher what these codes really meant I

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.299 
decipher what these codes really meant I
posted<00:00:59.520> them<00:00:59.760> at<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> end<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> video<00:01:00.719> so

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
posted them at the end of the video so

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.549 
posted them at the end of the video so
you<00:01:02.309> can<00:01:02.449> try<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:03.690> yourself<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.350> try<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
you can try it out yourself and try and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.980 
you can try it out yourself and try and
decipher<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.070> codes<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:06.119> haven't<00:01:06.540> tried

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
decipher the codes I just haven't tried

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.530 
decipher the codes I just haven't tried
yet<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.920> honest<00:01:08.159> with<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:09.119> I'll

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
yet to be honest with you so I'll

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.320 
yet to be honest with you so I'll
probably<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.409> into<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.860> soon<00:01:11.250> enough<00:01:11.330> so

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
probably get into that soon enough so

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.600 
probably get into that soon enough so
here's<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> first<00:01:12.810> bit<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.650> Illuminati<00:01:14.250> code

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
here's the first bit of Illuminati code

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.420 
here's the first bit of Illuminati code
and<00:01:15.170> i'll<00:01:16.170> give<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> nice<00:01:16.619> close-up<00:01:17.130> view

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
and i'll give you a nice close-up view

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.820 
and i'll give you a nice close-up view
in<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.640> second<00:01:18.090> look<00:01:18.270> at<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.619> there<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.770> is

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
in a second look at that there it is

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.109 
in a second look at that there it is
there's<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.790> first<00:01:21.030> my<00:01:21.900> code<00:01:22.350> as<00:01:22.740> also<00:01:23.580> words

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
there's the first my code as also words

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.810 
there's the first my code as also words
in<00:01:24.630> english<00:01:25.470> right<00:01:25.740> next<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.310> Illuminati

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
in english right next to the Illuminati

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.520 
in english right next to the Illuminati
so<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.330> could<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.479> mean<00:01:28.080> many<00:01:28.409> different

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
so it could be mean many different

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.020 
so it could be mean many different
things<00:01:29.840> so<00:01:31.040> that's<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.280> first<00:01:32.549> one<00:01:32.820> there's

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
things so that's the first one there's

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.370 
things so that's the first one there's
also<00:01:33.150> another<00:01:33.420> one<00:01:33.780> that's<00:01:33.960> kind<00:01:34.259> of

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
also another one that's kind of

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.740 
also another one that's kind of
Illuminati<00:01:35.040> it's<00:01:35.759> again<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.509> hanging

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
Illuminati it's again in the hanging

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.280 
Illuminati it's again in the hanging
man's<00:01:37.229> room<00:01:37.650> with<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.729> looks<00:01:39.329> like<00:01:39.509> hell<00:01:39.780> what

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
man's room with it looks like hell what

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.069 
man's room with it looks like hell what
it<00:01:40.409> could<00:01:40.530> also<00:01:40.710> be<00:01:41.119> different<00:01:42.119> things<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.990> the

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
it could also be different things so the

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.139 
it could also be different things so the
next<00:01:43.229> one's<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.860> wall<00:01:44.159> by<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.549> juggernaut

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
next one's in the wall by the juggernaut

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.420 
next one's in the wall by the juggernaut
in<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.899> area<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.350> can't<00:01:46.649> get<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.280> it's

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
in that area you can't get in and it's

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.020 
in that area you can't get in and it's
just<00:01:47.880> right<00:01:48.210> there<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:50.130> about<00:01:50.820> does<00:01:50.970> it

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
just right there so that about does it

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.670 
just right there so that about does it
for<00:01:51.180> Lu<00:01:51.420> minority<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.899> just<00:01:52.259> found<00:01:52.409> something

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
for Lu minority I just found something

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.249 
for Lu minority I just found something
really<00:01:53.040> i<00:01:53.790> thought<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.630> would<00:01:54.780> be<00:01:54.930> fun<00:01:55.229> to

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
really i thought it would be fun to

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.630 
really i thought it would be fun to
mention<00:01:55.680> at<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> end<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.100> video<00:01:56.280> since

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
mention at the end of this video since

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.590 
mention at the end of this video since
it<00:01:56.729> really<00:01:56.880> hasn't<00:01:57.030> fallen<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.450> any

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
it really hasn't fallen to any

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.459 
it really hasn't fallen to any
categories<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.380> what<00:01:58.530> i<00:01:58.560> was<00:01:58.890> trying<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.729> do<00:02:00.469> so

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
categories of what i was trying to do so

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.389 
categories of what i was trying to do so
you'll<00:02:02.310> notice<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.030> second<00:02:03.509> what<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.750> do<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.399> I

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399
