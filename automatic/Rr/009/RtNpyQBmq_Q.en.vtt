00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.219
 hello very good to all guys and girls 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.960
 we are here again with another one boxing 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.510
 as you see related to the last 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.540
 video analysis as I promised you of that 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.210
 zelda majora's 3d mask and you have before 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.460
 you the edition so to speak more 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.220
 limited that has come out of this game that 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.619
 is this version that brings the console with 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.470
 the screenprint of the mask and most 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.690
 apart it has the pre-installed game and a 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.570
 limited edition school figure 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.350
 kit that only comes with the packs of this 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.380
 console as you can see the figure comes 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.990
 also packaged with the same console 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.970
 if you are going to buy it and such fix 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.520
 that this is not going to load 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.890
 because as you can see it can be removed very 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.680
 easily you know that there are 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.480
 Sellers who really like the 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.220
 stay with the gifts so nothing 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.850
 let's open it let's take the 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.850
 plastic 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.030
 the tickets outside and the first thing that we 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.210
 we find in this edition is the figure 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.369
 of the school kit as you see in a very box 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.560
 discrete white that does not carry 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.590
 nothing silkscreen of the elderly 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.660
 marks simply the content the logo 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.180
 of nintendo and good the barcode 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.979
 and I imagine that the format they have 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.840
 chosen is exactly the same as 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.050
 used for club gifts 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.630
 nintendo so I would not like the 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.910
 all crazy that at some point 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.700
 from here to the nintendo club closing 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.320
 As you know in September it is possible that 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.860
 put this figure because as you see 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.720
 has the same packaging as those of the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.610
 things that command the club nintendo but 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.320
 good for now the only way to 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.899
 get it is by acquiring the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.770
 video console here in Spain in france and 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.650
 in the usa with the limited edition we are going to 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.750
 see the figurine 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:06.050
 to see how it is worth I expected it 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.000
 even smaller or the figure is not 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.979
 it's not very big either but 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.310
 equally no small either be the 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.070
 figure is pretty cool I'm going to open it 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.530
 ok so here we would have the figurine is 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.020
 of plasti that you are worth is not of any 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.850
 sensitive material that can break is 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.370
 plastic but good for a gift 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.030
 we're not going to be picky 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.830
 follow maybe I would have preferred that 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.350
 had more shadows or more shaded 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.990
 around here that effect as of darkness does not 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.610
 since this tone is very green but 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.459
 It is also quite good 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.380
 example here in the hat yes we see 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.830
 let's say darker parts too 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.720
 we notice that the design has been 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.580
 improved in this version of sculpt and 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.100
 that I've seen other figures that have the 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.180
 crested cock effect and it looks like that 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.220
 they have like that the hair let's say like straight in 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.220
 this position and it does not look good there is no 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.569
 cooler as well as more excited as 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.450
 long hat 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.450
 and well the figure as you see the mask 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.999
 it is very well painted very detailed me 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.709
 I like it a lot and the costume because that 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:15.260
 missing a couple of shadows but it's 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.959
 pretty good and as you can see the base is 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.819
 plastic and I think I'll put it next to 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.549
 my friends how is not the bookshelf 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.280
 well let's leave here the figure and 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.739
 now we go with the console edition 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.370
 that I also had enough desire to 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.799
 have it since I'm going to Germany - about 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.049
 days that I had not commented on it, I'll do 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.480
 a video there of how is the 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.480
 collection of physical formats 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.400
 as you know there all the products that 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.099
 they have to have physical format 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.230
 until the tlc quite curious and I will make a 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.810
 video about that and I wanted to take the 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.719
 console to the trip to play the monster 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.699
 hunter that I have not yet been able to prove 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:57.859
 along with other titles that I'll upload 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:01.340
 analysis next week as new 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:03.440
 and others in with the trip I had a 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.500
 week very moved the truth 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.570
 and well here we have here 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.910
 Go look there are club points nintendo 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.280
 that apparently simply carry them 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.650
 chalks 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.079
 but not apparently they are here 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.530
 well let's see the console we are going to 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:25.550
 to take it out is pretty big I have 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:28.850
 the normal 3ds so you can understand me like that 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:32.690
 that seeing now this edition xl 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:35.740
 majora's mask as I was surprised not with 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.030
 the size as you see shines this 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.860
 very cool design not notice the 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.960
 silkscreen do that is carried as a 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.600
 kind of protective film so that 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.030
 this is not scratched or anything as you can see 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.000
 it does not have any kind of texture and it's 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:55.060
 very cool I love then back here 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.600
 as you see nintendo 3ds x selenium 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.249
 it does not have any screen printing that back 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.499
 just here in front 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:06.069
 let's see it inside that I think it's 

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:10.209
 exactly like the normal xl 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:12.359
 it seems like you can see here we have the 

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:16.089
 console with colored buttons 

00:05:12.359 --> 00:05:18.969
 characteristics of the joystick that I think 

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:22.179
 that has also been reviewed and this one 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:24.129
 here it's worth watching what a pimp this is not 

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:26.589
 I had tried it yet and the truth 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:29.589
 I have enough desire and well this would be 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:32.109
 the console and well let's see what else 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:35.110
 there are these points here that are 

00:05:32.109 --> 00:05:37.389
 On the one hand we have the cards 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:41.259
 augmented reality that carry all the 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:43.539
 nintendo 3ds and the points it carries are 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:45.399
 of fiction I had not seen it are from the 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:48.579
 zelda majora's more that are not of the 

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:51.610
 apparently afterwards here we have 

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:53.319
 also this quick start guide me 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.710
 I imagine that for the transfer of 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:06:00.560
 data and it looks like it's worth 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:04.280
 and then separate then this manual from the 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.430
 new 3ds and the new 3ds xlt as those 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:11.270
 guys this would be the older edition 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:13.420
 more 3d with the figurine as you see very 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.400
 cool and stay tuned because 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.350
 surely in a ratillo I will leave 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.690
 also uploaded in a boxing of the 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.090
 special edition of the biggest ace more with the 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.380
 metal box the pin the posters and others 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.530
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.870
 the unboxing and good luck to all for 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.840
 both those who have booked and those who have 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.460
 they want to acquire a console of these 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.560
 this week, good luck because it's 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.680
 quite limited and the truth is that 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.500
 It's never wrong, it's not that you go to a 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.330
 little with that mood to say good to see 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.130
 If I met her, I was hoping that 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.140
