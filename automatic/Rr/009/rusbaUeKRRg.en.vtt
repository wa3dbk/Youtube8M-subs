another<00:06:02.090> two<00:06:02.419> dollar<00:06:02.600> ups<00:06:03.530> that<00:06:03.800> I<00:06:03.860> had<00:06:04.130> and<00:06:04.370> it

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
another two dollar ups that I had and it

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.670 
another two dollar ups that I had and it
wouldn't<00:06:05.210> work<00:06:05.360> so<00:06:05.690> I<00:06:05.990> think<00:06:06.110> if<00:06:06.440> you<00:06:06.530> have

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
wouldn't work so I think if you have

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.730 
wouldn't work so I think if you have
other<00:06:06.860> products<00:06:07.580> it<00:06:07.700> works<00:06:07.940> but<00:06:08.330> if<00:06:08.600> you<00:06:09.470> don't

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
other products it works but if you don't

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.529 
other products it works but if you don't
then<00:06:09.979> it<00:06:10.130> I<00:06:10.280> don't<00:06:10.460> know<00:06:10.550> whatever<00:06:10.910> it<00:06:11.300> didn't

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
then it I don't know whatever it didn't

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:12.790 
then it I don't know whatever it didn't
work<00:06:11.660> out<00:06:11.780> when<00:06:11.930> I<00:06:11.960> try<00:06:12.169> to<00:06:12.200> do<00:06:12.350> it<00:06:12.440> by<00:06:12.560> itself

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800
