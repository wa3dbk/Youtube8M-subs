well<00:00:22.890> for<00:00:23.490> me<00:00:23.640> what<00:00:24.000> defines<00:00:24.390> avant-garde<00:00:25.109> is

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
well for me what defines avant-garde is

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.999 
well for me what defines avant-garde is
taking<00:00:26.400> an<00:00:27.119> idea<00:00:27.660> or<00:00:27.960> an<00:00:28.140> object<00:00:28.259> or<00:00:28.679> a<00:00:28.739> thing

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
taking an idea or an object or a thing

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.670 
taking an idea or an object or a thing
which<00:00:29.609> isn't<00:00:29.939> necessarily<00:00:30.410> innovative<00:00:31.410> renew

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
which isn't necessarily innovative renew

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.990 
which isn't necessarily innovative renew
in<00:00:31.829> itself<00:00:32.129> it<00:00:32.399> could<00:00:32.550> be<00:00:32.669> actually<00:00:32.970> something

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
in itself it could be actually something

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.240 
in itself it could be actually something
that's<00:00:33.300> quite<00:00:33.660> conventional<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.470> putting<00:00:35.160> it

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
that's quite conventional and putting it

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.330 
that's quite conventional and putting it
into<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.670> new<00:00:35.910> context<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:37.590> space<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
into a new context in space and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.160 
into a new context in space and
therefore<00:00:38.760> creating<00:00:39.150> a<00:00:39.390> new<00:00:39.629> meaning<00:00:39.839> or<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
therefore creating a new meaning or a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.470 
therefore creating a new meaning or a
new<00:00:40.320> purpose<00:00:40.650> for<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.100> thing<00:00:41.339> for<00:00:42.210> instance

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
new purpose for the thing for instance

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.270 
new purpose for the thing for instance
when<00:00:42.629> Duchamp<00:00:43.050> took<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.500> urinal<00:00:43.860> which<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.250> a

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
where these smells exist then you can

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.350 
where these smells exist then you can
actually<00:01:34.010> change<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:34.580> thought<00:01:34.820> pattern<00:01:35.240> of

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
actually change the thought pattern of

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:46.760 
actually change the thought pattern of
people<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:35.990> thus<00:01:36.470> change<00:01:36.800> their<00:01:37.010> behavior

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.679

that<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.640> creates<00:01:57.119> what<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.299> call<00:01:57.630> little<00:01:57.960> sent

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
that it creates what I call little sent

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.679 
that it creates what I call little sent
emoticons<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.369> these<00:01:59.610> little<00:01:59.880> memories

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.720 

I<00:02:17.959> have<00:02:18.959> two<00:02:19.170> forms<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.560> synesthesia<00:02:20.010> the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
I have two forms of synesthesia the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.509 
I have two forms of synesthesia the
first<00:02:20.970> one<00:02:21.239> is<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.930> color<00:02:22.920> gramatik

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
first one is the color gramatik

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.030 
first one is the color gramatik
synesthesia<00:02:24.060> synesthesia<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.110> it's<00:02:25.739> when

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
synesthesia synesthesia and it's when

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.240 
synesthesia synesthesia and it's when
you<00:02:26.340> see<00:02:26.730> colors<00:02:27.150> when<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.200> here<00:02:28.680> or<00:02:28.920> look<00:02:29.040> at

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.050 
could see the same colors that he that I
was<00:03:05.069> learning<00:03:05.280> about<00:03:05.610> in<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:05.940> ingredients

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
was learning about in the ingredients

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.410 
was learning about in the ingredients
and<00:03:06.599> then<00:03:07.079> I<00:03:07.110> realized<00:03:07.500> as<00:03:07.709> I<00:03:07.739> started<00:03:08.069> to<00:03:08.129> work

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
and then I realized as I started to work

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.809 
and then I realized as I started to work
that<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.450> could<00:03:09.690> use<00:03:09.900> those<00:03:10.049> colors<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.920> modify

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
that I could use those colors to modify

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.030 
that I could use those colors to modify
the<00:03:11.879> sense<00:03:12.329> based<00:03:12.690> on<00:03:12.840> what<00:03:12.989> I<00:03:13.019> saw<00:03:13.349> and<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.010> I

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
the sense based on what I saw and so I

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.520 
the sense based on what I saw and so I
could<00:03:14.340> create<00:03:14.640> for<00:03:15.329> instance<00:03:15.690> if<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.900> brand<00:03:16.170> has

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
could create for instance if a brand has

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.039 
could create for instance if a brand has
identifies<00:03:17.489> with<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.730> color<00:03:17.940> blue<00:03:18.329> and<00:03:18.630> let's

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
identifies with the color blue and let's

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.879 
identifies with the color blue and let's
say<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.290> texture<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:20.630> silk<00:03:21.630> I<00:03:21.900> could<00:03:22.500> make<00:03:22.709> the

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
say the texture of silk I could make the

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.680 
say the texture of silk I could make the
scent<00:03:23.160> smell<00:03:23.549> exactly<00:03:23.880> like<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.389> color<00:03:24.600> blue

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
scent smell exactly like the color blue

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.990 
scent smell exactly like the color blue
and<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.230> texture<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.650> silk<00:03:25.920> not<00:03:26.370> just<00:03:26.639> for<00:03:26.819> me

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
and the texture of silk not just for me

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.490 
and the texture of silk not just for me
but<00:03:27.030> for<00:03:27.299> them<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:27.810> anyone<00:03:28.109> else<00:03:28.380> that
