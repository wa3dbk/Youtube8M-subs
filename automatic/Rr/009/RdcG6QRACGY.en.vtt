cool<00:00:03.720> Barbie<00:00:04.230> chairs<00:00:05.029> I'm<00:00:06.029> using<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.960> toilet

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
cool Barbie chairs I'm using a toilet

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.589 
cool Barbie chairs I'm using a toilet
paper<00:00:07.440> roll<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:07.919> as<00:00:08.519> my<00:00:08.700> tables<00:00:09.120> almost<00:00:09.510> the

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
paper roll and as my tables almost the

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.959 
paper roll and as my tables almost the
same<00:00:09.870> height<00:00:10.110> as<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.800> roll<00:00:11.070> I'm<00:00:11.280> cutting<00:00:11.820> off<00:00:11.940> a

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
same height as a roll I'm cutting off a

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.270 
same height as a roll I'm cutting off a
bit<00:00:12.330> from<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.929> top<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.349> roll<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:13.920> Barbie

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
bit from the top of the roll so Barbie

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.910 
bit from the top of the roll so Barbie
can<00:00:14.429> fit<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:14.759> like<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.660> won't<00:00:15.900> fit<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.859> I'm

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
can fit in like this won't fit so I'm

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.560 
can fit in like this won't fit so I'm
measuring<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.580> be<00:00:17.670> sure<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.090> can<00:00:18.180> cut

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
measuring it to be sure that I can cut

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.570 
measuring it to be sure that I can cut
it<00:00:18.660> straight<00:00:19.050> or<00:00:19.289> more<00:00:19.529> or<00:00:19.590> less<00:00:19.710> straight<00:00:19.980> so

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
it straight or more or less straight so

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.980 
it straight or more or less straight so
it<00:00:20.640> won't<00:00:20.850> wobble<00:00:22.130> make<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> line<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.990> I'm

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
it won't wobble make a line and I'm

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.070 
it won't wobble make a line and I'm
cutting<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:26.300> almost<00:00:27.300> always<00:00:27.539> when<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.840> cut

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
cutting it almost always when you cut

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.359 
cutting it almost always when you cut
they'll<00:00:28.289> be<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> little<00:00:28.680> bit<00:00:28.920> that's<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.250> bit

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
they'll be a little bit that's a bit

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.460 
they'll be a little bit that's a bit
lumpy<00:00:29.519> but<00:00:29.880> with<00:00:30.179> making<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.630> line<00:00:30.810> you'll<00:00:31.349> be

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
lumpy but with making the line you'll be

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.200 
lumpy but with making the line you'll be
able<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.800> see<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.340> then<00:00:32.579> cut<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.820> away<00:00:33.000> and

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
able to see it and then cut it away and

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.720 
able to see it and then cut it away and
straighten<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.860> you<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:35.040> make<00:00:35.190> any<00:00:35.399> kind<00:00:35.610> of
