00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.640
 consider the advantage I'm afraid of

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.180
 without exit risk of braking a turn 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.529
 wheels are locked 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:58.329
 the car does not obey the steering and

 if missed the way is not enough 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:22.339
 the driver has to drive around an obstacle

 vary due to weather 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.749
 and coating quality 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:54.369
 under emergency braking without 

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:56.099
 Kobayashi motorists lose

 with dad s even in such a situation car 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:02.879
 maintains stability when 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.879
 optimal brakes 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.289
 and in everyday life 

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:18.289
 impressed substances were all very important 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.789
 and you with prevents the wheels from locking when 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.309
 emergency braking 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:27.309
 she cuts 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:30.849
 and provides manageability 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.139
 and travel is necessary for your 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.279
 security 

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:43.909
