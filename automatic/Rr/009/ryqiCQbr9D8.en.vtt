00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
inventory screen and then you're going

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.979 
inventory screen and then you're going
to<00:00:59.609> make<00:00:59.730> sure<00:00:59.910> you've<00:01:00.120> got<00:01:00.149> buckets<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.750> oil

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
to make sure you've got buckets of oil

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.830 
to make sure you've got buckets of oil
as<00:01:01.289> well<00:01:01.350> otherwise<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.520> won't<00:01:02.699> work<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.149> then

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
as well otherwise it won't work and then

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.710 
as well otherwise it won't work and then
all<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.170> do<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.129> simply<00:01:05.790> double

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
all you do is you just simply double

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.990 
all you do is you just simply double
space<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:08.180> off<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.540> go<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:11.130> as<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.790> see

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
space and off you go and as you see

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.550 
space and off you go and as you see
going<00:01:12.240> by<00:01:12.360> down<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> bond<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.840> screen<00:01:13.110> that

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
going by down the bond the screen that

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.920 
going by down the bond the screen that
you<00:01:13.619> do<00:01:13.950> actually<00:01:14.189> burn<00:01:14.520> through<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.060> fuel<00:01:15.330> or

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
you do actually burn through the fuel or

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.990 
you do actually burn through the fuel or
the<00:01:16.049> oil<00:01:16.229> quite<00:01:17.009> quickly<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:19.020> yes<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.909> a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the oil quite quickly so yes you have a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.070 
the oil quite quickly so yes you have a
little<00:01:21.150> bit<00:01:21.240> wary<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.509> as<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:21.960> see<00:01:22.049> just

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
little bit wary that as you can see just

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.420 
little bit wary that as you can see just
basically<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.830> top<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.189> hill

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
basically get to the top of this hill

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.190 
basically get to the top of this hill
here<00:01:23.670> or<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.970> basic<00:01:24.509> mountainous<00:01:24.869> should<00:01:25.020> say

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
here or the basic mountainous should say

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.560 
here or the basic mountainous should say
it<00:01:25.439> burned<00:01:26.220> through<00:01:26.340> at<00:01:26.729> least<00:01:26.939> one<00:01:27.060> two<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.479> a

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
it burned through at least one two and a

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.249 
it burned through at least one two and a
half<00:01:27.770> buckets<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.780> does<00:01:30.780> go<00:01:30.960> through<00:01:30.990> and

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
half buckets so it does go through and

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.690 
half buckets so it does go through and
pretty<00:01:31.409> quick<00:01:31.590> which<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.430> pretty<00:01:32.520> cool

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
pretty quick which is pretty cool

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.800 
pretty quick which is pretty cool
actually<00:01:32.880> because<00:01:33.090> obviously<00:01:33.509> you're

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
actually because obviously you're

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.030 
actually because obviously you're
burning<00:01:34.079> through<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.290> fuel<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.619> should<00:01:34.860> be

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
burning through the fuel it should be

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.550 
burning through the fuel it should be
pretty<00:01:35.189> quickly<00:01:35.490> too<00:01:35.640> far<00:01:35.820> as<00:01:35.880> I'm<00:01:36.000> concerned

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
pretty quickly too far as I'm concerned

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.719 
pretty quickly too far as I'm concerned
so<00:01:37.560> their<00:01:37.740> goal<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.070> jumbo<00:01:38.250> that's<00:01:38.520> how<00:01:38.670> you

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
so their goal is a jumbo that's how you

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.850 
so their goal is a jumbo that's how you
do<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.150> equip<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.900> into<00:01:40.170> your<00:01:40.259> here<00:01:40.500> under

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
do it just equip it into your here under

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.710 
do it just equip it into your here under
the<00:01:40.950> chest<00:01:41.189> slot<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.610> then<00:01:41.640> just<00:01:42.329> once

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the chest slot and then just once

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.889 
the chest slot and then just once
equipped<00:01:43.229> long<00:01:43.470> as<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.619> got<00:01:43.680> buckets<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.100> oil

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
equipped long as you got buckets of oil

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.899 
equipped long as you got buckets of oil
then<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:46.409> double<00:01:47.040> space<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.790> will

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
then you just double space and you will

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:55.219 
then you just double space and you will
fly<00:01:48.530> woody<00:01:52.640> that's<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.820> alright<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.689> now<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:55.110> to

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
fly woody that's it alright so now on to

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.499 
fly woody that's it alright so now on to
the<00:01:55.259> second<00:01:55.619> part<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.909> quite<00:01:57.149> simply

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the second part and that is quite simply

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.440 
the second part and that is quite simply
the<00:01:58.079> parachute<00:01:59.060> parachute<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.210> obviously

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
the parachute parachute is obviously

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.270 
the parachute parachute is obviously
very<00:02:00.509> simple<00:02:00.960> if<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.740> jump<00:02:01.950> off<00:02:02.100> high

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
very simple if you can jump off high

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.300 
very simple if you can jump off high
buildings<00:02:03.229> no<00:02:04.229> you're<00:02:04.530> not<00:02:04.680> Superman<00:02:05.009> but
