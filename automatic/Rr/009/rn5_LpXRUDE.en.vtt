don't tell you wrong so basically how

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.430 
don't tell you wrong so basically how
you<00:03:09.740> start<00:03:10.040> off<00:03:10.160> is<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.850> that<00:03:11.510> down<00:03:11.840> down<00:03:12.410> up

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
you start off is a that down down up

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.870 
you start off is a that down down up
down<00:03:12.980> up<00:03:13.640> down<00:03:14.270> down<00:03:14.630> up<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:15.700> you're<00:03:16.700> going<00:03:16.820> to

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
down up down down up so you're going to

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.700 
down up down down up so you're going to
do<00:03:16.970> that<00:03:17.150> strum<00:03:17.420> pattern<00:03:17.840> you're<00:03:18.320> going<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:18.560> do

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
do that strum pattern you're going to do

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.240 
do that strum pattern you're going to do
it<00:03:18.950> four<00:03:19.850> times<00:03:20.180> on<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.990> so<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.650> starts<00:03:21.890> off<00:03:22.010> on<00:03:22.040> a

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
it four times on a so it starts off on a

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.770 
it four times on a so it starts off on a
so<00:03:22.850> you<00:03:22.940> got

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.650 

this<00:03:28.780> third<00:03:29.080> time<00:03:29.349> down<00:03:30.160> up<00:03:30.970> down<00:03:31.300> up<00:03:31.629> down

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
this third time down up down up down

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.090 
this third time down up down up down
down

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
down

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.900 
down
you<00:03:33.670> switch<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.000> deep<00:03:34.740> down<00:03:35.740> down-up<00:03:36.340> you

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
you switch the deep down down-up you

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.670 
you switch the deep down down-up you
gonna<00:03:37.120> do<00:03:37.210> it<00:03:37.300> twice<00:03:37.480> down

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
gonna do it twice down

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.660 
gonna do it twice down
dim<00:03:40.250> back<00:03:40.519> today<00:03:40.819> down<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:45.129> then<00:03:46.129> you

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
dim back today down and then you

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.610 
dim back today down and then you
basically<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:48.440> goes<00:03:48.650> a<00:03:49.010> four<00:03:49.909> measures<00:03:50.390> then<00:03:51.230> d

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
basically it goes a four measures then d

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.240 
basically it goes a four measures then d
for<00:03:52.310> two<00:03:52.489> measures<00:03:52.760> then<00:03:53.530> back<00:03:54.530> to<00:03:54.709> a<00:03:54.739> for<00:03:55.099> two

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
for two measures then back to a for two

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.830 
for two measures then back to a for two
measures<00:03:55.459> and<00:03:55.700> then<00:03:55.879> it<00:03:56.090> starts<00:03:56.390> over<00:03:56.510> with<00:03:56.690> a

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
measures and then it starts over with a

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.800 
measures and then it starts over with a
again<00:03:57.170> so<00:03:57.620> it<00:03:57.860> basically<00:03:57.980> is<00:03:58.400> like<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.390> a<00:03:59.420> is

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
again so it basically is like the a is

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.839 
again so it basically is like the a is
for<00:04:00.110> six<00:04:00.379> measures<00:04:00.769> measures<00:04:01.280> but<00:04:01.700> it's

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
for six measures measures but it's

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.530 
for six measures measures but it's
really<00:04:02.739> two<00:04:03.739> and<00:04:03.980> four<00:04:04.190> instead<00:04:04.579> of<00:04:04.640> just<00:04:04.849> 26

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
really two and four instead of just 26

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.190 
really two and four instead of just 26
if<00:04:05.750> that<00:04:05.930> makes<00:04:06.140> sense<00:04:07.599> but<00:04:09.190> then<00:04:10.190> after<00:04:10.549> that

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
if that makes sense but then after that

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.569 
if that makes sense but then after that
so<00:04:12.200> that's<00:04:12.410> for<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.620> first<00:04:12.859> that's<00:04:13.310> for<00:04:13.519> the

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
so that's for the first that's for the

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:19.650 
so that's for the first that's for the
vs.<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:14.769> for<00:04:15.769> the<00:04:15.859> course<00:04:16.160> you<00:04:17.350> know<00:04:18.350> it<00:04:18.590> says

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
vs. and for the course you know it says

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:28.379 
vs. and for the course you know it says
if<00:04:20.660> you<00:04:21.079> lose<00:04:21.470> your

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.330 

as<00:04:28.569> I
