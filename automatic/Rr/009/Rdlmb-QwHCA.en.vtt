 is a new series from me 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.450
 she calls herself with every weapon and 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.650
 I start with the mp 7 at the first 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.870
 unlocked weapon if you have the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.670
 classes editor has unlocked yes that 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.000
 was unlock a lot in two or 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.320
 three sentences but okay I'll talk 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.600
 bit over the waffles bit over 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.550
 the swarm a bit over the turks 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.269
 which I use I leave here now 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.670
 fade in 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.399
 I have them at maximum and then I have 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.780
 whole list park used that not 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.090
 everyone uses that called technician 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.910
 and the technician is doing exactly 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.329
 Just so it all babies all 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.980
 shock charges all samples giant 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.289
 grenades and everything or grenades 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.910
 everything is marked in red and that one 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.070
 just a better overview or 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.870
 Survey about it just gets 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.149
 for shit on the head is thrown 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.440
 or if that is just a game around the 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.430
 corner and that maybe you 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.440
 should be here 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.120
 yes that's not so bad and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.949
 will that also be black ops for pc 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.780
 Anyhow, there are so many bouncing babies 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.869
 that you can almost fill with it 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.880
 it's a bit of coffee and there has 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.010
 you do not really care about yours 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.189
 Swarm without completion series and so on 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.560
 if all three days get there all three 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.180
 meter your bouncing part comes and there 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.140
 the brand will disappear before my 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.270
 eyes also cool so yes so technician is 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.759
 very good and it does others too 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.439
 things you can, for example, I believe 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.180
 not that you can not but if you 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.890
 For example , she builds she can see you 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.630
 shoot down you get 50 points for it 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.280
 I do even a few times and 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.130
 that is just as much as we have at the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.159
 enemy types confirmed in the connection and 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.100
 it's really worth it to try 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.780
 the opponent by the equipment and he 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.270
 then it gets nice and you get excited 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.530
 is pleased about over 50 points the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.950
 maybe a swab without 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.119
 conclusion series as I said help yes 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.700
 so what else is there when you go now 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.079
 really is so stupid and you look through 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.040
 the red does not go through the walls and runs 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.190
 nevertheless a partie 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.680
 or a baby, and which is activated 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.120
 look but do not go 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.160
 That's about two to three seconds 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.420
 you have extra time around her 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.140
 escaped or around then 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.670
 lie 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.960
 or you could just as well in the 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.810
 run away and then more 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.240
 Opponents fight to take care of the enemy 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.740
 in the upper floor fights and himself 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.120
 then wonder why exactly not court is 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:27.130
 yes what should I say yes in this 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.990
 play or in this match against a 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.520
 few mature and that's a great one 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.770
 I hide myself because I notice 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.900
 I am 40 in form and the form 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:42.580
 important business is running well enough 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.020
 a package war after that, unfortunately 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.450
 not one more before i think i am 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.370
 again 200 points from form 21 tree 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.830
 died 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.700
 yes so I think fucking tree form that 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.440
 you are always 21 points and me too 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.300
 already two times tilted what he nervous 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.800
 and here you can see the belated one too 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.030
 the stock exchanges Berlin and I can 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.209
 Do not worry about the two types 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.070
 counting them is a big problem 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.170
 in black ops 2 because they just have one 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.380
 screw up like graduation honor and so on and 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.970
 I do not just like that because of something like that 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.739
 It can not be said that you can build as well 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.720
 other new people should use it 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.959
 you should annoy it so negative anyway 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.000
 there are still frightened types the 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.030
 pensive on the kd is real shit because 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.610
 the nerves and such and I have with one 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.840
 smg no chance the gameplay past yes 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.850
 I can, I think a few people 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.560
 and it was then 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.010
 since then I still believe so 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.890
 I have missed on ability ' 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.900
 I do not have an oscar night 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.640
 it does not matter that 's it if you guys 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.950
 series likes the thumbs up 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.760
 when i was mother i was the pc that 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.760
 watch and see you then
