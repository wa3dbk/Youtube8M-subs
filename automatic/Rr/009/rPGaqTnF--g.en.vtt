00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
oven now I've preheated the oven on bake

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.030 
oven now I've preheated the oven on bake
at<00:03:06.550> 350<00:03:07.390> degrees<00:03:07.750> Fahrenheit<00:03:08.260> which<00:03:08.830> is<00:03:08.860> a

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
at 350 degrees Fahrenheit which is a

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.619 
at 350 degrees Fahrenheit which is a
hundred<00:03:09.400> ninety<00:03:09.580> degrees<00:03:09.849> Celsius<00:03:10.269> and<00:03:10.450> leave

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
hundred ninety degrees Celsius and leave

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.210 
hundred ninety degrees Celsius and leave
me<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:10.930> bake<00:03:11.080> in<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.319> oven<00:03:11.349> for<00:03:11.980> around<00:03:12.040> about
