00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
show get a little coming up so we're try

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.479 
show get a little coming up so we're try
to<00:00:51.239> really<00:00:51.660> dial<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.079> his<00:00:52.500> abdominals<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.399> you

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
to really dial in his abdominals so you

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.340 
to really dial in his abdominals so you
really<00:00:53.699> get<00:00:53.789> some<00:00:53.969> cut<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.510> what's<00:00:55.019> the<00:00:55.140> best

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
really get some cut and what's the best

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.959 
really get some cut and what's the best
way<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.559> do<00:00:55.859> that<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.339> really<00:00:56.579> bring<00:00:56.760> up<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
way to do that and really bring up the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.549 
way to do that and really bring up the
separation<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.960> pro<00:00:58.109> bodybuilder

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
separation like a like a pro bodybuilder

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.229 
separation like a like a pro bodybuilder
so<00:00:58.589> when<00:00:59.160> Ryan<00:00:59.339> was<00:00:59.429> coming<00:00:59.760> originally<00:01:00.149> it

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
so when Ryan was coming originally it

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.000 
so when Ryan was coming originally it
was<00:01:00.329> just<00:01:00.510> hitting<00:01:00.660> his<00:01:00.839> abs<00:01:01.050> he<00:01:01.649> was<00:01:01.769> hitting

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
was just hitting his abs he was hitting

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.680 
was just hitting his abs he was hitting
it<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.219> about<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.429> 70<00:01:02.850> percent<00:01:02.969> contraction<00:01:03.390> so

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
it to about a 70 percent contraction so

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.670 
it to about a 70 percent contraction so
let's<00:01:03.839> just<00:01:03.989> go<00:01:04.080> ahead<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.439> how<00:01:04.530> you're

let's just go ahead like how you're
hitting<00:01:04.860> before<00:01:05.009> just<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:05.369> an<00:01:05.460> avid<00:01:05.700> thigh

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
you can see there's a point where you

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.570 
you can see there's a point where you
get<00:02:01.260> to<00:02:01.350> about<00:02:01.440> 90%<00:02:01.740> really<00:02:02.160> okay<00:02:02.340> I'm<00:02:02.430> done

the air out and holding it there is what

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.590 
the air out and holding it there is what
we're<00:02:59.430> after<00:02:59.459> this<00:02:59.850> body<00:03:00.060> builders<00:03:00.390> and

we're after this body builders and

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.910 
we're after this body builders and
that's<00:03:00.750> why<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:00.959> body<00:03:01.200> bones<00:03:01.410> have<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.739> best

that's why I body bones have the best

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.050 
that's why I body bones have the best
