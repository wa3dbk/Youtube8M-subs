a body pic or gap and i'm going to test

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.730 
a body pic or gap and i'm going to test
it<00:00:13.790> against<00:00:14.030> the<00:00:14.299> poor<00:00:15.580> rs.800<00:00:16.580> CX<00:00:17.270> the<00:00:17.740> heart

accelerometer base training tool so

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.939 
accelerometer base training tool so
quickly<00:00:23.630> take<00:00:23.779> a<00:00:23.810> look<00:00:24.050> right<00:00:24.230> now<00:00:24.289> at<00:00:24.470> the

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
quickly take a look right now at the

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.089 
quickly take a look right now at the
calorie<00:00:25.759> number<00:00:26.119> that<00:00:26.900> i<00:00:26.929> have<00:00:27.199> currently<00:00:27.830> the

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
calorie number that i have currently the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.710 
calorie number that i have currently the
fuel<00:00:28.369> right<00:00:28.580> now<00:00:28.759> is<00:00:29.029> at<00:00:29.859> 3259<00:00:31.029> the<00:00:32.029> calories

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
fuel right now is at 3259 the calories

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.729 
fuel right now is at 3259 the calories
I've<00:00:32.870> learned<00:00:33.110> so<00:00:33.320> far<00:00:33.350> today<00:00:33.710> is<00:00:35.440> 1217<00:00:36.440> so<00:00:36.710> I

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
I've learned so far today is 1217 so I

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:37.870 
I've learned so far today is 1217 so I
want<00:00:36.950> to<00:00:37.010> make<00:00:37.100> note<00:00:37.250> of<00:00:37.280> that<00:00:37.460> number<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:37.790> I'm

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
want to make note of that number and I'm

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.360 
want to make note of that number and I'm
going<00:00:38.000> to<00:00:38.030> check<00:00:38.239> that<00:00:38.360> at<00:00:38.510> the<00:00:38.630> end<00:00:38.980> and<00:00:39.980> the

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
going to check that at the end and the

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.130 
going to check that at the end and the
steps<00:00:40.640> that<00:00:40.730> I've<00:00:40.910> taken<00:00:41.150> well<00:00:41.450> that's<00:00:41.690> over

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
steps that I've taken well that's over

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.700 
steps that I've taken well that's over
12,000<00:00:42.950> now<00:00:43.040> and<00:00:43.250> then<00:00:43.550> here<00:00:43.790> I've<00:00:43.910> got<00:00:43.940> my<00:00:44.710> my

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
12,000 now and then here I've got my my

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.800 
12,000 now and then here I've got my my
heart<00:00:46.400> rate<00:00:46.550> going<00:00:46.760> I'm<00:00:46.970> going<00:00:47.060> to<00:00:47.180> hit<00:00:47.300> start

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
heart rate going I'm going to hit start

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.670 
heart rate going I'm going to hit start
on<00:00:47.960> that<00:00:49.540> there<00:00:50.540> we<00:00:50.660> go<00:00:50.780> so<00:00:51.050> start<00:00:51.470> it's

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
on that there we go so start it's

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.180 
on that there we go so start it's
registering<00:00:52.070> my<00:00:52.250> heart<00:00:52.490> rate<00:00:52.670> and<00:00:53.950> it<00:00:54.950> has

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
registering my heart rate and it has

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.240 
registering my heart rate and it has
begun<00:00:55.430> recording<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.660> I'll<00:00:57.530> now<00:00:57.770> check<00:00:58.100> at<00:00:58.220> the

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
begun recording so I'll now check at the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.610 
begun recording so I'll now check at the
end<00:00:58.430> what<00:00:58.610> my<00:00:58.760> calorie<00:00:59.270> burn<00:00:59.510> is<00:00:59.720> and<00:00:59.900> I'll<00:01:00.440> get

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
end what my calorie burn is and I'll get

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.030

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
information now I let me preface this by

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.200 
information now I let me preface this by
saying<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.530> typically<00:01:28.920> burn<00:01:29.250> an<00:01:29.520> average<00:01:30.090> of

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
saying I typically burn an average of

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.300 
saying I typically burn an average of
four<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.810> six<00:01:31.080> hundred<00:01:31.140> calories<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.100> body

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
four to six hundred calories in a body

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.400 
four to six hundred calories in a body
pump<00:01:32.550> class<00:01:32.580> and<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:34.050> i'm<00:01:34.110> going<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.290> show<00:01:34.380> you

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
pump class and so i'm going to show you

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.620 
pump class and so i'm going to show you
the<00:01:34.680> results<00:01:35.100> right<00:01:35.220> now<00:01:35.370> okay<00:01:36.150> guys<00:01:36.300> i'm<00:01:36.480> just

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the results right now okay guys i'm just

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.630 
the results right now okay guys i'm just
going<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.810> quickly<00:01:36.960> show<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.740> calories

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
going to quickly show you the calories

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.300 
going to quickly show you the calories
that<00:01:38.670> i<00:01:38.790> burned<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.240> body<00:01:39.390> pump<00:01:39.630> class<00:01:40.310> so

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
that i burned in the body pump class so

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.120 
that i burned in the body pump class so
the<00:01:41.430> number<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.670> now<00:01:41.850> at<00:01:42.050> 1552<00:01:43.050> so<00:01:43.920> that's

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the number is now at 1552 so that's

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.750 
the number is now at 1552 so that's
quite<00:01:44.790> different<00:01:44.910> from<00:01:45.510> a<00:01:46.290> normal<00:01:46.740> body<00:01:47.490> pump

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
quite different from a normal body pump

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.880 
quite different from a normal body pump
class<00:01:47.820> for<00:01:48.210> me<00:01:48.300> i'm<00:01:48.479> usually<00:01:48.660> up<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> 400

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
class for me i'm usually up in the 400

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.300 
class for me i'm usually up in the 400
to<00:01:50.100> 600<00:01:50.460> count<00:01:50.910> calories<00:01:51.510> burned<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.290> an<00:01:53.160> hour

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
to 600 count calories burned in an hour

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.940 
to 600 count calories burned in an hour
and<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:54.240> tells<00:01:54.450> me<00:01:54.660> I'm<00:01:54.750> I've<00:01:55.350> only<00:01:55.560> burned

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
and this tells me I'm I've only burned

calories<00:04:03.900> burned<00:04:04.140> is<00:04:04.610> now<00:04:05.610> up<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:06.110> 859<00:04:07.110> and<00:04:09.709> let

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
calories burned is now up to 859 and let

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.110 
calories burned is now up to 859 and let
me<00:04:10.800> go<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.280> fuel<00:04:13.370> so<00:04:14.370> here's<00:04:14.640> my<00:04:14.700> fuel

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
me go to the fuel so here's my fuel

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.530 
me go to the fuel so here's my fuel
count<00:04:15.450> now<00:04:16.190> 22<00:04:17.209> 62<00:04:18.209> so<00:04:19.160> as<00:04:20.160> far<00:04:20.970> as<00:04:21.030> accuracy

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
count now 22 62 so as far as accuracy

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.970 
count now 22 62 so as far as accuracy
I'm<00:04:21.870> going<00:04:22.020> to<00:04:22.080> check<00:04:22.230> the<00:04:22.350> numbers<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:22.890> i'll

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
I'm going to check the numbers and i'll

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.090 
I'm going to check the numbers and i'll
get<00:04:23.070> back<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.370> you<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:23.610> that's<00:04:23.850> a<00:04:25.100> difference

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
get back to you so that's a difference

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.330 
get back to you so that's a difference

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.020 
workout and the nike fuelband only
calculated<00:04:38.660> 304<00:04:39.660> calories<00:04:40.170> so<00:04:40.490> i'm<00:04:41.490> guessing

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
calculated 304 calories so i'm guessing

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.600 
calculated 304 calories so i'm guessing
that<00:04:42.740> because<00:04:43.740> some<00:04:43.980> of<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.130> movements<00:04:44.340> were

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
that because some of the movements were

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.400 
that because some of the movements were
static<00:04:44.940> and<00:04:45.300> not<00:04:45.450> moving<00:04:45.840> forward<00:04:46.229> and

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
static and not moving forward and

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.710 
static and not moving forward and
backward<00:04:46.919> or<00:04:47.310> side<00:04:47.610> to<00:04:47.760> side<00:04:47.790> or<00:04:48.090> up<00:04:48.180> and<00:04:48.300> down

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
backward or side to side or up and down

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.560 
backward or side to side or up and down
that<00:04:48.990> it<00:04:49.110> wasn't<00:04:49.470> calculating<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.700> proper

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
that it wasn't calculating the proper

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.600 
that it wasn't calculating the proper
caloric<00:04:52.200> expenditure<00:04:52.320> of<00:04:52.830> those<00:04:53.100> exercises

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
caloric expenditure of those exercises

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.300 
caloric expenditure of those exercises
even<00:04:53.940> the<00:04:54.090> heart<00:04:54.300> rate<00:04:54.450> was<00:04:54.600> going<00:04:54.870> up<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.310> the

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
even the heart rate was going up and the

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.130 
even the heart rate was going up and the
intensity<00:04:56.760> of<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:56.970> workout<00:04:57.030> increased<00:04:57.750> so

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
intensity of the workout increased so

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.500 
intensity of the workout increased so
bear<00:04:58.950> that<00:04:58.980> in<00:04:59.160> mind<00:04:59.280> when<00:04:59.700> you're<00:04:59.730> deciding

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
bear that in mind when you're deciding

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.080 
bear that in mind when you're deciding
whether<00:05:01.140> or<00:05:01.230> not<00:05:01.380> to<00:05:01.470> choose<00:05:01.830> a<00:05:02.100> Nike<00:05:02.700> FuelBand

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
something like the bodybugg which
