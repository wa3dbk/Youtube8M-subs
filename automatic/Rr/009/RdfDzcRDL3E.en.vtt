00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
and none of that stuff and it was just a

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.170 
and none of that stuff and it was just a
little<00:00:36.270> boring<00:00:36.600> kind<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.800> don't<00:00:38.790> know<00:00:38.850> not

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
little boring kind of I don't know not

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.880 
little boring kind of I don't know not
not<00:00:39.660> really<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.079> good<00:00:40.260> as<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.500> could<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.710> been

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
not really as good as it could have been

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.700 
not really as good as it could have been
so<00:00:41.219> what<00:00:41.399> I've<00:00:41.520> done<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:42.270> taken<00:00:42.840> some<00:00:42.989> sculpey

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
so what I've done is taken some sculpey

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.270 
so what I've done is taken some sculpey
and<00:00:44.629> of<00:00:45.629> course<00:00:45.899> molded<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:48.620> baked<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.890> and

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
glued it on with a six thousand so it's

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.240 
glued it on with a six thousand so it's
on<00:00:52.890> there<00:00:53.719> there<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> spider<00:00:55.469> crawling<00:00:55.890> on

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
on there there is a spider crawling on

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.209 
on there there is a spider crawling on
me<00:00:57.379> now<00:00:58.379> there's<00:00:58.590> not<00:01:01.100> okay

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
me now there's not okay

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.149 
me now there's not okay
anyway<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.830> the<00:01:04.830> star<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.549> plastic<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:08.100> I

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
anyway and the star is plastic and I

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.219 
anyway and the star is plastic and I
wouldn't<00:01:08.460> recommend<00:01:08.880> lifting<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.960> up<00:01:10.049> like

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
wouldn't recommend lifting it up like

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.310 
wouldn't recommend lifting it up like
this<00:01:10.470> even<00:01:11.250> though<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.369> am<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:12.060> also<00:01:12.990> wouldn't

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
this even though I am I also wouldn't

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.859 
this even though I am I also wouldn't
recommend<00:01:13.530> dropping<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.420> even<00:01:15.420> though<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.689> is

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
recommend dropping it even though it is

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.590 
recommend dropping it even though it is
pretty<00:01:16.290> much<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.619> there<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.070> hot-glued<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.420> with

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
pretty much on there I hot-glued it with

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.560 
pretty much on there I hot-glued it with
extremely<00:01:19.259> high<00:01:19.650> temperature<00:01:20.369> glue<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.970> then

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
extremely high temperature glue and then

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.609 
extremely high temperature glue and then
I<00:01:21.630> went<00:01:21.900> back<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.670> put<00:01:23.670> some<00:01:24.420> e6000<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.470> to

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
I went back and put some e6000 on it to

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.249 
I went back and put some e6000 on it to
reinforce<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:26.939> there<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.450> then

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
reinforce it so it's on there and then

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.230 
reinforce it so it's on there and then
this<00:01:28.770> design<00:01:29.189> here<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.630> also<00:01:31.110> sculpey

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
this design here that is also sculpey

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.100 
this design here that is also sculpey
and<00:01:33.560> this<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.720> down<00:01:36.930> at<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.490 
green real faint orange but a lot of
people<00:01:56.909> said<00:01:57.270> hey<00:01:57.570> they're<00:01:57.930> supposed<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.409> be

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
people said hey they're supposed to be

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.910

white

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
white

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.190 
white
so<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.070> listened<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.790> made<00:02:00.390> them<00:02:00.509> white<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.990> I

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
so I listened and made them white and I

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.410 
so I listened and made them white and I
really<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:01.770> how<00:02:02.040> these<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.790> turned<00:02:03.030> out<00:02:03.210> I

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
really like how these have turned out I

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.539 
really like how these have turned out I
really<00:02:03.930> think<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:05.130> more

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
really think that the more

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.210 
really think that the more
three-dimensional<00:02:06.740> thing<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.009> balls

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
three-dimensional thing on the balls

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.240 
three-dimensional thing on the balls
just<00:02:08.819> really<00:02:09.239> adds<00:02:09.509> something<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.530> it
