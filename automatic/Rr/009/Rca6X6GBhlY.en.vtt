at<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.930> end<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.380> then<00:01:51.500> I<00:01:51.649> just<00:01:51.830> started

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
at the end and then I just started

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.430 
at the end and then I just started
running<00:01:52.369> a<00:01:52.430> fever<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:53.030> I'm<00:01:53.360> not<00:01:53.960> really<00:01:54.140> sure
