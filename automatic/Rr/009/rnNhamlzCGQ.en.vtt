00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.420
 tells crowd of baixaki games my name is 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.130
 Roberto and I did analysis days of 2015 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.080
 and now you'll check it out because I 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.740
 I found the most social day in 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.900
 story 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.759
 for those who do not know 2015 days is already the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.310
 sixth franchise game was released in 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.320
 2009 no if making a huge success 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.250
 but will it be that after so much time 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.470
 game will continue keeping sheet is the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.099
 who will now write the analysis with 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.099
 low vision 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.020
 what makes accidents so successful 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.840
 is his way of playing age composed by 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.030
 famous choreography hits and the 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.460
 competitive scoring system 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.100
 the positive aspect of the 2015 version is that 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.809
 game continues to maintain these elements the 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.879
 repertoire of songs is still the 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.309
 the title with a large 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:58.530
 diversity of new songs 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.530
 releases and big hits of 2014 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.640
 It's cool 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.590
 the 2015 version also counts on 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.850
 choreographies for both 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.860
 who wants to play more 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.780
 relaxed or competitive 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.940
 they continue to offer levels of 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.890
 various difficulty in addition to versions 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.900
 different for each song 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.940
 once again ubisoft proves that 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.009
 can please the target audience of the game 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.000
 which is very broad ranging from 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.670
 children to the elderly 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.229
 the just dance scoring system 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.560
 2015 remains the same as ever 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.869
 based on notes and stars points is a 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.149
 way it has neither how nor why 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.039
 be changed since it works very well 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.960
 since the first version of the game 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.310
 In addition the players are already 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.100
 accustomed to this kind of evaluation 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.460
 something important for a very casual game 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.710
 and with a varied public 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.660
 More Than Ever Said 2015 Account 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.440
 with the participation of games through 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.090
 videos 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.670
 the auto dance feature was slightly 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.350
 remodeled but continues to ensure good 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.429
 laughter to the players at the end of 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.040
 every song 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.750
 also the fun feature that the 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.179
 minister remix allows players to 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.709
 become choreographers recording their 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.110
 own dance steps 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.150
 thereafter the curatorial team of the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.739
 game creates a unique video with 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.780
 presentations from around the world 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.450
 to be released 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.040
 but these choreographies do not present 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.160
 accuracy when capturing the 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.160
 movements 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.510
 the game has challenges in all 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.430
 songs 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.890
 the challenge mode introduced in this 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.150
 edition lets you compete with your friends 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.709
 and people online 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.620
 even if they are not together with 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.420
 you do not even have a real time laine 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.280
 You too can be challenged. 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.470
 randomly by opponents of all 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.750
 world and check the weekly ranking of 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.310
 each song composed only by users 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.739
 Brazilians 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.569
 but the biggest absence of the game is in the 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.010
 inability to play games 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.480
 closed between friends who are online 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.030
 the multiplayer mode launched in 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.880
 2014 dissent is back with 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.380
 cordez flower competition that allows the 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.900
 players participate in competitions 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.299
 by team against people from all over the world 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.400
 this online mode allows people to 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.680
 who are playing alone can dance 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.720
 with users from different countries 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.519
 either for fun or for competition 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.650
 another novelty of this edition is that a 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.110
 unlimited number of people can play 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.640
 using the released controller application 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.950
 for android and then the s 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.120
 just download the application connect the 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.709
 choose game and play music 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.350
 however holding the cell phone is not as 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.599
 comfortable like dancing like the wii 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.849
 remote in hand but to play with 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.480
 people at a party the controller is a 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.480
 great request 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:53.470
 unfortunately 2015 days lost some 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.450
 skills in this version 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.489
 an example is the way this has been 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.340
 reduced only one calorie counter 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.169
 inserted in the choreography losing its 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.630
 ability to set goals and 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:07.419
 give a performance chart 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.340
 however a new game mode allows 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.530
 to you to dance frantically for a 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.680
 determined time that can be 10 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.690
 minutes to half an hour or even an hour 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.690
 you can also choose which 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.889
 music want to dance before starting 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.440
 scenarios that make up the choreographies 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.010
 have been further enhanced in this 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.960
 version 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.750
 several of them received a production 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.389
 grandiose and most exquisite is that of music 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.580
 dark horse sung by katy perry com 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.979
 Egyptian elements very well built 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.930
 animations and eye popping this that 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.560
 can be one of the most beautiful ever created 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.560
 for series 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.740
 2015 games innovated to stay more 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.600
 social and shareable without 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.970
 model that makes you famous 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.890
 the game keep what has been working as 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.560
 hits the success system 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.450
 punctuation and choreography, and 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.970
 time that adds new skills 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.400
 leaving the game much more 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.500
 competitive and interactive 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.720
