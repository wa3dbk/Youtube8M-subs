00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
of great strategy techniques is so much

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.569 
of great strategy techniques is so much
easier<00:03:24.849> to<00:03:25.629> control<00:03:25.810> behavior<00:03:26.079> and<00:03:26.650> classroom

and this program provides that again

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.819 
and this program provides that again
it's<00:03:31.000> an<00:03:31.090> alternative<00:03:31.569> method<00:03:31.870> that's<00:03:32.440> unique

those who are not as on a higher level
you<00:03:48.970> find<00:03:49.269> that<00:03:49.480> behavior<00:03:49.900> problems<00:03:50.230> are

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
you find that behavior problems are

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.559 
you find that behavior problems are
totally<00:03:50.530> non-existent<00:03:50.799> we<00:03:51.760> all<00:03:51.940> know<00:03:52.269> that

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
totally non-existent we all know that

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.030 
totally non-existent we all know that
you<00:03:53.169> could<00:03:53.290> be<00:03:53.349> the<00:03:53.440> greatest<00:03:53.620> teacher<00:03:53.859> in<00:03:53.950> the

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
you could be the greatest teacher in the

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.860 
you could be the greatest teacher in the
world<00:03:54.220> but<00:03:54.880> if<00:03:54.970> you<00:03:55.030> can't<00:03:55.120> handle<00:03:55.359> behavior

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
world but if you can't handle behavior

world but if you can't handle behavior
problems<00:03:56.260> well<00:03:56.650> what<00:03:57.069> are<00:03:57.130> we<00:03:57.220> going<00:03:57.310> to

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
problems well what are we going to

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.520 
problems well what are we going to
really<00:03:57.579> learn<00:03:57.700> well<00:03:58.569> the<00:03:58.660> hydroplane<00:03:59.109> program

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
really learn well the hydroplane program

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.620 
really learn well the hydroplane program
takes<00:03:59.980> care<00:04:00.190> of<00:04:00.220> that<00:04:00.370> for<00:04:00.579> you<00:04:00.700> students<00:04:01.510> get

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
takes care of that for you students get

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.000 
takes care of that for you students get
very<00:04:01.840> very<00:04:01.959> much<00:04:02.169> involved<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:02.859> very

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
very very much involved and very

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.440 
very very much involved and very
interested<00:04:03.459> in<00:04:03.669> what<00:04:03.730> they're<00:04:03.970> doing<00:04:04.030> and

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
interested in what they're doing and

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.770 
interested in what they're doing and
again<00:04:05.169> it's<00:04:05.410> infectious<00:04:05.919> so<00:04:06.790> teachers<00:04:07.660> have

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
again it's infectious so teachers have

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.229 
again it's infectious so teachers have
an<00:04:07.900> opportunity<00:04:08.139> to<00:04:08.769> see<00:04:09.250> alternative<00:04:10.030> ways

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
an opportunity to see alternative ways

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.470 
an opportunity to see alternative ways
of<00:04:10.540> reaching<00:04:10.780> children<00:04:11.260> because<00:04:11.919> as<00:04:12.069> we<00:04:12.160> know

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
of reaching children because as we know

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.240 
of reaching children because as we know
every<00:04:13.480> child<00:04:13.840> is<00:04:14.019> an<00:04:14.109> individual<00:04:14.560> and<00:04:14.769> it's

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
every child is an individual and it's

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.979 
every child is an individual and it's
very<00:04:15.400> important<00:04:15.879> that<00:04:16.060> we<00:04:16.239> approached<00:04:16.660> them

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
very important that we approached them

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.770 
very important that we approached them
as<00:04:17.139> individuals<00:04:17.979> and<00:04:18.099> again<00:04:18.789> constructivist

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
as individuals and again constructivist

graduating high school it even fewer are

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.540 
graduating high school it even fewer are
going<00:06:37.460> on<00:06:37.580> to<00:06:37.670> college<00:06:37.820> to<00:06:38.540> trade<00:06:38.780> school<00:06:39.110> and

going on to college to trade school and

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.590 
going on to college to trade school and
as<00:06:40.550> we<00:06:40.670> know<00:06:40.700> with<00:06:40.910> the<00:06:40.970> job<00:06:41.180> market<00:06:41.330> being

as we know with the job market being
what<00:06:41.720> it<00:06:41.750> is<00:06:41.840> today<00:06:42.050> and<00:06:42.640> education<00:06:43.640> is<00:06:43.820> the

what it is today and education is the
key<00:06:44.350> so<00:06:45.350> we<00:06:45.620> are<00:06:45.770> looking<00:06:46.340> at<00:06:46.490> a<00:06:46.550> reform

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
key so we are looking at a reform

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.690 
key so we are looking at a reform
movement<00:06:47.720> in<00:06:47.840> a<00:06:47.930> sense<00:06:48.190> we're<00:06:49.190> looking<00:06:49.460> at<00:06:49.610> an
