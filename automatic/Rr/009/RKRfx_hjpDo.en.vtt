00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
this thing white so that's basically

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.140 
this thing white so that's basically
what<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.170> did<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.670> don't<00:01:41.670> remember<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> name

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
what I did and don't remember the name

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.590 
what I did and don't remember the name
of<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.329> paint<00:01:43.399> it<00:01:44.399> did<00:01:44.729> run<00:01:44.909> out<00:01:44.939> since<00:01:45.479> it

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
of the paint it did run out since it

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.090 
of the paint it did run out since it
wasn't<00:01:45.750> very<00:01:45.990> much<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.500> did<00:01:46.740> throw<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:46.979> out

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
wasn't very much so I did throw it out

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.690 
wasn't very much so I did throw it out
my<00:01:47.250> bad

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
my bad

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.190 
my bad
but<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:49.549> was<00:01:50.549> pretty<00:01:50.700> good<00:01:50.850> paint<00:01:51.110> moving<00:01:52.110> it

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
but I was pretty good paint moving it

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.929 
but I was pretty good paint moving it
doesn't<00:01:52.439> really<00:01:52.649> chip<00:01:52.979> off<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.790> guys

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
doesn't really chip off and you guys

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.240 
doesn't really chip off and you guys
might<00:01:54.149> see<00:01:54.299> some<00:01:54.479> green<00:01:54.720> spots<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.290> him<00:01:55.500> but

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
might see some green spots on him but

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.399 
might see some green spots on him but
that<00:01:57.030> was<00:01:57.210> actually<00:01:57.390> intended<00:01:57.869> because<00:01:58.229> I

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
that was actually intended because I

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.249 
that was actually intended because I
looked<00:01:58.799> up<00:01:58.920> some<00:01:59.130> pictures<00:01:59.490> by<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.659> snowy

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
looked up some pictures by a snowy

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.499 
looked up some pictures by a snowy
Arctic<00:02:01.770> ghillie<00:02:01.979> suit<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.460> uh<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.299> tripped

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
Arctic ghillie suit and uh it tripped

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.880 
Arctic ghillie suit and uh it tripped
some<00:02:03.659> gray<00:02:03.869> markings<00:02:04.290> on<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.770> actually

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
some gray markings on it and I actually

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.109 
some gray markings on it and I actually
didn't<00:02:05.189> want<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.399> paint<00:02:05.549> grey<00:02:05.790> over<00:02:06.060> it

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
didn't want to paint grey over it

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:06.980 
didn't want to paint grey over it
because<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.360> thought<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.570> would<00:02:06.659> look<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.810> little

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
because I thought it would look a little

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.680 
because I thought it would look a little
weird<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.439> actually<00:02:07.590> left<00:02:07.890> some<00:02:08.069> green<00:02:08.310> on

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
weird so I actually left some green on

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.940 
weird so I actually left some green on
so<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.989> think<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.379> would<00:02:10.500> look<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.679> little<00:02:10.800> bit

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
so I think that would look a little bit

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.780 
so I think that would look a little bit
better

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
better

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.670 
better
I<00:02:11.879> thought<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.510> would<00:02:12.659> and<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:13.140> turned<00:02:13.590> out

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
I thought it would and it turned out

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.250 
I thought it would and it turned out
pretty<00:02:13.860> pretty<00:02:14.400> good<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:14.989> I'm<00:02:15.989> gonna<00:02:16.079> give<00:02:16.230> you

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
pretty pretty good so I'm gonna give you

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.110 
pretty pretty good so I'm gonna give you
guys<00:02:16.379> a<00:02:16.439> little<00:02:16.560> closer<00:02:16.950> look<00:02:17.219> at<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:17.730> I

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
guys a little closer look at it and I

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.009 
guys a little closer look at it and I
watch<00:02:18.299> the<00:02:18.480> face<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:21.390> same<00:02:21.569> color<00:02:21.780> because<00:02:21.989> I

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
watch the face the same color because I

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.259 
watch the face the same color because I
didn't<00:02:22.230> want<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:22.439> paint<00:02:22.590> over<00:02:22.799> it<00:02:23.239> because<00:02:24.239> I

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
didn't want to paint over it because I

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.809 
didn't want to paint over it because I
thought<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.480> looks<00:02:24.659> fine<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:26.250> think<00:02:26.640> it

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
thought it looks fine and I think it

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.289 
thought it looks fine and I think it
turned<00:02:26.909> out<00:02:27.030> pretty<00:02:27.090> good<00:02:27.359> so<00:02:32.030> as<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.120> can<00:02:33.239> see

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
turned out pretty good so as you can see

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.929 
turned out pretty good so as you can see
me<00:02:33.569> little<00:02:33.810> green<00:02:34.049> markings<00:02:34.530> but<00:02:34.799> not<00:02:35.549> too<00:02:35.790> big

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
me little green markings but not too big

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.660 
me little green markings but not too big
of<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.150> deal<00:02:36.299> if<00:02:36.689> you<00:02:36.810> ask<00:02:36.959> me<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.439> think<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.579> was

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
of a deal if you ask me I think that was

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.809 
of a deal if you ask me I think that was
actually<00:02:39.060> was<00:02:39.209> intended<00:02:39.659> so<00:02:40.340> because<00:02:41.340> the

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
actually was intended so because the

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.589 
actually was intended so because the
ghillie<00:02:42.090> suit<00:02:42.269> isn't<00:02:42.510> all<00:02:42.689> white<00:02:44.299> but<00:02:45.299> yeah

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
ghillie suit isn't all white but yeah

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.399 
ghillie suit isn't all white but yeah
the<00:02:46.260> articulation<00:02:46.920> still<00:02:47.250> works<00:02:48.170> but<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.349> a

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
the articulation still works but it is a

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.159 
the articulation still works but it is a
little<00:02:49.680> stiff<00:02:49.980> being<00:02:50.639> since<00:02:50.879> the<00:02:51.060> paint<00:02:51.299> just

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:52.169 
little stiff being since the paint just

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.500 
little stiff being since the paint just
dried

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
dried

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.039 
dried
about<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.019> week<00:02:55.290> ago<00:02:55.470> but<00:02:56.959> even<00:02:57.959> though<00:02:58.019> that

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
about a week ago but even though that

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.929 
about a week ago but even though that
doesn't<00:02:58.290> really<00:02:58.500> make<00:02:58.680> any<00:02:58.829> sense<00:02:58.889> it's<00:02:59.639> still

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
doesn't really make any sense it's still

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.089 
doesn't really make any sense it's still
stiff<00:03:00.180> for<00:03:00.359> some<00:03:00.510> reason<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.500> arms<00:03:01.769> are<00:03:01.889> fine

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
stiff for some reason the arms are fine

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.520 
stiff for some reason the arms are fine
but<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.430> legs<00:03:02.730> are<00:03:03.209> a<00:03:03.269> little<00:03:03.569> stiff<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:05.480> yeah

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
but the legs are a little stiff and yeah

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.490 
but the legs are a little stiff and yeah
and<00:03:08.269> I<00:03:09.269> think<00:03:09.599> it's<00:03:09.840> really<00:03:10.049> cool<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.319> have<00:03:10.409> an

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
and I think it's really cool to have an

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.289 
and I think it's really cool to have an
articulate<00:03:10.950> suit<00:03:11.189> in<00:03:11.310> anyone's<00:03:12.120> collection

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299

here<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.000> my<00:03:45.269> custom<00:03:45.949> jungle<00:03:46.949> ghibli<00:03:47.400> suit<00:03:47.639> and

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:48.229 
here is my custom jungle ghibli suit and

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:51.680 
here is my custom jungle ghibli suit and
megabox<00:03:49.229> actually<00:03:49.739> made<00:03:49.919> a<00:03:50.099> very<00:03:50.549> nice<00:03:50.879> green

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
megabox actually made a very nice green

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.509 
megabox actually made a very nice green
one<00:03:51.930> I'm<00:03:52.109> very<00:03:52.169> happy<00:03:52.680> with<00:03:52.799> it<00:03:52.829> turned<00:03:53.099> up<00:03:53.220> but

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
one I'm very happy with it turned up but

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.550 
one I'm very happy with it turned up but
this<00:03:54.090> one<00:03:54.150> is<00:03:54.389> more<00:03:54.599> of<00:03:54.629> a<00:03:54.750> woodland<00:03:55.139> camo<00:03:55.439> I

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
this one is more of a woodland camo I

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.280 
this one is more of a woodland camo I
think<00:03:55.889> because<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.729> has<00:03:56.760> more<00:03:57.449> Brown<00:03:57.810> on<00:03:58.139> it

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
think because it has more Brown on it

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.619 
think because it has more Brown on it
and<00:03:58.819> some<00:03:59.819> right<00:04:00.120> if<00:04:00.269> you<00:04:00.389> look<00:04:00.540> very

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
and some right if you look very

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.500 
and some right if you look very
carefully<00:04:01.729> but<00:04:02.729> that<00:04:02.879> might<00:04:03.060> only<00:04:03.209> be<00:04:03.299> his

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
carefully but that might only be his

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.509 
carefully but that might only be his
mine<00:04:03.689> but<00:04:03.989> I<00:04:04.199> thought<00:04:04.739> I<00:04:04.799> needed<00:04:05.069> to<00:04:05.129> make<00:04:05.280> like

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
mine but I thought I needed to make like

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.420 
mine but I thought I needed to make like
more<00:04:05.790> of<00:04:05.819> a<00:04:05.970> jungle<00:04:06.239> one<00:04:06.510> so<00:04:06.750> I<00:04:06.780> painted<00:04:07.430> very

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
more of a jungle one so I painted very

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.030 
more of a jungle one so I painted very
dark<00:04:08.819> green<00:04:09.209> paint<00:04:09.479> on<00:04:09.659> it<00:04:10.319> ghillie<00:04:10.620> suit<00:04:10.829> and

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
dark green paint on it ghillie suit and

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.830 
dark green paint on it ghillie suit and
it<00:04:11.400> turned<00:04:11.609> out<00:04:11.669> very<00:04:11.729> nice<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:12.479> I<00:04:12.629> even

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
it turned out very nice and I even

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.339 
it turned out very nice and I even
painted<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.199> face<00:04:13.409> and<00:04:14.299> he's<00:04:15.299> not<00:04:15.959> hard<00:04:16.259> to

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
painted the face and he's not hard to

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.430 
painted the face and he's not hard to
see<00:04:16.500> obviously<00:04:16.949> in<00:04:17.009> there<00:04:17.159> but<00:04:17.340> I<00:04:17.959> like<00:04:18.959> how<00:04:19.380> he

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
see obviously in there but I like how he

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.810 
see obviously in there but I like how he
camouflages<00:04:20.070> in<00:04:20.190> there<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.370> think<00:04:20.579> that<00:04:20.669> looks

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
camouflages in there I think that looks

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.730 
camouflages in there I think that looks
really<00:04:21.060> nice<00:04:21.329> if<00:04:22.109> you<00:04:22.260> guys<00:04:22.349> have<00:04:22.529> a<00:04:22.590> lot<00:04:22.710> of

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
suit and he almost looks like he's

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.220 
suit and he almost looks like he's
painted<00:04:46.980> in<00:04:47.100> black<00:04:47.460> paint<00:04:47.820> but<00:04:48.240> in<00:04:48.600> person

painted in black paint but in person

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.190

he's actually in dark green and at first
I<00:04:52.470> didn't<00:04:52.770> think<00:04:52.889> this<00:04:53.040> was<00:04:53.190> going<00:04:53.340> to<00:04:53.400> be<00:04:53.550> a

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
I didn't think this was going to be a

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.320 
I didn't think this was going to be a
good<00:04:53.790> idea<00:04:54.200> because<00:04:55.200> I<00:04:55.740> didn't<00:04:56.160> think<00:04:56.190> that<00:04:56.700> it

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
good idea because I didn't think that it

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.909 
good idea because I didn't think that it
was<00:04:57.419> really<00:04:57.630> necessary<00:04:57.870> being<00:04:58.470> it<00:04:58.620> there<00:04:58.800> was

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
was really necessary being it there was

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.159 
was really necessary being it there was
already<00:04:59.040> a<00:04:59.160> green<00:04:59.400> one<00:04:59.610> but<00:04:59.910> in<00:05:00.660> the<00:05:00.780> aftermath

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
already a green one but in the aftermath

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.230 
already a green one but in the aftermath
it<00:05:01.320> turned<00:05:01.530> out<00:05:01.620> really<00:05:01.830> good<00:05:02.010> so<00:05:02.520> maybe<00:05:03.150> you

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
it turned out really good so maybe you

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.670 
it turned out really good so maybe you
guys<00:05:03.360> a<00:05:03.389> closer<00:05:03.750> look<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.290> I<00:05:04.350> pretty<00:05:04.590> much

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
guys a closer look and I pretty much

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.810 
guys a closer look and I pretty much
paint<00:05:05.100> over<00:05:06.320> everything<00:05:07.320> other<00:05:08.040> than<00:05:08.669> the

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
paint over everything other than the

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.400 
paint over everything other than the
hands<00:05:09.210> here<00:05:09.479> and<00:05:09.690> I<00:05:11.030> really<00:05:12.030> like<00:05:12.410> how

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
hands here and I really like how

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.360 
hands here and I really like how
something<00:05:13.770> turned<00:05:14.130> out<00:05:14.280> is<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.639> face<00:05:14.940> because

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
something turned out is the face because

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.530 
something turned out is the face because
it<00:05:17.370> looks<00:05:17.550> like<00:05:17.610> he's<00:05:17.820> kind<00:05:17.970> of<00:05:18.090> got<00:05:18.210> a<00:05:18.240> mask

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
it looks like he's kind of got a mask

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.690 
it looks like he's kind of got a mask
here<00:05:18.840> and<00:05:19.050> I<00:05:19.680> wanted<00:05:20.160> to<00:05:20.220> paint<00:05:20.400> over<00:05:20.610> the

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
here and I wanted to paint over the

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.990 
here and I wanted to paint over the
whole<00:05:20.820> face<00:05:21.000> other<00:05:21.270> than<00:05:21.300> his<00:05:21.570> eyes<00:05:21.720> so

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
whole face other than his eyes so

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.750 
whole face other than his eyes so
obviously<00:05:24.000> so<00:05:24.150> he<00:05:24.180> could<00:05:24.450> see<00:05:25.430> and<00:05:26.430> it<00:05:26.610> looks

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
obviously so he could see and it looks

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.900 
obviously so he could see and it looks
pretty<00:05:26.970> cool<00:05:27.150> if<00:05:27.270> you<00:05:27.389> ask<00:05:27.419> me<00:05:27.810> so<00:05:28.289> I<00:05:28.350> like<00:05:28.590> that

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.350 

and<00:05:32.910> I<00:05:33.000> do<00:05:33.060> like<00:05:33.390> it<00:05:33.770> and<00:05:34.940> I<00:05:35.940> think<00:05:36.000> in<00:05:36.300> the

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
and I do like it and I think in the

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.159 
and I do like it and I think in the
future<00:05:36.720> the<00:05:36.840> paint<00:05:37.080> might<00:05:37.410> fall<00:05:37.620> off<00:05:37.800> but<00:05:39.169> at

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
future the paint might fall off but at

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.700 
future the paint might fall off but at
least<00:05:40.350> for<00:05:40.500> another<00:05:40.560> a<00:05:42.050> few<00:05:43.050> months<00:05:43.320> I<00:05:43.410> think<00:05:43.470> I

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
least for another a few months I think I

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.460 
least for another a few months I think I
might<00:05:43.890> be<00:05:44.039> good<00:05:44.250> who<00:05:44.789> knows<00:05:45.110> I'm<00:05:46.110> not<00:05:46.289> really

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
might be good who knows I'm not really

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.250 
might be good who knows I'm not really
good<00:05:46.710> with<00:05:46.740> paint<00:05:47.100> so<00:05:47.310> I'm<00:05:47.400> not<00:05:47.960> too<00:05:48.960> much<00:05:48.990> of

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
good with paint so I'm not too much of

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.560 
good with paint so I'm not too much of
an<00:05:49.350> expert<00:05:49.800> with<00:05:50.010> how<00:05:50.130> it<00:05:50.250> works<00:05:50.430> I'm<00:05:51.360> sure

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570

so<00:06:35.310> get<00:06:35.520> on<00:06:35.610> this<00:06:35.789> that<00:06:36.090> I<00:06:36.270> just<00:06:36.810> might

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
so get on this that I just might

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.110 
so get on this that I just might
to<00:06:37.229> stick<00:06:37.470> with<00:06:37.650> it<00:06:37.800> but<00:06:38.099> I<00:06:38.340> really<00:06:38.669> like<00:06:39.000> the

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
to stick with it but I really like the

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.749 
to stick with it but I really like the
way<00:06:39.240> my<00:06:39.270> custom<00:06:39.810> turned<00:06:40.020> out<00:06:40.460> so<00:06:41.460> it's<00:06:41.580> kind<00:06:41.729> of

way my custom turned out so it's kind of

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:45.309 
way my custom turned out so it's kind of
hard<00:06:41.849> to<00:06:42.000> decide<00:06:42.270> if<00:06:42.360> you<00:06:42.449> ask<00:06:42.569> me<00:06:42.780> but<00:06:43.069> yeah

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319 
hard to decide if you ask me but yeah

than<00:06:50.520> I<00:06:50.610> intended<00:06:50.759> but<00:06:51.229> I<00:06:52.229> kind<00:06:52.830> of<00:06:52.889> wanted<00:06:53.099> to

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:53.159 
than I intended but I kind of wanted to

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:55.430 
than I intended but I kind of wanted to
go<00:06:53.370> over<00:06:53.400> every<00:06:53.879> every<00:06:54.509> little<00:06:54.750> process<00:06:54.990> that

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:56.669 
I went through when I was painting them

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:00.950 
I went through when I was painting them
and<00:06:56.909> I<00:06:56.940> actually<00:06:59.030> intended<00:07:00.030> to<00:07:00.120> do<00:07:00.270> a<00:07:00.300> desert

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960

and I actually intended to do a desert
one<00:07:01.110> as<00:07:01.259> well<00:07:01.500> but<00:07:01.979> the<00:07:02.430> problem<00:07:02.789> with<00:07:02.879> that

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:02.909 
one as well but the problem with that

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:04.369 
one as well but the problem with that
was<00:07:03.060> I<00:07:03.240> couldn't<00:07:03.599> find<00:07:03.750> the<00:07:03.870> right<00:07:03.900> paint<00:07:04.259> I

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
actually bought this sand paint that's

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.869 
actually bought this sand paint that's
what<00:07:07.080> it<00:07:07.169> was<00:07:07.229> called<00:07:07.530> and<00:07:07.830> it<00:07:08.370> did<00:07:08.550> turn<00:07:08.759> out

00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:08.879 
what it was called and it did turn out

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:10.219 
what it was called and it did turn out
well<00:07:09.090> and<00:07:09.120> I<00:07:09.300> went<00:07:09.419> back<00:07:09.599> to<00:07:09.750> Michael's<00:07:10.110> and<00:07:10.199> I

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:10.229 
well and I went back to Michael's and I

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:12.350 
well and I went back to Michael's and I
didn't<00:07:10.469> have<00:07:10.620> it<00:07:10.650> so<00:07:10.770> I<00:07:11.129> said<00:07:12.060> you<00:07:12.150> know<00:07:12.240> what

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 
didn't have it so I said you know what

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.339 
didn't have it so I said you know what
I'm<00:07:12.449> just<00:07:12.599> going<00:07:12.719> to<00:07:12.750> give<00:07:12.900> up<00:07:12.990> on<00:07:13.139> that<00:07:13.229> idea

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:13.349 
I'm just going to give up on that idea

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:14.899 
I'm just going to give up on that idea
because<00:07:13.710> I<00:07:13.770> don't<00:07:13.919> really<00:07:14.069> want<00:07:14.400> a<00:07:14.490> desert<00:07:14.759> one

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:14.909 
because I don't really want a desert one

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:17.209 
because I don't really want a desert one
anyways<00:07:15.300> I<00:07:15.870> just<00:07:16.139> really<00:07:16.500> wanted<00:07:16.740> an<00:07:16.860> Arctic
