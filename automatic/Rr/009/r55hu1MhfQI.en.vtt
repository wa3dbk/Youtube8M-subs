00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.870
 turn back the old dream 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.600
 man but unfortunately for now 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.290
 no tangible steps in this 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.299
 direction failed 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.019
 when can you find the numbers that go to 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.339
 attack direction 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.210
 how time is counted back 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.699
 Here we will try to make such watches 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.869
 making today it is done to us 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.989
 need the easiest Chinese 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:31.609
 alarm clock classes 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.399
 and there altogether royal novels are such 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.980
 potential will most likely not 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.960
 will survive 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.800
 device principle of action Kabantsev 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.820
 alarm clock 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.970
 extremely simple 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.970
 let's open it and see 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.640
 electronic circuit 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.830
 produces pulses with a frequency of 1 5 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.830
 ghz which go to coil 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.390
 driving special 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.390
 gear wheel 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.530
 with magnet inside 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.390
 formed in a kind of ball 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.590
 engine 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.220
 decisive half a turn per second 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.990
 so to change direction 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.740
 rotation of the arrows is necessary to 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.050
 gear set in motion 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.480
 whole mechanism 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.730
 reversed which is easy 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.090
 get a polarity reversal 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.750
 interview just turn over 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.750
 coils 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.270
 interest rates 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.370
 but neatly 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.410
 like i couldn't 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.410
 job postponed 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.890
 then we collect our watches 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.769
 you can be sure that now 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.189
 moving backwards 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.299
 So we got such an interesting souvenirs 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:20.790
 if you add a mechanism 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.919
 appropriate as baku who else 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.450
 unusual interior decoration
