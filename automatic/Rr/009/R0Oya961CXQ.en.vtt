little bit of control over the exposure

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.969 
little bit of control over the exposure
in<00:01:04.820> your<00:01:05.299> camera<00:01:05.720> so<00:01:05.960> you<00:01:06.049> put<00:01:06.229> exposure<00:01:06.650> and

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
in your camera so you put exposure and

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.740 
the on the canon g9 the exposure
compensation<00:01:12.830> button<00:01:13.670> is<00:01:13.880> right<00:01:14.330> here

meter down like here and it has a minus
plus<00:01:28.070> meter<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:29.020> sometimes<00:01:30.020> you'll<00:01:30.170> find

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
plus meter and sometimes you'll find

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
this exposure compensation feature

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.180 
this exposure compensation feature
inside<00:01:34.730> your<00:01:35.330> camera's<00:01:35.720> menu<00:01:36.230> sometimes

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
man you if you can't find it and you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.360 
man you if you can't find it and you
know<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:44.480> look<00:01:44.870> it<00:01:44.990> up<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.290> see<00:01:45.409> where<00:01:46.100> it<00:01:46.190> is

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
know and look it up and see where it is

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.270 
know and look it up and see where it is
once<00:01:47.360> you<00:01:47.510> find<00:01:47.780> it<00:01:47.870> it's<00:01:48.020> pretty<00:01:48.110> easy<00:01:48.350> if<00:01:49.100> you

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
once you find it it's pretty easy if you

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.730 
once you find it it's pretty easy if you
have<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.520> picture<00:01:49.880> sort<00:01:50.360> of<00:01:50.510> like<00:01:50.630> say<00:01:51.590> you<00:01:51.650> have

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
have a picture sort of like say you have

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.130 
have a picture sort of like say you have
a<00:01:51.830> subject<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:53.360> want<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:53.690> add<00:01:53.960> a<00:01:53.990> little

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
a subject and you want to add a little

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.200 
a subject and you want to add a little
bit<00:01:54.290> more<00:01:54.500> light<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:55.100> subject<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:56.000> just

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
bit more light to the subject you just

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.270 
bit more light to the subject you just
take<00:01:56.360> it<00:01:56.540> to<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.840> right<00:01:57.050> and<00:01:57.830> it<00:01:58.070> brings<00:01:58.190> a

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
take it to the right and it brings a

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.760 
take it to the right and it brings a
little<00:01:58.400> bit<00:01:58.580> more<00:01:58.729> like<00:01:58.970> now<00:01:59.240> on<00:01:59.479> this<00:02:00.170> video

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
little bit more like now on this video

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.800 
little bit more like now on this video
you<00:02:01.190> might<00:02:01.220> not<00:02:01.550> it<00:02:01.820> might<00:02:02.090> not<00:02:02.240> be<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.540> same

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
you might not it might not be the same

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.630 
you might not it might not be the same
quite<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.290> same<00:02:03.500> thing<00:02:03.530> but<00:02:04.040> it<00:02:04.310> gives<00:02:04.400> you<00:02:04.520> an

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
quite the same thing but it gives you an

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.480 
quite the same thing but it gives you an
idea<00:02:04.960> so<00:02:05.960> you<00:02:06.020> take<00:02:06.260> it<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.799> right<00:02:07.010> to<00:02:07.340> add

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
idea so you take it to the right to add

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.729 
idea so you take it to the right to add
more<00:02:07.729> light<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:08.149> then<00:02:08.720> if<00:02:08.899> you're<00:02:09.379> in<00:02:09.649> a

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
more light and then if you're in a

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.770 
more light and then if you're in a
situation<00:02:09.769> where<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:11.209> need<00:02:11.390> a<00:02:11.450> little<00:02:11.659> bit
