crop pattern that's a possibility I'm

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.890 
crop pattern that's a possibility I'm
not<00:02:14.380> sure<00:02:14.440> coaster<00:02:15.370> good<00:02:15.580> for<00:02:15.819> impaling<00:02:16.299> I

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
not sure coaster good for impaling I

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.930 
not sure coaster good for impaling I
think<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:17.650> i<00:02:17.860> think<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:18.100> is<00:02:18.160> indeed<00:02:18.489> another

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
think so i think this is indeed another
