00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.980 
got about this set the only one if you
guys<00:01:50.460> do<00:01:50.670> have<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> other<00:01:51.030> four<00:01:51.299> Cyclops's

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
guys do have the other four Cyclops's

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.289 
guys do have the other four Cyclops's
you<00:01:52.259> would<00:01:52.439> know<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.640> does<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:53.820> painted

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
you would know that it does have painted

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.230 
you would know that it does have painted
weapons<00:01:54.659> mm-hmm<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.890> case<00:01:56.100> here<00:01:56.310> it's<00:01:56.939> black

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
weapons mm-hmm that case here it's black

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.260 
weapons mm-hmm that case here it's black
all<00:01:57.509> black<00:01:57.540> not<00:01:58.350> painted<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.640> megabucks<00:02:00.090> went

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
all black not painted so megabucks went

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.850 
all black not painted so megabucks went
lazy<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.630> us<00:02:00.780> again<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.320> they<00:02:01.439> didn't<00:02:01.680> do<00:02:01.740> it

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
lazy on us again and they didn't do it

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.859 
lazy on us again and they didn't do it
but<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.399> think<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.759> reason<00:02:02.909> for<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.659> is

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
but I think the reason for that is

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.179 
but I think the reason for that is
because<00:02:03.899> they<00:02:04.170> gave<00:02:04.320> us<00:02:04.439> two<00:02:04.590> traffic<00:02:04.829> cones

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
because they gave us two traffic cones

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.490 
because they gave us two traffic cones
but<00:02:06.030> i'd<00:02:06.210> still<00:02:06.240> rather<00:02:06.899> have<00:02:07.110> two<00:02:07.200> painted

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
but i'd still rather have two painted

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.469 
but i'd still rather have two painted
weapon<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:08.580> that's<00:02:08.759> that's<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.179> little<00:02:09.360> odd

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
weapon so that's that's a little odd

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.210 
weapon so that's that's a little odd
that<00:02:09.750> they<00:02:09.929> didn't<00:02:10.140> do<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.890> other<00:02:11.009> four

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
that they didn't do that the other four

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.450 
that they didn't do that the other four
cyclops<00:02:11.580> didn't<00:02:12.060> have<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.360> painted<00:02:12.660> weapon

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
cyclops didn't have the painted weapon

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.180 
cyclops didn't have the painted weapon
so<00:02:13.820> who<00:02:14.660> cares<00:02:14.870> oats<00:02:15.170> it's<00:02:15.410> really<00:02:15.770> not<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.100> big

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
so who cares oats it's really not a big

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.090 
so who cares oats it's really not a big
deal<00:02:16.340> but<00:02:16.550> just<00:02:17.420> kind<00:02:17.660> of<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:17.960> mean<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:18.590> easy<00:02:18.860> for

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
deal but just kind of I mean so easy for

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.270 
deal but just kind of I mean so easy for
me<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.220> do<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:19.430> shall<00:02:19.730> hit<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.180> but<00:02:20.780> um<00:02:21.160> here<00:02:22.160> is

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
me to do I shall hit it but um here is

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.770 
me to do I shall hit it but um here is
this<00:02:22.430> marine<00:02:22.730> compared<00:02:23.120> next<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.570> one<00:02:23.720> on

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
this marine compared next to the one on

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.140 
this marine compared next to the one on
the<00:02:23.900> weapons<00:02:24.200> back<00:02:24.380> I<00:02:24.680> still<00:02:25.550> like<00:02:25.790> this<00:02:25.940> one<00:02:26.120> a

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
the weapons back I still like this one a

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.610 
the weapons back I still like this one a
little<00:02:26.240> bit<00:02:26.420> better<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:26.810> just<00:02:27.380> because<00:02:27.560> his

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
little bit better I just because his

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.790 
little bit better I just because his
head<00:02:27.830> mold<00:02:28.070> is<00:02:28.190> amazing<00:02:28.960> there<00:02:29.960> was<00:02:30.140> very<00:02:30.470> cool

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
head mold is amazing there was very cool

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.590 
head mold is amazing there was very cool
figures<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.490> definitely<00:02:32.060> going<00:02:32.210> to<00:02:32.270> be<00:02:32.360> armed

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
figures and definitely going to be armed

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.080 
figures and definitely going to be armed
building<00:02:32.900> both<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.260> them<00:02:33.730> might<00:02:34.730> get<00:02:34.880> another

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
building both of them might get another

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.790 
building both of them might get another
one<00:02:35.300> of<00:02:35.420> this<00:02:35.510> probably<00:02:36.260> just<00:02:36.320> two<00:02:36.680> or<00:02:36.770> three

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
one of this probably just two or three

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.640 
one of this probably just two or three
