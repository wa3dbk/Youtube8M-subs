00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.320 
up and down on this it took me about
three<00:02:41.410> minutes<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.860> finally<00:02:42.250> get<00:02:42.489> it<00:02:42.640> this<00:02:43.150> is

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
three minutes to finally get it this is

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.390 
three minutes to finally get it this is
like<00:02:43.510> my<00:02:43.690> second<00:02:44.080> time<00:02:44.200> doing<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.590> but<00:02:44.860> you

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
like my second time doing it but you

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.420 
like my second time doing it but you
soon<00:02:45.730> get<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.750> gets<00:02:47.739> a<00:02:47.800> little<00:02:47.920> tricky<00:02:48.280> but

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
soon get it it gets a little tricky but

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.330 
soon get it it gets a little tricky but
after<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:48.760> couple<00:02:48.940> of<00:02:49.090> times<00:02:49.269> doing<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:51.100> get

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
after a couple of times doing it you get

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.840 
after a couple of times doing it you get
it<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:56.260> just<00:02:56.440> keep<00:02:56.620> at<00:02:56.830> it<00:02:56.860> it<00:02:57.489> gets<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.730> little

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
it so just keep at it it gets a little

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.340 
it so just keep at it it gets a little
frustrating<00:02:58.450> as<00:02:58.569> you<00:02:58.690> see<00:02:58.840> my<00:02:58.989> friends

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
frustrating as you see my friends

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.830 
frustrating as you see my friends

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
already in it over there works better in

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.430 
already in it over there works better in
third<00:03:02.050> person<00:03:02.230> see<00:03:02.680> boom<00:03:02.950> right<00:03:03.519> in<00:03:03.580> it

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
third person see boom right in it

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.960 
third person see boom right in it
alright<00:03:05.440> so<00:03:05.800> you're<00:03:06.069> not<00:03:06.220> inside<00:03:06.819> the

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
alright so you're not inside the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.490 
alright so you're not inside the
building<00:03:07.209> you're<00:03:07.360> like<00:03:07.510> glitch<00:03:07.780> in<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.260> roof

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
building you're like glitch in the roof

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.340 
building you're like glitch in the roof
so<00:03:08.980> if<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.160> crouch<00:03:09.480> you're<00:03:10.480> like<00:03:10.690> floating<00:03:11.080> in

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
so if you crouch you're like floating in

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.319 
so if you crouch you're like floating in
the<00:03:11.440> air<00:03:11.470> but<00:03:12.069> you<00:03:12.130> can<00:03:12.310> see<00:03:12.550> down<00:03:12.730> below<00:03:12.910> like

the air but you can see down below like

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.610 
the air but you can see down below like
I<00:03:13.510> tried<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.870> set<00:03:14.019> up<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.200> tent<00:03:14.380> but<00:03:14.560> I

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
putting stuff in it this one's cool but

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.880 
putting stuff in it this one's cool but
when<00:03:22.630> you<00:03:22.720> have<00:03:22.810> your<00:03:22.930> flashlight<00:03:23.260> on<00:03:23.530> at

when you have your flashlight on at

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.220 
when you have your flashlight on at
night<00:03:24.100> it's<00:03:24.760> like<00:03:25.000> a<00:03:25.180> giant<00:03:25.360> beacon<00:03:25.930> like<00:03:26.110> you

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
night it's like a giant beacon like you

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.300 
night it's like a giant beacon like you
can<00:03:26.410> see<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:26.829> so<00:03:27.160> bright<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:28.650> we<00:03:29.650> tested<00:03:30.220> it

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
can see it so bright and we tested it

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.100 
can see it so bright and we tested it
and<00:03:30.519> you<00:03:30.670> can<00:03:30.820> definitely<00:03:31.030> still<00:03:31.630> get<00:03:31.810> shot

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
and you can definitely still get shot

and you can definitely still get shot
from<00:03:32.350> inside<00:03:32.500> so<00:03:32.980> if<00:03:33.040> somebody<00:03:33.370> sees<00:03:33.670> your

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
from inside so if somebody sees your

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.560 
from inside so if somebody sees your
flashlight<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:34.660> shoots<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.200> light<00:03:35.410> then

the wall

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.260 
the wall
so<00:04:22.199> now<00:04:22.319> you're<00:04:22.469> inside<00:04:22.830> here<00:04:23.069> you<00:04:23.250> can't<00:04:23.490> run

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
so now you're inside here you can't run

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.929 
so now you're inside here you can't run
over<00:04:24.599> to<00:04:24.719> the<00:04:24.750> left<00:04:25.050> corner<00:04:25.259> over<00:04:25.469> there<00:04:25.939> but

00:04:26.929 --> 00:04:26.939 
over to the left corner over there but

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:29.839 
over to the left corner over there but
now<00:04:27.240> you're<00:04:27.449> inside<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:28.379> can<00:04:28.620> set<00:04:29.430> your<00:04:29.580> tin

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
now you're inside you can set your tin

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.990 
now you're inside you can set your tin
home<00:04:30.030> and<00:04:30.330> everything<00:04:30.900> in<00:04:31.020> here<00:04:31.259> also<00:04:31.610> so<00:04:32.610> it's

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
home and everything in here also so it's

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.670 
home and everything in here also so it's
basically<00:04:33.509> like<00:04:33.990> a<00:04:34.050> lock<00:04:34.469> for<00:04:34.740> your<00:04:34.919> tent<00:04:35.330> so

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
basically like a lock for your tent so

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.869 
basically like a lock for your tent so
