00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
of the issues that other wheels have and

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.310 
of the issues that other wheels have and
try<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.360> create<00:00:39.360> an<00:00:39.510> answer<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.079> all<00:00:40.110> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
try to create an answer to all the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.040 
try to create an answer to all the
problems<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.460> what<00:00:41.610> we've<00:00:41.790> got<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.719> wheel

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
problems so what we've got is a wheel

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.229 
problems so what we've got is a wheel
then<00:00:43.379> because<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:43.980> wide<00:00:44.250> it's<00:00:44.910> still

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
then because it's wide it's still

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.479 
then because it's wide it's still
pressing<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.050> firming<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.680> soil<00:00:46.920> shut<00:00:47.250> just

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
pressing and firming the soil shut just

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.090 
pressing and firming the soil shut just
like<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.210> rubber<00:00:48.420> tires<00:00:48.780> already<00:00:49.110> doing<00:00:49.620> so

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
like the rubber tires already doing so

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.979 
like the rubber tires already doing so
we're<00:00:50.219> not<00:00:50.340> trying<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.760> change<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.780> whole<00:00:51.930> lot

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989

adding<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.719> spike<00:00:55.020> which<00:00:55.350> crumbles<00:00:55.829> that

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
adding the spike which crumbles that

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.279 
adding the spike which crumbles that
side<00:00:56.219> without<00:00:56.489> who<00:00:57.270> gives<00:00:57.510> us<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.780> good<00:00:57.960> see

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289

side without who gives us that good see
the<00:00:58.469> soil<00:00:58.710> contact<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.340> we're<00:00:59.520> looking<00:00:59.670> for

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the soil contact that we're looking for

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.720 
the soil contact that we're looking for
we're<00:01:00.780> looking<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.230> eliminate<00:01:01.890> air<00:01:02.190> pockets

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
we're looking to eliminate air pockets

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.990 
we're looking to eliminate air pockets
from<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
from the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.899 
from the
we're<00:01:04.360> looking<00:01:04.720> to<00:01:04.930> even<00:01:05.860> out<00:01:06.010> that<00:01:06.040> emergence

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
we're looking to even out that emergence

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.850 
we're looking to even out that emergence
so<00:01:07.240> that<00:01:07.420> we've<00:01:07.540> got<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:07.900> most<00:01:08.080> consistent

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
so that we've got the most consistent

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.039 
so that we've got the most consistent
stand<00:01:09.100> that<00:01:09.280> we<00:01:09.400> can<00:01:09.580> get<00:01:09.790> just<00:01:10.659> like<00:01:10.810> any
