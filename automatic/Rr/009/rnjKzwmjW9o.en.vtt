00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
really soft and I could see the the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.590

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
growth and everything a little bit more

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.080 
growth and everything a little bit more
with<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.260> makes<00:02:28.590> your<00:02:28.710> hair<00:02:28.890> curly<00:02:29.370> if

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
with this this makes your hair curly if

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.490 
with this this makes your hair curly if
I<00:02:30.240> could<00:02:30.390> walk<00:02:30.540> out<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.780> house<00:02:30.930> with<00:02:30.960> this<00:02:31.260> but

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
I could walk out the house with this but

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.410 
I could walk out the house with this but
it<00:02:31.620> just<00:02:31.650> doesn't<00:02:32.040> it's<00:02:32.340> not<00:02:32.400> as<00:02:32.640> shiny<00:02:32.850> but<00:02:33.150> I

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
it just doesn't it's not as shiny but I

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.360 
it just doesn't it's not as shiny but I
just<00:02:33.750> may<00:02:33.870> do<00:02:34.050> some<00:02:34.260> conditioner<00:02:35.070> watching

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
just may do some conditioner watching

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.650 
just may do some conditioner watching
girls<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:35.880> just<00:02:36.030> leave<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.240> conditioner

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
girls and just leave the conditioner

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.700 
girls and just leave the conditioner
with<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:36.990> because<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.290> made<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.590> really

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
with this because this made it really

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.800 
with this because this made it really
curly<00:02:38.070> I<00:02:38.220> think<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:38.850> may<00:02:39.060> be<00:02:39.090> even<00:02:39.390> curlier

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
curly I think this may be even curlier

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.380 
curly I think this may be even curlier
than<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:40.610> then<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.700> hair<00:02:41.880> milk<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.240> hair

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
than this then the hair milk the hair

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.620 
than this then the hair milk the hair
look<00:02:42.570> is<00:02:42.780> good<00:02:43.760> maybe<00:02:44.760> because<00:02:45.090> my<00:02:45.240> hair<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.510> so

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
look is good maybe because my hair is so

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.420 
look is good maybe because my hair is so
short<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:46.200> probably<00:02:46.650> can't<00:02:46.950> give<00:02:47.100> an<00:02:47.220> accurate

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430

cones in it like silicone stuff that I

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.100

washed that out and I put this right on
one<00:04:54.640> and<00:04:54.880> I<00:04:56.490> put<00:04:57.490> a<00:04:57.520> little<00:04:57.670> dollops<00:04:58.390> in<00:04:58.660> my

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.590 
one and I put a little dollops in my
hand<00:04:59.080> and<00:04:59.590> I<00:04:59.890> just<00:04:59.920> put<00:05:00.370> it<00:05:00.490> in<00:05:00.640> sections<00:05:01.180> and

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
hand and I just put it in sections and

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.180

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
then I got a little bit more I think I

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.710 
then I got a little bit more I think I
did<00:05:03.370> four<00:05:03.610> sections<00:05:04.060> so<00:05:04.180> I<00:05:04.240> got<00:05:04.390> a<00:05:04.420> little<00:05:04.600> bit

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
did four sections so I got a little bit

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.480 
did four sections so I got a little bit
more<00:05:04.870> and<00:05:04.960> I<00:05:05.020> put<00:05:05.230> it<00:05:05.320> like<00:05:05.350> this<00:05:05.590> and<00:05:06.040> I<00:05:06.130> really

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
more and I put it like this and I really

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.610 
more and I put it like this and I really
like<00:05:06.670> the<00:05:06.910> curl<00:05:07.420> definition<00:05:07.630> that<00:05:08.110> he<00:05:08.230> gave<00:05:08.410> me

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
like the curl definition that he gave me

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.250 
like the curl definition that he gave me
um<00:05:09.370> it<00:05:09.910> didn't<00:05:10.300> feel<00:05:10.450> as<00:05:10.600> crispy<00:05:11.050> as<00:05:11.080> I

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
um it didn't feel as crispy as I

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.930 
um it didn't feel as crispy as I
remember<00:05:11.650> it<00:05:11.740> feeling<00:05:11.920> and<00:05:12.310> that's<00:05:12.610> probably

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
remember it feeling and that's probably

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.360 
remember it feeling and that's probably
because<00:05:13.180> I<00:05:13.630> put<00:05:13.840> this<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.710> two<00:05:14.920> we<00:05:15.040> leave<00:05:15.220> in

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
because I put this the two we leave in

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.880 
because I put this the two we leave in
conditioner<00:05:15.910> right<00:05:16.150> on<00:05:16.300> top<00:05:16.600> of<00:05:16.780> it<00:05:16.960> I<00:05:17.140> let<00:05:17.860> it

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
conditioner right on top of it I let it

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.590 
conditioner right on top of it I let it
sit<00:05:18.010> about<00:05:18.220> 10-15<00:05:18.880> minutes<00:05:18.910> and<00:05:19.240> then<00:05:19.360> I<00:05:19.420> put

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
sit about 10-15 minutes and then I put

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.880 
sit about 10-15 minutes and then I put
this<00:05:19.720> right<00:05:19.960> on<00:05:20.110> top<00:05:20.140> of<00:05:20.410> it<00:05:20.650> so<00:05:21.280> I<00:05:22.350> do<00:05:23.350> like<00:05:23.710> the

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
this right on top of it so I do like the

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.190 
this right on top of it so I do like the
way<00:05:23.980> that<00:05:24.130> this<00:05:24.280> curls<00:05:24.610> my<00:05:24.760> hair<00:05:25.000> up<00:05:25.660> even

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
way that this curls my hair up even

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.380 
way that this curls my hair up even
better<00:05:26.410> the<00:05:26.650> nadir<00:05:26.830> milk<00:05:27.190> did<00:05:27.430> but<00:05:28.150> you<00:05:28.270> know

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
better the nadir milk did but you know

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.690 
better the nadir milk did but you know
like<00:05:28.570> I<00:05:28.690> said<00:05:28.750> it<00:05:28.990> is<00:05:29.110> probably<00:05:29.680> you<00:05:30.070> know<00:05:30.100> I'm

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
like I said it is probably you know I'm

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.010 
like I said it is probably you know I'm
probably<00:05:30.850> not<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:31.240> best<00:05:31.270> review<00:05:31.630> because<00:05:31.810> my

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
probably not the best review because my

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.840 
probably not the best review because my
hair<00:05:32.170> is<00:05:32.200> still<00:05:32.440> so<00:05:32.650> short<00:05:32.950> and<00:05:33.610> I've<00:05:33.700> only
