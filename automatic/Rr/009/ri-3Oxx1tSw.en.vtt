going to try to elongate the longevity
of<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.550> game<00:00:45.800> because<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.950> think<00:00:47.160> battlefield

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
of this game because I think battlefield

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.209 
of this game because I think battlefield
3<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:47.940> going<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.270> be<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.570> very<00:00:48.920> fun<00:00:49.920> and

3 is going to be a very fun and

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.350 
3 is going to be a very fun and
hopefully<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:50.670> going<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.879> last<00:00:51.059> for<00:00:51.270> an

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
hopefully it's going to last for an

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.850 
hopefully it's going to last for an
extremely<00:00:51.629> long<00:00:51.719> time<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.230> I'm<00:00:52.350> glad<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.680> see

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
that they're going to really put every

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the up coming up coming game and I think

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.619 
the up coming up coming game and I think
this<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.039> also<00:01:02.250> pretty<00:01:03.059> sweet<00:01:03.359> because<00:01:03.570> I

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
this is also pretty sweet because I

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.729 
this is also pretty sweet because I
really<00:01:03.989> don't<00:01:04.140> think<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.470> they're<00:01:04.559> going<00:01:04.680> to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
really don't think that they're going to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.850 
really don't think that they're going to
charge<00:01:05.450> 21<00:01:06.450> are<00:01:06.659> charged<00:01:07.049> every<00:01:07.260> single<00:01:07.680> time

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
charge 21 are charged every single time

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.530 
charge 21 are charged every single time
for<00:01:08.130> 21<00:01:08.549> DLCs<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.150> would<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.299> kind<00:01:09.479> of

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
for 21 DLCs that would be kind of

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.510 
for 21 DLCs that would be kind of
ridiculous<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.470> I'm<00:01:10.619> gonna<00:01:10.740> go<00:01:11.189> out<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.460> a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
ridiculous so I'm gonna go out on a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.039 
ridiculous so I'm gonna go out on a
little<00:01:11.700> limb<00:01:11.880> here<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.180> say<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.390> most<00:01:12.900> of

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
little limb here and say that most of

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.750 
little limb here and say that most of
these<00:01:13.140> DLCs<00:01:13.619> are<00:01:13.710> going<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:13.979> free<00:01:14.310> that's

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
these DLCs are going to be free that's

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.039 
these DLCs are going to be free that's
just<00:01:14.909> an<00:01:15.030> assumption<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.540> really<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:15.900> nothing

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
just an assumption I really have nothing

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.749 
just an assumption I really have nothing
to<00:01:16.259> back<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.470> but<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.100> would<00:01:17.369> really<00:01:17.549> have<00:01:17.729> a

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
to back it but I would really have a

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.420 
to back it but I would really have a
hard<00:01:17.909> time<00:01:18.150> believing<00:01:18.920> them<00:01:19.920> if<00:01:20.100> they<00:01:20.220> said

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
hard time believing them if they said

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.770 
hard time believing them if they said
that<00:01:20.520> we're<00:01:20.670> going<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.820> charge<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.450> every

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
that we're going to charge you every

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.380 
that we're going to charge you every
single<00:01:21.930> time<00:01:22.229> for<00:01:22.860> 21<00:01:23.430> DLCs<00:01:23.880> that's<00:01:24.090> just<00:01:24.270> my

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
single time for 21 DLCs that's just my

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.330 
single time for 21 DLCs that's just my
opinion<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.770> think<00:01:25.830> that's<00:01:26.070> kind<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
opinion but I think that's kind of the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.230 
opinion but I think that's kind of the
route<00:01:26.460> they're<00:01:26.549> going<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.729> go<00:01:26.790> they're<00:01:27.119> going

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
route they're going to go they're going

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.880 
play style so I think this is going to
be<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.010> really<00:02:17.310> nice<00:02:17.640> addition<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:19.080> vehicle

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
be a really nice addition to the vehicle

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.229 
be a really nice addition to the vehicle
gameplay<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.519> I'm<00:02:20.610> really<00:02:20.760> interested<00:02:21.030> to

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
gameplay and I'm really interested to

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.940 
gameplay and I'm really interested to
see<00:02:21.420> what<00:02:21.780> kind<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.140> perks<00:02:22.379> they<00:02:22.590> actually

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
see what kind of perks they actually

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.619 
see what kind of perks they actually
come<00:02:23.069> up<00:02:23.099> with<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:23.549> that'll<00:02:24.390> be<00:02:24.480> something

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
come up with so that'll be something

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:25.970 
come up with so that'll be something
hopefully<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.319> they<00:02:25.409> will<00:02:25.530> present<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:25.920> the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980

hopefully that they will present in the
near<00:02:26.129> future<00:02:26.480> another<00:02:27.480> thing<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.019> I

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
near future another thing and I

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.960 
near future another thing and I
mentioned<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:28.709> in<00:02:28.769> a<00:02:28.920> previous<00:02:28.950> video<00:02:29.489> where

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
mentioned this in a previous video where

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.390 
mentioned this in a previous video where
there<00:02:30.780> was<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.019> trailer<00:02:31.409> of<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.680> multiplayer

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
there was the trailer of the multiplayer

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.280 
there was the trailer of the multiplayer
trailer<00:02:32.640> trailer<00:02:33.480> man<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:33.930> can't<00:02:34.170> talk

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
trailer trailer man I can't talk

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.589 
trailer trailer man I can't talk
apparently<00:02:34.739> where<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.849> soldier<00:02:36.209> is<00:02:36.239> looking

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
apparently where the soldier is looking

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.240 
apparently where the soldier is looking
up<00:02:36.690> at<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.870> building<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.440> then<00:02:37.620> some<00:02:38.010> sort<00:02:38.190> of

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
up at a building and then some sort of

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.979 
up at a building and then some sort of
rocket<00:02:38.640> flies<00:02:38.909> into<00:02:39.299> it<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.720> rubble

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
rocket flies into it and the rubble

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.979 
rocket flies into it and the rubble
comes<00:02:40.170> down<00:02:40.379> and<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.769> looks<00:02:41.159> like<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:42.299> soldier

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
comes down and it looks like the soldier

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.809 
comes down and it looks like the soldier
dies<00:02:43.260> from<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.709> rubble<00:02:43.920> but<00:02:44.400> if<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.579> look<00:02:44.700> at

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
dies from the rubble but if you look at

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.000 
dies from the rubble but if you look at
it<00:02:44.849> closely<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.480> was<00:02:45.599> just<00:02:45.810> edited<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.829> where

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
it closely it was just edited to where

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.819 
it closely it was just edited to where
it<00:02:47.340> looked<00:02:47.579> it<00:02:47.700> kind<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.060> had<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.209> look<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:49.709> it

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
it looked it kind of had that look to it

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.830 
it looked it kind of had that look to it
but<00:02:50.010> really<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.430> guy<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.269> person

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
but really the guy the the person

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.240 
but really the guy the the person
actually<00:02:51.930> died<00:02:52.260> was<00:02:52.500> from<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.709> grenade<00:02:52.829> and<00:02:53.129> not

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
actually died was from a grenade and not

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.910 
actually died was from a grenade and not
actually<00:02:53.549> rubble<00:02:53.879> so<00:02:54.359> I<00:02:54.780> was<00:02:55.349> wrong<00:02:55.590> in<00:02:55.799> my

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
actually rubble so I was wrong in my

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.229 
actually rubble so I was wrong in my
assumption<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.370> debris<00:02:56.790> will<00:02:56.940> actually

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
assumption that debris will actually

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.509 
assumption that debris will actually
kill<00:02:57.390> people<00:02:57.720> from<00:02:58.109> that<00:02:58.319> trailer<00:02:58.739> but<00:02:59.340> my

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
kill people from that trailer but my

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.890 
kill people from that trailer but my
assumption<00:02:59.790> was<00:03:00.060> actually<00:03:00.359> correct<00:03:00.659> because

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
assumption was actually correct because

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.630 
assumption was actually correct because
they<00:03:01.140> have<00:03:01.319> confirmed<00:03:01.739> that<00:03:01.859> debris<00:03:02.340> will

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
they have confirmed that debris will

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.270 
they have confirmed that debris will
actually<00:03:03.150> kill<00:03:03.629> people<00:03:03.930> in<00:03:04.170> battlefield<00:03:04.980> 3<00:03:05.010> so

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
actually kill people in battlefield 3 so

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.130 
actually kill people in battlefield 3 so
I<00:03:05.310> think<00:03:05.400> that's<00:03:05.609> fantastic<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:06.870> looks<00:03:07.079> like

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
I think that's fantastic it looks like

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.080 
I think that's fantastic it looks like
they're<00:03:07.349> really<00:03:07.500> trying<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:08.010> up<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.640> ante<00:03:08.940> and

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
they're really trying to up the ante and

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.390 
they're really trying to up the ante and
really<00:03:09.359> allow<00:03:09.599> players<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.400> really

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
really allow players to really

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.039 
really allow players to really
manipulate<00:03:11.640> their<00:03:12.209> environment<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.900> their

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
manipulate their environment to their

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.410 
manipulate their environment to their
advantage<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.709> do<00:03:13.799> whatever<00:03:14.129> they<00:03:14.700> can<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.209> win

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
advantage to do whatever they can to win

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.910 
advantage to do whatever they can to win
and<00:03:15.840> another<00:03:16.170> thing<00:03:16.379> that<00:03:16.620> they've<00:03:16.739> mentioned

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
and another thing that they've mentioned

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.470 
and another thing that they've mentioned
is<00:03:17.340> another<00:03:17.819> way<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.030> can<00:03:18.209> actually

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
is another way you can actually

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.300 
is another way you can actually
manipulate<00:03:18.599> your<00:03:19.019> environment<00:03:19.500> is<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:20.099> take

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
manipulate your environment is to take

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.710 
manipulate your environment is to take
out<00:03:20.489> light<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.060> if<00:03:21.150> you're<00:03:21.299> in<00:03:21.419> an<00:03:21.480> underground

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
out light so if you're in an underground

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.940 
out light so if you're in an underground
tunnel<00:03:22.079> or<00:03:22.319> something<00:03:22.349> like<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.650> there's

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
tunnel or something like that there's

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.740 
tunnel or something like that there's
lights<00:03:23.160> everywhere<00:03:23.459> if<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:24.150> shoot<00:03:24.389> out<00:03:24.540> all

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
lights everywhere if you shoot out all

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.930 
lights everywhere if you shoot out all
of<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:25.049> lights<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:26.040> will<00:03:26.190> actually<00:03:26.370> be<00:03:26.669> dimmer

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
of the lights it will actually be dimmer

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.970 
of the lights it will actually be dimmer
so<00:03:27.329> if<00:03:27.599> you<00:03:27.810> are<00:03:28.109> if<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:28.590> have<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.709> flashlight

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
so if you are if you have a flashlight

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.319 
so if you are if you have a flashlight
or<00:03:29.220> something<00:03:29.250> like<00:03:29.459> that<00:03:29.519> you<00:03:29.760> can<00:03:29.970> blind

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
or something like that you can blind

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.800 
or something like that you can blind
your<00:03:30.709> your<00:03:31.709> enemy<00:03:31.980> or<00:03:32.190> if<00:03:32.430> you're<00:03:32.639> using<00:03:32.910> night

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
your your enemy or if you're using night

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.809 
your your enemy or if you're using night
vision<00:03:33.840> for<00:03:34.530> your<00:03:34.680> for<00:03:35.190> your<00:03:35.280> character<00:03:35.549> set

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
vision for your for your character set

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.550 
vision for your for your character set
up<00:03:35.940> you're<00:03:36.299> gonna<00:03:36.450> have<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.780> advantage<00:03:37.169> so<00:03:37.349> if

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
up you're gonna have the advantage so if

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.319 
up you're gonna have the advantage so if
that's<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:38.069> you<00:03:38.609> know<00:03:38.730> if<00:03:38.910> that's<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.209> way

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
that's the you know if that's the way

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.759 
that's the you know if that's the way
you<00:03:39.389> want<00:03:39.599> to<00:03:39.660> go<00:03:39.720> about<00:03:39.930> trying<00:03:40.319> to<00:03:40.530> defeat

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
you want to go about trying to defeat

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.530 
you want to go about trying to defeat
your<00:03:40.889> enemy<00:03:41.160> then<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.579> have<00:03:41.760> that<00:03:41.790> option<00:03:42.150> so

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
your enemy then you have that option so

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.819 
your enemy then you have that option so
that's<00:03:42.959> just<00:03:43.079> another<00:03:43.290> way<00:03:43.379> that<00:03:43.560> they're

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
that's just another way that they're

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.369 
that's just another way that they're
going<00:03:43.949> to<00:03:44.040> be<00:03:44.190> allowing<00:03:44.609> players<00:03:44.970> to

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
going to be allowing players to

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.300 
going to be allowing players to
manipulate<00:03:46.379> the<00:03:46.560> environment<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:47.190> their

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
manipulate the environment to their

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.470 
manipulate the environment to their
advantage<00:03:47.489> and<00:03:47.730> I<00:03:47.819> think<00:03:48.000> this<00:03:48.060> is<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.239> really

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
advantage and I think this is a really

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.240 
advantage and I think this is a really
great<00:03:48.720> addition<00:03:49.169> to<00:03:49.199> the<00:03:49.349> game<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:49.799> it's<00:03:50.099> just

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
great addition to the game and it's just

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.430 
great addition to the game and it's just
really<00:03:50.430> good<00:03:50.669> to<00:03:50.730> see<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:51.599> this<00:03:51.930> about<00:03:52.169> wraps

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
really good to see so this about wraps
