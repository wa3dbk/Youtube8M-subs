hi<00:00:02.340> my<00:00:03.030> name<00:00:03.179> is<00:00:03.210> dave<00:00:03.480> Andrews<00:00:03.720> and<00:00:04.290> today<00:00:04.710> I'm

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
hi my name is dave Andrews and today I'm

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.559 
hi my name is dave Andrews and today I'm
going<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.220> explain<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.730> you<00:00:05.819> how<00:00:06.029> computer

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
going to explain to you how computer

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.320 
going to explain to you how computer
hard<00:00:06.810> drives<00:00:07.140> work<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.980> have<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.519> diagram<00:00:09.000> on<00:00:09.210> my

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
hard drives work I have a diagram on my

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.490 
hard drives work I have a diagram on my
computer<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:09.809> I'm<00:00:10.050> gonna<00:00:10.230> pull<00:00:10.469> up<00:00:12.380> and<00:00:13.380> this

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
computer that I'm gonna pull up and this

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.760 
computer that I'm gonna pull up and this
is<00:00:13.559> basically<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.190> parts<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.969> hard<00:00:15.210> drive

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
is basically the parts of a hard drive

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.130 
is basically the parts of a hard drive
kind<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.859> taken<00:00:17.190> apart<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:18.480> where<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.750> can<00:00:18.900> see

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
kind of taken apart to where you can see

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.590 
kind of taken apart to where you can see
each<00:00:19.350> individual<00:00:20.039> one<00:00:20.310> now<00:00:21.029> hard<00:00:21.270> drive<00:00:21.449> is

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
each individual one now hard drive is

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.420 
each individual one now hard drive is
basically<00:00:21.990> if<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.500> looked<00:00:22.920> inside<00:00:23.220> your

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
basically if you looked inside your

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.759 
basically if you looked inside your
computer<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.970> be<00:00:24.150> like<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.570> block<00:00:25.199> maybe

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
computer it be like a block maybe

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.490 
computer it be like a block maybe
there's<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.279> little<00:00:26.550> bit<00:00:26.699> larger<00:00:27.210> than<00:00:27.420> then<00:00:28.320> an

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
there's a little bit larger than then an

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.279 
there's a little bit larger than then an
index<00:00:29.010> card<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> basically<00:00:31.199> a

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
index card and that is a basically a

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.139 
index card and that is a basically a
block<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.800> metal<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.399> these<00:00:32.489> are<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.820> parts

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
block of metal and these are the parts

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.270 
block of metal and these are the parts
that<00:00:33.210> are<00:00:33.390> inside<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.050> hard<00:00:34.290> drive<00:00:34.590> you

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
that are inside of that hard drive you

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.639 
that are inside of that hard drive you
have<00:00:35.340> what's<00:00:36.210> called<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.540> read<00:00:36.780> head<00:00:37.170> right

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
have what's called a read head right

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.729 
have what's called a read head right
here<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.700> also<00:00:38.879> have<00:00:39.210> platters<00:00:40.050> these

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
here and you also have platters these

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.130 
here and you also have platters these
platters<00:00:41.309> are<00:00:41.879> basically<00:00:42.360> if<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.750> look<00:00:42.899> at<00:00:43.050> it

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
platters are basically if you look at it

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.350 
platters are basically if you look at it
looks<00:00:43.260> like<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> CD<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.579> instead<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.149> being

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
looks like a CD but instead of being

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.310 
looks like a CD but instead of being
like<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> CD<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.379> uses<00:00:46.969> magnetism<00:00:48.050> to<00:00:49.050> store

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
like a CD it uses magnetism to store

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.090 
like a CD it uses magnetism to store
data<00:00:50.510> what<00:00:51.510> happens<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.050> when<00:00:52.379> your<00:00:52.620> hard

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
data what happens is when your hard

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.340 
data what happens is when your hard
drive<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.489> spinning<00:00:53.910> up<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.300> these<00:00:54.960> platters

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
drive is spinning up is these platters

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.410 
drive is spinning up is these platters
inside<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.980> your<00:00:56.070> hard<00:00:56.219> drive<00:00:56.460> will<00:00:56.670> spin<00:00:57.120> very

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
inside of your hard drive will spin very

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.200 
inside of your hard drive will spin very
very<00:00:57.780> very<00:00:57.989> fast<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.770> they'll<00:00:59.010> spend

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
very very fast and they'll spend

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.650 
very very fast and they'll spend
constantly<00:01:00.350> some<00:01:01.350> will<00:01:01.530> spin<00:01:01.859> at<00:01:02.210> 5400<00:01:03.210> rpm

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
constantly some will spin at 5400 rpm

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.429 
constantly some will spin at 5400 rpm
others<00:01:04.110> will<00:01:04.260> spin<00:01:04.439> at<00:01:04.589> 7200<00:01:05.549> there's<00:01:06.030> even

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
others will spin at 7200 there's even

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.980 
others will spin at 7200 there's even
10,000<00:01:07.439> rpm<00:01:07.890> hard<00:01:08.280> drives<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.909> higher<00:01:09.240> now

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
10,000 rpm hard drives in higher now

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.700 
10,000 rpm hard drives in higher now
what

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
what

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.920 
what
rpm<00:01:11.310> does<00:01:11.580> for<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.330> faster<00:01:12.780> this

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
rpm does for you is the faster this

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.109 
rpm does for you is the faster this
spins<00:01:13.320> conceivably<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.400> faster<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.909> hard

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
spins conceivably the faster that hard

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.280 
spins conceivably the faster that hard
drive<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.390> going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.689> be<00:01:15.750> able<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.020> read<00:01:16.259> data

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
drive is going to be able to read data

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.880 
drive is going to be able to read data
in<00:01:16.890> certain<00:01:17.729> conditions<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:19.350> basically

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
in certain conditions but basically

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.609 
in certain conditions but basically
wrapped<00:01:20.400> around<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:21.180> platter<00:01:21.600> if<00:01:22.350> you'll

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
wrapped around this platter if you'll

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.980 
wrapped around this platter if you'll
follow<00:01:22.799> my<00:01:23.159> little<00:01:23.310> hand<00:01:23.729> here<00:01:24.060> kind<00:01:24.810> of

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
follow my little hand here kind of

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.630 
follow my little hand here kind of
growing<00:01:25.890> out<00:01:26.100> as<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.850> goes<00:01:27.030> around<00:01:27.390> our<00:01:28.640> strips

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
growing out as it goes around our strips

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.950 
growing out as it goes around our strips
basically<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.689> data<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:32.329> and<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.540> data<00:01:33.750> is

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
basically of data and and that data is

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.740 
basically of data and and that data is
stored<00:01:34.159> magnetically<00:01:35.159> little<00:01:35.700> uh<00:01:35.750> it'll

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
stored magnetically little uh it'll

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.200 
stored magnetically little uh it'll
either<00:01:36.869> be<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.470> part<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:37.920> has<00:01:38.070> no<00:01:38.610> magnetism

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
either be a part that has no magnetism

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.870 
either be a part that has no magnetism
or<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.869> part<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.200> does<00:01:40.560> have<00:01:40.829> magnetism<00:01:41.430> and

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
or a part that does have magnetism and

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.490 
or a part that does have magnetism and
this<00:01:42.420> read<00:01:42.750> head<00:01:43.079> will<00:01:44.119> scroll<00:01:45.119> around<00:01:45.780> on

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
this read head will scroll around on

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.830 
this read head will scroll around on
this<00:01:46.710> hard<00:01:47.310> drive<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.820> different<00:01:48.180> parts<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.659> it

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
this hard drive to different parts of it

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.830 
this hard drive to different parts of it
and<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.799> will<00:01:49.979> as<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.520> spins<00:01:50.820> pull<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.570> data

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and it will as it spins pull that data

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.289 
and it will as it spins pull that data
off<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.200> hard<00:01:52.649> drive<00:01:52.920> if<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:54.240> a

combine all those little ones and zeros
together<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.450> get<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.719> data<00:02:03.960> off<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
together and you get the data off of the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.920 
together and you get the data off of the
hard<00:02:04.799> drive<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.149> how<00:02:06.299> hard<00:02:06.659> drive

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
hard drive and that is how hard drive

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.210 
hard drive and that is how hard drive
works
