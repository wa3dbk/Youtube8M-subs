brain

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.799 

clearly<00:00:59.699> crazy<00:01:00.000> but<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.239> think<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
clearly crazy but I think it's the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.560 
clearly crazy but I think it's the
Orient<00:01:01.109> Express<00:01:01.730> then<00:01:02.730> I've<00:01:02.969> never<00:01:03.059> seen<00:01:03.420> it

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
Orient Express then I've never seen it

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
so therefore I don't know classy place

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.899 
so therefore I don't know classy place
