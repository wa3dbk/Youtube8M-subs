00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hello everyone in this video I wanted 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.620
 consider but quieter chat 32 0 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.469
 cleaning it from corrosion as you can see 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:17.779
 battery here and 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:23.609
 section it only connects volumes all 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:26.300
 in corrosion and oxides we start with 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.099
 this side shows that 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.149
 Circuits some have all oxidized 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:37.950
 pretty much either need them well 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:41.010
 either disappear or replaced but for starters 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:46.500
 go through a short way just that's it 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:51.270
 clear for this we need 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.199
 solvent 646 let's say think and suit 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:00.000
 some alcohol clean and 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:03.809
 petrol will clean the entire unit 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.729
 completely independently raise all 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:11.100
 screens all the glands here by the way cameras and and 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.479
 will have to be removed simply by 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.390
 cleaning time the camera is removed quite 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.450
 so straightforward primitive way with 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.659
 tweezers can be repaired 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.290
 Spicy little ones and shell sharply 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.290
 ground 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.600
 I usually remove the camera with tweezers 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.600
 is always 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.979
 so see in some places in general 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.979
 everything is a mess 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.380
 take a toothbrush and clean this 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.810
 toothbrush and passes just see 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.450
 the screen and most importantly the crane must be removed 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.740
 because under them 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.740
 accumulates there is a lot of dirt 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:21.900
 after cleaning it will be necessary to walk 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.900
 dry the machine tweezers that spoke 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.670
 just rises and everything is more or less 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.940
 neatly from the first time may not 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.720
 especially get but you can see what keeps 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:39.040
 hero4 camera for the slits on the right below 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:42.870
 From above they are still nagged 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.970
 neatly so in place are inserted 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.600
 clean the device until shine 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.840
 see with your own eyes don't make sure that 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.890
 no corrosion 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.260
 Further here as I spoke pass by the hair dryer 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:03.340
 to dry 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.790
 places and three hundred eighty degrees i 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:12.209
 pass until just catch 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:15.670
 won't stop so much spluttering there 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:19.150
 to stop the sound to dry all 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:24.370
 that he is a hot fee for the system itself 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:27.519
 hot it was going through all dry 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.630
 that's all you see under the controller 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:34.690
 solvent remaining 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.790
 after that we just left it thrown 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.620
 display 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.709
 check and turn on does not turn on 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.310
 does not work and can proceed 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.190
 in the assembly of the apparatus in short wanted 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.570
 to explain 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.570
 about the phone that was with him 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:59.580
 phone on the floor in a wet environment then 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:03.280
 there it turns out the water itself has been there 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:06.490
 further used this phone and to 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.490
 networks flooded the phone then it turns on who 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.750
 does not turn off hang out loses that is 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:16.510
 it turns out the phone lives its life 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:19.720
 to eliminate such shoals just 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:23.070
 basic cleaning is needed if not 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:27.010
 helps you can still walk soldering iron 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.860
 flux not soldering iron to recover 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.669
 oxidized contacts 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:38.200
 after such after such cleansing is necessary 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:40.710
 just after assembly check 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.710
 all outgoing and incoming bluetooth 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:48.930
 camera charging 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:54.550
 well and so on ordinary regular 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:58.800
 event in principle i'm in short here 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:02.740
 told how to clean how will appear 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.660
 all as you can see the phone turns on 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.310
 principle, yes, it is also normally studied 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:11.200
 just hang 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:15.300
 on and off in principle i told everything 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.300
 so good luck to everyone
