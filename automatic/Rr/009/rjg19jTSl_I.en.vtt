build<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:34.050> deck<00:01:34.320> build<00:01:34.650> made<00:01:35.190> around<00:01:35.400> discard

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
build a deck build made around discard

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.420

attacking<00:01:37.020> our<00:01:37.080> opponents<00:01:37.470> hand<00:01:37.650> especially

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
attacking our opponents hand especially

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.340 
attacking our opponents hand especially
made<00:01:38.790> me<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.030> one<00:01:39.300> opponent<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.080> you<00:01:40.260> know

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
made me just one opponent and you know

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
made me just one opponent and you know
because<00:01:40.530> included<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.010> you<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.220> two

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
because included on you have two

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.760 
because included on you have two
different<00:01:41.550> opponents<00:01:42.560> neutralized<00:01:43.560> one

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
different opponents neutralized one

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.110 
different opponents neutralized one
opponent's<00:01:44.190> hand<00:01:44.370> make<00:01:44.640> them<00:01:44.760> out<00:01:44.940> of<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
opponent's hand make them out of the

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.810 
opponent's hand make them out of the
game<00:01:45.300> so<00:01:45.540> there's<00:01:45.690> basically<00:01:45.810> two<00:01:46.140> versus<00:01:46.650> one

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
game so there's basically two versus one

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.950 
game so there's basically two versus one
it<00:01:47.820> worked<00:01:47.970> pretty<00:01:48.090> well<00:01:48.300> we<00:01:48.570> went<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
it worked pretty well we went to a

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.900 
it worked pretty well we went to a
second-place<00:01:49.470> finish<00:01:49.590> losing<00:01:50.370> in<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.490> finals

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910

to<00:01:51.660> a<00:01:51.990> combo<00:01:52.440> deck<00:01:52.680> but<00:01:52.950> then<00:01:53.070> again<00:01:53.190> I

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
to a combo deck but then again I

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.340 
to a combo deck but then again I
expected<00:01:54.660> something<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:54.870> that<00:01:55.140> because

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
expected something like that because

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.140 
expected something like that because
intuited<00:01:55.890> giant<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.340> people<00:01:56.610> actually<00:01:56.910> build

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
intuited giant the people actually build

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.360 
intuited giant the people actually build
a<00:01:57.390> Twitter<00:01:58.080> giant<00:01:58.410> deck<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:59.100> know<00:01:59.190> that's

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
a Twitter giant deck you know that's

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.760 
a Twitter giant deck you know that's
built<00:01:59.610> around<00:01:59.810> comboing<00:02:00.810> both<00:02:01.260> the<00:02:01.590> bolt

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
built around comboing both the bolt

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.680 
built around comboing both the bolt
those<00:02:01.860> people<00:02:02.100> had<00:02:02.220> counterspells<00:02:03.000> so

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
those people had counterspells so

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.240 
those people had counterspells so
there's<00:02:03.840> no<00:02:03.900> way<00:02:04.080> I<00:02:04.110> could<00:02:04.380> out<00:02:04.560> counter<00:02:04.950> them

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
there's no way I could out counter them

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.889 
there's no way I could out counter them
so<00:02:05.640> let's<00:02:06.240> look<00:02:06.390> at<00:02:06.510> the<00:02:06.600> deck<00:02:06.750> though<00:02:08.899> first

the exact same thing to what their
blighting<00:02:40.980> does<00:02:41.190> now<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:43.500> gotta<00:02:43.680> think<00:02:43.830> of

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
blighting does now you gotta think of

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.400

this like a numbers game when you get

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.440 
this like a numbers game when you get
lightning<00:02:46.709> they're<00:02:47.220> using<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.730> card<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.360> make

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
lightning they're using a card to make

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.390 
lightning they're using a card to make
you<00:02:48.599> discard<00:02:49.019> two<00:02:49.170> cards<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.620> deal<00:02:50.220> three

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
you discard two cards and deal three

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.160 
you discard two cards and deal three
damage<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:51.090> if<00:02:51.209> you<00:02:51.300> discard<00:02:51.690> two<00:02:51.810> jasek

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
damage so if you discard two jasek

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.229 
damage so if you discard two jasek
Specter<00:02:52.560> then<00:02:53.160> use<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.430> drastic<00:02:53.880> Specter

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
complement the discard we had four

complement the discard we had four
copies<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.660> lightning<00:03:43.850> which<00:03:44.850> are<00:03:45.000> really

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
copies of lightning which are really

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.920 
copies of lightning which are really
nice<00:03:46.069> we<00:03:47.069> also<00:03:47.220> had<00:03:47.579> mine<00:03:48.180> sludge<00:03:48.600> in<00:03:48.840> my

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
nice we also had mine sludge in my

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.289 
nice we also had mine sludge in my
opponents<00:03:49.350> deck<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.829> then<00:03:50.670> we<00:03:50.910> also<00:03:51.060> had

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
opponents deck and then we also had

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.199 
opponents deck and then we also had
swerve<00:03:52.069> several<00:03:53.069> times<00:03:53.370> we<00:03:53.579> would<00:03:53.730> get<00:03:53.850> mine

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
swerve several times we would get mine

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.110 
swerve several times we would get mine
sludge<00:03:54.569> by<00:03:54.900> opposing<00:03:55.500> vampire<00:03:56.100> decks<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.639> I

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
sludge by opposing vampire decks and I

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.780 
sludge by opposing vampire decks and I
would<00:03:57.329> swerve<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:58.139> mine<00:03:58.410> sledge<00:03:58.769> back<00:03:59.069> on<00:03:59.370> to

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
would swerve that mine sledge back on to

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.780 
would swerve that mine sledge back on to
one<00:04:00.600> of<00:04:00.720> their<00:04:00.900> opponents<00:04:01.500> so<00:04:01.620> basically<00:04:02.190> you

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
one of their opponents so basically you

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.640 
one of their opponents so basically you
know<00:04:02.910> he<00:04:03.060> was<00:04:03.180> sludging<00:04:03.569> his<00:04:03.660> partner<00:04:04.049> which

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
know he was sludging his partner which

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.879 
know he was sludging his partner which
is<00:04:04.799> always<00:04:04.980> fun<00:04:05.480> so<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:07.230> round<00:04:07.380> out<00:04:07.530> this<00:04:07.650> deck

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
is always fun so to round out this deck

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.360 
is always fun so to round out this deck
I<00:04:08.900> also<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:10.139> might<00:04:10.410> notice<00:04:10.590> there's<00:04:10.889> lack<00:04:11.160> of

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
I also you might notice there's lack of

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.960 
I also you might notice there's lack of
removal<00:04:11.880> my<00:04:12.090> removal<00:04:12.480> over<00:04:12.750> here<00:04:13.109> is

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
removal my removal over here is

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.610 
removal my removal over here is
bituminous<00:04:14.970> blast<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.870> terminate

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
bituminous blast and terminate

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.710 
bituminous blast and terminate
bituminous<00:04:17.430> flats<00:04:17.729> probably<00:04:18.329> isn't<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.660> best

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
bituminous flats probably isn't the best

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.879 
bituminous flats probably isn't the best
idea<00:04:19.049> especially<00:04:19.380> when<00:04:19.650> you're<00:04:19.769> running

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
idea especially when you're running

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.310 
idea especially when you're running
swerve<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.459> negate<00:04:20.959> but<00:04:21.959> I<00:04:21.989> want<00:04:22.229> something

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.719 
swerve and negate but I want something
