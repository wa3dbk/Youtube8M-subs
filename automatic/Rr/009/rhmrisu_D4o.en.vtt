 An hour ago, the Kremlin was blown up. 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:25.530
 The president has launched a ghost action, and the entire IMF has been denied. 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.710
 Now, I received instructions to take you to Washington. 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.490
 There, you and your team will be charged with "Blowing the Kremlin" 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.710
 Unless you are running after attacking Brandt and me 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.580
 But if any member of the team is caught 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.460
 They will be listed as terrorists trying to cause a world nuclear war. 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.700
 What will happen now? 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.770
 It is your mission, see if you want to pick up. 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.110
 So, what plans are there now? 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:36.370

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.800
 Who are you, Brant? 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.300
 We all have secrets. Right, Ethan? 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:55.990

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.870
 OK Now, remember, blue means you can stick to the wall. 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.830
 What about red? 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.390
 death 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.830
 You can't do it! 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.030
 You didn't help me!
