00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.790 

okay<00:00:00.630> so<00:00:00.690> some<00:00:00.960> of<00:00:01.050> you<00:00:01.110> may<00:00:01.230> be<00:00:01.260> wondering<00:00:01.770> how

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
okay so some of you may be wondering how

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.700 
okay so some of you may be wondering how
these<00:00:02.399> frames<00:00:02.850> perform<00:00:03.600> with<00:00:04.080> sunlight

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
these frames perform with sunlight

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.330 
these frames perform with sunlight
because<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:06.150> cameras<00:00:06.540> themselves<00:00:06.720> in<00:00:07.440> touch

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
because the cameras themselves in touch

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.400 
because the cameras themselves in touch
setups<00:00:08.790> have<00:00:09.090> difficulty<00:00:09.690> tracking<00:00:09.960> when<00:00:10.320> you

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
setups have difficulty tracking when you

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.140 
setups have difficulty tracking when you
have<00:00:10.620> lots<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:11.040> ambient<00:00:11.490> light<00:00:11.550> sunlight

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
have lots of ambient light sunlight

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.220 
have lots of ambient light sunlight
infrared<00:00:12.780> light

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
infrared light

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.799 
infrared light
well<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.190> infrared<00:00:15.030> touch<00:00:15.240> frames<00:00:15.540> actually

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
well the infrared touch frames actually

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.230 
well the infrared touch frames actually
do<00:00:16.230> much<00:00:16.500> much<00:00:16.680> better<00:00:16.740> so<00:00:17.580> here<00:00:17.880> we<00:00:17.970> are<00:00:18.000> in

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
do much much better so here we are in

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.220 
do much much better so here we are in
the<00:00:18.359> room<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.500> windows<00:00:19.890> are<00:00:20.340> mostly

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
the room and the windows are mostly

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.070 
the room and the windows are mostly
closed<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.560> blinds<00:00:22.920> are<00:00:23.100> shut<00:00:23.510> so<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:24.779> fully

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
closed the blinds are shut so it's fully

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.200 
closed the blinds are shut so it's fully
calibrated<00:00:25.380> right<00:00:25.920> now<00:00:26.099> as<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:27.090> can<00:00:27.240> see<00:00:29.210> so

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
calibrated right now as you can see so

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.200 
calibrated right now as you can see so
it's<00:00:30.480> really<00:00:30.660> really<00:00:30.840> good<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:32.120> what<00:00:33.120> we're

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
it's really really good so what we're

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:46.130 
it's really really good so what we're
going<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.630> open<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.989> window<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.870> have

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
going to do is open the window so I have

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.619 
going to do is open the window so I have
tons<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.739> tons<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:47.370> sunlight<00:00:47.969> coming<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
tons and tons of sunlight coming in the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.569 
tons and tons of sunlight coming in the
room<00:00:48.809> right<00:00:48.960> now<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.950> see<00:00:50.129> my<00:00:50.309> shadow

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
room right now you can see my shadow

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.380 
room right now you can see my shadow
just<00:00:51.539> from<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> window<00:00:52.170> being<00:00:52.350> open<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.390> here

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
just from the window being open and here

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:05.940 
just from the window being open and here
we<00:00:54.510> are<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:56.600> doing<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> same<00:00:58.879> tracking

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.120 

so<00:01:06.520> all<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:07.420> same<00:01:07.630> so<00:01:08.380> even<00:01:08.770> if<00:01:08.860> you<00:01:08.950> have

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
so all the same so even if you have

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.730 
so all the same so even if you have
varying<00:01:09.700> light<00:01:09.909> conditions<00:01:10.450> sunlight<00:01:11.409> coming

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
varying light conditions sunlight coming

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.300 
varying light conditions sunlight coming
in<00:01:11.979> and<00:01:12.250> out<00:01:12.369> the<00:01:12.880> frame<00:01:13.150> should<00:01:13.360> work<00:01:13.600> fine<00:01:14.380> I

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
in and out the frame should work fine I

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.370 
in and out the frame should work fine I
have<00:01:15.909> heard<00:01:16.180> that<00:01:16.450> some<00:01:16.659> of<00:01:16.689> the<00:01:16.840> very<00:01:17.049> very

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
have heard that some of the very very

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.800 
have heard that some of the very very
large<00:01:17.590> frames<00:01:18.040> may<00:01:18.340> have<00:01:18.909> a<00:01:19.270> diminishing

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
large frames may have a diminishing

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.630 
large frames may have a diminishing
tracking<00:01:20.350> once<00:01:20.649> it<00:01:20.799> gets<00:01:20.950> towards<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.369> center

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
tracking once it gets towards the center

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.460 
tracking once it gets towards the center
more<00:01:21.820> of<00:01:21.909> the<00:01:22.000> screen<00:01:22.299> but<00:01:22.990> it<00:01:23.049> should<00:01:23.440> be

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
more of the screen but it should be

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.430 
more of the screen but it should be
still<00:01:23.799> pretty<00:01:24.070> good<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:24.570> usable<00:01:25.570> if<00:01:26.200> there's

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
still pretty good and usable if there's

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.499 
still pretty good and usable if there's
direct<00:01:26.799> sunlight<00:01:27.100> on<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.549> larger<00:01:28.180> screens

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
direct sunlight on the larger screens

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.630 
direct sunlight on the larger screens
probably<00:01:28.960> isn't<00:01:29.140> recommended<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.830> now<00:01:30.430> let's

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
probably isn't recommended and now let's

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.700 
probably isn't recommended and now let's
try<00:01:30.970> and<00:01:31.390> see<00:01:31.899> what<00:01:32.049> the<00:01:32.140> screen<00:01:32.380> looks<00:01:32.409> like

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
try and see what the screen looks like

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.289 
try and see what the screen looks like
outside<00:01:34.470> okay<00:01:35.470> so<00:01:35.530> here<00:01:36.130> we<00:01:36.220> are<00:01:36.250> in<00:01:36.789> direct

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
outside okay so here we are in direct

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.080 
outside okay so here we are in direct
sunlight<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:38.409> LCD<00:01:39.280> image<00:01:39.670> is<00:01:39.789> obviously

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
sunlight the LCD image is obviously

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.109 
sunlight the LCD image is obviously
washed<00:01:40.420> out<00:01:40.720> as<00:01:40.990> most<00:01:41.770> LCDs<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.670> projection

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
washed out as most LCDs and projection

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.399 
washed out as most LCDs and projection
images<00:01:43.420> pretty<00:01:43.630> much<00:01:43.780> would<00:01:43.990> be<00:01:44.140> in<00:01:44.289> direct

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
images pretty much would be in direct

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.100 
images pretty much would be in direct
sunlight<00:01:44.770> so<00:01:45.490> this<00:01:45.880> is<00:01:46.030> just<00:01:46.270> a<00:01:46.450> test

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
sunlight so this is just a test

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.870 
sunlight so this is just a test
obviously<00:01:47.530> it's<00:01:48.039> not<00:01:48.190> really<00:01:48.460> a<00:01:48.490> real-world

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
obviously it's not really a real-world

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.840 
obviously it's not really a real-world
application<00:01:49.299> as<00:01:50.140> it<00:01:50.770> probably<00:01:51.340> isn't

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
application as it probably isn't

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.539 
application as it probably isn't
something<00:01:52.149> that<00:01:52.299> most<00:01:52.539> people<00:01:52.659> would<00:01:52.869> ever<00:01:53.049> do

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
something that most people would ever do

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.880 
something that most people would ever do
as<00:01:54.549> you<00:01:54.729> can<00:01:54.880> see<00:01:55.090> just<00:01:55.569> sitting<00:01:56.440> here<00:01:56.649> it's

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
as you can see just sitting here it's

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.460 
as you can see just sitting here it's
already<00:01:57.069> created<00:01:57.580> a<00:01:57.640> couple<00:01:57.789> touch<00:01:58.630> points<00:01:59.110> so

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
already created a couple touch points so

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.960 
already created a couple touch points so
I'm<00:01:59.740> just<00:01:59.860> gonna<00:02:00.009> drag<00:02:00.250> my<00:02:00.429> fingers<00:02:00.759> across

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
I'm just gonna drag my fingers across

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.520 
I'm just gonna drag my fingers across
you<00:02:01.270> can<00:02:01.390> get<00:02:01.509> an<00:02:01.569> idea<00:02:01.780> of<00:02:01.840> pretty<00:02:02.319> much<00:02:02.380> how

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
you can get an idea of pretty much how

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.559 
you can get an idea of pretty much how
terrible<00:02:02.979> it<00:02:03.069> works<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:03.520> haven't<00:02:04.149> in<00:02:04.240> direct

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
terrible it works I haven't in direct

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:06.630 
terrible it works I haven't in direct
sunlight<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:05.200> infrared<00:02:05.649> light<00:02:05.920> from<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.429> Sun

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
sunlight the infrared light from the Sun

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.259 
sunlight the infrared light from the Sun
obviously<00:02:07.110> washes<00:02:08.110> out<00:02:08.319> the<00:02:08.759> touching<00:02:09.759> the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
obviously washes out the touching the

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.710 
obviously washes out the touching the
touch<00:02:11.250> sensing<00:02:12.250> infrared<00:02:13.150> sensors<00:02:13.570> around

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
touch sensing infrared sensors around

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.940 
touch sensing infrared sensors around
the<00:02:14.019> edge<00:02:14.350> so<00:02:14.380> let<00:02:15.190> me<00:02:15.310> just<00:02:15.459> show<00:02:15.579> you<00:02:15.609> here<00:02:15.940> I

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
the edge so let me just show you here I

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.199 
the edge so let me just show you here I
know<00:02:17.950> it's<00:02:18.100> really<00:02:18.310> hard<00:02:18.459> to<00:02:18.760> see<00:02:19.000> but<00:02:21.209> it

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
know it's really hard to see but it

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.410 
know it's really hard to see but it
seems<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.630> be<00:02:22.690> working<00:02:23.489> semi<00:02:24.489> okay<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.359> the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
seems to be working semi okay and the

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.080 
seems to be working semi okay and the
center<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.750> works<00:02:25.900> better<00:02:26.170> but<00:02:27.040> just<00:02:27.700> dragging

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
center it works better but just dragging

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.130 
center it works better but just dragging
even<00:02:28.329> a<00:02:28.359> single<00:02:28.600> finger<00:02:29.019> around<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:31.720> can<00:02:31.870> sit

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
even a single finger around you can sit

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.569 
even a single finger around you can sit
find<00:02:32.769> it<00:02:33.310> kind<00:02:33.609> of<00:02:33.820> works<00:02:34.090> but<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:36.040> is<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.250> six

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
find it kind of works but this is a six

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.699 
find it kind of works but this is a six
point<00:02:36.820> touch<00:02:37.090> frame<00:02:37.420> I<00:02:39.989> will<00:02:40.989> say<00:02:41.320> that<00:02:41.530> the

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
point touch frame I will say that the

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.670 
point touch frame I will say that the
response<00:02:42.430> time<00:02:42.730> is<00:02:43.090> faster<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.260> that's

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
response time is faster and that's

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.620 
response time is faster and that's
probably<00:02:45.010> because<00:02:45.160> my<00:02:45.549> fingers<00:02:45.970> are<00:02:46.209> heavily

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
probably because my fingers are heavily

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.660 
probably because my fingers are heavily
lit<00:02:46.930> up<00:02:47.019> by<00:02:47.200> infrared<00:02:47.829> light<00:02:48.160> due<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.459> the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
lit up by infrared light due to the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.970 
lit up by infrared light due to the
direct<00:02:48.970> sunlight<00:02:49.209> so<00:02:49.660> that's<00:02:49.870> camera<00:02:50.650> sensors

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
direct sunlight so that's camera sensors

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.509 
direct sunlight so that's camera sensors
are<00:02:51.130> that<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.380> infrared<00:02:53.380> sensors<00:02:53.739> are<00:02:53.920> much

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
are that the infrared sensors are much

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.960 
are that the infrared sensors are much
easier<00:02:54.549> to<00:02:55.239> detect<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.440> points<00:02:56.980> but<00:02:57.609> let<00:02:57.910> me

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
easier to detect the points but let me

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.970 
easier to detect the points but let me
just<00:02:58.150> show<00:02:58.359> you<00:02:58.390> what<00:02:58.780> five<00:02:59.140> fingers<00:02:59.650> drive

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
just show you what five fingers drive

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.729 
just show you what five fingers drive
across<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.459> screen<00:03:00.670> looks<00:03:01.030> like<00:03:01.269> because

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
across the screen looks like because

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.170 
across the screen looks like because
it's<00:03:02.739> actually<00:03:02.980> pretty<00:03:03.370> bad<00:03:05.700> there<00:03:06.700> we<00:03:06.790> go

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
it's actually pretty bad there we go

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.819 
it's actually pretty bad there we go
yep<00:03:08.350> there<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.650> goes<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.410> know<00:03:11.470> it's<00:03:11.680> really

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
yep there it goes so I know it's really

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:12.509 
yep there it goes so I know it's really
hard<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.100> see

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
hard to see

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.490 
hard to see
I<00:03:12.600> apologize<00:03:13.600> obviously<00:03:14.080> direct<00:03:14.319> sunlight

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
I apologize obviously direct sunlight

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.160 
I apologize obviously direct sunlight
hard<00:03:14.890> but<00:03:15.700> yeah

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
hard but yeah

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.610 
hard but yeah
wonderful<00:03:19.910> so<00:03:20.910> two<00:03:21.060> fingers<00:03:21.630> dragging<00:03:22.530> across

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
wonderful so two fingers dragging across

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.670 
wonderful so two fingers dragging across
and<00:03:23.190> basically<00:03:23.940> too<00:03:24.240> much<00:03:24.480> too<00:03:25.200> much<00:03:25.320> inferred

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
and basically too much too much inferred

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.040 
and basically too much too much inferred
light<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:26.190> have<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.240> sensors<00:03:27.630> figure<00:03:27.930> out

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
light to have the sensors figure out

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.390 
light to have the sensors figure out
where<00:03:28.260> exactly<00:03:28.290> you're<00:03:28.830> touching<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.310> can

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
where exactly you're touching you can

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.310 
where exactly you're touching you can
see<00:03:29.550> that<00:03:29.670> we're<00:03:29.790> still<00:03:30.000> outside<00:03:30.210> we're<00:03:31.110> just

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
see that we're still outside we're just

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.770 
see that we're still outside we're just
in<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.800> shade<00:03:32.070> so<00:03:32.550> direct<00:03:33.270> sunlight<00:03:33.540> it's

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
in the shade so direct sunlight it's

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.660 
in the shade so direct sunlight it's
really<00:03:34.110> only<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.350> few<00:03:34.560> feet<00:03:34.710> away<00:03:34.740> but<00:03:35.280> we're<00:03:35.430> on

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
really only a few feet away but we're on

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.030 
really only a few feet away but we're on
an<00:03:35.790> overhang<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.330> so<00:03:37.110> we're<00:03:37.500> getting<00:03:37.620> shade

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
an overhang and so we're getting shade

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.800 
an overhang and so we're getting shade
there's<00:03:38.310> no<00:03:38.460> direct<00:03:38.820> sunlight<00:03:39.120> hitting<00:03:39.570> the

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
there's no direct sunlight hitting the

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.050 
there's no direct sunlight hitting the
screen<00:03:40.110> but<00:03:40.740> there's<00:03:40.920> plenty<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.520> plenty<00:03:41.940> of

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
screen but there's plenty of plenty of

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.820 
screen but there's plenty of plenty of
infrared<00:03:42.390> light<00:03:42.480> bouncing<00:03:43.290> around<00:03:43.380> and

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
infrared light bouncing around and

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.610 
infrared light bouncing around and
lighting<00:03:44.190> up<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.430> area<00:03:44.670> out<00:03:44.730> here<00:03:45.230> but<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.410> just

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
lighting up the area out here but I just

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.160 
lighting up the area out here but I just
want<00:03:46.770> to<00:03:46.830> show<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.010> how<00:03:47.400> much<00:03:47.880> different<00:03:48.420> the

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
want to show you how much different the

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.200 
want to show you how much different the
tracking<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:49.890> compared<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.460> having<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.120> in

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
tracking is compared to having it in

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.310 
tracking is compared to having it in
direct<00:03:51.480> sunlight<00:03:51.660> so<00:03:52.080> you<00:03:52.980> have<00:03:53.070> a<00:03:53.130> go<00:03:54.020> and<00:03:55.020> as

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
direct sunlight so you have a go and as

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.070 
direct sunlight so you have a go and as
you<00:03:55.380> can<00:03:55.500> see<00:03:55.560> it<00:03:56.130> is<00:03:56.760> perfect<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.840> probably

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
you can see it is perfect you probably

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.650 
you can see it is perfect you probably
wouldn't<00:03:58.290> want<00:03:58.320> to<00:03:58.470> use<00:03:58.590> really<00:03:58.770> large<00:03:59.070> frames

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
wouldn't want to use really large frames

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.060 
wouldn't want to use really large frames
because<00:04:00.660> of<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.990> infrared<00:04:01.320> light<00:04:01.709> from<00:04:01.740> the

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
because of the infrared light from the

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.980 
because of the infrared light from the
LEDs<00:04:02.459> not<00:04:02.850> being<00:04:03.120> able<00:04:03.270> to<00:04:03.480> reach<00:04:03.720> your

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
LEDs not being able to reach your

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.810 
LEDs not being able to reach your
fingers<00:04:04.470> when<00:04:04.680> it's<00:04:04.800> having<00:04:04.950> to<00:04:05.160> compete<00:04:05.520> with

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
fingers when it's having to compete with

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.360 
fingers when it's having to compete with
you<00:04:06.480> know<00:04:06.600> ambient<00:04:07.140> sunlight<00:04:07.290> or<00:04:07.709> whatnot<00:04:07.890> so

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
you know ambient sunlight or whatnot so

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.320 
you know ambient sunlight or whatnot so
if<00:04:08.550> you're<00:04:08.670> trying<00:04:08.880> to<00:04:08.940> make<00:04:09.030> really<00:04:09.300> really

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
if you're trying to make really really

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.449 
if you're trying to make really really
large<00:04:09.690> images<00:04:10.110> probably<00:04:10.410> best<00:04:10.770> to<00:04:11.010> have<00:04:11.190> it<00:04:11.340> in

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
large images probably best to have it in

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.030 
large images probably best to have it in
a<00:04:11.550> controlled<00:04:12.030> lighting<00:04:12.750> situation<00:04:13.470> not<00:04:13.800> with

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
a controlled lighting situation not with

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.099 
a controlled lighting situation not with
staring<00:04:14.550> sunlight<00:04:15.000> on<00:04:15.240> it<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:15.540> also<00:04:15.810> any<00:04:15.990> of

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
staring sunlight on it and also any of

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.180 
staring sunlight on it and also any of
these<00:04:16.200> screens<00:04:16.590> that<00:04:16.709> are<00:04:16.830> gonna<00:04:16.920> have

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
these screens that are gonna have

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.699 
these screens that are gonna have
varying<00:04:17.609> lighting<00:04:17.880> conditions<00:04:18.330> you<00:04:18.930> may<00:04:19.109> see

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
varying lighting conditions you may see

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.199 
varying lighting conditions you may see
that<00:04:19.980> you<00:04:20.070> have<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.370> calibrate<00:04:20.580> them<00:04:21.060> if

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
that you have to calibrate them if

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.970 
that you have to calibrate them if
you're<00:04:21.330> having<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.720> huge<00:04:22.169> contrast<00:04:22.740> between

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
you're having a huge contrast between

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.159 
you're having a huge contrast between
certain<00:04:23.520> lighting<00:04:23.850> situations<00:04:24.540> you<00:04:25.050> know

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
certain lighting situations you know

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.740 
certain lighting situations you know
obviously<00:04:26.070> between<00:04:26.250> fully<00:04:26.880> off<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:27.330> fully<00:04:27.540> on

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
obviously between fully off and fully on

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.110 
obviously between fully off and fully on
ambient<00:04:28.200> light<00:04:28.380> could<00:04:28.980> be<00:04:29.010> a<00:04:29.130> problem<00:04:29.580> but<00:04:29.880> if

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
ambient light could be a problem but if

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.820 
ambient light could be a problem but if
you're<00:04:30.270> just<00:04:30.390> having<00:04:30.540> moderate<00:04:31.110> changes<00:04:31.560> the

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
you're just having moderate changes the

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.380 
you're just having moderate changes the
frames<00:04:32.430> work<00:04:32.700> just<00:04:32.910> fine

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
frames work just fine

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.980 
frames work just fine
so<00:04:33.540> we've<00:04:33.960> compared<00:04:34.470> ambient<00:04:35.310> sunlight

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
so we've compared ambient sunlight

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.120 
so we've compared ambient sunlight
direct<00:04:36.990> sunlight<00:04:37.850> inside<00:04:38.850> we<00:04:39.390> also<00:04:39.540> looked<00:04:39.990> at

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
direct sunlight inside we also looked at

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.710 
direct sunlight inside we also looked at
light<00:04:41.130> coming<00:04:41.580> in<00:04:41.730> through<00:04:41.760> a<00:04:42.000> window<00:04:42.360> these

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
light coming in through a window these

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.600 
light coming in through a window these
frames<00:04:43.020> will<00:04:43.230> work<00:04:43.380> anywhere<00:04:43.980> that<00:04:44.550> you're

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
frames will work anywhere that you're

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.170 
frames will work anywhere that you're
not<00:04:44.820> getting<00:04:45.150> any<00:04:45.360> direct<00:04:47.180> high-intensity

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180

infrared<00:04:48.780> light<00:04:49.020> like<00:04:49.350> the<00:04:49.500> sunlight<00:04:49.740> or

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
infrared light like the sunlight or

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.390 
infrared light like the sunlight or
perhaps<00:04:50.790> a<00:04:51.090> very<00:04:51.330> very<00:04:51.600> bright<00:04:52.400> incandescent

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
perhaps a very very bright incandescent

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.560 
perhaps a very very bright incandescent
bulb<00:04:54.110> but<00:04:55.110> really<00:04:55.980> good<00:04:56.100> news<00:04:56.370> you<00:04:57.030> can<00:04:57.210> use<00:04:57.419> it

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
bulb but really good news you can use it

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.150 
bulb but really good news you can use it
outside<00:04:57.690> where<00:04:58.410> there's<00:04:58.560> lots<00:04:58.710> of<00:04:58.860> infrared

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
outside where there's lots of infrared

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.469 
outside where there's lots of infrared
light<00:04:59.280> bouncing<00:04:59.820> around<00:04:59.910> something<00:05:00.360> you

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
light bouncing around something you

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.260 
light bouncing around something you
could<00:05:00.780> not<00:05:00.930> do<00:05:01.200> with<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.590> infrared<00:05:02.270> cameras

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
could not do with the infrared cameras

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.200 
could not do with the infrared cameras
and<00:05:03.630> it's<00:05:04.140> all<00:05:04.320> due<00:05:04.620> to<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:05.100> setup<00:05:05.760> of<00:05:05.970> the

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
and it's all due to the setup of the

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.180 
and it's all due to the setup of the
infrared<00:05:06.660> light<00:05:06.900> and<00:05:07.140> the<00:05:07.350> infrared<00:05:07.680> sensors

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
the normal optical tracking setup you

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.890 
the normal optical tracking setup you
need<00:05:14.100> to<00:05:14.220> build<00:05:14.340> a<00:05:14.520> set<00:05:14.700> up<00:05:14.820> outside<00:05:15.360> that

need to build a set up outside that

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.870 
need to build a set up outside that
needs<00:05:16.140> to<00:05:16.320> go<00:05:16.380> to<00:05:16.500> track<00:05:16.860> fingers<00:05:17.340> and<00:05:17.580> whatnot

with either a camera setup or an
infrared<00:05:19.800> touch<00:05:20.010> frame<00:05:20.280> you're<00:05:20.880> much<00:05:21.479> better

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
infrared touch frame you're much better

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.330 
infrared touch frame you're much better
off<00:05:21.930> going<00:05:22.169> with<00:05:22.440> an<00:05:22.560> infrared<00:05:22.800> touch<00:05:23.040> frame

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
off going with an infrared touch frame

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.010 
off going with an infrared touch frame
just<00:05:23.610> because<00:05:23.910> you<00:05:24.419> can<00:05:24.570> have<00:05:24.720> all<00:05:24.780> this

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
just because you can have all this

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.409 
just because you can have all this
ambient<00:05:25.440> infrared<00:05:25.890> light<00:05:26.130> but<00:05:26.729> you<00:05:27.240> know<00:05:27.360> you

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
ambient infrared light but you know you

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:28.850 
ambient infrared light but you know you
can't<00:05:27.660> have<00:05:27.750> a<00:05:27.810> direct<00:05:28.140> sunlight<00:05:28.350> but<00:05:28.620> you<00:05:28.710> can

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
can't have a direct sunlight but you can

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
can't have a direct sunlight but you can
still<00:05:29.039> use<00:05:29.190> it<00:05:29.340> in<00:05:29.370> all<00:05:29.520> the<00:05:29.640> normal

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
still use it in all the normal

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.250 
still use it in all the normal
situations<00:05:30.360> you<00:05:30.479> would<00:05:30.570> probably<00:05:30.960> be

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
situations you would probably be

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.890 
situations you would probably be
using<00:05:31.470> an<00:05:31.980> LCD<00:05:32.130> or<00:05:32.460> a<00:05:32.730> projected<00:05:33.240> image<00:05:33.450> I<00:05:33.750> mean

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
using an LCD or a projected image I mean

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.120 
using an LCD or a projected image I mean
you<00:05:34.020> wouldn't<00:05:34.200> want<00:05:34.320> to<00:05:34.470> have<00:05:34.560> an<00:05:34.710> LCD<00:05:34.980> in

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
you wouldn't want to have an LCD in

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.740 
you wouldn't want to have an LCD in
direct<00:05:35.400> Sun<00:05:35.550> anyways<00:05:35.940> it<00:05:36.090> would<00:05:36.150> totally<00:05:36.390> wash

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
direct Sun anyways it would totally wash

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.000 
direct Sun anyways it would totally wash
out<00:05:36.960> the<00:05:37.080> image<00:05:37.320> so<00:05:37.470> there's<00:05:37.620> no<00:05:37.710> point<00:05:37.860> in

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
out the image so there's no point in

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.710 
out the image so there's no point in
using<00:05:38.160> it<00:05:38.400> this<00:05:38.880> is<00:05:39.030> the<00:05:39.120> perfect<00:05:39.240> thing<00:05:39.540> to

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
using it this is the perfect thing to

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.570 
using it this is the perfect thing to
use<00:05:39.930> and<00:05:40.290> infrared<00:05:40.650> touch<00:05:40.800> frames<00:05:41.130> you<00:05:41.430> can

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
use and infrared touch frames you can

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.460 
use and infrared touch frames you can
see<00:05:41.730> you<00:05:42.000> know<00:05:42.120> again<00:05:42.780> we're<00:05:43.020> in<00:05:43.170> the<00:05:43.260> shade

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
see you know again we're in the shade

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:49.400 
see you know again we're in the shade
and<00:05:44.540> lots<00:05:45.540> of<00:05:45.860> good<00:05:46.860> tracking
