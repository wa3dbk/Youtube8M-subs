00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.449 
carded because he's about what 510 511
but<00:03:21.720> just<00:03:22.470> walk<00:03:22.680> up<00:03:22.860> in<00:03:23.040> there<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.400> they

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
but just walk up in there and they

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.830 
but just walk up in there and they
assume<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:23.790> i<00:03:24.000> can<00:03:24.209> buy<00:03:24.330> drinks<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.780> all

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
assume that i can buy drinks and all

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.470 
assume that i can buy drinks and all
that<00:03:24.989> crap<00:03:25.110> i<00:03:25.580> don't<00:03:26.580> really<00:03:26.700> even<00:03:26.880> drink<00:03:27.239> so<00:03:27.450> i

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
that crap i don't really even drink so i

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.940 
that crap i don't really even drink so i
guess<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:27.959> doesn't<00:03:28.200> help<00:03:28.320> me<00:03:28.410> out<00:03:28.530> too<00:03:28.739> much

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
guess it doesn't help me out too much

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.660 
guess it doesn't help me out too much
but<00:03:29.209> she's<00:03:30.209> nice<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.630> think<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:30.900> everyone

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
but she's nice to think that everyone

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.070 
but she's nice to think that everyone
thinks<00:03:32.670> you're<00:03:32.850> older<00:03:33.209> i<00:03:33.420> guess<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.810> was<00:03:33.840> more

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
thinks you're older i guess it was more

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.229
