00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:03.919 

so<00:00:02.129> this<00:00:02.580> is<00:00:02.730> one<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:02.970> those<00:00:03.060> pallets<00:00:03.629> that<00:00:03.750> are

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
so this is one of those pallets that are

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.889 
so this is one of those pallets that are
difficult<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.710> get<00:00:04.830> into<00:00:05.069> because<00:00:05.790> they<00:00:06.569> have

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
difficult to get into because they have

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.990 
difficult to get into because they have
the<00:00:07.259> little<00:00:07.799> groove<00:00:08.040> on<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.429> back<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:08.970> a

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
the little groove on the back and a

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.330 
the little groove on the back and a
little<00:00:09.240> plate<00:00:09.570> that<00:00:10.320> comes<00:00:10.590> off<00:00:10.860> this<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.219> the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
little plate that comes off this is the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.950 
little plate that comes off this is the
little<00:00:11.550> plate<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:11.940> comes<00:00:12.179> off<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.480> we<00:00:12.809> need

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
little plate that comes off and we need

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.200 
little plate that comes off and we need
to<00:00:13.139> get<00:00:13.320> into<00:00:13.500> that<00:00:13.710> in<00:00:14.370> order<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.910> get<00:00:15.059> into

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
to get into that in order to get into

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.960 
to get into that in order to get into
our<00:00:15.480> eyeshadows<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.379> do<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:17.010> pot<00:00:17.220> them<00:00:17.460> so

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
our eyeshadows and do you pot them so

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.429 
our eyeshadows and do you pot them so
we're<00:00:18.090> gonna<00:00:18.210> look<00:00:18.420> for<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.750> groove<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.230> runs

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
we're gonna look for the groove it runs

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.410 
we're gonna look for the groove it runs
along<00:00:19.740> here<00:00:19.770> now<00:00:20.400> sometimes<00:00:20.850> if<00:00:21.000> you're<00:00:21.150> lucky

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
you can get into it by maybe wedging

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.839 
you can get into it by maybe wedging
your<00:00:24.930> spatula<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.369> just<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.609> little

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
and you're just gonna melt OOP we have

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.550 
and you're just gonna melt OOP we have
fire<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:24.630> don't<00:01:24.780> want<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.020> get<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.290> clip

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
let's go a little bit further and just

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.929 
let's go a little bit further and just
melt<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.500> glue<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.490> happens<00:01:29.850> just

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
melt it that glue if that happens just

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.090 
melt it that glue if that happens just
blow<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.509> up<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:30.960> no<00:01:31.259> big<00:01:31.500> deal

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
blow it up it's no big deal

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.399 
blow it up it's no big deal
keep<00:01:32.400> your<00:01:32.549> flame<00:01:32.820> moving<00:01:33.329> can<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:33.990> see<00:01:34.229> that

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
keep your flame moving can you see that

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.440 
keep your flame moving can you see that
and<00:01:34.680> you're<00:01:35.579> gonna<00:01:35.670> get<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.939> little<00:01:36.090> bit<00:01:36.270> of

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
and you're gonna get a little bit of

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.850 
and you're gonna get a little bit of
black<00:01:36.600> smoke<00:01:36.810> which<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.350> probably<00:01:37.770> not

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
black smoke which is probably not

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.160 
black smoke which is probably not
healthy<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.369> be<00:01:38.610> breathing<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.869> did

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
healthy to be breathing in but that did

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.620 
healthy to be breathing in but that did
melt<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.829> plastic<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.880> as<00:01:42.030> quickly<00:01:42.360> as

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
melt the plastic and as quickly as
