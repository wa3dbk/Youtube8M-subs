 arcane television your channel your 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.489
 internet tourism 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.469
 many times we want to clean our 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.640
 heart our soul and we use 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:42.550
 different objects but 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.489
 the general cleaning leave our 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.090
 teachers when you really want 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.129
 be at peace with yourself 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.559
 stop envying thinking about others 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.880
 people everything will depend on us 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.810
 of what our 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.300
 we go on like that is to support that 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.090
 situation today we will teach you a 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.750
 ritual with which you will be able to clean 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:12.440
 current for this we will use water from 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:15.100
 flowering and some rose petals 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.860
 we will also need a pencil 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:22.900
 remember that you should preferably have 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:26.590
 some red color this pencil 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.500
 you must first write on each petal and 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.650
 very carefully without you going to 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.940
 break the petals you must write with the 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:40.420
 pencil negative feelings 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:43.600
 doing self-analysis a self-examination 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.409
 of how your heart is what it is that 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.080
 feel your heart 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.890
 is to write on this petal 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.070
 first we give an example selfishness 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.830
 can 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.580
 you put the petal on this side now 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.480
 you write on the other petal resentment 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.370
 it can be the feeling 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.370
 500 invade us many 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.200
 and you are getting demanding and the other can 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.150
 melancholy sadness all 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.490
 feelings that you can 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.390
 have experienced at some time 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.790
 you must translate the write them in each 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.230
 one of the petals that you have that 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.440
 moment 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.200
 once you swoon everyone and everyone already 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.780
 have any negative feelings if 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.390
 you feel that there are not many that you do not have 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.900
 So many average feelings can you 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:44.890
 even repeat those that I have already described 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.319
 some pros you write in some other 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.959
 petals there is also no problem 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.499
 I finish writing everything and the 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.170
 Then you must remove the water from 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:59.719
 flowering over each of the 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.989
 petals of preference you can make a 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:05.299
 hole in the top of the 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.030
 vial containing the side of 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:11.750
 flowering and so you can go 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.889
 controlling the fall of this little water 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:19.420
 you drop drop rate in each of 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:22.330
 the petals that symbolize 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.450
 negative feeling that you can have 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.599
 experienced or from which you love 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.210
 detach you want to detach then 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.340
 end subscribe 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:36.250
 you finish spraying each one 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.920
 then you put aside the work of 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.600
 budding together all the petals 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.140
 thus 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.740
 you leave it there that you keep it 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:52.100
 arrange for one hour after having 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:56.450
 after that hour you will see that they will have 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:04:02.000
 dried even all the liquid that you have 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:04.100
 thrown over this one these rose petals 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.400
 you realize that little by little 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.360
 as they go by spending 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.150
 the days 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.970
 these rose petals are drying of 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.730
 that same form and they will disappear 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.430
 all those feelings of furrows of your 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.949
 lifetime 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.190
