00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.260
 well guys obviously inside of 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.510
 this video as for the previous one 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.730
 this is also recorded with the voice 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.920
 over so the audio doesn't match 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.320
 what I was doing at the time 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.790
 however the first start of this lg with 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.010
 the web os operating system like 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.100
 we can see some slow start first 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.800
 it is not so slow for every hour there 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.699
 I can confirm 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.170
 so let's go to see a little bit 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.269
 first start up what the 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.730
 what television offers us to do now 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:36.890
 do not give that of course I am 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.960
 I was framing the screen 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.510
 the screen with the camera 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.510
 if you were to continue making videos of the 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.010
 tv is normal that no or equipment from 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.780
 connect to the TV to be able to record 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.040
 in direct take what happens then 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.820
 we must settle for a little bit 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.860
 of this medium-low quality though 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.879
 however this is what that is 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.699
 what can I do 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:02.000
 then now you should start the first one 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.530
 the guided procedure that precisely there 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.180
 allows you to configure all the various 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.130
 parameters that a configures in 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.860
 very particular guided configuration 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.690
 here is how you see shows us of 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.970
 take the magic remote control the magic 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.790
 fashions is to use that to 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.790
 precisely maneuver the various various menus ie 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.090
 this little bird that guides us in short 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.690
 at the beginning with the first ignition with i 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.880
 first settings but I have essentially 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.640
 canceled this first this first phase 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.460
 to go and see if they were there 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.650
 software updates available for 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.210
 the TV to avoid redoing twice 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.770
 the same procedure is in fact like 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.570
 we'll see soon I found the 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.430
 updates and so I preferred 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.780
 restart for television with 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.760
 the update completed so that 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.670
 it was configured once and for all 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.890
 in a more precise manner 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.510
 and here we are indeed in the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.909
 settings to go see the 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.590
 updates had already been there 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.090
 will already be connected to the internet then in 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.070
 the moment I went to the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.440
 general settings and then on 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.810
 you will indeed see information on TV 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.330
 as already the download had started was 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.709
 already to a say a fourth is the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.159
 version that you see above is actually 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.720
 the 04 point 30.16 which is that of 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.610
 start of this type therefore anyway 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.900
 an October shooting firmware I saw on 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.340
 on the website 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.290
 after the update instead the version 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.379
 final that went to install the 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.849
 zero 4.30 2.20 which was distributed to 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.069
 November and then last 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.319
 currently available therefore this 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.299
 phase there is above all the update 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.890
 of the software that was neither 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.819
 particularly slow or particularly 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.030
 fast 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.069
 I imagine the heavy firmware about 7 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.470
 800 megawatts and therefore quite heavy 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.540
 because in any case the download speed 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.060
 I know it is quite high with fiber 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.400
 the short stage of download is 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.859
 It was already long in itself after all 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.840
 however an update in short 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.430
 feasible in the background so that not 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.139
 that didn't bother me 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.790
 now at the end of this of this 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.340
 update then is essentially 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.900
 restarted the TV to be able to do the 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.189
 the initial setting is that which 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.349
 we'll see in a few moments 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:08.989
 and here we are with the TV that you are just 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.780
 restarted place lg the wheel of 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.689
 loading in progress and the now famous 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.150
 lg little bird that starts its flight e 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:18.590
 15 guides us into the first 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.299
 television configuration really 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.530
 this kind of nice 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.840
 customization was not the first 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.480
 question is where we are therefore with the 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.739
 Magic remote like you see is really 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.889
 fantastic to use because that's enough 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.379
 point it at the TV to receive 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:35.569
 immediately comfortable mouse input if 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:39.530
 so we mean I just selected 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:42.319
 italy i am selecting as country counts 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.819
 Italy therefore Italians Italy now 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.709
 update the settings related to 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.870
 tongue on the right we see a bar 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.560
 under a patina that makes a reflection 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.510
 on TV because I recorded it in the evening 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.609
 in which precisely he shows us the passages 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.840
 still to be done here says operation 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.909
 completed long ago has been located 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.159
 really very nice this way of 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:03.500
 set for are these animations 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:06.199
 details here is the part where 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.599
 you need to connect to the home network 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:10.639
 as you can see now the keyboard will appear a 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.079
 screen that I write here and now 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.449
 the password 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:17.479
 ok guys password inserted tv connected 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:19.940
 at home wifi and those are its beginnings 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.660
 to surf if connected to the internet 15 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.460
 in short, he informs us that 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.520
 the configuration is completed in this 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.200
 in case the TV will be looked at home if later 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.120
 we must see how it will come as we receive 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.590
 teach on TV broadcasts because 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.390
 connected to digital terrestrial 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.560
 this television is an entrance for both 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.090
 the digital terrestrial therefore for 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.130
 the terrestrial antenna but also for that 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.900
 satellite however I do not have one 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.330
 siena so I set a simple one 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.470
 digital terrestrial search with with 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.810
 antenna I see myself I always have it inside 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.430
 eager to do this 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.160
 want it this way 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.630
 the search begins at the end of which 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.710
 we'll see a few how many 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.610
 programs approved the steps 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.170
 subsequent determined 265 channels 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.720
 concerning the television there is one here 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.070
 phase in which you must go to select 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.200
 the programs that maybe they have 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.280
 duplicates then make a choice in 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.080
 based on what we want 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.240
 with long signal that we want to receive 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.460
 but usually they are more than other channels 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.420
 just the same with names 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.550
 different 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.850
 the choice they were on seems to me 13 when 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.800
 you should be the last ok let's go to 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.630
 see the next legal notice step 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.760
 in short, all the various must be sought with 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.410
 contracts and not a venture 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.060
 television being smart tv with the 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.230
 possibility of external communication 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.280
 etc 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.500
 there are all the various legal notes 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.190
 user contracts as you see now 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.540
 then we select terms of use 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.350
 all privacy stuff as usual 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.780
 I read everything so I accept it 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.800
 see now ok additional services then 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.810
 display information 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.669
 vocal information because like travel 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.570
 chan said the unboxing to these 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.160
 voice commands 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.870
 so there are also advertisements 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.630
 personalized within the laws 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.370
 of the ior laws and therefore in short I gave 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.900
 everything I accept here makes me see 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.000
 what we did one thing not 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.620
 I did was not add note 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.070
 the decoder because in the end there is none 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.040
 need 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:11.910
 I put an end to this and animation 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:14.280
 final note with ok fine now you can 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.230
 watch then watch TV and from here on 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.040
 then the configuration ends 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.630
 initial guided tour and my course starts 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.790
 taken directly to the type 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:27.990
 main as you see the antenna 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:29.610
 live tv so we will have to open life in 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:33.350
 direct the Kurd that I live in of 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:35.700
 live interviews with notes 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.010
 the interface that of classic TV that 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.900
 that thing for less and for this video 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.370
 it was all thank you for seeing it 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.030
 as usual and I give you an appointment at 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.510
 next one 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.510
 Hi guys
