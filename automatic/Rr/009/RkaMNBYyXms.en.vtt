22 I will be using the more initiative
my<00:01:29.750> asset<00:01:30.750> an<00:01:31.460> older<00:01:32.460> say<00:01:33.210> really<00:01:34.939> 33,000<00:01:36.920> kV

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
my asset an older say really 33,000 kV

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.960 
my asset an older say really 33,000 kV
mode<00:01:39.470> but<00:01:40.470> yeah<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:42.600> more<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.200> here

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
mode but yeah the more up here

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.929 
mode but yeah the more up here
servo<00:01:44.970> easy<00:01:45.750> receiver<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:48.000> that's<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.329> good

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
servo easy receiver so that's so good

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.819 
servo easy receiver so that's so good
now<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:52.259> model<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.250> turay<00:01:53.610> 121<00:01:54.479> inch

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
now is that this model of turay 121 inch

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.480 
now is that this model of turay 121 inch
where's<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.270> in<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:58.130> one-fifth<00:01:59.130> scale

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
where's that in this one-fifth scale

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.959 
where's that in this one-fifth scale
about<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.840> size<00:02:01.259> but<00:02:02.299> yeah<00:02:03.320> as<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.560> can<00:02:04.680> see

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
about that size but yeah as you can see

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.990 
about that size but yeah as you can see
compared<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.210> real<00:02:07.049> cowboy<00:02:07.700> boots<00:02:08.700> has<00:02:08.849> no

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
compared to a real cowboy boots has no

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.960 
compared to a real cowboy boots has no
bit<00:02:09.229> it's<00:02:10.229> quite<00:02:10.470> small<00:02:10.739> hopefully<00:02:11.129> but

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
bit it's quite small hopefully but

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.380 
bit it's quite small hopefully but
that's<00:02:12.740> probably<00:02:13.740> because<00:02:14.070> this<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.700> 144

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
that's probably because this is a 144

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:24.070 
that's probably because this is a 144
inches<00:02:15.570> but<00:02:16.940> yeah<00:02:17.940> now<00:02:20.630> comparing<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.750> away

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
inches but yeah now comparing it away

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.590 
inches but yeah now comparing it away
se10<00:02:25.790> they're<00:02:26.790> around<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.930> same<00:02:28.200> size<00:02:28.500> but

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
se10 they're around the same size but

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.960 
se10 they're around the same size but
you<00:02:30.600> can<00:02:30.630> really<00:02:31.170> tell<00:02:31.980> because<00:02:32.190> I'm<00:02:32.460> held

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
you can really tell because I'm held

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.870 
you can really tell because I'm held
pinch<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:35.180> but<00:02:36.180> yeah<00:02:36.840> that's<00:02:37.170> about<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.770> if<00:02:38.640> you

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
pinch it but yeah that's about it if you

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.630
