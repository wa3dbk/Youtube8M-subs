what I believe in and now I am a fan of
this<00:04:02.340> partly<00:04:02.640> because<00:04:02.850> it's<00:04:03.720> so<00:04:03.840> versatile

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
this partly because it's so versatile

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.980 
this partly because it's so versatile
man<00:04:04.590> it's<00:04:04.920> so<00:04:05.130> light<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.550> it<00:04:06.180> has<00:04:06.360> a<00:04:06.660> decent

man it's so light and it has a decent
amount<00:04:07.290> of<00:04:07.500> spray<00:04:07.740> so<00:04:08.160> out<00:04:08.310> of<00:04:08.340> ten<00:04:08.640> this

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
amount of spray so out of ten this

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.180 
amount of spray so out of ten this
product<00:04:09.270> would<00:04:09.390> have<00:04:09.420> about<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.260> 4/4<00:04:11.010> hold

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
product would have about a 4/4 hold

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.370 
product would have about a 4/4 hold
format<00:04:12.090> it's<00:04:12.300> not<00:04:12.480> really<00:04:12.750> matte<00:04:12.959> so<00:04:13.230> it's

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
format it's not really matte so it's

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.160 
format it's not really matte so it's
about<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:13.860> two<00:04:14.820> or<00:04:14.850> three<00:04:15.209> so<00:04:15.780> that's<00:04:15.930> like<00:04:16.109> a

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
about a two or three so that's like a

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.030 
about a two or three so that's like a
good<00:04:16.890> amount<00:04:17.220> for<00:04:17.280> shininess<00:04:17.930> flexibility<00:04:19.040> it

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
good amount for shininess flexibility it

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.979 
good amount for shininess flexibility it
doesn't<00:04:20.400> really<00:04:20.580> have<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.330> lot<00:04:21.479> of<00:04:21.570> flexibility

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
doesn't really have a lot of flexibility

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.910 
doesn't really have a lot of flexibility
it<00:04:22.109> doesn't<00:04:22.380> give<00:04:22.500> you<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:23.010> lot<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.340> volume<00:04:24.150> for

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
it doesn't give you a lot of volume for

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.370 
it doesn't give you a lot of volume for
say<00:04:25.100> but<00:04:25.850> it<00:04:26.120> does<00:04:26.330> give<00:04:26.540> you<00:04:26.660> a<00:04:26.690> lot<00:04:26.870> of<00:04:26.930> hold

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
say but it does give you a lot of hold

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.830 
say but it does give you a lot of hold
which<00:04:28.280> is<00:04:28.310> I<00:04:28.550> really<00:04:28.760> like<00:04:28.970> it<00:04:29.330> it's<00:04:29.450> like<00:04:29.660> that

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
which is I really like it it's like that

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.580 
which is I really like it it's like that
balance<00:04:30.260> and<00:04:31.960> so<00:04:32.960> three<00:04:33.140> good<00:04:33.290> things<00:04:33.470> are

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
balance and so three good things are

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.580 
balance and so three good things are
like<00:04:34.390> it's<00:04:35.390> portable<00:04:35.840> it's<00:04:38.140> it's<00:04:39.140> a<00:04:39.320> quick

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
like it's portable it's it's a quick

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.410 
like it's portable it's it's a quick
fixer-upper<00:04:40.340> and<00:04:40.400> it's<00:04:40.640> not<00:04:40.820> something<00:04:41.120> and

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
fixer-upper and it's not something and

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.940 
fixer-upper and it's not something and
it<00:04:41.930> doesn't<00:04:42.110> really<00:04:42.320> get<00:04:42.500> your<00:04:42.560> hands<00:04:42.740> dirty

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
it doesn't really get your hands dirty

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.040 
it doesn't really get your hands dirty
whereas<00:04:43.460> if<00:04:43.790> you're<00:04:43.970> using<00:04:44.000> a<00:04:44.270> wax<00:04:44.450> your<00:04:44.900> hands

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
whereas if you're using a wax your hands

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.630 
whereas if you're using a wax your hands
get<00:04:45.230> dirty<00:04:45.260> you<00:04:45.560> have<00:04:45.710> to<00:04:45.800> do<00:04:45.950> yeah<00:04:48.490> like<00:04:49.490> that

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
get dirty you have to do yeah like that

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.460 
get dirty you have to do yeah like that
and<00:04:49.850> there's<00:04:50.030> like<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.330> whole<00:04:50.480> step<00:04:50.750> where's

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
and there's like the whole step where's

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.690 
and there's like the whole step where's
waxing<00:04:51.800> your<00:04:51.920> hands<00:04:52.070> for<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.310> rest<00:04:52.370> of<00:04:52.580> the

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
waxing your hands for the rest of the

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.030 
waxing your hands for the rest of the
day<00:04:52.850> and<00:04:53.090> then<00:04:53.240> you<00:04:53.600> feel<00:04:53.810> like<00:04:54.080> in<00:04:54.890> your

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
day and then you feel like in your

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.490 
day and then you feel like in your
wedges<00:04:55.220> and<00:04:55.730> you're<00:04:56.660> eating<00:04:56.960> a<00:04:57.020> steak<00:04:57.260> and

and then the bad things I wish this

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.380 
and then the bad things I wish this
product<00:05:12.160> was<00:05:13.160> a<00:05:13.400> little<00:05:13.850> bit<00:05:13.970> less<00:05:14.150> shiny

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
product was a little bit less shiny

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.730 
product was a little bit less shiny
almost<00:05:14.890> and<00:05:15.890> I<00:05:16.040> wish<00:05:16.280> it<00:05:16.880> was<00:05:17.420> I<00:05:17.600> wish<00:05:18.140> this<00:05:18.320> was

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.710 
almost and I wish it was I wish this was
actually<00:05:18.950> a<00:05:19.190> smaller<00:05:19.640> packaging<00:05:20.210> like<00:05:20.390> more

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
actually a smaller packaging like more

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.480 
actually a smaller packaging like more
of<00:05:20.750> a<00:05:20.900> travel<00:05:21.290> size<00:05:21.440> and<00:05:21.860> makes<00:05:22.100> sense<00:05:22.310> more

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
of a travel size and makes sense more

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.320 
of a travel size and makes sense more
for<00:05:22.700> me<00:05:22.790> and<00:05:23.440> another<00:05:24.440> thing<00:05:24.710> that<00:05:25.330> actually

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
for me and another thing that actually

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.170 
for me and another thing that actually
makes<00:05:26.600> my<00:05:26.840> hair<00:05:26.990> a<00:05:27.020> bit<00:05:27.200> heavier<00:05:27.700> I've<00:05:28.700> noticed

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
makes my hair a bit heavier I've noticed

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.630 
makes my hair a bit heavier I've noticed
it's<00:05:29.630> not<00:05:29.690> like<00:05:29.930> your<00:05:30.080> dry<00:05:30.320> wax<00:05:30.530> where<00:05:30.890> like

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
it's not like your dry wax where like

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.640 
it's not like your dry wax where like
you<00:05:32.150> can<00:05:32.300> actually<00:05:32.450> give<00:05:32.990> it<00:05:33.110> a<00:05:33.200> bit<00:05:33.350> of<00:05:33.410> volume

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
you can actually give it a bit of volume

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.950 
you can actually give it a bit of volume
this<00:05:33.950> one<00:05:34.130> is<00:05:34.400> it<00:05:34.880> just<00:05:34.940> goes<00:05:35.390> straight<00:05:35.720> down

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
this one is it just goes straight down

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.040 
this one is it just goes straight down
half<00:05:36.410> the<00:05:36.530> time<00:05:39.400> to<00:05:40.400> think<00:05:40.610> about<00:05:40.910> it<00:05:41.330> is<00:05:41.510> a<00:05:41.690> wax

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
half the time to think about it is a wax

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.910 
half the time to think about it is a wax
spray<00:05:42.410> indeed<00:05:43.510> actually<00:05:44.510> I<00:05:44.720> would<00:05:45.470> recommend
