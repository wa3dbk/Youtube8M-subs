 with lewiston pans and because with the 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.930
 flavors pans with what is the 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.450
 difference of the pans likes it or not 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.240

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.500
 is that the difference commission is 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.690
 complete and stable why because the 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.370
 fringes with stand number 1 are made 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.380

 here for saying that the 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.160
 grannies cook with beltrÃ© but almost 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.560
 they cooked before if they had to be bought 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.630

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.510
 before and to the reference of sellers is not 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.420
 he gets stuck 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.489
 Nothing nothing at all and this is a reality 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.530

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.360
 we give it does not stay stuck 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.269

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.040
 We offer a lifetime guarantee 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.060
