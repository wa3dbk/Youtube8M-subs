00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 good day my ladies and gentlemen and 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.450
 welcome to a new episode of 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.370
 I wanted to 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.710
 mine is yes that that standard 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.900
 because yes says I have the most on 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.540
 Most said so far 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.490
 call of duty modern warfare now and then 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.890
 I once said big that I say 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.470
 but often content new cnet 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.539
 came out and you previously one 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.070
 Other has played in call of duty 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.880
 post I have for example black ops 2 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.800
 often mentioned 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.800
 jacobs 2 is awesome advents warfare 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.250
 minimal but there is a difference 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.809
 really minimal anyway maybe because 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.890
 i had good times there the beautiful 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.160
 Have fun times with you like me 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.320
 the better minimal better at this 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.469
 I can be told if it is 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:57.980
 It would be a PS4 version 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:01.260
 hammer it would be the best call of duty 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:05.659
 So reprint with as ps4 so one 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.480
 more beautiful graphics that was it then 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.610
 Of course I can not have everything 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:15.210
 and not everyone will find it good 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.850
 not every player will find call of 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.650
 Duty black ops 2 horny what made him so bad 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.650
 is these people are different 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.530
 that 's not quite attacked 13 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:39.240
 we stand like movements bad 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:40.890
 are bad you will just worse 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.420
 if you do not play all the time and off 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.910
 and sometimes you come out of the game 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.350
 game flow on this problem I have 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:52.020
 But right now is not really 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.300
 so hard when you know for example at 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.119
 the cards where the opponents hope 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:02.640
 a button so that for example the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:06.420
 first assist next the rave 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.140
 is only just from the exercise of what 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.140
 is so bad 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.870
 It is boring if you always 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.540
 schumacher would only win earlier 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.140
 probably stopped because of that 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.000
 boring six times in a row 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.000
 world champion what else can you achieve 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:35.469
 company concluding its hamburg in the clay 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.530
 unpacked just for fun because I have 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:41.670
 only two emblem and there you should 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.670
 be tapetenwechsel 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.500
 age from other side i love that 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.050
 Whenever you are on a goal not always 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.430
 but cheers are always on 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.230
 moves in and then gets the ball 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.990
 I now in the penner comes from the side 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.990
 and shoots you away 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.580
 something might hit something 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.580
 comes to be 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.030
 there comes the calculator or what will become 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:27.629
 lie down because he knows he 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:32.700
 you probably die 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:33.959
 know that you're dead if he dies 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.019
 possibly with illness months 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:40.079
 Being moderate says they will die 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.139
 then you know it yeah I mean it to 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:47.909
 for example, if you are shot down now 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:49.969
 from behind not for whatever reason 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:54.469
 always being shot down by them 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:56.879
 you know, then you feel something like that 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:58.620
 There are people who say where I knew 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.219
 that I would not do that me 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.219
 hurt 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:12.480
 two screws but still with drone 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:14.879
 made it clear if you know it 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.829
 my star becomes one knows one lets one 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:20.780
 Seconds before that is not so great either 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.780
 I will die there 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.030
 want is actually want it there 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:36.240
 people who prefer not to say 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:38.610
 I do not want to see it coming but we 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.740
 do not need to talk about it 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.090
 I wish all of us one more 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.240
 little to have something to live 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.050
 So that with the thought of death 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.610
 we also move 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:52.560
 we do not know the 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.270
 Medicine is getting better and better because of that 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.270
 Now let's say we look old 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.920
 because somebody is 88 today 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.240
 or if we are 80 or if I'm 80 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.490
 am I telling you modest but 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.220
 not today 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:08.310
 if we still have some way to live 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.970
 hopefully one more time with tuba 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.100
 emblem 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.280
 I find my friends be better 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.310
 red bit too dark 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:21.830
 we are second but our map is 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.830
 better until next time and bye
