two three and four five and six pointers

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.770 
two three and four five and six pointers
on<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:17.009> push<00:01:17.220> break<00:01:17.550> actually<00:01:18.180> closed<00:01:18.509> in

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
on the push break actually closed in

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.960 
on the push break actually closed in
like<00:01:18.990> an<00:01:19.140> accordion<00:01:19.430> so<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.550> get<00:01:20.700> something

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
like an accordion so we get something

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.520 
like an accordion so we get something
like<00:01:22.220> walking<00:01:23.220> walking<00:01:23.759> closer<00:01:24.530> walking

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
like walking walking closer walking

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.969 
like walking walking closer walking
closer<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.369> then<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.550> big<00:01:26.759> step<00:01:27.030> back<00:01:27.300> as

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
closer and then a big step back as

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.960 
closer and then a big step back as
opposed<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:32.690> maintaining<00:01:33.690> the<00:01:33.930> same<00:01:34.140> distance

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
opposed to maintaining the same distance

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.249 
opposed to maintaining the same distance
so<00:01:35.970> what<00:01:36.300> that<00:01:36.330> means<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.899> that<00:01:36.960> we're<00:01:37.170> going

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
so what that means is that we're going

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.139 
so what that means is that we're going
to<00:01:37.320> have<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.619> travel<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.190> little<00:01:38.460> bit<00:01:38.610> on<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
third step so first step second step

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.510 
third step so first step second step
your<00:01:43.680> right<00:01:43.710> there<00:01:44.220> travel<00:01:45.180> more<00:01:45.570> in<00:01:46.289> and<00:01:46.950> big
