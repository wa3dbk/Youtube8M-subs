00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.439 
our tutorial so we're not gonna need our
default<00:00:52.920> cube<00:00:53.399> today<00:00:53.579> but<00:00:53.969> whether<00:00:54.180> we're

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
default cube today but whether we're

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.660 
default cube today but whether we're
going<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.660> be<00:00:54.750> using<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:55.289> plane<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.190> add<00:00:56.399> much

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
going to be using a plane so add much

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.700 
going to be using a plane so add much
mesh<00:00:57.390> plane<00:00:57.920> we're<00:00:58.920> gonna<00:00:59.039> scale<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.430> up<00:00:59.489> 5<00:00:59.850> and

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
mesh plane we're gonna scale it up 5 and

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.680 
mesh plane we're gonna scale it up 5 and
go<00:01:01.710> into<00:01:01.890> edit<00:01:02.100> mode<00:01:02.539> we're<00:01:03.539> going<00:01:03.629> to

go into edit mode we're going to

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.969 
go into edit mode we're going to
subdivide<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.710> few<00:01:05.010> times<00:01:06.350> that<00:01:07.350> seems<00:01:07.710> good

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
subdivide it a few times that seems good

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.800 
subdivide it a few times that seems good
enough<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.580> go<00:01:09.510> back<00:01:09.689> into<00:01:09.930> object<00:01:10.740> mode<00:01:11.810> now

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
enough and go back into object mode now

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.899 
enough and go back into object mode now
we<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:13.979> need<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:15.320> click<00:01:16.320> here<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:17.840> start<00:01:18.840> a

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
Lee go up from the plane i'll

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.250 
Lee go up from the plane i'll
demonstrate<00:02:19.640> this<00:02:20.180> in<00:02:20.420> a<00:02:20.570> minute<00:02:20.720> when<00:02:20.990> we<00:02:21.110> get

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
going to save this as cloud if i could

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.320 
going to save this as cloud if i could
spell<00:03:07.280> dot<00:03:07.970> PNG<00:03:08.270> and<00:03:08.720> i<00:03:09.070> just<00:03:10.070> like<00:03:10.250> PNG<00:03:10.520> geez<00:03:11.300> a
