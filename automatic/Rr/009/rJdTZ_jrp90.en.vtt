00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hello I have been many times already 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.720
 a question asked the medial 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.750
 I'm kind of real 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.370
 uncomfortable is because I meant 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.680
 I can say that, but I can not 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.590
 somehow he so the question one can of 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.980
 get you an autograph 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.980
 my first reaction 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.939
 and then I actually have the first one 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.740
 ( laughs) laughed loud because I did that 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.829
 for a bit outlandish 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.380
 because I do not actually make music 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.460
 want and somehow help the people 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.350
 want and somehow more these things 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.590
 all slowly so a little suspicious 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:52.800
 such questions will arise 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.480
 but I have something then so then 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.199
 paarmal now made that me something 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.989
 also sent it and it was amazing 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.799
 what I received for reactions 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.600
 that people were surprised 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.430
 So that as a Christmas present 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.900
 was partially transmitted and I the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.549
 did not get it because it was for 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.200
 me on effective note is on the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.290
 I somehow signs many greetings 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.500
 lingua wise, so to speak 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.540
 and I do not know who they are 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.670
 Reactions were so brilliantly well 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.240
 thus animal pleasure with it 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.829
 I was done that somehow 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.479
 then also has to take note of 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.780
 therefore 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.880
 well then i say so i have 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.320
 already the convincing so this 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.920
 started mailbox 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.110
 then send to God's name 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.149
 Envelope with an envelope in it 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.009
 is franked if otherwise as I said 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.049
 yes it broke so have maps 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.450
 I do not and I do not even am 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.640
 best envelope with a postcard in it 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.189
 Just send a postcard back 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.850
 and then I do my package as well 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.390
 round 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.320
 when it comes to really some people like that 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.969
 otherwise it is important as I said 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.619
 I still can not find my autograph 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.619
 as particularly worthy of deportation and 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:18.590
 somehow feel uncomfortable when 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:21.330
 Such things have now increasingly occurred 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.840
 but ok, yes , he knows the mailbox address 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.980

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:34.650
 the post office box and the postal code 960 30 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:37.230

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:42.569
