together<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.880> important<00:03:52.360> part<00:03:52.570> to<00:03:52.750> remember

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
together the important part to remember

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.350 
together the important part to remember
is<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.530> size<00:03:53.830> of<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.280> outside<00:03:54.730> diameter<00:03:55.210> and

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
is the size of the outside diameter and

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.240 
is the size of the outside diameter and
the<00:03:55.570> inside<00:03:56.020> diameter<00:03:56.260> which<00:03:56.950> will<00:03:57.130> be

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
the inside diameter which will be

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.860 
the inside diameter which will be

dependent on the size of your fittings
for<00:04:01.560> fittings<00:04:02.560> it's<00:04:02.740> important<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.220> remember

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
for fittings it's important to remember

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.220 
for fittings it's important to remember
there<00:04:03.700> are<00:04:03.730> two<00:04:03.940> types<00:04:04.150> you<00:04:04.570> can<00:04:04.630> have<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:04.870> barb

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
there are two types you can have a barb

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.940 
there are two types you can have a barb
type<00:04:05.440> of<00:04:05.620> fitting<00:04:05.950> like<00:04:06.610> so<00:04:06.930> or<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:08.110> compression

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
type of fitting like so or a compression

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.430 
type of fitting like so or a compression
fit<00:04:09.160> like<00:04:09.700> this<00:04:09.730> now<00:04:10.630> you<00:04:10.660> would<00:04:10.870> push<00:04:11.080> the

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
fit like this now you would push the

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.250 
fit like this now you would push the
tube<00:04:11.860> on<00:04:12.010> top<00:04:12.220> and<00:04:12.490> just<00:04:13.360> simply<00:04:13.780> screw<00:04:14.110> on<00:04:14.230> the

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
tube on top and just simply screw on the

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.800 
tube on top and just simply screw on the
cap<00:04:14.620> back<00:04:14.860> on<00:04:15.070> and<00:04:15.310> keep<00:04:15.580> it<00:04:15.700> on<00:04:15.850> time<00:04:16.120> all<00:04:16.480> for

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
cap back on and keep it on time all for

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.870 
cap back on and keep it on time all for
the<00:04:16.840> barb<00:04:17.140> well<00:04:17.800> actually<00:04:17.950> I'll<00:04:18.550> just<00:04:18.640> show

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
the barb well actually I'll just show

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.200 
the barb well actually I'll just show
you<00:04:18.910> right<00:04:19.739> so<00:04:20.739> for<00:04:20.920> the<00:04:21.010> barb<00:04:21.250> you<00:04:21.790> could<00:04:21.970> just

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
you right so for the barb you could just

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.490 
you right so for the barb you could just
simply<00:04:22.510> push<00:04:23.550> just<00:04:24.550> push<00:04:24.730> the<00:04:25.540> tube<00:04:25.780> on<00:04:26.230> it

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
simply push just push the tube on it

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.760 
simply push just push the tube on it
let's<00:04:27.460> give<00:04:27.670> you<00:04:27.760> a<00:04:27.790> tight<00:04:28.000> fit<00:04:28.380> once<00:04:29.380> it's<00:04:29.560> all

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
let's give you a tight fit once it's all

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.290 
let's give you a tight fit once it's all
the<00:04:29.890> way<00:04:29.920> in<00:04:30.040> to<00:04:30.400> make<00:04:30.550> sure<00:04:30.700> nothing<00:04:30.880> leaks

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
the way in to make sure nothing leaks

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.480 
the way in to make sure nothing leaks
out<00:04:31.450> you<00:04:31.630> can<00:04:31.750> either<00:04:31.930> use<00:04:32.050> a<00:04:32.260> zip<00:04:32.560> tie<00:04:32.770> to

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
out you can either use a zip tie to

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.050 
out you can either use a zip tie to
tighten<00:04:33.790> it<00:04:33.850> up<00:04:33.940> or<00:04:34.570> can<00:04:35.320> use<00:04:35.560> a<00:04:35.830> clamp<00:04:36.220> click

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
tighten it up or can use a clamp click

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.330 
tighten it up or can use a clamp click
in<00:04:37.180> this<00:04:37.300> case<00:04:37.540> now<00:04:38.530> I<00:04:38.590> won't<00:04:38.890> push<00:04:39.070> it<00:04:39.190> all<00:04:39.310> the

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
in this case now I won't push it all the

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.430 
in this case now I won't push it all the
way<00:04:39.460> in<00:04:39.580> because<00:04:39.970> they're<00:04:40.330> fairly<00:04:40.780> tight<00:04:41.140> and

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
way in because they're fairly tight and

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.590 
way in because they're fairly tight and
they're<00:04:41.860> hard<00:04:42.040> to<00:04:42.070> put<00:04:42.340> on<00:04:42.460> but<00:04:43.180> once<00:04:43.390> they're

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
they're hard to put on but once they're

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.620 
they're hard to put on but once they're
on<00:04:43.630> trust<00:04:44.410> me<00:04:44.530> water<00:04:44.740> won't<00:04:45.040> leak<00:04:45.250> out<00:04:45.570> now<00:04:46.570> for

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
on trust me water won't leak out now for

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.590 
on trust me water won't leak out now for
compression<00:04:47.230> fitting<00:04:47.710> which<00:04:48.490> in<00:04:48.790> my<00:04:49.270> case<00:04:49.300> I

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
compression fitting which in my case I

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.490 
compression fitting which in my case I
prefer<00:04:49.990> just<00:04:50.860> put<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.190> cap<00:04:51.400> on

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
prefer just put the cap on

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.300 
prefer just put the cap on
push<00:04:53.100> it<00:04:53.280> on<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.730> fitting<00:04:54.590> once<00:04:55.590> it's<00:04:55.800> on<00:04:55.920> nice

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
push it on the fitting once it's on nice

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.240 
push it on the fitting once it's on nice
and<00:04:56.340> tight<00:04:56.870> just<00:04:57.870> squeeze<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.710> top<00:04:58.890> back<00:04:59.070> on

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
and tight just squeeze the top back on

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.640 
and tight just squeeze the top back on
is<00:04:59.430> created<00:04:59.820> and<00:05:00.270> it<00:05:00.450> makes<00:05:00.690> for<00:05:00.780> much<00:05:01.230> much

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
is created and it makes for much much

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.300 
is created and it makes for much much
cleaner<00:05:01.980> look<00:05:02.310> but<00:05:03.060> they<00:05:03.330> are<00:05:03.450> more<00:05:03.810> expensive

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
cleaner look but they are more expensive

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.070 
cleaner look but they are more expensive
so<00:05:05.310> basically<00:05:05.670> they<00:05:05.910> are<00:05:05.970> both<00:05:06.210> as<00:05:06.450> efficient

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
so basically they are both as efficient

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.120 
so basically they are both as efficient
it's<00:05:07.800> just<00:05:08.070> a<00:05:08.340> type<00:05:08.600> style<00:05:09.600> and<00:05:09.990> the<00:05:10.860> price

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
it's just a type style and the price

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.490 
it's just a type style and the price
you're<00:05:11.280> going<00:05:11.430> to<00:05:11.490> pay<00:05:11.580> for<00:05:11.610> them<00:05:12.230> now<00:05:13.230> for<00:05:13.260> the

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
you're going to pay for them now for the

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.600 
you're going to pay for them now for the
cooling<00:05:13.830> liquid<00:05:14.010> you'll<00:05:14.340> want<00:05:14.490> to<00:05:14.550> use

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
cooling liquid you'll want to use

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.610 
cooling liquid you'll want to use
something<00:05:15.000> like<00:05:15.030> this<00:05:15.360> this<00:05:15.870> is<00:05:15.930> a<00:05:16.080> premade

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
something like this this is a premade

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.180 
something like this this is a premade
liquid<00:05:17.220> it's<00:05:17.760> UV<00:05:18.210> reacting<00:05:18.630> to<00:05:18.780> screen<00:05:19.190> you

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
liquid it's UV reacting to screen you

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.710 
liquid it's UV reacting to screen you
could<00:05:20.310> use<00:05:20.580> distilled<00:05:20.850> water<00:05:21.270> if<00:05:21.420> you<00:05:21.540> want

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
could use distilled water if you want

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.450 
could use distilled water if you want
just<00:05:21.960> make<00:05:22.080> sure<00:05:22.230> you<00:05:22.320> don't<00:05:22.350> use<00:05:22.740> regular<00:05:23.250> tap

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
just make sure you don't use regular tap

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.800 
just make sure you don't use regular tap
water<00:05:23.490> because<00:05:24.120> there<00:05:24.270> are<00:05:24.360> minerals<00:05:24.690> in

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
water because there are minerals in

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.450 
water because there are minerals in
there<00:05:24.960> that<00:05:25.110> could<00:05:25.140> form<00:05:25.470> deposits<00:05:26.100> and<00:05:26.310> your

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
there that could form deposits and your

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.190 
there that could form deposits and your
blocks<00:05:26.730> and<00:05:27.030> they<00:05:27.480> could<00:05:27.660> obstruct<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.169> flow

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
blocks and they could obstruct the flow

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.650 
blocks and they could obstruct the flow
it's<00:05:29.160> also<00:05:29.250> important<00:05:29.820> to<00:05:29.880> note<00:05:30.090> these

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
it's also important to note these

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.200 
it's also important to note these
liquids<00:05:31.380> the<00:05:31.650> colored<00:05:31.980> ones<00:05:32.010> have<00:05:32.610> a<00:05:32.640> tendency
