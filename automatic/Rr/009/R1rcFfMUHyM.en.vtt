it's<00:00:45.149> just<00:00:45.210> because<00:00:45.539> they<00:00:45.840> had<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.350> know

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
it's just because they had to you know

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.319

see<00:01:00.600> wave<00:01:00.960> there<00:01:01.289> because<00:01:01.680> if<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.489> had<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> choice

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
see wave there because if I had a choice

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.670 
see wave there because if I had a choice
of<00:01:03.090> getting<00:01:03.390> waiver<00:01:03.600> storm<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.199> probably<00:01:04.470> would

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
of getting waiver storm I probably would

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.620 
of getting waiver storm I probably would
have<00:01:04.739> gotten<00:01:04.949> wave<00:01:05.720> just<00:01:06.720> for<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> diverse<00:01:07.619> um

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
have gotten wave just for the diverse um

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
have gotten wave just for the diverse um
you<00:01:09.630> know<00:01:10.310> figure<00:01:11.310> collection<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:12.530> you<00:01:13.530> know

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
you know figure collection it's you know

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.740 
you know figure collection it's you know
better<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.460> wave<00:01:14.880> than<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> storm

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
better to have a wave than a storm

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.380 
better to have a wave than a storm
because<00:01:16.170> she'll<00:01:16.470> probably<00:01:16.680> get<00:01:16.950> more<00:01:17.729> rare<00:01:18.150> as

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
because she'll probably get more rare as

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.020 
because she'll probably get more rare as
time<00:01:18.659> goes<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.950> mean<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.430> whole<00:01:20.549> Babylon

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
time goes on I mean the whole Babylon

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.859 
time goes on I mean the whole Babylon
robes<00:01:21.330> will<00:01:21.659> be<00:01:21.930> rare<00:01:22.200> as<00:01:22.409> time<00:01:22.650> goes<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:23.070> but

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
robes will be rare as time goes on but

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.320 
robes will be rare as time goes on but
whatever<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.140> think<00:01:26.100> there<00:01:26.280> weren't<00:01:26.670> any<00:01:26.820> waves

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
whatever I think there weren't any waves

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.569 
whatever I think there weren't any waves
because<00:01:27.900> either<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.590> they<00:01:28.890> aren't<00:01:29.130> out<00:01:29.280> yet<00:01:29.310> or

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
because either a they aren't out yet or

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.420 
because either a they aren't out yet or
be<00:01:30.000> like<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:31.049> know<00:01:31.079> purple<00:01:32.009> looks<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.310> little

be like you know purple looks a little
more<00:01:32.640> interesting<00:01:33.210> than<00:01:33.470> bland<00:01:34.470> grey<00:01:35.100> so

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
more interesting than bland grey so

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.810 
more interesting than bland grey so
people<00:01:36.509> probably<00:01:36.869> noticed<00:01:37.380> her<00:01:37.619> more<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.520> i

jets<00:04:27.740> and<00:04:28.040> Sonic's<00:04:28.490> because<00:04:28.850> you<00:04:29.720> turn<00:04:29.990> it

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
jets and Sonic's because you turn it

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.750 
jets and Sonic's because you turn it
over<00:04:30.290> and<00:04:30.410> there's<00:04:30.620> almost<00:04:30.800> no<00:04:31.130> detail<00:04:31.550> on

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
over and there's almost no detail on

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.070 
over and there's almost no detail on
jets<00:04:32.090> but<00:04:32.960> uh<00:04:33.550> for<00:04:34.550> storm<00:04:34.850> there's<00:04:35.600> actually

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
jets but uh for storm there's actually

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.260 
jets but uh for storm there's actually
molded<00:04:36.440> detail<00:04:36.860> on<00:04:37.100> I<00:04:37.280> mean<00:04:37.460> granted<00:04:37.940> it's<00:04:38.120> not

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
molded detail on I mean granted it's not

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.110 
molded detail on I mean granted it's not
too<00:04:38.510> much<00:04:38.810> but<00:04:39.200> there<00:04:39.860> still<00:04:39.980> is<00:04:40.370> some<00:04:40.550> detail

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
too much but there still is some detail

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.840 
too much but there still is some detail
there<00:04:41.390> and<00:04:41.930> I<00:04:42.290> just<00:04:42.860> like<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:43.160> design<00:04:43.490> of<00:04:43.520> his

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
there and I just like the design of his

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.970 
there and I just like the design of his
board<00:04:44.120> it's<00:04:44.510> a<00:04:44.630> little<00:04:44.900> bulkier<00:04:45.380> but<00:04:45.650> I<00:04:45.680> like

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
board it's a little bulkier but I like

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.640 
board it's a little bulkier but I like
that<00:04:46.190> about<00:04:46.250> it<00:04:46.700> and<00:04:47.080> it<00:04:48.080> just<00:04:48.140> has<00:04:48.380> a<00:04:48.410> nice

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
that about it and it just has a nice

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.250 
that about it and it just has a nice
paint<00:04:48.950> job<00:04:49.040> and<00:04:49.340> whatnot<00:04:49.960> now<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.020> only

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
paint job and whatnot now the only

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.720 
paint job and whatnot now the only
difficult<00:04:51.800> thing<00:04:51.980> about<00:04:52.010> this<00:04:52.310> figure<00:04:52.670> is

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
difficult thing about this figure is

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.320 
difficult thing about this figure is
giving<00:04:53.180> them<00:04:53.300> on<00:04:53.420> the<00:04:53.570> board<00:04:54.640> and<00:04:55.640> having<00:04:56.180> him

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
giving them on the board and having him

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.780 
giving them on the board and having him
steady<00:04:56.750> on<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.110> board<00:04:57.460> you<00:04:58.460> just<00:04:58.640> gotta

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
steady on the board you just gotta

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.730 
steady on the board you just gotta
position<00:04:59.300> his<00:04:59.420> feet<00:04:59.720> right<00:04:59.960> maybe<00:05:00.350> turn<00:05:00.590> his

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
position his feet right maybe turn his

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.550 
position his feet right maybe turn his
ankles<00:05:01.190> a<00:05:01.310> little<00:05:01.340> bit<00:05:01.730> but<00:05:02.450> eventually<00:05:03.230> he

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
ankles a little bit but eventually he

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.350 
ankles a little bit but eventually he
will<00:05:03.770> get<00:05:04.010> there<00:05:04.280> and<00:05:04.520> he<00:05:04.640> will<00:05:04.820> stand<00:05:05.090> pretty

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
will get there and he will stand pretty

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.780 
will get there and he will stand pretty
well<00:05:06.370> next<00:05:07.370> to<00:05:07.700> jet<00:05:08.030> a<00:05:09.370> scale<00:05:10.370> looks

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
well next to jet a scale looks

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:19.060 
well next to jet a scale looks
proportional<00:05:11.570> I<00:05:11.780> say<00:05:13.090> right<00:05:17.200> i<00:05:18.200> forgot<00:05:18.590> to<00:05:18.920> do

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
proportional I say right i forgot to do

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.820 
proportional I say right i forgot to do
this<00:05:19.190> at<00:05:19.340> the<00:05:19.430> beginning<00:05:19.520> but<00:05:20.290> packaging<00:05:21.290> you

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
this at the beginning but packaging you

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.450 
this at the beginning but packaging you
probably<00:05:22.070> don't<00:05:22.190> care<00:05:24.100> packaging<00:05:25.100> nothing

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
probably don't care packaging nothing

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.010 
probably don't care packaging nothing
special<00:05:25.790> you<00:05:26.120> can<00:05:26.180> actually<00:05:26.360> see<00:05:26.540> the<00:05:26.750> card

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
special you can actually see the card

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.860 
special you can actually see the card
right<00:05:27.500> there<00:05:27.590> but<00:05:28.130> nothing<00:05:28.970> special<00:05:29.270> storm

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
right there but nothing special storm

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.920 
right there but nothing special storm
the<00:05:29.990> albatross<00:05:31.630> nothing<00:05:32.630> out<00:05:32.750> of<00:05:32.810> the

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
the albatross nothing out of the

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.850 
the albatross nothing out of the
ordinary<00:05:32.990> for<00:05:33.560> the<00:05:33.830> riders<00:05:34.720> and<00:05:35.860> that's

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
ordinary for the riders and that's

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.240 
ordinary for the riders and that's
pretty<00:05:37.070> much<00:05:37.190> it<00:05:38.200> what<00:05:39.200> I<00:05:39.230> recommend<00:05:39.650> doing<00:05:39.950> if

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
pretty much it what I recommend doing if

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.580 
pretty much it what I recommend doing if
you're<00:05:40.400> a<00:05:40.430> sonic<00:05:40.790> collector<00:05:41.180> I<00:05:41.420> mean<00:05:42.080> at<00:05:42.350> one

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
you're a sonic collector I mean at one

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.650 
you're a sonic collector I mean at one
point<00:05:42.830> or<00:05:42.980> another<00:05:43.040> I'll<00:05:43.370> probably<00:05:43.550> on<00:05:44.090> all<00:05:44.450> of

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
point or another I'll probably on all of

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.430 
point or another I'll probably on all of
the<00:05:44.810> Free<00:05:44.990> Riders<00:05:45.230> figures<00:05:45.740> but<00:05:47.020> if<00:05:48.020> you're

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
the Free Riders figures but if you're

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.290 
the Free Riders figures but if you're
collecting<00:05:48.890> them<00:05:49.070> I<00:05:49.220> kind<00:05:49.610> of<00:05:49.730> recommend

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
collecting them I kind of recommend

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.620 
collecting them I kind of recommend
getting<00:05:50.480> the<00:05:50.690> Babylon<00:05:51.140> rogues<00:05:51.440> first<00:05:51.920> because

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
getting the Babylon rogues first because

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.790 
getting the Babylon rogues first because
you<00:05:53.630> know<00:05:53.780> you<00:05:53.840> could<00:05:54.080> get<00:05:54.230> you<00:05:54.500> could<00:05:54.530> get

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
you know you could get you could get

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.620 
you know you could get you could get
different<00:05:55.040> versions<00:05:55.580> of<00:05:55.700> Tails<00:05:55.970> knuckles<00:05:56.180> and

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
different versions of Tails knuckles and

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.020 
different versions of Tails knuckles and
sonic<00:05:57.080> but<00:05:57.320> you<00:05:57.560> know<00:05:57.650> there's<00:05:57.920> only<00:05:57.980> one<00:05:58.760> of

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
sonic but you know there's only one of

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.750 
sonic but you know there's only one of
these<00:05:59.420> guys<00:05:59.750> so<00:06:00.290> I<00:06:00.530> recommend<00:06:01.160> getting<00:06:01.490> these

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
these guys so I recommend getting these

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.440 
these guys so I recommend getting these
guys<00:06:02.060> first<00:06:03.310> probably<00:06:04.310> because<00:06:04.610> what<00:06:05.240> I<00:06:05.270> just

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
guys first probably because what I just

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.200 
guys first probably because what I just
said<00:06:05.660> and<00:06:05.930> they'll<00:06:06.860> probably<00:06:07.280> get<00:06:07.730> really

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
said and they'll probably get really

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
said and they'll probably get really
rare<00:06:08.450> as<00:06:08.660> time<00:06:08.930> goes<00:06:09.170> on<00:06:10.420> so<00:06:11.420> yeah<00:06:12.020> he's<00:06:12.170> a

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.230 
rare as time goes on so yeah he's a

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.560 
rare as time goes on so yeah he's a
great<00:06:12.440> figure<00:06:13.630> 1099<00:06:14.630> toys<00:06:14.930> r<00:06:15.140> us<00:06:15.170> and<00:06:15.820> i<00:06:16.820> hope

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
great figure 1099 toys r us and i hope

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.370 
great figure 1099 toys r us and i hope
you<00:06:17.780> can<00:06:17.990> pick<00:06:18.380> them<00:06:18.500> up<00:06:18.590> see<00:06:18.950> you<00:06:19.010> next<00:06:19.160> time
