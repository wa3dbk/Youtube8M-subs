00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
also I think amber would be much cheese

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.150 
also I think amber would be much cheese

whoops
ok<00:03:15.650> let's<00:03:15.940> try<00:03:16.940> double<00:03:17.780> kick<00:03:17.960> now<00:03:18.320> I<00:03:18.350> think

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.890 

I<00:03:24.219> wasn't<00:03:24.879> too<00:03:24.969> worried<00:03:25.209> about<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.480> trainers

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
I wasn't too worried about the trainers

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.259 
I wasn't too worried about the trainers
but<00:03:26.140> they<00:03:26.290> are<00:03:26.409> doing<00:03:26.590> fairly<00:03:27.120> decent<00:03:28.120> damage

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
but they are doing fairly decent damage

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.929 
but they are doing fairly decent damage
considering<00:03:29.079> I<00:03:29.260> mean<00:03:29.409> a<00:03:29.439> fairly<00:03:30.340> low<00:03:30.549> level

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:30.939 
considering I mean a fairly low level

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.060 
considering I mean a fairly low level
remember

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.410 

and<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:36.130> had<00:03:36.250> for<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.430> best<00:03:36.640> at<00:03:36.820> my<00:03:36.940> second<00:03:37.300> time

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
and I had for the best at my second time

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.780 
and I had for the best at my second time
against<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.870> mortgage<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.440> later<00:03:38.650> will<00:03:38.830> work

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790
