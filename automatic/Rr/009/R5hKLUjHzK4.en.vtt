00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.730 
trying to take my time on getting back
to<00:01:33.119> where<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.299> was<00:01:33.329> before<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:34.140> really<00:01:34.560> want<00:01:34.710> to

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
to where I was before I really want to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.429 
to where I was before I really want to
take<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> time<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.369> rest<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.790> out<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.060> time

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
take the time to rest it out this time

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.840 
take the time to rest it out this time
before<00:01:37.439> when<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.590> first<00:01:37.829> got<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> injury<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.610> was

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
before when I first got the injury I was

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.310 
before when I first got the injury I was
like<00:01:39.030> that's<00:01:39.360> probably<00:01:39.659> nothing<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.290> I

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
like that's probably nothing so I

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.679 
like that's probably nothing so I
continued<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.740> squat<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:42.210> was<00:01:42.390> not<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> good

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
continued to squat and it was not a good

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.660 
continued to squat and it was not a good
idea<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.290> now<00:01:43.470> we're<00:01:43.619> really<00:01:43.740> taking<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.100> couple

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
idea so now we're really taking a couple

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.429 
idea so now we're really taking a couple
of<00:01:44.790> weeks<00:01:45.060> maybe<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.659> couple<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.049> months<00:01:46.170> off

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
of weeks maybe a couple of months off

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.160 
of weeks maybe a couple of months off
squatting<00:01:47.430> because<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.540> when<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.689> feel<00:01:48.750> it

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
squatting because that is when I feel it

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.260 
squatting because that is when I feel it
the<00:01:49.290> most<00:01:49.320> when<00:01:49.799> there's<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.189> flexion<00:01:50.939> between

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
the most when there's a flexion between

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.639 
the most when there's a flexion between
my<00:01:51.360> knee<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.689> I'm<00:01:51.780> not<00:01:51.930> going<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.140> squat<00:01:52.439> guys
