00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.909 
Denny ties out the game for Raymond
Felton<00:05:49.789> and<00:05:49.969> when<00:05:50.599> he<00:05:50.659> moves<00:05:50.870> the<00:05:51.050> game<00:05:51.289> by<00:05:51.530> one

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
Felton and when he moves the game by one

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.969 
Felton and when he moves the game by one
so<00:05:52.659> that's<00:05:53.659> pretty<00:05:53.930> disappointing<00:05:54.139> i<00:05:54.740> felt

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
so that's pretty disappointing i felt

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.890 
so that's pretty disappointing i felt
like<00:05:55.039> if<00:05:55.250> i<00:05:55.340> stay<00:05:55.550> on<00:05:55.669> the<00:05:55.789> floor<00:05:55.940> we<00:05:56.690> would

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
like if i stay on the floor we would

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.990 
like if i stay on the floor we would
have<00:05:56.930> probably<00:05:57.199> won<00:05:57.469> that<00:05:57.680> game<00:05:57.830> instead<00:05:58.310> we

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
have probably won that game instead we

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.700 
have probably won that game instead we
end<00:05:59.240> up<00:05:59.300> losing<00:05:59.719> and<00:05:59.960> now<00:06:00.169> I'm<00:06:00.409> definitely
