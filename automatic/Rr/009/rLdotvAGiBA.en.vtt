00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.080
 of vandal with the skewers as of 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.470
 bikers and this one has the 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.340
 back the band symbol though not 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.230
 he looks very good because he has the 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.090
 backs a weird effect the sword 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.410
 curved but good if we walk you can see 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:39.130
 You see the band symbol we give you 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.690
 our forces 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:47.250
 that's not good dragonball 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:51.510
 and let's see what it was 6 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.670
 I had a violent as I like 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.620
 you look like one of those people whose 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.620
 interior would be interesting to know 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.280
 the dance 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.280
 take it now 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.150
 and laughter 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.700
 As you can see, it also bears the face like this 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.289
 project a little bit we see the truth and the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.020
 Face painted as Gothic 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:26.149
 all made up in white 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.149
 and if we are going to square the camera 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.970
 and we are going to teach the movement of 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:35.700
 personage that we have already taught before 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.240
 in the race and the car attack medium 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.240
 hem 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.670
 the q 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.100
 what we are going to show another copy has 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.100
 a careful a short 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.970
 the w 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.050
 it's the puddle that seems more like more 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.430
 liquid here it seems to me because 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.289
 we play a little talk but I think 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.160
 that looks like the puddle has more 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.870
 water effect 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.850
 and we are going to throw another comments that 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.780
 we wait in the ass w 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.590
 let's throw another w another double b 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.590
 said beige 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.850
 a 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.220
 let's throw again 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.200
 are ours I think it makes an effect on 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.200
 in it but it does not look very good 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.139
 let's throw another are the rooms like this 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.230
 as I spike around truth and throw a 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:56.230
 knife if it looks very little let's go 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.920
 up to 20 other remits one q 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.920
 1 w 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.549
 and another lesson 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.549
 and finally the r 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.060
 and good but we will kill we will 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.060
 remove those from here 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.970
 I put defense to him before the 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.590
 blows then what it costs to kill him 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.590
 well let's pull recall 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.240
 is that it does absolutely nothing 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.720
 progress now let's see the animation 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.720
 of death 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.739
 attentive full moon 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:07.270
 and we see how he really dies like this 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:11.040
 because it 's strange and good then nothing 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.040
 I hope it's here, let's wait 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.920
 let's never ever anything I'm doing 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.750
 the champion and then the society 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.160
 let's hope it reappears good 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.450
 take advantage of it seems that you comment that I give 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.120
 there are favorites write if you do not 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.460

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.280
 animation does not have animation 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.040
 of reappearing forgiveness and nothing see you 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.570
