00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:09.490
 Hi Chief 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.490
 Introducing the German memory of Ravensberger in Germany 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.590
 It is Mr. Kama's nervousness 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.770
 Target age is 2 and a half years old 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.280
 Even though from a small half 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:28.800
 Let's say something else 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:33.300
 As soon as it's time to give up and stir in your mouth, it's started and this is 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.810
 Let's open two boxes which is the target age of Dream Monde 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.810
 To during the 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.660
 Japanese manual etc 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:50.670
 There are quite a few people in the formwork 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:55.379
 This one will not be used when playing 9 games 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.170
 If I say Let's why give in advance not to the children of this time 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.649
 I love puzzles 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.649
 This also I'm me playing with teeth Mekko from 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.540
 Now let's look at the degree 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.540
 eh 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.620
 Kuma 's 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:23.950
 It is the same silhouette 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:27.750
 However, it is a bear who put up an angry bear and give up honey when the back is turned 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.750
 It is a sleepy sleepy bear 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.940
 It is a country friend, and a genre rank stands 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.030
 I have skin 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.150
 It is a trad-like bear 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.700
 I do not know I love ice cream 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:48.380
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:50.510
 There are various bears, but if you turn it over, this is founder. 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.840
 Everyone is the same type 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.490
 But 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.370
 In fact, if you look closely 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.870
 It looks like it's a mirror rather than the same thing 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.990
 Why 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.110
 I do not understand either 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.820
 I would like to hear it when I go to Germany next time 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.740
 Oh 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:15.590
 This child has only one sock 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.590
 Please try and enjoy in such a memory game
