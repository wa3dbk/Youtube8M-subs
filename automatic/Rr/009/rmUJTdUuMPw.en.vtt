00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
the lock orientation and like I said

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.130 
the lock orientation and like I said
most<00:02:26.850> of<00:02:27.030> these<00:02:27.090> I'll<00:02:27.300> be<00:02:27.450> explaining<00:02:27.780> further

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
most of these I'll be explaining further

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.750 
most of these I'll be explaining further
details<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.830> future<00:02:29.100> tutorials

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
details in the future tutorials

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.240 
details in the future tutorials
but<00:02:30.060> Locker<00:02:30.720> orientation<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.500> let's<00:02:31.980> say<00:02:32.190> you

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
but Locker orientation is let's say you

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.460 
but Locker orientation is let's say you
were<00:02:32.610> playing<00:02:32.910> an<00:02:33.030> app<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:33.540> well<00:02:34.230> let's<00:02:34.350> say

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
were playing an app and well let's say

you're reading a book and you only want
your<00:02:36.360> iPhone<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.990> be<00:02:37.140> in<00:02:37.350> one<00:02:37.650> in<00:02:38.100> one<00:02:38.160> location

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
your iPhone to be in one in one location

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.090 
your iPhone to be in one in one location
like<00:02:38.880> this<00:02:39.210> up<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.720> down<00:02:39.900> if<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.710> you<00:02:40.920> don't

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
like this up and down if you you don't

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.170 
like this up and down if you you don't
want<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.520> look<00:02:41.640> let's<00:02:41.880> say<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.060> you

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
want it to look let's say that you

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.560 
want it to look let's say that you
accidentally<00:02:42.720> put<00:02:43.560> your<00:02:43.740> iPhone<00:02:44.490> sideways<00:02:45.180> it

accidentally put your iPhone sideways it

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.990 
accidentally put your iPhone sideways it
would<00:02:45.720> normally<00:02:46.080> change<00:02:46.440> views<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.490> side

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
would normally change views to that side

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.490 
would normally change views to that side
view<00:02:48.030> but<00:02:48.720> if<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.900> don't<00:02:49.080> want<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.470> change

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
view but if you don't want it to change

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.100 
view but if you don't want it to change
views<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.280> just<00:02:50.520> enable<00:02:50.970> lock<00:02:51.330> orientation

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
views you just enable lock orientation

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.970 
views you just enable lock orientation
and<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.410> will<00:02:52.560> stay<00:02:52.800> in<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.340> same<00:02:53.850> view<00:02:54.980> then

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
and it will stay in that same view then

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.590 
and it will stay in that same view then
at<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.550> same<00:02:56.640> time<00:02:56.700> we<00:02:56.880> have<00:02:57.030> here<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.480> our

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
at the same time we have here is our

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.870 
at the same time we have here is our
brightness<00:02:58.070> everybody's<00:02:59.070> default<00:02:59.490> should<00:02:59.730> be

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
brightness everybody's default should be

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.610 
brightness everybody's default should be
auto<00:03:00.120> brightness<00:03:00.390> which<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:01.080> adjusts

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
auto brightness which it adjusts

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.550 
auto brightness which it adjusts
automatically<00:03:02.160> depending<00:03:02.670> on<00:03:02.760> what<00:03:03.030> kind<00:03:03.270> of

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
automatically depending on what kind of

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.050 
automatically depending on what kind of
light<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.740> have<00:03:04.770> at<00:03:05.190> the<00:03:05.310> time<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:05.790> what<00:03:05.880> kind

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
light you have at the time and what kind

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.300 
light you have at the time and what kind
of<00:03:06.090> light<00:03:06.360> it's<00:03:06.750> you're<00:03:07.260> receiving<00:03:07.890> like<00:03:08.160> if

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
of light it's you're receiving like if

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.960 
of light it's you're receiving like if
it's<00:03:08.430> really<00:03:08.700> dark<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.270> might<00:03:09.570> go<00:03:09.920> pretty<00:03:10.970> dim

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
it's really dark you might go pretty dim

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.280 
it's really dark you might go pretty dim
because<00:03:12.240> you<00:03:12.390> really<00:03:12.600> don't<00:03:12.810> need<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.140> much

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
because you really don't need that much

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.510 
because you really don't need that much
light<00:03:13.500> in<00:03:13.650> if<00:03:13.770> it's<00:03:13.950> like<00:03:14.100> really<00:03:14.400> bright

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
light in if it's like really bright

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.520 
light in if it's like really bright
outside<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.120> might<00:03:15.270> go<00:03:15.420> really<00:03:15.930> bright<00:03:16.200> in

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
outside you might go really bright in

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.650 
outside you might go really bright in
order<00:03:16.740> for<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.220> choose<00:03:17.610> easier<00:03:18.030> easily
