hi<00:00:02.169> everyone<00:00:02.590> we<00:00:03.070> are<00:00:03.100> going<00:00:03.370> to<00:00:03.519> talk<00:00:03.759> about

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:03.790 
hi everyone we are going to talk about

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.720 
hi everyone we are going to talk about
engagement<00:00:04.630> of<00:00:04.990> the<00:00:05.170> head<00:00:05.440> and<00:00:05.800> what<00:00:06.520> do<00:00:06.640> we

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:06.730 
engagement of the head and what do we

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.020 
engagement of the head and what do we
mean<00:00:06.820> when<00:00:07.690> we<00:00:07.840> say<00:00:08.139> the<00:00:08.169> head<00:00:08.559> is<00:00:08.740> in

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
mean when we say the head is in

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.039 
mean when we say the head is in
syncretism<00:00:10.030> or<00:00:10.539> a<00:00:11.110> syncretism<00:00:12.269> so<00:00:13.269> let's<00:00:13.809> get

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:14.049 
syncretism or a syncretism so let's get

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.400 
syncretism or a syncretism so let's get
started<00:00:14.679> what<00:00:15.459> I've<00:00:15.639> drawn<00:00:15.909> out<00:00:16.179> here<00:00:16.570> is<00:00:16.900> a

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
started what I've drawn out here is a

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.070 
started what I've drawn out here is a
fetal<00:00:17.920> head<00:00:18.250> which<00:00:19.119> is<00:00:19.300> descending<00:00:19.869> through

fetal head which is descending through

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.060 
fetal head which is descending through
the<00:00:20.199> pelvis

the pelvis

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.359 
the pelvis
this<00:00:21.640> is<00:00:21.910> the<00:00:22.179> symphysis<00:00:22.599> pubis<00:00:22.900> and<00:00:23.529> this<00:00:24.160> is

this is the symphysis pubis and this is
the<00:00:24.939> sacrum<00:00:25.509> and<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:27.609> is<00:00:27.910> a<00:00:28.679> point<00:00:29.679> roughly

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
the sacrum and this is a point roughly

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.000 
the sacrum and this is a point roughly
midway<00:00:30.759> between<00:00:31.029> the<00:00:31.599> symphysis<00:00:32.050> pubis<00:00:32.289> and

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
midway between the symphysis pubis and

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.729 
midway between the symphysis pubis and
the<00:00:33.219> sacrum<00:00:33.610> that<00:00:34.210> is<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:34.629> front<00:00:35.050> and<00:00:35.350> the

back<00:00:35.980> of<00:00:36.309> the<00:00:36.460> pelvis<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:38.559> see<00:00:38.770> it<00:00:38.890> that

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
back of the pelvis we see it that

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.000 
back of the pelvis we see it that
engagement<00:00:39.640> has<00:00:40.120> taken<00:00:40.539> place<00:00:40.739> when<00:00:41.739> the

is known to be in a syncretism and this

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.550 
is known to be in a syncretism and this
usually<00:01:40.170> happens<00:01:40.590> when<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:42.170> when<00:01:43.170> there<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.440> a

bone presents now you must be thinking
that<00:02:24.420> hey<00:02:24.810> how<00:02:25.080> can<00:02:25.140> there<00:02:25.440> be<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:26.000> posterior

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
that hey how can there be a posterior

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.170 
that hey how can there be a posterior
and<00:02:27.270> an<00:02:27.450> anterior<00:02:27.900> pelvic<00:02:28.290> bone<00:02:28.920> like<00:02:29.220> there

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
and an anterior pelvic bone like there

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.970 
and an anterior pelvic bone like there
are<00:02:30.270> two<00:02:30.450> parietal<00:02:30.959> bones<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.470> agree<00:02:31.800> and

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
are two parietal bones I agree and

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.910 
are two parietal bones I agree and
they're<00:02:32.250> both<00:02:32.850> posterior<00:02:33.780> according<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.800> the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
they're both posterior according to the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.380 
they're both posterior according to the
fetal<00:02:35.250> end<00:02:35.430> but<00:02:35.850> this<00:02:36.060> time<00:02:36.239> we're<00:02:36.360> not

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
fetal end but this time we're not

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.390 
fetal end but this time we're not
talking<00:02:36.870> about<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.290> fetal<00:02:37.709> head<00:02:37.950> we<00:02:38.280> are

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
talking about the fetal head we are

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.490 
talking about the fetal head we are
talking<00:02:38.790> about<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.269> motto<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.900> in<00:02:40.320> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
talking about the motto and in the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.420 
talking about the motto and in the
mother<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:41.580> sacrum<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.299> interior<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:44.040> mean

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
mother the sacrum is interior and I mean

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.850 
mother the sacrum is interior and I mean
sorry<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.970> pubis<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.959> anterior<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.799> the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
sorry the pubis is anterior and the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.210 
sorry the pubis is anterior and the
sacrum<00:02:47.370> is<00:02:47.489> posterior<00:02:47.910> right<00:02:48.590> so<00:02:49.590> the

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
sacrum is posterior right so the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.280 
sacrum is posterior right so the
parietal<00:02:50.700> bone<00:02:51.060> which<00:02:51.360> is<00:02:51.390> presenting<00:02:52.140> is

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
parietal bone which is presenting is

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.600 
parietal bone which is presenting is
more<00:02:52.650> posterior<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.670> anterior<00:02:54.320> right<00:02:55.320> so<00:02:56.220> we

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
more posterior and anterior right so we

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.190 
more posterior and anterior right so we
call<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.799> posterior<00:02:58.799> or<00:02:59.100> syncretism<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.450> as

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
call it posterior or syncretism and as

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.699 
call it posterior or syncretism and as
you<00:03:01.350> can<00:03:01.500> see<00:03:01.739> this<00:03:01.980> title<00:03:02.519> bone<00:03:02.850> is<00:03:03.330> more

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
you can see this title bone is more

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.800 
you can see this title bone is more
nearer<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.340> pupils<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.390> would<00:03:06.630> be

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
nearer to the pupils so this would be

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.380 
nearer to the pupils so this would be
the<00:03:06.959> midway<00:03:07.380> between<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:08.070> pubis<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.180> the

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
the midway between the pubis and the

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.470 
the midway between the pubis and the

between the pubis and the sacrum again

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.380 
between the pubis and the sacrum again
it<00:03:48.300> is<00:03:48.540> approaching<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.820> sacrum<00:03:50.820> more<00:03:51.180> than

it is approaching the sacrum more than
the<00:03:51.570> pupils<00:03:52.050> and<00:03:55.490> you<00:03:56.490> can<00:03:56.670> feel<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.330> anterior

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
the pupils and you can feel the anterior

the pupils and you can feel the anterior
parroting<00:03:58.770> bone<00:03:59.070> and<00:03:59.400> you<00:04:00.180> will<00:04:00.420> find<00:04:00.870> that

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
parroting bone and you will find that

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.330 
parroting bone and you will find that
the<00:04:01.380> post<00:04:01.710> the<00:04:02.460> slightest<00:04:03.060> suture<00:04:03.720> is<00:04:03.990> in<00:04:04.770> the

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
the post the slightest suture is in the

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.300 
the post the slightest suture is in the
posterior<00:04:06.030> position<00:04:06.600> of<00:04:07.110> the<00:04:07.260> adults<00:04:07.800> pelvis

posterior position of the adults pelvis

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.770 
posterior position of the adults pelvis
so<00:04:08.640> this<00:04:09.390> is<00:04:09.570> no<00:04:09.750> one<00:04:09.930> as<00:04:10.280> anterior<00:04:11.280> or

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
so this is no one as anterior or

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:20.449 
so this is no one as anterior or
syncretism<00:04:15.140> how<00:04:16.940> during<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:19.250> engagement<00:04:20.250> and

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
syncretism how during a engagement and

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.740 
syncretism how during a engagement and
the<00:04:20.610> scent<00:04:20.880> of<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.299> hell<00:04:23.210> they<00:04:24.210> can<00:04:24.390> be<00:04:24.570> a

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
the scent of the hell they can be a

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.920 
the scent of the hell they can be a
posterior<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:26.100> a<00:04:26.520> lateral<00:04:27.060> flexion<00:04:27.660> of<00:04:27.810> the

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.300 
head in case of a posterior or
syncretism<00:04:31.770> so<00:04:32.700> that<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.510> head<00:04:33.980> comes<00:04:34.980> to

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
syncretism so that the head comes to

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.130 
syncretism so that the head comes to
glide<00:04:35.730> on<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.510> anterior<00:04:36.960> variety<00:04:37.740> bone<00:04:37.980> like

it's like the anvil the anterior

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.850 
it's like the anvil the anterior
choroidal<00:04:43.830> bone<00:04:44.520> will<00:04:44.790> glide<00:04:45.180> past<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:46.440> pubis

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
choroidal bone will glide past the pubis

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.040 
choroidal bone will glide past the pubis
symphysis

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.879 

it<00:04:49.770> will<00:04:50.099> come<00:04:50.370> into<00:04:51.379> syncretism<00:04:52.379> like

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
it will come into syncretism like

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.249 
it will come into syncretism like
earlier<00:04:53.669> shown<00:04:55.099> similarly<00:04:56.099> an<00:04:56.400> anterior

should<00:05:04.830> come<00:05:05.099> in<00:05:05.430> syncretism<00:05:07.069> so<00:05:08.069> that's<00:05:09.030> all

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
should come in syncretism so that's all

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:15.350 
should come in syncretism so that's all
I<00:05:09.960> hope<00:05:10.560> you<00:05:10.889> had<00:05:11.220> fun<00:05:11.490> learning<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:14.360> stay
