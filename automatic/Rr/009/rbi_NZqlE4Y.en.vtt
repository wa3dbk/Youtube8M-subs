00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
the sound that no the guitars really

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.149 
the sound that no the guitars really
have<00:01:07.020> no<00:01:07.409> idea<00:01:08.240> how<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.420> does<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.409> but<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.860> seems

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
have no idea how it does it but it seems

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.850 
have no idea how it does it but it seems
to<00:01:11.310> have<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.939> creak<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.650> good

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
to have that a creak in it and a good

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:23.630 
to have that a creak in it and a good
and<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.220> good<00:01:14.430> clarity

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
for me for me in the early days I like I

for me for me in the early days I like I
sort<00:01:27.520> of<00:01:27.609> either<00:01:27.850> liked<00:01:28.649> quite<00:01:29.649> quite<00:01:30.520> a<00:01:31.439> sort

sort of either liked quite quite a sort
of<00:01:32.469> scathing<00:01:33.280> trebly<00:01:33.789> sound<00:01:34.090> which<00:01:34.390> was<00:01:34.600> easy

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
of scathing trebly sound which was easy

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.279 
of scathing trebly sound which was easy
just<00:01:35.020> bang<00:01:35.530> or<00:01:36.450> quite<00:01:37.450> a<00:01:37.479> creamy<00:01:37.840> sort<00:01:38.200> of

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
just bang or quite a creamy sort of

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.620 
just bang or quite a creamy sort of
sound<00:01:38.590> like<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.159> ills<00:01:39.369> Abbey<00:01:39.579> Road<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:40.209> you

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
sound like the ills Abbey Road and you

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.999 
sound like the ills Abbey Road and you
could<00:01:40.810> sort<00:01:40.990> of<00:01:41.079> get<00:01:41.259> that<00:01:41.289> by<00:01:41.590> going<00:01:41.770> onto

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
could sort of get that by going onto

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.789 
could sort of get that by going onto
this<00:01:42.310> onto<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:42.849> pickup<00:01:43.240> up<00:01:43.420> here<00:01:43.990> or<00:01:44.170> rolling

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
this onto the pickup up here or rolling

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.719 
this onto the pickup up here or rolling
off<00:01:45.099> there<00:01:45.399> time<00:01:46.349> so<00:01:47.349> I<00:01:47.380> just<00:01:47.799> I<00:01:47.979> just<00:01:48.250> found<00:01:48.429> it

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
off there time so I just I just found it

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.679 
off there time so I just I just found it
simple<00:01:49.390> indestructible<00:01:49.929> light<00:01:51.479> might<00:01:52.479> learn

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
simple indestructible light might learn

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.580 
simple indestructible light might learn
compared<00:01:53.319> to<00:01:53.530> other<00:01:53.920> good<00:01:54.159> time<00:01:56.909> my<00:01:57.909> first

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
compared to other good time my first

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
compared to other good time my first
experience<00:01:59.590> of<00:01:59.649> using<00:01:59.860> one<00:02:00.219> probably<00:02:02.520> for<00:02:03.520> our

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
experience of using one probably for our

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.249 
experience of using one probably for our
first<00:02:03.849> recordings<00:02:04.390> we<00:02:04.509> made<00:02:04.689> misty<00:02:05.079> van

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
first recordings we made misty van

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.499 
first recordings we made misty van
Street<00:02:05.739> he'll<00:02:06.429> probably<00:02:06.610> back<00:02:06.969> me<00:02:07.119> up<00:02:07.149> but

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
Street he'll probably back me up but

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.139 
Street he'll probably back me up but
he's<00:02:07.750> got<00:02:08.289> a<00:02:08.319> nice<00:02:08.530> telly

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
he's got a nice telly

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.240 
he's got a nice telly
it's<00:02:10.149> an<00:02:10.269> old<00:02:10.450> on<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:10.869> really<00:02:11.170> old<00:02:11.349> and<00:02:14.250> the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
it's an old on it really old and the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.949 
it's an old on it really old and the
guitar<00:02:15.579> I<00:02:15.609> was<00:02:15.879> using<00:02:16.120> was<00:02:16.420> her<00:02:16.510> kind<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.900> a

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
guitar I was using was her kind of a

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.610 
guitar I was using was her kind of a
rock<00:02:17.200> orientated<00:02:18.099> so<00:02:18.129> guitar<00:02:18.790> really<00:02:19.090> so<00:02:19.420> I

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
rock orientated so guitar really so I

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.039 
rock orientated so guitar really so I
think<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.010> tele<00:02:21.819> was<00:02:22.060> doing<00:02:22.690> lots<00:02:22.870> of

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
think that the tele was doing lots of

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.970 
think that the tele was doing lots of
lots<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.680> different<00:02:24.450> different<00:02:25.450> sort<00:02:26.109> of<00:02:26.200> jobs

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
lots of different different sort of jobs

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.860 
lots of different different sort of jobs
whether<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:28.269> know<00:02:28.420> whether<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.750> other

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
whether you know whether the other

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.740 
whether you know whether the other
guitars<00:02:29.319> was<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:29.590> bit<00:02:29.889> more<00:02:30.220> doing<00:02:31.180> one<00:02:31.389> sort<00:02:31.660> of

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
guitars was a bit more doing one sort of

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.830 
guitars was a bit more doing one sort of
job<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:33.340> it's<00:02:33.790> it'd<00:02:34.000> be<00:02:34.209> right<00:02:34.359> down<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.780> the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
job so it's it'd be right down to the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.089 
job so it's it'd be right down to the
ground<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.319> think<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:35.680> think<00:02:35.889> when<00:02:36.010> we

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
ground so I think I think when we

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.400 
ground so I think I think when we
restarted<00:02:36.880> recording<00:02:37.329> an<00:02:37.450> album<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:38.200> might

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
restarted recording an album it might

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.289 
restarted recording an album it might
have<00:02:38.530> been<00:02:38.769> he's<00:02:39.310> probably<00:02:39.489> our<00:02:39.669> first<00:02:39.849> one<00:02:40.090> is

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299

just<00:03:28.390> have<00:03:28.600> a<00:03:29.430> combo<00:03:30.430> I'm<00:03:31.110> pretty<00:03:32.110> cranked<00:03:32.890> and

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230

you<00:03:38.620> know<00:03:38.740> I'm<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:39.220> bit<00:03:39.460> more<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:42.510> what

willfully bizarre I suppose whilst
playing<00:03:46.240> I'm<00:03:46.600> a<00:03:46.630> bit<00:03:46.900> more<00:03:47.580> less<00:03:48.580> technical
