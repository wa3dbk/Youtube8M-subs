00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
great part about this way is that it

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.840 
great part about this way is that it
wasn't<00:01:49.110> necessarily<00:01:49.500> super<00:01:50.009> shiny<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.610> that

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
wasn't necessarily super shiny and that

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.230

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
350 degrees so if i wanted to i could

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.280 
350 degrees so if i wanted to i could
kind<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:26.970> flip<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.209> bang<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.720> little<00:02:27.930> bit<00:02:28.049> more

kind of flip the bang a little bit more

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.559 
kind of flip the bang a little bit more
or<00:02:28.500> bump<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.890> back<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.400> usually<00:02:30.060> don't<00:02:30.239> put<00:02:30.540> a

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
or bump the back I usually don't put a

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.570 
or bump the back I usually don't put a
lot<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:30.810> heat<00:02:31.080> on<00:02:31.260> my<00:02:31.530> heat<00:02:31.890> resistance<00:02:32.400> that

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
lot of heat on my heat resistance that

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.880 
lot of heat on my heat resistance that
it<00:02:33.000> care<00:02:33.239> but<00:02:33.870> it's<00:02:33.900> always<00:02:34.380> nice<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.590> have

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
it care but it's always nice to have

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.320 
it care but it's always nice to have
that<00:02:35.040> option<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.640> think<00:02:35.880> that's<00:02:36.060> one<00:02:36.299> of

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
that option and I think that's one of

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.350 
that option and I think that's one of
the<00:02:36.480> things<00:02:36.569> that<00:02:36.900> make<00:02:37.730> these<00:02:38.730> type<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.030> wigs

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
the things that make these type of wigs

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.050 
the things that make these type of wigs
look<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.930> lot<00:02:40.110> now<00:02:40.319> natural<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.220> also<00:02:41.670> have<00:02:41.880> the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
look a lot now natural you also have the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.509 
look a lot now natural you also have the
option<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.630> splitting<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.620> parts<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.160> could

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
option of splitting the parts so I could

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.430 
option of splitting the parts so I could
take<00:02:44.700> my<00:02:44.730> scissors<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.510> cut<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:45.930> part<00:02:46.200> and

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
take my scissors and cut this part and

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.440 
take my scissors and cut this part and
instead<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.130> having<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.549> lace<00:02:47.819> party<00:02:48.239> I<00:02:48.390> could

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
instead of having a lace party I could

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.720 
instead of having a lace party I could
have<00:02:48.750> an<00:02:48.959> invisible<00:02:49.799> party<00:02:50.160> which<00:02:50.340> is<00:02:50.489> shown

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
week was just really tight I don't know

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.199 
week was just really tight I don't know
if<00:03:28.350> it's<00:03:28.500> because<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.579> way<00:03:29.730> i<00:03:29.760> have<00:03:30.030> my

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
if it's because of the way i have my

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.509 
if it's because of the way i have my
natural<00:03:30.810> hair<00:03:30.959> under<00:03:31.380> this<00:03:31.530> wig<00:03:31.799> if<00:03:32.280> it's

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
natural hair under this wig if it's

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:33.830 
natural hair under this wig if it's
because<00:03:32.700> of<00:03:32.850> that<00:03:33.120> which<00:03:33.359> i<00:03:33.480> really<00:03:33.569> don't

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
because of that which i really don't

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.229 
because of that which i really don't
think<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:34.109> is<00:03:34.260> but<00:03:34.530> maybe<00:03:35.459> because<00:03:35.910> my<00:03:36.060> hair

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
think it is but maybe because my hair

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.390 
think it is but maybe because my hair
isn't<00:03:36.359> necessarily<00:03:36.840> cornrow<00:03:37.380> down<00:03:37.650> it's<00:03:38.190> just

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
isn't necessarily cornrow down it's just

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.470 
isn't necessarily cornrow down it's just

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
plot it so yeah so i'm not sure that is

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.170
