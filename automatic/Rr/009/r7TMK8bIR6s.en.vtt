replenishment pack for the our 1800 or
right<00:01:59.009> Andrew<00:01:59.490> now<00:01:59.939> this<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.590> this<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.649> eight

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
right Andrew now this is this is eight

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.429 
right Andrew now this is this is eight
bottles<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:04.079> ink

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
bottles of ink

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.469 
bottles of ink
now<00:02:04.710> there's<00:02:04.920> 60<00:02:05.399> mil<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
now there's 60 mil so it's the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.660 
now there's 60 mil so it's the
equivalent<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:07.020> 48<00:02:07.829> cartridge

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
equivalent of 48 cartridge

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.279 
equivalent of 48 cartridge
is<00:02:08.729> worth<00:02:08.910> having<00:02:09.149> which<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.660> great<00:02:09.959> value

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
is worth having which is great value

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.780 
is worth having which is great value
when<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.069> consider<00:02:11.490> that<00:02:11.730> that

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
when you consider that that

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.479 
when you consider that that
replenishment<00:02:12.720> pack<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.650> hundred<00:02:14.310> and

twenty pounds plus three eighty so

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
twenty pounds plus three eighty so
that's<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:17.069> fifth<00:02:17.459> of<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.819> usual<00:02:18.300> price<00:02:19.130> so<00:02:20.130> we

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
that's a fifth of the usual price so we

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.880

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:42.790 
need to bear in mind that when you
actually<00:06:40.460> move<00:06:41.210> your<00:06:41.719> move<00:06:42.229> your<00:06:42.289> carriage

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
actually move your move your carriage

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.219 
actually move your move your carriage
across<00:06:42.949> and<00:06:43.460> then<00:06:43.550> move<00:06:43.759> them<00:06:43.939> back<00:06:44.149> again<00:06:44.539> not

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:45.229 
across and then move them back again not

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:47.619 
across and then move them back again not
just<00:06:45.499> one<00:06:45.770> but<00:06:46.099> all<00:06:46.249> of<00:06:46.639> these<00:06:46.819> chips<00:06:47.210> will<00:06:47.599> be

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:47.629 
just one but all of these chips will be

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:54.999 
just one but all of these chips will be
will<00:06:48.499> be<00:06:49.479> will<00:06:50.479> be<00:06:51.789> reset<00:06:52.789> so<00:06:53.419> not<00:06:53.779> a<00:06:53.809> bad<00:06:54.080> idea

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:55.009 
will be will be reset so not a bad idea

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:57.790 
will be will be reset so not a bad idea
is<00:06:55.309> to<00:06:55.759> periodically<00:06:56.529> top-up<00:06:57.529> your

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 
is to periodically top-up your

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.189 
is to periodically top-up your
cartridges<00:06:58.550> I<00:06:58.759> like<00:06:59.389> to<00:06:59.599> top-up<00:06:59.839> these

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199 
cartridges I like to top-up these

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:03.639 
cartridges I like to top-up these
cartridges<00:07:00.710> once<00:07:01.639> every<00:07:02.180> every<00:07:03.020> week<00:07:03.289> or

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:03.649 
cartridges once every every week or

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:05.739 
cartridges once every every week or
maybe<00:07:03.800> every<00:07:04.309> two<00:07:04.610> weeks<00:07:04.909> depending<00:07:05.180> on<00:07:05.599> the

00:07:05.739 --> 00:07:05.749 
maybe every two weeks depending on the

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:07.450 
maybe every two weeks depending on the
amount<00:07:06.020> of<00:07:06.289> printing<00:07:06.710> that<00:07:06.830> you'll<00:07:06.979> be<00:07:07.099> doing

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 
amount of printing that you'll be doing

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.809 
amount of printing that you'll be doing
now<00:07:08.089> it's<00:07:08.539> a<00:07:08.719> nice<00:07:08.930> and<00:07:09.259> clean<00:07:09.589> operate<00:07:10.550> it's

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:10.819 
now it's a nice and clean operate it's

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:13.600 
now it's a nice and clean operate it's
very<00:07:11.180> very<00:07:11.509> straightforward<00:07:12.039> it's<00:07:13.039> not<00:07:13.310> as<00:07:13.459> if

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:13.610 
very very straightforward it's not as if

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.559 
very very straightforward it's not as if
you're<00:07:13.909> you're<00:07:14.719> having<00:07:15.080> to<00:07:15.229> push<00:07:15.560> the<00:07:15.589> ink

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:16.569 
you're you're having to push the ink

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:18.850 
you're you're having to push the ink
viciously<00:07:17.569> into<00:07:17.899> the<00:07:18.020> cartridges<00:07:18.620> you're

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
viciously into the cartridges you're

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.029 
viciously into the cartridges you're
just<00:07:19.039> gently<00:07:19.459> pouring<00:07:19.999> the<00:07:20.149> ink<00:07:20.419> in<00:07:20.689> the<00:07:21.469> reset

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:22.039 
just gently pouring the ink in the reset

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:26.110 
just gently pouring the ink in the reset
chips<00:07:22.370> work<00:07:22.669> perfectly<00:07:23.360> and<00:07:23.719> also<00:07:24.639> if<00:07:25.639> you

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120 
chips work perfectly and also if you

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.110 
chips work perfectly and also if you
adopt<00:07:26.689> the<00:07:26.810> idea<00:07:27.139> of<00:07:27.520> periodically<00:07:28.520> topping

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 
adopt the idea of periodically topping

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.860 
adopt the idea of periodically topping
up<00:07:29.240> your<00:07:29.270> cartridges<00:07:30.110> you<00:07:30.830> never<00:07:31.180> you<00:07:32.180> can<00:07:32.629> you

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:32.870 
up your cartridges you never you can you

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.869 
up your cartridges you never you can you
can<00:07:33.139> run<00:07:33.589> the<00:07:33.770> printer<00:07:34.189> virtual<00:07:34.669> like<00:07:34.849> a

00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:34.879 
can run the printer virtual like a

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:38.079 
can run the printer virtual like a
continuous<00:07:35.599> ink<00:07:35.810> system<00:07:36.050> now<00:07:36.979> you<00:07:37.039> enjoy<00:07:37.669> the

00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:38.089 
continuous ink system now you enjoy the

00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:41.829 
continuous ink system now you enjoy the
benefits<00:07:38.899> of<00:07:39.259> much<00:07:40.249> much<00:07:40.789> cheaper<00:07:41.330> printing

00:07:41.829 --> 00:07:41.839 
benefits of much much cheaper printing

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:44.980 
benefits of much much cheaper printing
so<00:07:42.499> you're<00:07:42.649> printing<00:07:42.979> at<00:07:43.430> nearly<00:07:43.999> one-fifth

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:44.990 
so you're printing at nearly one-fifth

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.920 
so you're printing at nearly one-fifth
of<00:07:45.229> the<00:07:45.289> price<00:07:45.620> but<00:07:46.580> of<00:07:46.759> course<00:07:47.029> you're<00:07:47.599> not

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:47.930 
of the price but of course you're not

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.760 
of the price but of course you're not
you're<00:07:48.680> not<00:07:48.709> shelling<00:07:49.490> out<00:07:49.669> for<00:07:50.770> for

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:51.770 
you're not shelling out for for

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.279 
you're not shelling out for for
literally<00:07:52.699> hundreds<00:07:53.389> of<00:07:53.569> pounds<00:07:53.990> worth<00:07:54.139> of

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:54.289 
literally hundreds of pounds worth of
