months now which feels like a year it's
a<00:00:20.880> really<00:00:21.119> long<00:00:21.210> time<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.630> have<00:00:21.960> one<00:00:22.650> unit

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
a really long time to have one unit

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.890 
a really long time to have one unit
especially<00:00:23.730> for<00:00:23.910> someone<00:00:23.970> that's<00:00:24.510> used<00:00:24.750> to

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
especially for someone that's used to

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.040 
especially for someone that's used to
really<00:00:25.590> changing<00:00:26.160> their<00:00:26.310> hair<00:00:26.550> off<00:00:26.789> them<00:00:27.060> okay

they had purchased this unit and a
completely<00:01:15.990> fell<00:01:16.320> apart<00:01:16.909> that<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.360> the

completely fell apart that like the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.499 
completely fell apart that like the

this<00:01:25.770> hair<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.130> really<00:01:26.490> good<00:01:26.880> i<00:01:26.909> guess<00:01:27.439> that<00:01:28.439> um

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
this hair is really good i guess that um

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.859 
this hair is really good i guess that um
I<00:01:29.490> don't<00:01:29.700> know<00:01:29.970> they<00:01:30.240> musta<00:01:30.509> gave<00:01:30.600> her<00:01:30.810> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
I don't know they musta gave her a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.170 
I don't know they musta gave her a
completely<00:01:31.770> different<00:01:32.100> unit<00:01:32.400> because<00:01:32.700> as<00:01:32.939> you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
completely different unit because as you

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.660 
completely different unit because as you
can<00:01:33.210> see<00:01:33.390> I'm<00:01:34.350> kind<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.829> living<00:01:35.040> proof<00:01:35.640> that

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
can see I'm kind of living proof that

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.020 
can see I'm kind of living proof that
this<00:01:36.150> hair<00:01:36.450> actually<00:01:36.689> does<00:01:37.290> hold<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.220> guess

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
this hair actually does hold up I guess

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.600 
this hair actually does hold up I guess
for<00:01:39.659> everybody<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.619> hair<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:40.979> different<00:01:41.280> you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
for everybody the hair is different you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.370 
for everybody the hair is different you
might<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> bad<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.450> might<00:01:42.780> get<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> good<00:01:43.200> one

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
might get a bad you might get a good one

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.210
