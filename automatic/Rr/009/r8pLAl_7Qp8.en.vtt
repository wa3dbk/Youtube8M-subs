00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.450
 open because sack that we say we had 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.369
 and therefore I was open and turned into 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.199
 a plastic case and then to his 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.630
 inside there was this background we say 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.750
 this cardboard with the logo that the mouse 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.699
 optical usb plus mouse pad 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.029
 the background so then there is violet in 3d 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.480
 that if I show you a second 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.219
 then excuse this on this one 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.910

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.350

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.579

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.840

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.309
 they did it this way they put it 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.860
 of scotch and then I put it back 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:55.949
 because it was consumed in fact it is free 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.690
 and so there was this violet and therefore 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.329
 it is so made then by returns from various 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.350
 instructions on what is compatible 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.780

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.470
 connected with a thread is she who is a 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:29.159
 wire that connects directly to the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:32.250
 computer and is equal to the mouse pad why 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.100
 at the same figure and then like to see 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.110
 manor spread is just that it is smaller 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.340

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.310
