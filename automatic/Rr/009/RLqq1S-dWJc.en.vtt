00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.039 
said that it was advertised as free
although<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.729> am<00:01:06.180> pretty<00:01:06.510> sure<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.720> we're

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
although I am pretty sure that we're

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.510 
although I am pretty sure that we're
we've<00:01:07.500> already<00:01:07.710> paid<00:01:08.010> for<00:01:08.070> it

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
we've already paid for it

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.910 
we've already paid for it
in<00:01:08.670> some<00:01:09.000> capacity<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:10.049> oh<00:01:10.320> no<00:01:10.650> tuition

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
in some capacity like oh no tuition

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.200 
in some capacity like oh no tuition
maybe<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:13.110> went<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.040> free<00:01:14.490> spin<00:01:14.880> class

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
maybe so I went to the free spin class

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.940 
maybe so I went to the free spin class
at<00:01:15.960> my<00:01:16.549> universities<00:01:17.549> recreational<00:01:18.360> center

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
at my universities recreational center

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.770 
at my universities recreational center
and<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.100> was<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> gym<00:01:20.820> where<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.540> know

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
and it was in the gym where you know

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.649 
and it was in the gym where you know
people<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.290> play<00:01:22.470> basketball<00:01:23.119> and<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.450> we

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
people can play basketball and so we

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.810 
people can play basketball and so we
wheeled<00:01:24.990> our<00:01:25.200> bikes<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.950> stationary<00:01:26.520> bikes

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
wheeled our bikes the stationary bikes

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.880 
wheeled our bikes the stationary bikes
in<00:01:27.060> there<00:01:27.240> they're<00:01:27.810> not<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.110> really<00:01:28.380> big<00:01:28.619> ones

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
in there they're not the really big ones

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.730 
in there they're not the really big ones
that<00:01:29.250> are<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.600> guess<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.350> actual

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
that are in I guess like the actual

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.590 
that are in I guess like the actual
workout<00:01:32.130> gyms<00:01:32.490> or<00:01:32.729> ones<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:32.970> can't<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.329> moved

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
workout gyms or ones that can't be moved

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.510 
workout gyms or ones that can't be moved
the<00:01:33.750> ones<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.020> are<00:01:34.110> super<00:01:34.380> heavy<00:01:34.590> these<00:01:35.220> ones

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
the ones that are super heavy these ones

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.370 
the ones that are super heavy these ones
have<00:01:35.700> wheels<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.329> bottom<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.200> can

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
have wheels on the bottom that we can

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.910 
have wheels on the bottom that we can
roll<00:01:37.619> from<00:01:37.979> place<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.310> place<00:01:39.079> so<00:01:40.079> we<00:01:40.650> were<00:01:40.770> like

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
roll from place to place so we were like

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.550 
roll from place to place so we were like
in<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.220> semi-circle<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.210> then<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.170> instructor

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
in a semi-circle and then the instructor

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.330 
in a semi-circle and then the instructor
is<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.159> middle<00:01:44.869> and<00:01:45.869> pretty<00:01:46.799> much<00:01:47.009> what<00:01:47.220> it

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
is in the middle and pretty much what it

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.490 
is in the middle and pretty much what it
is<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.180> was<00:01:48.450> at<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.810> was<00:01:49.110> afraid<00:01:49.290> at

a<00:02:02.399> heat<00:02:02.610> stroke

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
a heat stroke

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.740 
a heat stroke
so<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.259> was<00:02:04.950> really<00:02:05.189> worried<00:02:05.460> about<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.750> but

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
so I was really worried about that but

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.389 
so I was really worried about that but
then<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.079> found<00:02:07.259> out<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.799> was<00:02:07.979> there<00:02:08.280> was

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
then I found out that it was there was

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.639 
then I found out that it was there was
AC<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.940> there<00:02:09.090> so

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
AC in there so

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.580 
AC in there so
I<00:02:09.709> think<00:02:10.039> I<00:02:10.129> could<00:02:10.310> do<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:10.579> so<00:02:11.269> get<00:02:12.230> in<00:02:12.379> there

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
I think I could do it so get in there

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.039 
I think I could do it so get in there
and<00:02:12.950> it's<00:02:13.129> like<00:02:13.340> me<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.849> like<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.329> bunch<00:02:14.689> of<00:02:14.840> my

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
and it's like me and like a bunch of my

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.050 
and it's like me and like a bunch of my
friends<00:02:15.079> it's<00:02:15.680> like<00:02:15.739> a<00:02:15.860> few<00:02:16.099> girlfriends<00:02:16.400> and

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
friends it's like a few girlfriends and

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.670 
friends it's like a few girlfriends and
like<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.239> lot<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:17.659> guy<00:02:17.840> friends<00:02:17.870> so<00:02:18.500> there's

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
like a lot of guy friends so there's

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.580 
like a lot of guy friends so there's
probably<00:02:18.890> about<00:02:19.540> six<00:02:20.540> seven<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.110> eight<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.470> us

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
probably about six seven and eight of us

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.589 
probably about six seven and eight of us
total<00:02:22.159> and<00:02:22.340> we're<00:02:22.549> like<00:02:22.670> all<00:02:22.879> in<00:02:23.180> this<00:02:23.360> like

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
total and we're like all in this like

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.369 
total and we're like all in this like
there's<00:02:24.170> like<00:02:24.319> two<00:02:24.590> rows<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:25.390> bikes<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.989> then

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
there's like two rows of bikes and then

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.780 
there's like two rows of bikes and then
of<00:02:27.530> course<00:02:27.769> the<00:02:27.920> instructor<00:02:28.250> in<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.519> middle

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
of course the instructor in the middle

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.240 
of course the instructor in the middle
so<00:02:29.599> I'm<00:02:29.930> pretty<00:02:30.260> much<00:02:30.439> the<00:02:30.590> whole<00:02:30.739> thing<00:02:31.069> is

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
so I'm pretty much the whole thing is

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.399 
so I'm pretty much the whole thing is
that<00:02:31.459> she<00:02:31.670> went<00:02:31.879> by<00:02:32.090> before<00:02:32.989> we<00:02:33.230> got<00:02:33.379> started

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
that she went by before we got started

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.710 
that she went by before we got started
we<00:02:33.950> signed<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.400> waiver<00:02:34.819> just<00:02:35.180> saying<00:02:35.359> that<00:02:35.599> we

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
we signed the waiver just saying that we

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.259 
we signed the waiver just saying that we
consent<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.379> doing<00:02:36.590> this<00:02:36.680> workout<00:02:37.159> and<00:02:37.640> if<00:02:38.150> we

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
consent to doing this workout and if we

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.210 
consent to doing this workout and if we
puke<00:02:38.659> or<00:02:38.870> die<00:02:39.049> or<00:02:39.319> something<00:02:39.530> like<00:02:39.709> that<00:02:39.769> the

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
puke or die or something like that the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.770 
puke or die or something like that the
school<00:02:40.459> doesn't<00:02:40.670> takes<00:02:40.970> responsibility<00:02:41.180> for

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
school doesn't takes responsibility for

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.059 
school doesn't takes responsibility for
definite<00:02:42.230> of<00:02:42.349> that<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.870> she<00:02:45.349> went<00:02:45.560> by<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:46.010> she

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
definite of that so she went by and she

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.789 
definite of that so she went by and she
helped<00:02:46.549> each<00:02:47.209> of<00:02:47.540> us<00:02:47.720> adjust<00:02:48.290> our<00:02:48.530> bikes

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
helped each of us adjust our bikes

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.800 
helped each of us adjust our bikes
because<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.879> course<00:02:50.090> we<00:02:50.269> all<00:02:50.480> are<00:02:50.510> different

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
because of course we all are different

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.550 
because of course we all are different
heights

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
heights

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.920 
heights
some<00:02:52.489> people<00:02:52.760> have<00:02:52.909> longer<00:02:53.239> legs<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.750> other

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
some people have longer legs and other

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.589 
some people have longer legs and other
people<00:02:54.349> longer<00:02:54.590> arms<00:02:55.159> so<00:02:55.430> she's<00:02:56.269> helping<00:02:56.510> us

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
people longer arms so she's helping us

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.699 
people longer arms so she's helping us
adjust<00:02:56.780> advice<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.439> suit<00:02:57.680> our<00:02:57.889> body<00:02:58.129> type<00:02:58.459> so

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
adjust advice to suit our body type so

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.410 
adjust advice to suit our body type so
after<00:03:00.709> we<00:03:00.829> got<00:03:01.040> that<00:03:01.280> taken<00:03:01.549> care<00:03:01.790> of<00:03:02.000> then<00:03:02.299> we

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
after we got that taken care of then we

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.149 
after we got that taken care of then we
started<00:03:02.720> to<00:03:02.780> get<00:03:02.900> on<00:03:03.049> the<00:03:03.139> bike<00:03:03.349> and<00:03:03.530> basically

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
started to get on the bike and basically

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.030 
started to get on the bike and basically
the<00:03:04.459> whole<00:03:04.489> objective<00:03:05.269> I<00:03:06.049> guess<00:03:06.319> is<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.829> like

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
the whole objective I guess is to like

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.580 
the whole objective I guess is to like
stay<00:03:07.400> in<00:03:07.670> tune<00:03:07.939> with<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.359> music<00:03:08.389> so<00:03:09.260> if<00:03:09.379> the

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
stay in tune with the music so if the

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.429 
stay in tune with the music so if the
beat<00:03:09.829> is<00:03:09.859> like<00:03:10.069> one<00:03:10.760> two<00:03:11.060> three<00:03:11.090> one<00:03:11.750> two<00:03:11.780> three

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:12.439 
beat is like one two three one two three

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.189 
beat is like one two three one two three
our<00:03:12.620> feet<00:03:12.980> are<00:03:13.310> supposed<00:03:14.030> to<00:03:14.120> be<00:03:14.299> going<00:03:14.510> like

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:15.199 
our feet are supposed to be going like

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:17.379 
our feet are supposed to be going like
one<00:03:15.530> two<00:03:15.799> three<00:03:15.829> one<00:03:16.459> two<00:03:16.489> three<00:03:16.669> on<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.180> bike

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
one two three one two three on the bike

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.199 
one two three one two three on the bike
and<00:03:17.690> there's<00:03:18.319> a<00:03:18.410> gear<00:03:18.829> that<00:03:19.040> we<00:03:19.190> turn<00:03:19.459> up<00:03:19.699> the

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
and there's a gear that we turn up the

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.619 
and there's a gear that we turn up the
resistance<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.730> when<00:03:22.730> we're<00:03:22.910> having<00:03:23.269> a<00:03:23.359> seat

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
resistance so when we're having a seat

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.770 
resistance so when we're having a seat
on<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.379> bike<00:03:24.760> she<00:03:25.760> might<00:03:25.940> tell<00:03:26.090> us<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.389> turn<00:03:26.569> up

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
on the bike she might tell us to turn up

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.409 
on the bike she might tell us to turn up
the<00:03:26.900> resistance<00:03:27.169> and<00:03:27.650> then<00:03:28.370> when<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:28.909> comes<00:03:29.090> to

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
the resistance and then when it comes to

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:30.970 
the resistance and then when it comes to
like<00:03:29.599> the<00:03:29.629> chorus<00:03:30.049> of<00:03:30.199> the<00:03:30.319> song<00:03:30.349> and<00:03:30.859> it

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
like the chorus of the song and it

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.110 
like the chorus of the song and it
speeds<00:03:31.400> up<00:03:31.639> then<00:03:32.239> we<00:03:32.359> have<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:32.659> stand<00:03:32.870> up<00:03:33.400> or<00:03:34.400> I

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
speeds up then we have to stand up or I

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.360 
speeds up then we have to stand up or I
guess<00:03:35.329> where<00:03:36.049> the<00:03:36.169> song<00:03:36.379> is<00:03:36.530> building<00:03:36.919> up<00:03:37.099> to

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
guess where the song is building up to

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.780 
guess where the song is building up to
the<00:03:37.519> chorus<00:03:38.680> that's<00:03:39.680> when<00:03:39.919> we<00:03:40.040> like<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.400> like

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
the chorus that's when we like to like

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.809 
the chorus that's when we like to like
get<00:03:41.120> our<00:03:41.239> butt<00:03:41.690> off<00:03:41.840> of<00:03:42.319> the<00:03:42.530> seat<00:03:42.799> and<00:03:43.099> you

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
get our butt off of the seat and you

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.809 
get our butt off of the seat and you
know<00:03:43.970> we're<00:03:44.239> going<00:03:44.889> really<00:03:45.889> hard<00:03:46.250> on<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:46.609> bike

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
know we're going really hard on the bike

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.059 
know we're going really hard on the bike
with<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.599> resistance<00:03:48.290> so<00:03:48.530> it's<00:03:48.680> like<00:03:48.799> burning

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
with the resistance so it's like burning

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.890 
with the resistance so it's like burning
your<00:03:49.310> legs<00:03:49.579> and<00:03:49.970> then<00:03:52.030> what<00:03:53.030> else<00:03:53.180> then<00:03:53.629> like

did it yesterday
but<00:07:05.300> I<00:07:05.750> mean<00:07:06.260> it<00:07:06.380> just<00:07:06.500> feels<00:07:06.710> different<00:07:07.280> than
