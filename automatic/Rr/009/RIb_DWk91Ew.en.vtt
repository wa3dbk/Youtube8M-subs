00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
the front so that I don't have so much

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.900 
the front so that I don't have so much
bulk<00:04:13.799> so<00:04:14.879> just<00:04:15.879> when<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:17.430> push<00:04:18.430> a<00:04:18.609> through<00:04:18.820> the

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
bulk so just when to push a through the

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:35.210 
bulk so just when to push a through the

extensions<00:04:39.979> onto<00:04:40.400> our<00:04:40.639> little<00:04:41.210> ponytail<00:04:41.599> that

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
extensions onto our little ponytail that

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.600 
extensions onto our little ponytail that
we<00:04:42.050> made<00:04:42.229> so<00:04:42.559> it<00:04:42.770> should<00:04:42.979> look<00:04:43.009> something<00:04:43.309> like
