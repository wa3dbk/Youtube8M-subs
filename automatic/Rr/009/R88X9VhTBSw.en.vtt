training<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.130> with<00:00:38.970> your<00:00:39.450> cat<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.380> a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
training this with your cat in a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.610 
training this with your cat in a
separate<00:00:41.430> room<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.760> your<00:00:41.850> dog<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.470> just<00:00:43.470> your

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
separate room to your dog and just your

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.110

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
dog knowing that the cats in the house

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.630 
dog knowing that the cats in the house
could<00:00:45.390> be<00:00:45.630> enough<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.870> set<00:00:46.260> them<00:00:46.410> off<00:00:46.640> barking

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
could be enough to set them off barking

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.810 
could be enough to set them off barking
or<00:00:48.560> scrambling<00:00:49.560> at<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.710> door<00:00:49.980> or<00:00:50.280> whatever<00:00:50.670> is

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
or scrambling at the door or whatever is

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.080 
or scrambling at the door or whatever is

that they do when the cats around and so

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.750
