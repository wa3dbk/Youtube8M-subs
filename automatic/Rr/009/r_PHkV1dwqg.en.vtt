right<00:02:13.620> here<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.730> helps<00:02:15.030> hold<00:02:15.240> this<00:02:15.450> twist

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
right here and it helps hold this twist

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.290 
right here and it helps hold this twist
in<00:02:15.930> place<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:16.830> if<00:02:17.070> you're<00:02:17.220> going<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.580> use<00:02:18.060> a

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
in place so if you're going to use a

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.990 
in place so if you're going to use a
satin<00:02:18.810> material<00:02:19.470> something<00:02:19.890> slippery<00:02:20.550> then

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
satin material something slippery then

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.480 
satin material something slippery then
most<00:02:21.420> likely<00:02:21.570> your<00:02:22.200> twist<00:02:22.560> will<00:02:22.800> go<00:02:23.040> undone

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
most likely your twist will go undone

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.030 
most likely your twist will go undone
easily<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.810> what<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.080> suggest<00:02:25.500> for<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.920> do

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
easily so what I suggest for you to do

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.950 
easily so what I suggest for you to do
is<00:02:26.250> find<00:02:26.520> something<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:27.000> has<00:02:27.150> texture<00:02:27.630> or<00:02:27.930> a

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
is find something that has texture or a

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.140 
is find something that has texture or a
little<00:02:28.320> bit<00:02:28.440> more<00:02:28.620> stiff<00:02:29.010> for<00:02:29.490> this<00:02:29.760> type<00:02:30.120> of

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
little bit more stiff for this type of

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.040 
little bit more stiff for this type of
pillowcase<00:02:32.030> okay<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.090> onto<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.690> flower

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
pillowcase okay so onto the flower

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.930 
pillowcase okay so onto the flower
making<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.160> first<00:02:35.370> thing<00:02:35.550> I'm<00:02:35.640> going<00:02:35.790> to

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
making and the first thing I'm going to

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.570 
making and the first thing I'm going to
do<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:36.300> cut<00:02:36.570> out<00:02:36.810> two<00:02:37.110> square<00:02:37.530> piece<00:02:37.830> from<00:02:38.160> some

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
do is cut out two square piece from some

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.420 
do is cut out two square piece from some
felt<00:02:38.880> material<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:39.930> then<00:02:40.560> I'm<00:02:40.800> going<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.190> just

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
felt material and then I'm going to just

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.060 
felt material and then I'm going to just
draw<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:42.030> spiral<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.660> give<00:02:42.960> you<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.140> visual<00:02:43.650> image

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
draw a spiral to give you a visual image

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.400 
draw a spiral to give you a visual image
on<00:02:44.310> how<00:02:44.910> I<00:02:44.940> will<00:02:45.360> be<00:02:45.390> cutting<00:02:45.720> these<00:02:45.960> squares

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
on how I will be cutting these squares

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.700 
on how I will be cutting these squares
these<00:02:47.160> squares<00:02:47.550> are<00:02:47.850> about<00:02:48.390> five<00:02:49.200> by<00:02:49.410> five<00:02:49.680> I

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
these squares are about five by five I

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.740 
these squares are about five by five I
would<00:02:49.980> say<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.700> all<00:02:50.820> depends<00:02:51.180> on<00:02:51.330> how<00:02:51.510> big

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
would say and it all depends on how big

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.870 
would say and it all depends on how big
you<00:02:51.900> want<00:02:51.930> your<00:02:52.170> flowers<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.650> look<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.730> I'm

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
you want your flowers to look so I'm

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.840 
you want your flowers to look so I'm
just<00:02:54.120> going<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.450> cut<00:02:54.750> out<00:02:54.960> around<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.530> lines

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
just going to cut out around the lines

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.370 
just going to cut out around the lines
usually<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:57.120> don't<00:02:57.360> draw<00:02:57.630> out<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.930> spiral

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
usually I don't draw out the spiral

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.560 
usually I don't draw out the spiral
because<00:02:58.740> I<00:02:58.950> already<00:02:59.100> have<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.730> visual<00:03:00.120> image<00:03:00.270> of

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
because I already have a visual image of

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.199 
because I already have a visual image of
in<00:03:00.780> my<00:03:01.020> head<00:03:01.260> on<00:03:01.440> how<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.070> want<00:03:02.370> this<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:02.700> look<00:03:05.209> so

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
in my head on how I want this to look so

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.180 
in my head on how I want this to look so
after<00:03:06.540> cutting<00:03:06.810> out<00:03:06.930> all<00:03:07.080> your<00:03:07.290> spirals<00:03:07.860> the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
after cutting out all your spirals the

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.520 
after cutting out all your spirals the
next<00:03:08.459> thing<00:03:08.610> you're<00:03:08.730> going<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.120> do<00:03:09.330> is<00:03:09.570> take

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
next thing you're going to do is take

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.190 
next thing you're going to do is take
each<00:03:10.770> spiral<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:11.640> wrap<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.180> around<00:03:12.330> forming<00:03:13.080> a

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
each spiral and wrap it around forming a

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.110 
each spiral and wrap it around forming a
flower<00:03:13.560> just<00:03:13.980> like<00:03:14.220> how<00:03:14.400> I'm<00:03:14.550> doing<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:14.940> right

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
flower just like how I'm doing it right

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.720 
flower just like how I'm doing it right
here<00:03:15.590> once<00:03:16.590> you're<00:03:16.800> done<00:03:16.950> with<00:03:17.160> each<00:03:17.400> flower

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
here once you're done with each flower

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.390 
here once you're done with each flower
go<00:03:18.090> ahead<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.600> glue<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.110> end<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.830> prevent<00:03:20.280> the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
go ahead and glue the end to prevent the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.589 
go ahead and glue the end to prevent the
flower<00:03:20.640> from<00:03:20.940> unraveling

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
flower from unraveling

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.180 
flower from unraveling
okay<00:03:24.599> so<00:03:24.660> for<00:03:25.050> this<00:03:25.170> next<00:03:25.230> step<00:03:25.920> right<00:03:26.130> here

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
okay so for this next step right here

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.760 
okay so for this next step right here
you<00:03:26.640> will<00:03:26.790> need<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.150> cut<00:03:27.420> out<00:03:27.569> a<00:03:27.930> felt<00:03:28.349> heart

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
you will need to cut out a felt heart

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.880 
you will need to cut out a felt heart
the<00:03:29.310> same<00:03:29.550> material<00:03:30.209> as<00:03:30.360> your<00:03:30.870> flowers<00:03:31.530> and
