00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.240
 hello friends here we are again go 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.430
 to finish this series of videos of 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.140
 training for beginners with the 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.820
 leg training the 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.470
 leg training is the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.840
 most basic training are the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.270
 larger muscles therefore the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.099
 what greater energy and more work and 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.739
 sacrifice brings us to the time of 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.370
 train ok this is a training 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.970
 basic and main we go there 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.129
 First of all, introduce yourself to 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.500
 'israel hidalgo runner-up in the 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:39.460
 Catalan championship of the federation 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.890
 Catalan bodybuilding and its good 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.449
 group best group are the legs so 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.780
 so much we are going to work a little bit to 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.010
 you can see how as we assert 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.010
 quadriceps extensions we are going to 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.250
 work on 15 20 repetitions let's go 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.320
 there we go nailing we work all the 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.030
 quadriceps area 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.720
 lentito squeezing up congesting 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.720
 good very good 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.650
 very good there 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.210
 squeezes 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.600
 very dense very hard 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.150
 squeezing phenomenon 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.159
 we look for burning congestion good 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.990
 after the 40's extensions we're going to 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.909
 do a femoral cure exercise 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.940
 lying for the back of the 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.220
 leg with this we also do it for 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.020
 heat the joint a little bit and 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.790
 then we will get into the exercises more 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.520
 basic as are the squats and the 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.810
 press so we put it a little bit with 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.690
 we manage we put the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.149
 articulation and we do not hurt so much and 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.450
 we force the joint we will work 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.220
 equal of 44 sets of 12 15 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.510
 repetitions 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.820
 it's about contracting with completely 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.510
 stretch the muscle and contract what is the 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.510
 vice moral 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.390
 movements always slow and controlled 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.700
 giving the maximum possible travel with 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.319
 Total top ration and stretch 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.920
 maximum 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.969
 Well now we have the leg 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.030
 congested hot the joint 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:23.879
 lubricated let's make the king the king the 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.430
 exercise king by deference squats 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.920
 to see gentlemen beginners if you want 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.170
 have big legs you can not forget 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.989
 of basic and squared squats 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.329
 ok is the main exercise so 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.000
 Therefore it must be done well done we will 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.260
 over there and rap it's about putting the 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.989
 bar 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.790
 on the shoulders going down to the 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.090
 horizontal your femur has to be 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.069
 horizontal to the ground and try not to 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.489
 train your back too much 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.489
 ahead 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.739
 and controlling the weight this exercise is 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.079
 a very basic exercise but also 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.000
 as you have seen it is quite dangerous 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.590
 you have to control the weight a lot and what 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.810
 we will do to try to avoid injuries is 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.959
 do it in a pyramidal way 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.599
 we will increase the weight in function 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.090
 of those of the series the first series 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.159
 more repetitions with less weight 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.290
 we will be adding weight and we will do less 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.939
 repetitions but never for the 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.340
 beginners we will never get off the 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:24.170
 other repetitions very well after 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.970
 the squats that we already have the leg 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.459
 very punished very congested we 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.769
 we're going to finish off the sloping press 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.340
 a very basic pressure exercise 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.650
 also and as you can see then we 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:41.019
 activates all the muscles of the leg 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.019
 which as much as twins femoral 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.350
 this is an exercise that we can throw 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.640
 heavier without risk problems of 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.680
 harm us 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.719
 at the time of doing it 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.000
 it's very comfortable going by guides then not 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:58.680
 there's a problem, well, we've worked 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.140
 the thigh the upper part of the leg we 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.400
 the calves are the twins 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.859
 let's work with twins in 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.140
 standing machine we will be alternating a day 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.599
 in standing machine and another one month and another 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.060
 sitting to vary the angles of 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.670
 work on the muscles involved is 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.919
 try to lower the heels below the 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.100
 all with a maximum stretch and went up 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.100
 up looking for maximum contraction of 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.620
 the Twins 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.750
 blocking the knees and the only thing that 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.030
 we move all the heels 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.260
 good guys with this the training 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.440
 of legs we have finished the 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.240
 training for beginners 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.610
 soon we will do a training of 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.860
 volume for more advanced bodybuilders 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.170
 we will do a strong training and 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.150
 intense and then as not also a 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.050
 my training but good a little 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.050
 we're going there 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.630
 or not 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.950
