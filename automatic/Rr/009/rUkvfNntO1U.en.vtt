like he said like we heard him speak and
Irish<00:02:36.489> originally<00:02:37.209> I<00:02:37.269> thought<00:02:37.329> he<00:02:37.540> was

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
but the thing is that Naruto has the

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.390 
but the thing is that Naruto has the
chakra<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.040> every<00:02:42.370> single<00:02:42.640> other<00:02:42.700> be<00:02:43.120> Jew<00:02:43.389> and

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:30.729 
combining with you know earth and

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:33.569 
combining with you know earth and
everything<00:03:30.879> and<00:03:31.209> we<00:03:31.810> see<00:03:32.019> that<00:03:32.049> you<00:03:32.349> know<00:03:32.579> by

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
everything and we see that you know by

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.839 
everything and we see that you know by
now<00:03:33.879> so<00:03:34.209> using<00:03:34.659> this<00:03:34.780> magma<00:03:35.079> release<00:03:35.500> it<00:03:35.849> shows

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
now so using this magma release it shows

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.729 
now so using this magma release it shows
that<00:03:37.090> he's<00:03:37.239> able<00:03:37.419> to<00:03:37.599> tap<00:03:37.870> into<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.319> original

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
that he's able to tap into the original

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.680 
that he's able to tap into the original
powers<00:03:39.069> of<00:03:39.250> every<00:03:39.519> single<00:03:39.790> other<00:03:39.849> biju<00:03:40.419> so

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
powers of every single other biju so

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.629 
powers of every single other biju so
this<00:03:41.229> shows<00:03:41.440> that<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.919> will<00:03:42.069> be<00:03:42.159> able<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.430> do

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
this shows that you will be able to do

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.309 
this shows that you will be able to do
with<00:03:42.849> not<00:03:43.030> only<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.329> four<00:03:43.599> tails<00:03:43.840> but<00:03:44.139> with

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
with not only the four tails but with

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.339 
with not only the four tails but with
the<00:03:44.500> probably<00:03:45.069> third<00:03:45.250> tail<00:03:45.489> so<00:03:45.669> using<00:03:46.060> water

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
the probably third tail so using water

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.050 
the probably third tail so using water
and<00:03:47.349> the<00:03:47.470> other<00:03:47.560> Biju's<00:03:48.159> we're<00:03:48.310> not<00:03:48.400> sure<00:03:48.579> what

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
and the other Biju's we're not sure what

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.460 
and the other Biju's we're not sure what
powers<00:03:49.329> they<00:03:49.449> can<00:03:49.599> use<00:03:49.750> like<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.049> six<00:03:50.290> tails

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
powers they can use like the six tails

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.140 
powers they can use like the six tails
from<00:03:50.680> han<00:03:50.949> and<00:03:51.250> you<00:03:51.340> know<00:03:51.430> those<00:03:51.669> other<00:03:51.879> chicks

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
from han and you know those other chicks

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.759 
from han and you know those other chicks
because<00:03:52.720> we<00:03:52.840> didn't<00:03:52.989> really<00:03:53.079> see<00:03:53.169> on<00:03:53.500> what

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
because we didn't really see on what

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.009 
because we didn't really see on what
they<00:03:53.889> can<00:03:54.040> do<00:03:54.220> but<00:03:54.489> i'm<00:03:54.729> pretty<00:03:55.569> sure<00:03:55.689> they<00:03:55.900> all

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
they can do but i'm pretty sure they all

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.929 
they can do but i'm pretty sure they all
have<00:03:56.169> their<00:03:56.319> perspective<00:03:56.799> elements<00:03:57.250> but<00:03:57.400> this

00:03:57.929 --> 00:03:57.939 
have their perspective elements but this

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:59.969 
have their perspective elements but this
second<00:03:58.840> part<00:03:58.959> of<00:03:59.049> the<00:03:59.139> prediction<00:03:59.590> of<00:03:59.709> narts

00:03:59.969 --> 00:03:59.979 
second part of the prediction of narts

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:02.039 
second part of the prediction of narts
will<00:04:00.159> be<00:04:00.280> able<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.549> use<00:04:00.639> like<00:04:01.030> of<00:04:01.239> all<00:04:01.810> five

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
will be able to use like of all five

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.020 
will be able to use like of all five
elements<00:04:02.470> that's<00:04:02.590> probably<00:04:02.859> true<00:04:03.099> now<00:04:03.310> but

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
elements that's probably true now but

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.849 
elements that's probably true now but
yeah<00:04:04.599> just<00:04:04.870> seeing<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:05.409> disruptive

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
yeah just seeing the disruptive

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.649 
yeah just seeing the disruptive
capabilities<00:04:06.430> of<00:04:06.459> that<00:04:06.699> Ross<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:07.239> shriek<00:04:07.509> on

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
capabilities of that Ross and shriek on

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:09.719 
capabilities of that Ross and shriek on
