making<00:00:03.840> miniature<00:00:04.200> robots<00:00:04.529> move<00:00:04.830> is<00:00:05.100> no<00:00:05.339> easy

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
making miniature robots move is no easy

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.270 
making miniature robots move is no easy
task<00:00:05.870> for<00:00:06.870> these<00:00:06.990> scientists<00:00:07.529> in<00:00:07.710> Zurich<00:00:08.099> have

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
task for these scientists in Zurich have

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.799 
task for these scientists in Zurich have
figured<00:00:08.550> out<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.700> way<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:08.970> do<00:00:09.300> that<00:00:09.540> using

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
figured out a way to do that using

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.620 
figured out a way to do that using
magnets<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:11.219> next<00:00:11.519> step<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.940> getting<00:00:12.269> them<00:00:12.509> to

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
magnets the next step is getting them to

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.680 
magnets the next step is getting them to
actually<00:00:12.809> do<00:00:13.320> something<00:00:14.030> so<00:00:15.030> now<00:00:15.210> I'm<00:00:15.450> about

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
actually do something so now I'm about

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.480 
actually do something so now I'm about
to<00:00:15.750> meet<00:00:16.020> Mike<00:00:16.410> robot<00:00:16.710> with<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.859> jaw-dropping

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
to meet Mike robot with a jaw-dropping

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.250 
to meet Mike robot with a jaw-dropping
mission<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.420> keep<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.750> from<00:00:18.869> going<00:00:19.080> blind

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
mission to keep you from going blind

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.800 
mission to keep you from going blind
so<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.619> where<00:00:22.740> we<00:00:22.830> keep<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.010> optimum<00:00:23.810> the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
so this is where we keep the optimum the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.320 
so this is where we keep the optimum the
idea<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.890> current<00:00:26.490> pop<00:00:26.609> thalmic<00:00:26.970> surgery

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
idea is that current pop thalmic surgery

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.720 
idea is that current pop thalmic surgery
procedures<00:00:27.840> are<00:00:28.170> fairly<00:00:28.650> invasive<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.490> what

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
procedures are fairly invasive so what

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.700 
procedures are fairly invasive so what
we're<00:00:29.880> trying<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.210> do<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.630> build<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.260> device

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
we're trying to do is build a device

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.130 
we're trying to do is build a device
which<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.070> manipulate<00:00:32.660> micro<00:00:33.660> robot<00:00:33.960> within

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
which can manipulate micro robot within

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.680 
which can manipulate micro robot within
the<00:00:34.380> eye<00:00:34.550> to<00:00:35.550> then<00:00:35.700> do<00:00:35.910> some<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.390> surgical

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
the eye to then do some of the surgical

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.710 
the eye to then do some of the surgical
tasks

to fix them are so difficult that only
about<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.580> thousand<00:01:03.150> doctors<00:01:03.330> in<00:01:03.630> America<00:01:03.690> are

about<00:01:06.960> these<00:01:07.200> surgeries<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.610> they

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
about these surgeries is that they

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.510 
about these surgeries is that they
require<00:01:09.450> very<00:01:09.480> very<00:01:10.170> high<00:01:10.680> precision<00:01:10.950> by<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
require very very high precision by the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.359 
require very very high precision by the
surgeons<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.270> even<00:01:12.840> slight<00:01:13.170> tremor<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
surgeons so even slight tremor in the

surgeons so even slight tremor in the
hand<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.729> surgeon<00:01:15.060> can<00:01:15.270> mean<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
hand of the surgeon can mean the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.219 
hand of the surgeon can mean the
difference<00:01:15.960> between<00:01:16.290> vision<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.920> blindness

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
difference between vision and blindness

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.080 
difference between vision and blindness
these<00:01:19.229> are<00:01:19.440> delicate<00:01:19.800> operations<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.700> they

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
these are delicate operations and they

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.969 
these are delicate operations and they
only<00:01:21.330> happen<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.750> conjunction<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> highly

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.029 
fleet and this is a similar view to a
ophthalmic<00:02:03.660> surgeon<00:02:03.929> see<00:02:04.259> as<00:02:04.470> they<00:02:04.679> do<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
ophthalmic surgeon see as they do the

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.830 
ophthalmic surgeon see as they do the
different<00:02:05.310> procedures

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.419 

the<00:02:08.259> device<00:02:08.530> would<00:02:08.649> be<00:02:08.709> introduced<00:02:09.160> with<00:02:09.399> a

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
the device would be introduced with a

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.730 
the device would be introduced with a
small<00:02:09.910> injection<00:02:10.420> so<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:11.440> don't<00:02:11.620> actually

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
small injection so you don't actually

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.160 
small injection so you don't actually
have<00:02:11.890> to<00:02:12.069> have<00:02:12.130> stitches<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:13.660> device<00:02:13.930> would

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
have to have stitches the device would

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.650 
have to have stitches the device would
then<00:02:14.350> be<00:02:14.620> steered<00:02:15.190> magnetically<00:02:15.940> using<00:02:16.420> the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
then be steered magnetically using the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.780 
then be steered magnetically using the
the<00:02:16.990> feedback<00:02:17.319> looking<00:02:18.220> through<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.430> camera

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
the feedback looking through the camera

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.490 
the feedback looking through the camera
and<00:02:19.090> then<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.360> device<00:02:19.660> is<00:02:19.870> removed<00:02:19.990> in<00:02:20.380> the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
and then the device is removed in the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.890 
and then the device is removed in the
same<00:02:20.530> way<00:02:20.890> it<00:02:20.950> was<00:02:21.040> introduced<00:02:21.660> whether<00:02:22.660> one

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
same way it was introduced whether one

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.690 
same way it was introduced whether one
day<00:02:23.080> replace<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.890> typical<00:02:24.310> procedures

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
day replace the typical procedures

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.030 
day replace the typical procedures
altogether<00:02:25.270> one<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.170> major<00:02:26.350> hopes<00:02:26.770> and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
altogether one of the major hopes and

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.650 
altogether one of the major hopes and
goals<00:02:27.069> of<00:02:27.489> working<00:02:28.030> on<00:02:28.120> micro<00:02:28.360> robotic

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
goals of working on micro robotic

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.120 
goals of working on micro robotic
technology<00:02:29.110> like<00:02:29.260> this<00:02:29.470> is<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:29.860> we<00:02:30.100> can

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
technology like this is that we can

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.670 
technology like this is that we can
really<00:02:30.489> help<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.850> change<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.270> way<00:02:31.630> surgery<00:02:32.560> is

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
really help to change the way surgery is

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.809 
really help to change the way surgery is
performed<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.680> fact<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.100> can<00:02:36.310> put<00:02:36.700> this

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
performed the fact that you can put this

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.059 
performed the fact that you can put this
in<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.000> eye<00:02:37.120> move<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.230> around<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:38.800> get<00:02:38.980> it

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
in the eye move it around and get it

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.610 
in the eye move it around and get it
back<00:02:39.160> out<00:02:39.370> again<00:02:39.400> I<00:02:39.880> think<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:40.660> is<00:02:41.350> really

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
back out again I think this is really

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.620 
back out again I think this is really
quite<00:02:41.800> remarkable<00:02:42.120> I'm<00:02:43.120> gonna<00:02:43.300> give<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.510> back

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
quite remarkable I'm gonna give it back

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.970 
quite remarkable I'm gonna give it back
to<00:02:44.019> you<00:02:44.110> because<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.560> could<00:02:44.709> lose<00:02:44.920> that

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
to you because you could lose that

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.430 
to you because you could lose that
really<00:02:45.640> easily<00:02:46.000> there's<00:02:46.959> plenty<00:02:47.230> more<00:02:47.260> where

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
really easily there's plenty more where

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.620 
really easily there's plenty more where
they
