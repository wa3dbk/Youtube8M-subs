00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.609
 Well, hello everyone dear friends with you 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.610
 james blue this would show you how 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.840
 add you furniture my craft without 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.139
 any mods for what you need 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.379
 command block 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.640
 button and the command itself to which the link 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:25.350
 in the description we will pray to the team 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:27.300
 we put the button and activate with you 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.429
 will be a forgery because now see 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.500
 just how many team blocks can 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.450
 activate you see how much 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:41.960
 just dohrena 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:44.850
 I think it's still a little nagging 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:49.440
 so we will not destroy the car 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.570
 destroy and start here we have stood out as 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.859
 would eggs and 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:08.549
 we have a chair here this is our first furniture 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:08.909
 then the table then the big table then 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.560
 us 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:17.040
 books for of course nothing is needed except 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:23.040
 guide and the last thing is probably the most 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:27.830
 cool this tv is what you do 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.830
 can do it 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:47.730
 you can do something like this with 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:59.070
 of this side we will deliver now also 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:02:02.369
 you can sit on chairs so easy 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.400
 we press it seems we press sorry right 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.270
 click on the chair and sit down to 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:18.860
 get up press shift she little tables 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:18.860
 you can put food so big 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:40.240
 by the way is another version before 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:43.390
 another version I did it in 1.8 it 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:47.500

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:52.740
 garbage will simply not mean 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:57.120
 can not be thought can add up here and go 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:03:02.290
 here you see relied still possible 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:05.410
 let's put it big here again 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.830
 Malinki now see it is necessary here as 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:15.750
 then go into it and that's how it relies 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:18.240

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.190
 lift and 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.080
 but still meat only you can put 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:31.270
 bread principle is she there all 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:37.300
