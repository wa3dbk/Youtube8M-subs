I really felt like I shouldn't have but
then<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.170> thought<00:00:34.559> about<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.040> like<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.670> I

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
then I thought about it like and I

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.520 
then I thought about it like and I
remembered<00:00:36.059> fifa<00:00:36.360> 13<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.960> used<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.320> struggle

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
remembered fifa 13 I used to struggle

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.170 
remembered fifa 13 I used to struggle
against<00:00:37.890> people<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:38.219> low<00:00:38.460> chemistry<00:00:38.969> all

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
against people with low chemistry all

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.600 
against people with low chemistry all
the<00:00:39.450> time<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.860> don't<00:00:41.070> know<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.370> what<00:00:41.550> it

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
xbox is a little bit more difficult and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.060 
xbox is a little bit more difficult and
PlayStation<00:01:18.900> I'm<00:01:18.960> not<00:01:19.110> really<00:01:19.229> sure<00:01:19.320> why<00:01:19.650> it's

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
PlayStation I'm not really sure why it's

PlayStation I'm not really sure why it's
probably<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.670> controller<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> I'm<00:01:21.960> in

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
probably just a controller but a I'm in

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.350 
probably just a controller but a I'm in
Division<00:01:22.409> 9<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.799> both<00:01:23.009> consoles<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:24.150> no

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
Division 9 on both consoles so I have no

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.539 
Division 9 on both consoles so I have no
concept<00:01:25.200> really<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.740> how<00:01:25.860> difficult<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.520> is

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
concept really of how difficult it is

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.390 
concept really of how difficult it is
you<00:01:27.330> know<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.960> something<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.470> division<00:01:28.890> 4<00:01:29.159> or

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
you know in something like division 4 or

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.859 
you know in something like division 4 or
what<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.700> difference<00:01:30.030> between<00:01:30.150> division<00:01:30.659> 4

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
what the difference between division 4

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.050 
what the difference between division 4
and<00:01:31.020> division<00:01:31.290> 1<00:01:31.439> would<00:01:31.619> be<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.790> can't

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
and division 1 would be and like I can't

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.910 
and division 1 would be and like I can't
even<00:01:33.390> imagine<00:01:33.600> what<00:01:34.200> how<00:01:34.380> difficult<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
even imagine what how difficult the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.980 
even imagine what how difficult the
vision<00:01:35.130> one<00:01:35.280> must<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:35.970> am<00:01:36.210> how<00:01:36.750> whenever

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
vision one must be but am how whenever

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.539 
vision one must be but am how whenever
like<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.500> was<00:01:37.680> another<00:01:37.890> complete

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
like this was another complete

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.280 
like this was another complete
clusterfuck<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.540> my<00:01:39.659> defense<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.229> it

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
clusterfuck in my defense and it

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.380 
clusterfuck in my defense and it
resulted<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.920> penalty<00:01:41.310> for<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.700> dude<00:01:41.939> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
resulted in a penalty for this dude and

he scored in the first half actually
with<00:01:43.890> Jackson<00:01:44.220> Martinez<00:01:44.549> who<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.540> reckon<00:01:46.320> Ruiz

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
with Jackson Martinez who I reckon Ruiz

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.830 
with Jackson Martinez who I reckon Ruiz

straight<00:01:51.210> away<00:01:51.420> just<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.810> see<00:01:51.960> how<00:01:52.110> good<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.409> is

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
straight away just to see how good it is

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.499 
straight away just to see how good it is
so<00:01:53.369> i<00:01:53.399> was<00:01:53.579> looking<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.850> try<00:01:54.090> out<00:01:54.210> Jackson

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
so i was looking to try out Jackson

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.910 
so i was looking to try out Jackson
Martinez<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.020> Jackson<00:01:55.259> Martinez<00:01:55.530> himself

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
Martinez and Jackson Martinez himself

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.499 
Martinez and Jackson Martinez himself
stepped<00:01:56.159> up<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.430> take<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.729> panel<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.210> scored

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
stepped up to take this panel and scored

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.780 
stepped up to take this panel and scored
I<00:01:57.719> think<00:01:58.290> I'm<00:01:58.649> sure<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.130> Jackson<00:01:59.399> Martinez

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
I think I'm sure it is Jackson Martinez

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.190 
I think I'm sure it is Jackson Martinez
I<00:01:59.939> would<00:02:00.149> have<00:02:00.240> noticed<00:02:00.390> if<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.780> wasn't<00:02:01.079> I'm

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
I would have noticed if it wasn't I'm

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.050 
I would have noticed if it wasn't I'm
sure<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:01.560> he<00:02:01.680> equalized<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> 56<00:02:02.790> minute

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
sure but he equalized in the 56 minute

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.520 
sure but he equalized in the 56 minute
and<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.390> how<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.570> game<00:02:03.659> ended<00:02:04.110> at<00:02:04.259> 2-all

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
and that is how the game ended at 2-all

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.649 
and that is how the game ended at 2-all
which<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.490> was<00:02:05.670> disappointed<00:02:05.939> with<00:02:06.329> because<00:02:06.630> I

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
which I was disappointed with because I

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.040 
which I was disappointed with because I
led<00:02:06.960> for<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.069> long<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.580> game<00:02:08.729> but<00:02:09.060> at<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
led for so long in the game but at the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.630 
led for so long in the game but at the
same<00:02:10.259> time<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.679> didn't<00:02:10.979> really<00:02:11.129> feel<00:02:11.220> like<00:02:11.400> I

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
same time I didn't really feel like I

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.100 
same time I didn't really feel like I
had<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.910> in

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
had it in

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.930 
had it in
me<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.350> win<00:02:12.500> for<00:02:13.070> whatever<00:02:13.280> reason<00:02:13.640> I<00:02:13.730> just

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
me to win for whatever reason I just

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.400 
me to win for whatever reason I just
felt<00:02:14.120> really<00:02:14.300> challenged<00:02:14.870> by<00:02:14.990> my<00:02:15.200> opponent

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
felt really challenged by my opponent

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.740 
felt really challenged by my opponent
and<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:15.770> really<00:02:16.100> felt<00:02:16.280> like<00:02:16.400> he<00:02:16.550> knew<00:02:16.790> how<00:02:17.690> to

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
and I really felt like he knew how to

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.090 
and I really felt like he knew how to
play<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.140> game<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.320> lot<00:02:18.530> better<00:02:18.680> than<00:02:18.950> I<00:02:19.040> did

play the game a lot better than I did

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.160 
play the game a lot better than I did
and<00:02:19.400> in<00:02:19.790> fairness<00:02:19.940> it<00:02:20.240> does<00:02:20.360> take<00:02:20.600> balls<00:02:20.900> to

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
and in fairness it does take balls to

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.990

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
not in a way where there was tons of

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.370 
not in a way where there was tons of
like<00:02:46.640> clear-cut<00:02:47.209> chances<00:02:47.630> but<00:02:47.780> this<00:02:47.990> dude<00:02:48.170> did

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
like clear-cut chances but this dude did

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.229 
like clear-cut chances but this dude did
end<00:02:48.530> up<00:02:48.680> score<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.130> in<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.310> 78th<00:02:49.820> minute<00:02:49.850> and

end up score and in the 78th minute and

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.030 
end up score and in the 78th minute and
I<00:02:50.300> was<00:02:50.450> so<00:02:50.630> good<00:02:50.870> with<00:02:51.200> this<00:02:51.290> goal<00:02:51.500> because<00:02:51.830> I

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
I was so good with this goal because I

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.130 
I was so good with this goal because I
honestly<00:02:53.030> didn't<00:02:53.360> feel<00:02:53.510> like<00:02:53.540> he<00:02:53.660> deserved<00:02:54.050> it

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
honestly didn't feel like he deserved it

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.270 
honestly didn't feel like he deserved it
but<00:02:54.260> I<00:02:54.320> went<00:02:54.530> back<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:54.709> I<00:02:54.890> looked<00:02:55.070> at<00:02:55.190> the

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
but I went back and I looked at the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.190 
but I went back and I looked at the
replay<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.760> as<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:55.940> ball<00:02:55.970> comes<00:02:56.270> in<00:02:56.540> this<00:02:56.989> I

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
replay and as the ball comes in this I

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.020 
replay and as the ball comes in this I
don't<00:02:57.470> know<00:02:57.560> if<00:02:57.860> this<00:02:58.100> pisses<00:02:58.580> anyone<00:02:58.880> else

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
don't know if this pisses anyone else

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.910 
don't know if this pisses anyone else
off<00:02:59.180> as<00:02:59.330> much<00:02:59.450> as<00:02:59.600> it<00:02:59.690> pisses<00:02:59.930> me<00:02:59.930> off<00:03:00.080> but<00:03:00.410> how

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
off as much as it pisses me off but how

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.190 
off as much as it pisses me off but how
does<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.160> defender<00:03:01.730> like<00:03:02.150> Daniel<00:03:02.510> Agger<00:03:02.690> jump

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
does a defender like Daniel Agger jump

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.080 
does a defender like Daniel Agger jump
up<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.560> miss<00:03:03.800> George<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.400> header<00:03:04.580> like<00:03:04.880> that

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
when the ball is about four foot in

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.930 
when the ball is about four foot in
front<00:03:06.770> of<00:03:06.980> them<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:07.190> he's<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:07.400> fucking<00:03:07.760> tall

lad and he has really good heading

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.800 
lad and he has really good heading
accuracy<00:03:09.590> stats<00:03:10.160> like<00:03:10.730> as<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.209> comes<00:03:11.420> in<00:03:11.630> right

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
accuracy stats like as it comes in right

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.290 
accuracy stats like as it comes in right
here<00:03:12.080> in<00:03:12.290> slow<00:03:12.770> motion<00:03:13.010> how<00:03:13.400> does<00:03:13.640> he<00:03:13.760> not<00:03:13.970> just

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
here in slow motion how does he not just

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.120 
here in slow motion how does he not just
fucking<00:03:14.750> header<00:03:14.959> that<00:03:15.050> away<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:15.800> then

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
fucking header that away and then

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.199 
fucking header that away and then
obviously<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.519> goalkeeper<00:03:17.030> does<00:03:17.180> a

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
obviously the goalkeeper does a

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.240 
obviously the goalkeeper does a
horrendous<00:03:17.900> job<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:18.260> saving<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.739> as<00:03:18.830> well<00:03:18.980> and

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
horrendous job of saving it as well and

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.190 
horrendous job of saving it as well and
it<00:03:19.280> just<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:20.360> don't<00:03:20.420> know<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.750> made<00:03:20.900> me<00:03:21.019> feel

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
it just I don't know it made me feel

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:34.550 
it just I don't know it made me feel
like<00:03:21.500> a<00:03:21.799> car<00:03:22.430> crash

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.260 

so<00:03:35.560> after<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:35.920> I<00:03:35.980> ended<00:03:36.340> up<00:03:36.400> selling<00:03:36.640> at<00:03:37.000> this

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
so after that I ended up selling at this

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.180 
so after that I ended up selling at this
time<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.510> put<00:03:38.140> him<00:03:38.230> up<00:03:38.320> for<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.500> 700<00:03:38.950> bit<00:03:39.070> i<00:03:39.100> think

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
time I put him up for a 700 bit i think

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.550 
time I put him up for a 700 bit i think
i<00:03:39.430> actually<00:03:39.550> bought<00:03:39.850> him<00:03:40.060> for<00:03:40.320> 750<00:03:41.320> so<00:03:41.440> it's

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
i actually bought him for 750 so it's

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.050 
i actually bought him for 750 so it's
only<00:03:41.740> 50<00:03:42.010> calling<00:03:42.220> last<00:03:42.370> not<00:03:42.640> really<00:03:42.820> worried

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
only 50 calling last not really worried

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.790 
only 50 calling last not really worried
about<00:03:43.210> and<00:03:43.450> I<00:03:43.540> listed<00:03:43.990> Martin<00:03:44.290> Kelly<00:03:44.470> as<00:03:44.650> well

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
about and I listed Martin Kelly as well

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.980 
about and I listed Martin Kelly as well
who<00:03:45.040> he<00:03:45.850> I<00:03:45.880> don't<00:03:46.030> think<00:03:46.390> he<00:03:46.510> actually<00:03:46.660> sold

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
who he I don't think he actually sold

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.720 
who he I don't think he actually sold
and<00:03:47.260> I<00:03:47.320> think<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:47.620> ended<00:03:47.890> up<00:03:47.980> this<00:03:48.160> guiding<00:03:48.580> him

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
and I think I ended up this guiding him

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.010 
and I think I ended up this guiding him
after<00:03:49.030> just<00:03:49.240> because<00:03:49.450> they<00:03:49.570> only<00:03:49.690> have<00:03:49.870> one

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
after just because they only have one

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.480 
after just because they only have one
contract<00:03:50.470> left<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:50.860> I<00:03:50.920> can't<00:03:51.220> be<00:03:51.370> bothered

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
contract left and I can't be bothered

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.820 
contract left and I can't be bothered
buying<00:03:51.880> contracts<00:03:52.390> on<00:03:52.540> this<00:03:52.720> game<00:03:52.900> because

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
buying contracts on this game because

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.530 
buying contracts on this game because
they're<00:03:54.130> gone<00:03:54.310> for<00:03:54.520> like<00:03:54.580> 300<00:03:55.000> coins<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.420> it's
