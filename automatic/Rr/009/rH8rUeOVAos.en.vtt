00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
away i read somewhere that you could use

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.550 
away i read somewhere that you could use
apple<00:01:33.829> cider<00:01:33.860> vinegar<00:01:34.250> soaks<00:01:35.060> like<00:01:35.990> equal

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
apple cider vinegar soaks like equal

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.080 
apple cider vinegar soaks like equal
parts<00:01:37.009> water<00:01:37.280> and<00:01:37.729> apple<00:01:38.090> cider<00:01:38.450> vinegar<00:01:38.630> and

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
parts water and apple cider vinegar and

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.120 
parts water and apple cider vinegar and
that<00:01:41.090> helps<00:01:41.420> with<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.659> staining<00:01:42.110> also<00:01:43.099> a

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
that helps with the staining also a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:50.649 
that helps with the staining also a
quicker<00:01:43.610> result<00:01:46.750> here<00:01:47.750> is<00:01:48.159> those<00:01:49.659> tablets

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
quicker result here is those tablets

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.410

the<00:04:42.430> effect<00:04:42.910> at<00:04:43.090> all<00:04:43.770> because<00:04:44.770> I<00:04:44.920> was<00:04:45.070> reading

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
the effect at all because I was reading

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.910 
the effect at all because I was reading
places<00:04:45.940> that<00:04:46.120> some<00:04:46.420> putting<00:04:47.110> top<00:04:47.320> coats<00:04:47.620> over

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
places that some putting top coats over

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.480 
places that some putting top coats over
some<00:04:48.190> of<00:04:48.340> these<00:04:48.490> polishes<00:04:50.010> changes<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:51.220> fact

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
some of these polishes changes the fact

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.640 
some of these polishes changes the fact
but<00:04:51.820> nope<00:04:52.770> so<00:04:53.770> I<00:04:53.800> definitely<00:04:54.400> think<00:04:54.820> it<00:04:55.150> was

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
but nope so I definitely think it was

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.070 
but nope so I definitely think it was
worth<00:04:56.650> ten<00:04:57.490> dollars<00:04:58.090> even<00:04:58.420> though<00:04:58.720> it's<00:04:58.900> a

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
worth ten dollars even though it's a

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.530 
worth ten dollars even though it's a
relatively<00:04:59.590> small<00:04:59.740> bottle<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.820> effect<00:05:01.300> is

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
relatively small bottle the effect is

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.800 
relatively small bottle the effect is
just<00:05:01.810> so<00:05:02.050> cool<00:05:02.410> I'd<00:05:02.590> also<00:05:02.920> underneath<00:05:03.550> a<00:05:04.120> light
