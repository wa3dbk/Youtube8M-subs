00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.710
We have the Tofu and Beans. 
Just heat the ingredients, and you're done!

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.030
The following are the ingredients for this menu.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.580
Instead of using pork,
 here, we will use deep-fried tofu.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.370
Tofu may also suffice, 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.170
but deep-fried tofu has a fine texture.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.670
The deep-fried tofu is blanched in hot water.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.090
The cooked tomato.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.710
Tomatoes contain plenty of beta-carotene and lycopene.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.950
Both are very resistant to heat, 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.480
so the nutrients will remain even after boiled in water.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.490
Feel free to use canned food.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.370
This is a can of soy beans.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.370
Soy beans are said...

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.540
Soy beans are also known as "the meat of the garden".

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.510
They contain a lot of fat and protein.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.210
Next is a bowl of chopped onions.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.410
A substance called allyl sulfide in an onion hurts the eyes.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.630
Allyl sulfide helps us absorb thiamine (Vitamin B1) into our bodies.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.820
This is the king oyster; 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.050
any other mushroom is acceptable.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.540
Using this mushroom will especially
give the menu an interesting texture.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.070
Throw the ingredients into the pot. 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.150
A Le Creuset is used in this case, 
but any pot is fine.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.690
Just add the ingredients.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.080
Befor adding, 
you may saute onion in the olive oil.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.770
To make it as healthier as possible, 
we will not use oil.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.650
Heating it will increase its flavor.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.030
Just add the ingredients. It's very simple.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.310
This menu is especially very helpful for busy housewives.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.190
Stir occasionally,

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.190
turn down the heat,

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.520
 and place the lid. 
Let it simmer for 15 minutes.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.690
It has been 15 minutes.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.280
It seems like it is well cooked...

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.300
Mmm... looks delicious!

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.160
Now, to add the seasoning.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.480
Pour in some honey.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.850
Adding honey will sweeten the flavor 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.860
and may also be favorable for young children.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.020
Some ketchup, 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.240
and consomme.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.190
If the consomme is cubed, one will be enough.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.100
Some Worcester sauce...

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:57.860
Keep the pot open and simmer 
until the amount it boiled down to half.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.380
It is about half now.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.540
Exchanging the deep-fried tofu to sausages 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.740
Instead of honey, a tablespoon of wine may also be used. 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.330
Add garlic and bring out the taste.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.340
It will be something good to go with wine.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.330
Please try this at home.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.500
...and now, We have the Tofu and Beans. 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.220
Just heat the ingredients, and you're done!
