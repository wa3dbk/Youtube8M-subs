00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.400 
caliber rounds
um<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:19.640> the<00:00:20.640> married<00:00:21.060> has<00:00:21.300> enough<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:22.020> hold

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
um and the married has enough to hold

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.640 
um and the married has enough to hold
two<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.830> them<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:24.119> could<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.840> probably<00:00:25.260> if<00:00:25.560> I

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
two of them it could it probably if I

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.460 
two of them it could it probably if I
wanted<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.340> can<00:00:26.580> hold<00:00:26.820> three<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:27.470> not

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
wanted it to it can hold three but not

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.700 
wanted it to it can hold three but not
forget<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.550> reason<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.199> that<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.289> made<00:00:31.529> it

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
forget the reason that I that I made it

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.690 
forget the reason that I that I made it
only<00:00:32.189> made<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.550> hold<00:00:32.759> -<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.750> was<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:34.700> think

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
only made it hold - but it was I think

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.590 
only made it hold - but it was I think
the<00:00:35.910> reason<00:00:36.329> was<00:00:36.510> because<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:39.030> gun<00:00:39.210> wouldn't

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
the reason was because the gun wouldn't

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.010 
the reason was because the gun wouldn't
work<00:00:39.780> or<00:00:40.079> something<00:00:40.790> if<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:42.000> put<00:00:42.690> three<00:00:42.930> in

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
work or something if I put three in

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.680 
work or something if I put three in
there<00:00:43.280> but<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.120> save<00:00:45.360> time

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
there but just to save time

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.779 
there but just to save time
I<00:00:45.960> already<00:00:47.059> loaded<00:00:48.059> or<00:00:48.600> got<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> Rodin<00:00:49.789> let's

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
I already loaded or got the Rodin let's

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:51.650 
I already loaded or got the Rodin let's
go<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.000> semiotic

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
go to semiotic

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.720 
go to semiotic
mechanism<00:00:53.420> so<00:00:54.420> if<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.870> had<00:00:55.050> more<00:00:55.260> than<00:00:55.730> more

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
mechanism so if I had more than more

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.819 
mechanism so if I had more than more
than<00:00:56.760> run<00:00:57.059> one<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.719> these<00:00:57.899> really<00:00:58.410> long<00:00:58.559> rubber

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
than run one of these really long rubber

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:07.160 
than run one of these really long rubber
bands<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.489> could<00:00:59.699> shoot<00:01:00.320> automatically

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.969 

okay<00:01:07.890> should<00:01:08.520> whoa<00:01:09.270> when<00:01:09.510> interest<00:01:09.900> nope<00:01:10.770> this

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
okay should whoa when interest nope this

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.610 
okay should whoa when interest nope this
it<00:01:11.280> was<00:01:11.490> really<00:01:12.060> powerful<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:12.960> explosive

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
it was really powerful just explosive

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.980 
it was really powerful just explosive
but<00:01:14.190> that's<00:01:14.940> not<00:01:15.150> as<00:01:15.270> powerful

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
but that's not as powerful

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.420 
but that's not as powerful
I'm<00:01:16.140> pretty<00:01:16.440> sure<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:16.740> because<00:01:16.890> we're<00:01:17.340> our

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
I'm pretty sure it's because we're our

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.920 
I'm pretty sure it's because we're our
bands<00:01:17.729> gotten<00:01:18.000> worn<00:01:18.869> down<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.320> stuff<00:01:20.930> now

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
bands gotten worn down and stuff now

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.310 
bands gotten worn down and stuff now
since<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.320> don't<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.740> rubber<00:01:23.220> band<00:01:24.140> for<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
since I don't have a rubber band for the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:49.980 
since I don't have a rubber band for the
magazine<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:27.560> push<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.740> up

Bob<00:02:59.700> Mann<00:02:59.970> I'm<00:03:00.150> pretty<00:03:00.420> sure<00:03:00.599> it<00:03:01.049> is<00:03:01.579> and<00:03:02.579> that

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
Bob Mann I'm pretty sure it is and that

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.280 
Bob Mann I'm pretty sure it is and that
was<00:03:02.880> pretty<00:03:03.150> big<00:03:03.420> but<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.720> broke<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:04.019> lot

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
was pretty big but it broke a lot

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.610 
was pretty big but it broke a lot
because<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:05.480> cuz<00:03:06.480> just<00:03:06.750> this<00:03:06.989> structure<00:03:07.440> wasn't

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
because I cuz just this structure wasn't

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.229 
because I cuz just this structure wasn't
sturdy<00:03:08.340> enough<00:03:09.230> but<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.350> one<00:03:10.560> doesn't<00:03:10.799> even

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
sturdy enough but this one doesn't even

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.789 
sturdy enough but this one doesn't even
like<00:03:12.239> this<00:03:12.569> one<00:03:12.780> doesn't<00:03:12.989> break<00:03:13.319> even<00:03:13.709> though

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
like this one doesn't break even though

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.319 
like this one doesn't break even though
it's<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.220> huge<00:03:15.799> alright<00:03:16.829> you<00:03:17.730> can't<00:03:18.030> take<00:03:18.180> over

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
it's so huge alright you can't take over

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.630 
it's so huge alright you can't take over
out
