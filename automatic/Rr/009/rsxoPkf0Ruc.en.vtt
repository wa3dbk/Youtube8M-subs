00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hi guys, how are you? I'm just seeing the creed. 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.340
 in addition to the street and I and today I'm here to 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.200
 to teach something very simple but that 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.780
 I get many emails from people 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.679
 Wondering how to do is patina 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.980
 Provencal 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.500
 Actually, I'm going to take a step-by-step 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.140
 complete written on the patina 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.039
 and I'm basically going to teach 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:30.869
 You guys do the scrapes on the mons. 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.360
 Part corners just to summarize to right 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.300
 You know everything before 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.030
 Publish step by step is this window is 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.930
 in a very dark way I blessed well 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.410
 to remove the varnish I applied two coats 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.719
 of the paint that the white latex paint and 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.280
 then three coats of nail polish 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.980
 water white satin also logical 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.809
 So she stayed, she was pretty white. 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.390
 that's what I wanted the most 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.760
 so now I'm going to teach you to 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.189
 do the ProvenÃ§al patina I already saw 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.140
 various techniques to do their part 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.310
 but I have one that is very simple 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.210
 so cool 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.450
 They're pieces of glass and we're going to waste it. 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.909
 these corners is very always only that to him 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.680
 We're going to put on a glove because it goes. 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.840
 something happens we cut 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.990
 the inmates, I can not right? 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.150
 good the only secret is that so the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.759
 glass he has some places that he 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.920
 cuts and others that he is already blind 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.530
 so we'll always use the side 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.530
 more important and will 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.610
 have seen how it is 100 bi 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:55.400
 so we pick up where you have these 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.400
 Older women think that more stab 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.190
 The cool thing about this page is that some 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.310
 Places get more right on others 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.869
 Not for me, that's funny. 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.260
 end result that not everything remains 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.020
 and the wood appears that is 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.060
 Well, well, old, dark, so I'll do it. 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.440
 This whole piece and I come to show 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:26.000
 Already how it was good to just do 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.000
 a little bit for you 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:52.040
 O window is ready're there I did I 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.520
 I spent all the corners some places 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.610
 more come others - this goes a lot 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.910
 I like the person there under a good 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.270
 worn only a little bit can waste 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.010
 until it's part of the hardware people look at it 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.990
 what a cute thing 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.300
 so this is the agent the window is here 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.080
 and I'm going to do something really cool with 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.970
 she 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:23.210
 Ah, I'll leave the link on 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.790
 post information box about how to 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.220
 do the part of the province when I go 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.430
 show the window ready with the 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.010
 The idea that I had then comes back and 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.070

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.610

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.100
 suggestions of videos my imagination at 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.900
 Sometimes you can not tell me everything I 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.150
 I gotta do it, well, send it to me. 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.180

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.930
 I could not resist I came back to show the 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:59.800
 window did not make a panel with 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.540
 a tag board that is your coffee punch 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.660
 to put my brushes 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:09.380
 here are all the baskets that people 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:12.020
 find a store of 99 and here a 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.390
 that I'm going to paint on 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.970
 It's true, I only put the things I 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.660
 I was very anxious but I'm still going to change 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:24.470
 This panel looks nice, people. 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.440
