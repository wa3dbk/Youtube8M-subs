00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.279
 such a seemingly not very important topic 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:09.209
 how to wash the spray gun and aftertreatment 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.619
 spray guns why is it important to have 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:14.039
 several spray guns and especially 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:17.890
 separately have for soil 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:19.990
 only at least once to combat 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.289
 just the way was always absolutely clean 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:27.130
 that is, we are engaged in finishing 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:30.009
 painting tons i after each painting 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.920
 just make out the way and mine it 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:36.070
 applies to the one that causes 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.920
 finish it there it happens 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.220
 I can do it differently for the third time 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.700
 after applying in this case 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.270
 came from out of a pack taped for 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.000
 minor works here 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.850
 rust on the frame and 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.300
 that she was cleaned now the tower 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.380
 spit on yes but I acted differently 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:07.770
 processed a strong converter 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:07.770
 rust and primed now bad 1 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:17.310
 the goal is to save you necessarily 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.630
 thirst first to use exactly the primer 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.820
 document hundreds then there should be light where 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:28.420
 no matter how much layer putty result 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.400
 the lid is put dirty with soil as it can 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.340
 you can certainly enter to score 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:40.720
 solvent principle can so if so 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:43.590
 and do we just live and believe 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.590
 fall to 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:59.950
 a little harder way a little more interesting 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:09.819
 the way the same thing only he poke 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:11.709
 finger outside the window and finger drops 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.290
 detractors up all wore 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.920
 call pro buffalo and all the dirt 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.920
 lift up 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.709
 1 reply 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.620
 we can then get can also still 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.680
 Repeat this screen with your finger 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.130
 warm we all paint rises 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.130
 glass 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.320
 another story you have to take some 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:49.100
 capacitance and sort out kaput nozzles we 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:53.530
 quickly solvents so that it is convenient 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:57.920
 it is desirable to get 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:04.550
 clip tag brush is also needed because 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:07.910
 we can wash off the remains of the 100 end after 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:11.050
 this pour fresh solvent and again 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.840
 product piece way still convenient to have 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.350
 ordinary wooden toothpicks for cleaning 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.660
 nozzles 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.700
 just especially can only just soft 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.430
 by material 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.130
 we take the toothpick accused on the rod 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.650
 pens every time I undermine cum and 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.650
 clean juice to full purity 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.629
 and you are strong with solvent 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.250
 740 acrylic solvent 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:53.140
 and this is the usual 150 150 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.420
 seemingly fetus serious business 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.470
 use strong solvent for 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.780
 paragraph 646 casco wash for example 650 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.340
 stupid in the usual way it is strong 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.160
 try to use jump wash 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.160
 item that is, I buy it only for 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.930
 these goals in painting virtually no 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.400
 out of plastic to steal accounts 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.530
 the garage may be some kind of humidity 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.930
 maybe the dirt is not over here still may not 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.560
 dry to the end of the ground and strongly 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.510
 Of course there is more solvent 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.100
 the likelihood that can happen to 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:29.770
 primer on the part that's all 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:35.200
 actually it is therefore important to have one for 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:37.710
 ground and one battle flag on this wish 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.870
 Holocron painting with undesirable 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.150
 should and this wash after each 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:47.620
 of application 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:50.010
 was pure kartopu for a year whose 1 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.010
 until 3
