brain when you crack it open it

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.150 
brain when you crack it open it
resembles<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.200> brain<00:03:07.440> complete<00:03:07.920> with<00:03:07.950> the

resembles a brain complete with the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.050 
resembles a brain complete with the
right<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.610> left<00:03:08.640> hemispheres<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:11.040> it's<00:03:11.850> it

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
right and left hemispheres and it's it

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.750 
right and left hemispheres and it's it
has<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.660> contains<00:03:13.170> omega-3<00:03:13.350> fatty<00:03:14.310> acids

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
has it contains omega-3 fatty acids

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.880 
has it contains omega-3 fatty acids
which<00:03:14.970> helps<00:03:15.330> cognitive<00:03:15.900> function<00:03:16.350> and

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
which helps cognitive function and
