00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
we're out here with another piston

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.089 
we're out here with another piston
creation<00:00:02.970> that<00:00:03.600> I<00:00:03.659> made<00:00:04.819> this<00:00:05.819> time<00:00:06.180> it<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.690> a

amethyst<00:00:22.279> really<00:00:23.510> yeah<00:00:24.510> whatever<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:24.990> get

amethyst really yeah whatever you get
the<00:00:25.230> picture<00:00:25.560> oh<00:00:25.710> alright<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.609> basically<00:00:26.849> we

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
the picture oh alright so basically we

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.200 
the picture oh alright so basically we
hit<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.750> cobblestone<00:00:28.170> generator<00:00:28.199> here<00:00:29.210> it

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
hit the cobblestone generator here it

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:39.380 
hit the cobblestone generator here it
pushes<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.019> up<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:37.489> get<00:00:38.489> inside<00:00:38.940> there<00:00:39.180> we<00:00:39.270> go

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
pushes it up and get inside there we go

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.510 
pushes it up and get inside there we go
and<00:00:39.660> there<00:00:40.530> are<00:00:40.620> Pistons<00:00:41.070> along<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.340> bottom

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
and there are Pistons along the bottom

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.799 
and there are Pistons along the bottom
and<00:00:41.969> underneath<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.989> floor<00:00:43.410> there<00:00:43.800> are

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
and underneath this floor there are

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.630 
and underneath this floor there are
Peters<00:00:45.809> all<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.530> stuff<00:00:46.829> all<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.100> good<00:00:47.370> stuff

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
Peters all that stuff all the good stuff

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.380 
Peters all that stuff all the good stuff
and<00:00:48.530> basically<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:50.190> pushes<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.730> up<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.180> will

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
and basically it pushes it up this will

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.250 
and basically it pushes it up this will
build<00:00:51.629> sides<00:00:52.309> one<00:00:53.309> by<00:00:53.489> one<00:00:54.020> and<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:55.170> it

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
build sides one by one and then it

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.720 
build sides one by one and then it
pushes<00:00:55.410> over<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.010> then<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.280> patient

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
pushes over here and then this patient

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.029 
pushes over here and then this patient
pushes<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.180> over<00:00:57.210> here<00:00:57.600> pushes<00:00:58.500> them<00:00:58.649> up<00:00:58.800> one

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
pushes it over here pushes them up one

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.890 
pushes it over here pushes them up one
by<00:00:59.070> one<00:01:00.770> over<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:02.570> same<00:01:03.570> thing<00:01:05.600> down<00:01:06.600> over

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
by one over here same thing down over

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.429 
by one over here same thing down over
here<00:01:07.220> but<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.369> comes<00:01:08.640> up<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.510> then<00:01:10.260> these

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
here but it comes up and then these

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.440 
here but it comes up and then these
missions<00:01:10.979> which<00:01:11.159> run<00:01:11.400> off<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> separate<00:01:12.240> clucks

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
missions which run off a separate clucks

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.700 
missions which run off a separate clucks
I<00:01:12.750> didn't<00:01:12.990> want<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.229> wire<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.280> clock<00:01:14.610> up<00:01:14.820> here

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
I didn't want to wire that clock up here

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.330 
I didn't want to wire that clock up here
pushes<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.780> forward<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.530> then<00:01:19.619> stops<00:01:19.979> here

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
pushes it forward and then stops here

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.050 
pushes it forward and then stops here
and<00:01:20.479> then<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:22.049> goes<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.680> next<00:01:22.979> one<00:01:23.189> forward

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
and then it goes the next one forward

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.020 
and then it goes the next one forward
stops<00:01:24.360> four<00:01:24.689> stops<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.170> then<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.380> finishes

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
stops four stops and then it finishes

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.910 
stops four stops and then it finishes
right<00:01:27.030> up<00:01:27.150> there<00:01:27.360> Oh<00:01:27.540> runs<00:01:28.320> off<00:01:28.500> with<00:01:28.710> this

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
right up there Oh runs off with this

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.039 
right up there Oh runs off with this
clock<00:01:29.250> right<00:01:29.430> there<00:01:32.450> now<00:01:33.450> let<00:01:33.540> me<00:01:33.600> show<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.840> it

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
clock right there now let me show you it

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:42.420 
clock right there now let me show you it
in<00:01:34.140> action<00:01:35.810> start<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.079> clock

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:58.550 

whoops<00:01:43.430> oh<00:01:43.790> crap

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:12.740 

I'm<00:01:59.560> so<00:01:59.800> bad<00:01:59.980> at<00:02:00.040> this

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.979 

there<00:02:13.750> we<00:02:13.959> go<00:02:15.239> all<00:02:16.239> right<00:02:16.390> step<00:02:16.629> how<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:16.930> that

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
there we go all right step how is that

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:27.270 
there we go all right step how is that
it's<00:02:19.989> just<00:02:23.700> outside<00:02:24.700> for<00:02:25.060> now<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:26.500> timing<00:02:27.040> for

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
it's just outside for now the timing for

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.880 
it's just outside for now the timing for
this<00:02:27.310> is<00:02:27.959> incredibly<00:02:28.959> hard<00:02:29.290> because<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.769> have

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
this is incredibly hard because you have

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.559 
this is incredibly hard because you have
to<00:02:30.040> get<00:02:30.269> make<00:02:31.269> sure<00:02:31.599> that<00:02:32.170> this<00:02:32.590> person<00:02:33.069> is

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
to get make sure that this person is

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.479 
to get make sure that this person is
retracted<00:02:34.569> when<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:36.370> piston<00:02:37.379> extends<00:02:38.489> and

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
retracted when that piston extends and

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.649 
retracted when that piston extends and
make<00:02:39.970> sure<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:40.390> this<00:02:40.780> is<00:02:40.989> on<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.500> thumb<00:02:42.659> those

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
make sure it this is on the thumb those

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.780 
make sure it this is on the thumb those
ones<00:02:43.900> those<00:02:44.620> personal<00:02:45.190> just<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.519> little<00:02:45.700> bit
