sweetness to cocktails usually when

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.920 
sweetness to cocktails usually when
we're<00:00:07.950> using<00:00:08.010> fresh<00:00:08.820> lemon<00:00:09.270> fresh<00:00:09.480> lime<00:00:09.750> we

know<00:00:10.049> that<00:00:10.230> we<00:00:10.350> need<00:00:10.680> a<00:00:10.709> little<00:00:10.889> bit<00:00:11.100> of

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
know that we need a little bit of

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.560 
know that we need a little bit of
sweetness<00:00:11.430> not<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.730> make<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.059> drink<00:00:12.360> sweet

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
rich or sea Europe we can do two parts

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.349 
rich or sea Europe we can do two parts
sugar<00:00:46.440> -<00:00:46.739> one<00:00:46.890> part<00:00:47.069> water<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.460> adjust<00:00:48.239> that

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:48.359 
sugar - one part water and adjust that

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:49.819 
sugar - one part water and adjust that
on<00:00:48.479> the<00:00:48.569> fly<00:00:48.780> which<00:00:48.989> gives<00:00:49.199> us<00:00:49.319> the<00:00:49.440> ability<00:00:49.530> to

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
on the fly which gives us the ability to

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.889 
on the fly which gives us the ability to
to<00:00:50.309> add<00:00:50.460> more<00:00:50.760> sweetness<00:00:51.089> without<00:00:51.359> quite<00:00:51.780> as

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
to add more sweetness without quite as

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.719 
to add more sweetness without quite as
much<00:00:52.019> liquid<00:00:52.289> going<00:00:52.589> in<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.769> glass<00:00:52.979> but

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
much liquid going in the glass but

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:55.009 
much liquid going in the glass but
there's<00:00:53.879> other<00:00:54.089> ways<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.659> can<00:00:54.839> think

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
there's other ways that we can think

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.779 
there's other ways that we can think
about<00:00:55.139> using<00:00:55.679> the<00:00:55.920> sweeteners<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.579> other

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
about using the sweeteners and other

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.759 
about using the sweeteners and other
sweeteners<00:00:57.389> that<00:00:57.420> we<00:00:57.659> can<00:00:57.809> use<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.530> bring

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
sweeteners that we can use to bring

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.549 
sweeteners that we can use to bring
different<00:00:59.010> flavors<00:00:59.789> or<00:00:59.940> different<00:01:00.239> layers<00:01:00.420> of

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
different flavors or different layers of

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.509 
different flavors or different layers of
complexity<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.799> the<00:01:01.889> cocktails<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.399> we're

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
complexity to the cocktails that we're

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.969 
complexity to the cocktails that we're
making<00:01:02.639> one<00:01:03.389> is<00:01:03.659> agave<00:01:04.260> nectar<00:01:04.290> obviously

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
making one is agave nectar obviously

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.710 
making one is agave nectar obviously
tequila<00:01:05.489> made<00:01:05.700> from<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.940> agave<00:01:06.120> plant<00:01:06.540> so

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
tequila made from the agave plant so

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.029 
tequila made from the agave plant so
when<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:06.930> think<00:01:07.049> about<00:01:07.170> tequila<00:01:07.649> drinks<00:01:07.920> we

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:08.039 
when we think about tequila drinks we

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:09.289 
when we think about tequila drinks we
think<00:01:08.219> about<00:01:08.340> sweetened<00:01:08.880> them<00:01:08.969> with<00:01:09.090> agave

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
think about sweetened them with agave

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.870 
think about sweetened them with agave
nectar<00:01:09.590> because<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.740> brings<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.460> little

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
nectar because it brings that little

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.480 
nectar because it brings that little
extra<00:01:12.270> layer<00:01:12.899> that<00:01:12.960> little<00:01:13.439> extra<00:01:13.680> depth<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
extra layer that little extra depth to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.219 
extra layer that little extra depth to
the<00:01:14.610> cocktail<00:01:15.030> something<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.750> brings<00:01:15.990> some

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the cocktail something that brings some

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.410 
the cocktail something that brings some
of<00:01:16.289> that<00:01:16.439> richness<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.369> flavor<00:01:17.729> from<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
of that richness and flavor from the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.139 
of that richness and flavor from the
agave<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.310> gives<00:01:20.310> us<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.609> sweetness<00:01:20.820> all<00:01:21.060> at

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
agave and gives us that sweetness all at

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.649 
agave and gives us that sweetness all at
the<00:01:21.210> same<00:01:21.359> time

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
the same time

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.840 
the same time
honey's<00:01:22.350> another<00:01:22.619> place<00:01:22.859> that<00:01:22.890> we<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.280> go<00:01:23.399> we

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
honey's another place that we can go we

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.730 
honey's another place that we can go we
can<00:01:24.000> make<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.210> syrup<00:01:24.570> by<00:01:24.780> blending<00:01:25.229> honey<00:01:25.469> with

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
can make a syrup by blending honey with

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.620 
can make a syrup by blending honey with
