version of my language sports car so

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.910 
version of my language sports car so
here<00:00:09.990> it<00:00:10.080> is<00:00:11.210> may<00:00:12.210> look<00:00:12.420> very<00:00:13.320> much<00:00:13.469> similar<00:00:13.769> to

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
here it is may look very much similar to

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.460 
here it is may look very much similar to
the<00:00:14.099> older<00:00:14.429> version<00:00:14.759> but<00:00:15.289> let's<00:00:16.289> turn<00:00:16.440> around

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
the older version but let's turn around

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.700 
the older version but let's turn around
low<00:00:17.430> voice<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> lot<00:00:18.539> different<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.619> a

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
low voice that is a lot different and a

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.340 
low voice that is a lot different and a
lot<00:00:19.830> better<00:00:20.100> looking<00:00:20.779> the<00:00:21.779> back<00:00:22.109> is

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
lot better looking the back is

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:30.109 
lot better looking the back is
completely<00:00:22.470> redone<00:00:26.510> it<00:00:27.510> has<00:00:28.130> a<00:00:29.130> sloped<00:00:29.880> back

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
completely redone it has a sloped back

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.359 
completely redone it has a sloped back
which<00:00:30.750> makes<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.080> look<00:00:31.199> sporty

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
which makes it look sporty

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.299 
which makes it look sporty
in<00:00:32.790> my<00:00:32.910> opinion<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.480> overall<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.559> looks<00:00:34.590> much

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
in my opinion and overall it looks much

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.869 
in my opinion and overall it looks much
better<00:00:35.489> than<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.760> other<00:00:35.880> version<00:00:37.610> as<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.760> can

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
the Lego Lego set pass here which

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.380 
the Lego Lego set pass here which
actually<00:02:01.450> based<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:02.289> frame<00:02:02.710> on<00:02:03.390> enough

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
actually based the frame on enough

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.630 
actually based the frame on enough
customize<00:02:04.869> this<00:02:05.050> a<00:02:05.229> lot<00:02:05.409> actually<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:06.520> make

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
customize this a lot actually to make

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.520 
customize this a lot actually to make
you<00:02:06.759> look<00:02:07.170> similar<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.369> my<00:02:09.369> sports<00:02:09.670> car<00:02:10.530> I'll

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
you look similar to my sports car I'll

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.240 
you look similar to my sports car I'll
probably<00:02:11.769> do<00:02:11.980> another<00:02:12.010> view<00:02:12.489> on<00:02:12.610> this<00:02:12.790> so<00:02:13.180> yeah

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
probably do another view on this so yeah

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.289 
probably do another view on this so yeah
but<00:02:15.250> yeah<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:17.489> think<00:02:18.489> she<00:02:18.640> also<00:02:18.760> changed<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
but yeah I think she also changed the

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.490 
but yeah I think she also changed the
windscreen<00:02:19.750> color<00:02:19.989> I<00:02:20.310> love<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.489> pieces<00:02:22.500> like

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
windscreen color I love the pieces like

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.420 
windscreen color I love the pieces like
the<00:02:24.120> tinted<00:02:25.120> version<00:02:25.480> of<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.019> blue<00:02:27.010> one<00:02:27.190> I

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
the tinted version of the blue one I

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.680 
the tinted version of the blue one I
think<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.820> looks<00:02:27.970> much<00:02:28.150> better<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:31.120> also

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
think it looks much better I also

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.160 
think it looks much better I also
changed<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.799> portion<00:02:33.250> here<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:34.840> give<00:02:35.019> the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
changed this portion here to give the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.280 
changed this portion here to give the
drivers<00:02:35.590> sort<00:02:35.829> of<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:37.500> room<00:02:38.970> before<00:02:40.079> the<00:02:41.079> driver

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
drivers sort of a room before the driver

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.930 
drivers sort of a room before the driver
sitting<00:02:41.650> he<00:02:41.920> was<00:02:42.070> sort<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.310> leaning<00:02:42.910> forward

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
sitting he was sort of leaning forward

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.420 
sitting he was sort of leaning forward
of<00:02:43.299> this<00:02:43.420> now<00:02:43.690> when<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:43.900> can<00:02:44.130> sit<00:02:45.130> straight

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
of this now when you can sit straight
