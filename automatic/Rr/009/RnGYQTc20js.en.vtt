hey everybody its future inventions here
with<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.990> review<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.820> the<00:00:14.820> extreme<00:00:15.420> impact

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
with the review of the extreme impact

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.859 
with the review of the extreme impact
protection<00:00:16.260> case<00:00:16.890> from<00:00:17.369> g-form<00:00:18.270> these<00:00:18.660> are

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
protection case from g-form these are

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.260 
protection case from g-form these are
some<00:00:19.080> really<00:00:19.560> nice-looking<00:00:19.800> cases<00:00:20.699> that

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
some really nice-looking cases that

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.960 
some really nice-looking cases that
offer<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:22.080> lot<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.560> protection<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.550> they're

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
offer a lot of protection and they're

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.269 
offer a lot of protection and they're
just<00:00:24.150> awesome<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:25.080> these<00:00:25.289> cases<00:00:25.590> come<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
just awesome so these cases come in a

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.200 
just awesome so these cases come in a
variety<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.760> colors<00:00:27.240> including<00:00:27.900> yellow<00:00:28.140> black

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
variety of colors including yellow black

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.930 
variety of colors including yellow black
blue<00:00:30.210> green<00:00:31.080> which<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:31.769> one<00:00:32.040> orange

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
blue green which is this one orange

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.030 
blue green which is this one orange
clear<00:00:33.750> pink<00:00:34.790> white<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.090> purple<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.380> there's

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
clear pink white and purple and there's

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.250 
clear pink white and purple and there's
also<00:00:38.219> another<00:00:38.610> style<00:00:39.090> that's<00:00:39.420> kind<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.870> like<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
also another style that's kind of like a

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.950 
also another style that's kind of like a
checkerboard<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.550> has<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> bunch<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.180> boxes<00:00:42.390> and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
checkerboard it has a bunch of boxes and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.630 
checkerboard it has a bunch of boxes and
it's<00:00:43.500> pretty<00:00:43.739> cool<00:00:43.980> as<00:00:44.219> well

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
it's pretty cool as well

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.959 
it's pretty cool as well
so<00:00:45.480> what<00:00:45.690> makes<00:00:45.870> these<00:00:46.170> cases<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.070> special<00:00:47.760> is

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
so what makes these cases so special is

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.260 
so what makes these cases so special is
that<00:00:48.329> they're<00:00:48.870> made<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.610> g-form<00:00:50.610> special

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
that they're made of g-form special

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.410 
that they're made of g-form special
material<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.489> this<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.730> kind<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.180> like

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
material and this is kind of like

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.170 
material and this is kind of like
non-newtonian<00:00:55.320> fluid<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.160> talked<00:00:56.760> about<00:00:56.879> this

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
non-newtonian fluid I talked about this

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.599 
non-newtonian fluid I talked about this
in<00:00:57.449> an<00:00:57.629> earlier<00:00:58.109> video<00:00:58.530> which<00:00:58.890> was<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> review

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
in an earlier video which was a review

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.569 
in an earlier video which was a review
of<00:00:59.820> their<00:01:00.030> portfolio<00:01:00.899> case<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.710> iPad<00:01:02.100> so

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
of their portfolio case for the iPad so

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.030 
of their portfolio case for the iPad so
basically<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.480> material<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.379> soft<00:01:04.710> right

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
basically this material is soft right

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.429 
basically this material is soft right
now<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.489> really<00:01:05.760> flexible<00:01:06.270> but<00:01:07.020> then<00:01:07.049> when

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
now it's really flexible but then when

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.859 
now it's really flexible but then when
something<00:01:07.740> impacts<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.670> or<00:01:08.880> rather<00:01:09.390> when<00:01:09.720> this

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
something impacts it or rather when this

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.469 
something impacts it or rather when this
impacts<00:01:10.500> something<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.460> will<00:01:11.820> momentarily

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
impacts something it will momentarily

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.289 
impacts something it will momentarily
become<00:01:13.110> rigid<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.880> therefore<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.119> will

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
become rigid and therefore it will

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.410 
become rigid and therefore it will
absorb<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.990> shock<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.759> fits<00:01:18.000> into

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
absorb the shock so it just fits into

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.830 
absorb the shock so it just fits into
this<00:01:19.350> kind<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.220> shell<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:20.909> flexible<00:01:21.659> as

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
this kind of shell this is flexible as

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.440 
this kind of shell this is flexible as
well

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.920 

and<00:01:29.770> there<00:01:30.770> it<00:01:30.920> is<00:01:30.950> I<00:01:31.430> do<00:01:31.820> not<00:01:32.180> recommend<00:01:32.720> that

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
and there it is I do not recommend that

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.960 
and there it is I do not recommend that
you<00:01:33.080> take<00:01:33.410> that<00:01:33.590> stuff<00:01:33.920> out<00:01:34.130> that's<00:01:34.700> it<00:01:34.880> a

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
you take that stuff out that's it a

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.630 
you take that stuff out that's it a
little<00:01:35.240> while<00:01:35.390> now<00:01:36.320> I<00:01:36.350> have<00:01:36.710> this<00:01:37.070> phone<00:01:37.370> and

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
little while now I have this phone and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.630 
little while now I have this phone and
to<00:01:38.270> put<00:01:38.510> it<00:01:38.630> in<00:01:38.750> it's<00:01:38.990> very<00:01:39.320> simple<00:01:39.800> you<00:01:39.980> just

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
to put it in it's very simple you just

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.170 
to put it in it's very simple you just
pop<00:01:40.940> it<00:01:40.970> in<00:01:41.270> like<00:01:41.900> so<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:42.760> then<00:01:43.760> you<00:01:43.880> have<00:01:44.030> your

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
pop it in like so and then you have your

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.040 
pop it in like so and then you have your
phone<00:01:44.600> so<00:01:45.530> at<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:46.010> top<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.640> have<00:01:46.670> your<00:01:47.300> sleep

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
phone so at the top you have your sleep

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.930 
phone so at the top you have your sleep
and<00:01:48.260> awake<00:01:48.500> button<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.100> that's<00:01:49.640> pretty

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
and awake button and that's pretty

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.570 
and awake button and that's pretty
tactile<00:01:50.510> sometimes<00:01:51.200> when<00:01:51.590> you<00:01:51.800> push<00:01:52.220> down<00:01:52.250> on

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
tactile sometimes when you push down on

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.790 
tactile sometimes when you push down on
it<00:01:52.850> then<00:01:53.300> it<00:01:53.540> can<00:01:53.780> be<00:01:53.930> a<00:01:53.960> little<00:01:54.200> bit<00:01:54.440> harder<00:01:54.770> to

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
it then it can be a little bit harder to

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.520 
it then it can be a little bit harder to
push<00:01:55.130> but<00:01:56.000> for<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.450> most<00:01:56.600> part<00:01:56.720> it's<00:01:57.110> very

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
push but for the most part it's very

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.170 
push but for the most part it's very
nice<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:57.980> clicky<00:01:58.130> then<00:01:58.610> you<00:01:58.730> have<00:01:58.970> your

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
nice and clicky then you have your

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.260 
nice and clicky then you have your
little<00:01:59.330> microphone<00:01:59.930> hole<00:02:00.230> and<00:02:00.560> your<00:02:01.370> port<00:02:01.760> for

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
little microphone hole and your port for

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.920 
little microphone hole and your port for
the<00:02:02.620> 3.5<00:02:03.620> millimeter<00:02:04.280> audio<00:02:04.790> plug<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.510> on

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
the 3.5 millimeter audio plug and on

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.950 
the 3.5 millimeter audio plug and on
this<00:02:06.620> side<00:02:06.890> you<00:02:07.310> have<00:02:07.340> your<00:02:08.060> vibrate<00:02:08.750> switch

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
this side you have your vibrate switch

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.710 
this side you have your vibrate switch
and<00:02:09.410> that's<00:02:09.920> very<00:02:10.280> accessible<00:02:10.850> you<00:02:11.540> might

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
and that's very accessible you might

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.510 
and that's very accessible you might
have<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:12.020> dig<00:02:12.200> in<00:02:12.410> a<00:02:12.440> little<00:02:12.530> bit<00:02:12.890> but<00:02:13.280> it's

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
have to dig in a little bit but it's

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.960 
have to dig in a little bit but it's
fine

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
fine

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.630 
fine
same<00:02:14.240> story<00:02:14.570> with<00:02:14.990> these<00:02:15.290> volume<00:02:16.130> rockers

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
same story with these volume rockers

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.150 
same story with these volume rockers
they're<00:02:17.210> pretty<00:02:17.480> tactile<00:02:18.110> so<00:02:18.710> at<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.040> bottom

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
they're pretty tactile so at the bottom

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.860 
they're pretty tactile so at the bottom
you'll<00:02:19.640> have<00:02:19.760> some<00:02:20.000> really<00:02:20.210> nice<00:02:20.390> cutouts

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
you'll have some really nice cutouts

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.960 
you'll have some really nice cutouts
that<00:02:21.050> are<00:02:21.320> very<00:02:21.710> well<00:02:22.010> aligned<00:02:22.400> for<00:02:22.820> the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
that are very well aligned for the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.000 
that are very well aligned for the
speaker<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.600> microphone<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:24.620> also<00:02:24.770> have

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
speaker and microphone and you also have

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.370 
speaker and microphone and you also have
a<00:02:25.070> cutout<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.820> really<00:02:26.390> complements<00:02:26.990> the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
a cutout that really complements the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.680 
a cutout that really complements the
charging<00:02:27.980> cable<00:02:28.190> for<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.820> iPhone<00:02:29.180> some

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
charging cable for the iPhone some

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.140 
charging cable for the iPhone some
protection<00:02:30.260> on<00:02:30.350> side<00:02:30.800> on<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.430> back<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:31.970> do

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
protection on side on the back you do

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.180 
protection on side on the back you do
have<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.390> very<00:02:32.780> large<00:02:33.140> camera<00:02:33.709> cutout<00:02:34.160> that

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
have a very large camera cutout that

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.580 
have a very large camera cutout that
works<00:02:34.610> very<00:02:34.880> well<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:35.540> never<00:02:35.959> gets<00:02:36.230> in<00:02:36.500> the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
works very well and it never gets in the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.830 
works very well and it never gets in the
way<00:02:36.709> of<00:02:36.890> photos<00:02:37.310> then<00:02:37.730> finally<00:02:38.300> on<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.570> front

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
way of photos then finally on the front

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.930 
way of photos then finally on the front
pretty<00:02:39.080> much<00:02:39.350> everything<00:02:40.130> is<00:02:40.280> cut<00:02:40.550> out<00:02:40.700> and

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
pretty much everything is cut out and

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.270 
pretty much everything is cut out and
you<00:02:41.270> do<00:02:41.420> have<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.630> little<00:02:41.990> lip<00:02:42.260> so<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:42.770> can<00:02:43.010> lay

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
you do have a little lip so you can lay

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.420 
you do have a little lip so you can lay
it<00:02:43.430> safely<00:02:43.850> on<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.209> table<00:02:45.200> so<00:02:45.920> let's<00:02:46.130> take<00:02:46.400> a

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
it safely on a table so let's take a

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.400 
it safely on a table so let's take a
look<00:02:46.670> at<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.150> protection<00:02:47.540> all<00:02:47.989> around<00:02:48.020> the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
look at the protection all around the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.830 
look at the protection all around the
case<00:02:48.620> at<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.220> top<00:02:49.489> you<00:02:49.940> don't<00:02:50.150> have<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.420> lot<00:02:50.810> of

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
case at the top you don't have a lot of

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.560 
case at the top you don't have a lot of
protection<00:02:51.200> only<00:02:52.100> what's<00:02:52.430> on<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.880> side<00:02:53.150> here

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
protection only what's on the side here

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.720 
protection only what's on the side here
and<00:02:53.720> here<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.170> that<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:54.560> don't<00:02:54.830> like<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.489> think

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
and here and that I don't like I think

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.850 
and here and that I don't like I think
there<00:02:55.880> could<00:02:56.090> be<00:02:56.150> something<00:02:56.660> up<00:02:57.050> here<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:57.709> it's

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
there could be something up here so it's

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.650 
there could be something up here so it's
pretty<00:02:58.010> open<00:02:58.280> at<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.730> top<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.209> same<00:02:59.630> thing

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
pretty open at the top and same thing

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.900 
pretty open at the top and same thing
for<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.080> bottom<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.830> just<00:03:00.860> have<00:03:01.310> these<00:03:01.550> two

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
for the bottom you just have these two

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.360 
for the bottom you just have these two
little<00:03:02.180> corner<00:03:02.810> parts<00:03:03.170> I<00:03:03.410> think<00:03:03.800> much<00:03:04.340> more

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
little corner parts I think much more

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.060 
little corner parts I think much more
could<00:03:04.880> have<00:03:05.000> been<00:03:05.030> done<00:03:05.260> here<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:06.290> here<00:03:06.890> maybe

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
could have been done here and here maybe

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.000 
could have been done here and here maybe
a<00:03:07.250> little<00:03:07.489> cover<00:03:07.910> for<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.750> dock<00:03:09.050> adapter<00:03:09.680> but

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
a little cover for the dock adapter but

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.740 
a little cover for the dock adapter but
if<00:03:10.220> you're<00:03:10.370> going<00:03:10.550> to<00:03:10.730> drop<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.000> on<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:11.390> bottom

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
if you're going to drop it on the bottom

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.660 
if you're going to drop it on the bottom
or<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:11.959> top<00:03:12.080> then<00:03:12.620> you're<00:03:13.040> not<00:03:13.160> gonna<00:03:13.370> have

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
or the top then you're not gonna have

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.180 
or the top then you're not gonna have
that<00:03:13.700> much<00:03:14.270> protection<00:03:14.750> also<00:03:15.290> on<00:03:15.770> the<00:03:15.920> front

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
that much protection also on the front

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.490 
that much protection also on the front
that's<00:03:16.700> something<00:03:17.300> that<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.750> didn't<00:03:18.050> like<00:03:18.230> I

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
that's something that I didn't like I

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.960 
that's something that I didn't like I
think<00:03:18.709> there<00:03:18.830> could<00:03:19.040> be<00:03:19.070> some<00:03:19.430> protection

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
think there could be some protection

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.330 
think there could be some protection
here<00:03:20.300> and<00:03:20.450> here<00:03:21.110> only<00:03:21.500> because<00:03:21.800> if<00:03:21.980> you<00:03:22.130> drop

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
here and here only because if you drop

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.729 
here and here only because if you drop
it<00:03:22.400> face<00:03:22.760> down<00:03:23.090> then<00:03:23.540> it's<00:03:23.870> not<00:03:24.080> going<00:03:24.350> to<00:03:24.560> end

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
it face down then it's not going to end

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.979 
it face down then it's not going to end
very<00:03:24.920> well<00:03:25.220> but<00:03:25.670> overall<00:03:26.060> you're<00:03:26.540> mostly

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
very well but overall you're mostly

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.360 
very well but overall you're mostly
protected<00:03:27.620> on<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:27.739> sides<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:29.080> the<00:03:30.080> back<00:03:30.370> so

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
protected on the sides and the back so

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.370 
protected on the sides and the back so
one<00:03:31.520> thing<00:03:31.730> that<00:03:31.760> I<00:03:31.910> love<00:03:32.239> about<00:03:32.270> this<00:03:32.750> case<00:03:33.050> is

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
one thing that I love about this case is

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.420 
one thing that I love about this case is
the<00:03:33.890> grip<00:03:34.310> it<00:03:34.640> just<00:03:35.360> feels<00:03:35.900> so<00:03:36.440> nice<00:03:36.769> with<00:03:37.220> this
