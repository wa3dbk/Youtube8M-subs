with<00:01:31.819> it<00:01:31.999> now<00:01:32.659> Blackmagic<00:01:33.560> decided<00:01:33.889> to<00:01:33.979> use

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
with it now Blackmagic decided to use

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.099 
with it now Blackmagic decided to use
the<00:01:34.959> HFS+<00:01:35.990> file<00:01:36.590> format<00:01:37.099> to<00:01:37.659> work<00:01:38.659> with<00:01:38.899> this

that the SSD light will illuminate green

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.330 
that the SSD light will illuminate green
then<00:02:06.619> we<00:02:06.709> can<00:02:06.829> hook<00:02:06.950> up<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.369> HDMI<00:02:07.960> cable<00:02:08.960> to<00:02:09.110> it

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
then we can hook up the HDMI cable to it

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
then we can hook up the HDMI cable to it
the<00:02:10.340> other<00:02:10.490> end<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:10.880> camera

the other end to the camera

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.510 
the other end to the camera
now<00:02:14.360> I<00:02:14.420> forgetting<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:15.310> compatible<00:02:16.310> video

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
now I forgetting a compatible video

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.390 
now I forgetting a compatible video
signal<00:02:17.420> from<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.690> camera<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.680> video<00:02:19.160> light

so<00:02:21.860> one<00:02:22.040> little<00:02:22.160> quirk<00:02:22.520> with<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.760> fs100<00:02:23.180> when

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
so one little quirk with the fs100 when

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.910 
so one little quirk with the fs100 when
you're<00:02:23.870> connected<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.440> hyper<00:02:24.680> deck
