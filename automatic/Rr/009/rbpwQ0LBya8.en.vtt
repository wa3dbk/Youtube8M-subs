00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.170
 hello welcome to another video more of the 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.580
 recycle planet 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.890
 you who imagine they think that 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.840
 I'm going to teach you today because 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.880
 I will teach how to make a lamp with 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.400
 a glass bottle is not so difficult 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.830
 as it seems but if we need help 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.600
 If you want to see how we do it, do not leave 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.130
 to watch those videos 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.160
 to cut in a super way 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.500
 different to the bottle we need 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.360
 Stamen a wire that measures the width of 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.810
 the bottle 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.310
 sandpaper for glass 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.950
 and ethyl alcohol 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.180
 a glass bottle 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.180
 and fire 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.820
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.800
 roll the yarn to the wire you go to 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.960
 choose what thickness you want and what you want 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.120
 thinner if you want it thicker that 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.600
 it does not matter if it works when cutting the 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.600
 bottle 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.890
 something like that has to be before 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.049
 prepare the bottle to cut it 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.450
 ready a container with cold water where 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.759
 fit your bottle 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.080
 place the wire at the height where 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.660
 you want to cut it and tie it 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.940
 then very carefully wet all the 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.100
 stain with ethyl alcohol if you're 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.620
 minor asks for help from an adult 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.110
 for the next steps 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.280
 fire the yarn and keep the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.280
 lying down bottle 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.080
 if you want that was a bit the bottle 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.780
 but in the same position after 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.040
 introduce the bottle in cold water and 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.290
 your bottle will be cut automatically 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.080
 I had already made a video of this but 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.140
 I decided to repeat it because the bottle is a 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.539
 slightly thicker and a little bigger 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.830
 after the league passed by where 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.830
 cut and ready 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.720
 to hang it we need 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.940
 a drill 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.810
 a hammer 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.170
 so that you 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.030
 and a screw hook for this step asks 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.000
 help from an adult or someone who knows 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.489
 of the subject pierced the chest about five 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.770
 centimeters of depth we introduce 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.989
 the package with the help of a hammer to 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.989
 then insert the hook screw 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.980
 to form the lamp we need 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.480
 the necessary light connection and the 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.480
 glass bottle cut 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.080
 the cable is already in the bottle 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.840
 with all this that the oaf will help 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.000
 that does not pass from there the cable you pass 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.159
 by the hook screw and you ask for help 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.799
 to connect with someone who knows about 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:12.640
 theme and I can tell you step by step 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.800
 how can you connect it 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.709
 I'm not the world's expert doing 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.709
 this but I asked for help and it was very easy 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.020
 and that's how it is now, we just put a little 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.930
 Do not get hot so you do not 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:31.610
 crash the glass and this is how you look 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.610
 bottle lamp 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.610
 encourage yourself to make the lamp and truth that 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.220
 it's simpler than it seems 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.140
 I swear apart it gives an incredible touch in your 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.599
 space or where you go to 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.909
 put no no no no no grand no 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.909
 Me personally fascinated me 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.019
 what wave do you dare to call for 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.810
 that the divine chord since it 's like the 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.849
 lighting as it gives that cozy look 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.150
 the environmental part in such a way the 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.010
 space that is wonderful if you want 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.750
 more ideas about recycling as they are 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.879
 Do not forget you nibble on the red button 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.130
 whoever subscribes that this little horse 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.720
 like to share this video with everyone 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.699
 your friends so they can also do 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.190
 some lamps with bottles and that do 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.380
 of your environment something very cool right now 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.229
 that I think about this place to the ship of 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.389
 this perfect powerful lamp and also 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.479
 can be person reading zone 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:36.289
 thought and relaxation I do not know will be a 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.289
 very good area 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.700
 also social networks that all the 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.770
 I leave at the information house and they 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.290
 They can help you to know that I am 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.990
 they make other videos that follow the next 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.990
 video that will give clues for equal costs 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.980
 and this is today but it is the state 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.980
 who remembers 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.980
 goodbye
