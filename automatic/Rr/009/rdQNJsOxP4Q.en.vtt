00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
next thing it's important but we come up

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.240 
next thing it's important but we come up
with<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.780> ball<00:03:40.960> it's<00:03:41.470> a<00:03:41.560> lot<00:03:41.710> easier<00:03:41.740> for<00:03:42.100> us

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
with the ball it's a lot easier for us

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.430 
with the ball it's a lot easier for us
to<00:03:42.280> move<00:03:42.520> up<00:03:42.790> that<00:03:43.120> it<00:03:43.270> is<00:03:43.360> too<00:03:43.510> moved<00:03:43.690> out<00:03:43.960> so

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
to move up that it is too moved out so

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.110 
to move up that it is too moved out so
we<00:03:44.530> must<00:03:44.710> stay<00:03:45.010> low<00:03:45.250> until<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.730> ballers<00:03:46.090> pitch
