while<00:01:02.960> my<00:01:05.979> black<00:01:06.979> soldier<00:01:07.250> fly<00:01:07.369> bands<00:01:07.610> are

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
while my black soldier fly bands are

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.170 
while my black soldier fly bands are
full<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:08.450> so<00:01:09.200> these<00:01:09.409> ones<00:01:09.650> what<00:01:10.009> I<00:01:10.040> do<00:01:10.159> is<00:01:11.060> I

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
full and so these ones what I do is I

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.400 
full and so these ones what I do is I
feed<00:01:11.390> them<00:01:11.480> every<00:01:11.600> day<00:01:11.720> and<00:01:11.990> a<00:01:14.200> little<00:01:15.200> bit<00:01:15.320> of

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
feed them every day and a little bit of

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.520 
feed them every day and a little bit of
a<00:01:15.500> scoop<00:01:16.480> and<00:01:17.480> then<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:20.840> then<00:01:21.110> I<00:01:21.170> just<00:01:21.320> take<00:01:21.470> a

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
a scoop and then and then I just take a

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.600 
a scoop and then and then I just take a
scoop<00:01:21.830> out<00:01:22.010> of<00:01:22.040> here<00:01:24.010> it's<00:01:25.010> a<00:01:25.130> feed<00:01:25.370> to<00:01:25.490> the

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
scoop out of here it's a feed to the

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.370 
scoop out of here it's a feed to the
chickens<00:01:28.630> which<00:01:29.630> I've<00:01:29.780> already<00:01:29.930> done<00:01:30.050> today

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
chickens which I've already done today

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:38.649 
chickens which I've already done today
they<00:01:30.650> I<00:01:31.040> kind<00:01:31.490> of<00:01:31.580> go<00:01:31.670> crazy<00:01:31.700> with<00:01:32.180> that

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.200 

that<00:01:39.659> would<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.140> good<00:01:40.369> for<00:01:41.369> many<00:01:41.999> many

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
that would be good for many many

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.910 
that would be good for many many
chickens<00:01:47.810> like<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.869> say<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.109> is<00:01:49.170> spent<00:01:49.590> barley

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
chickens like I say this is spent barley

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.260 
chickens like I say this is spent barley
from<00:01:50.039> brewery<00:01:51.109> so<00:01:52.109> it's<00:01:52.259> easy<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.469> get<00:01:53.270> and

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
from brewery so it's easy to get and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.510 
from brewery so it's easy to get and
this<00:01:54.719> time<00:01:54.959> of<00:01:55.109> year<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.289> mean<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.619> gives<00:01:56.219> up<00:01:56.340> 80

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
this time of year I mean it gives up 80

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.099 
this time of year I mean it gives up 80
degrees<00:01:56.819> during<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.090> day<00:01:57.179> these<00:01:57.509> barrels<00:01:57.899> get

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
degrees during the day these barrels get

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:08.900 
degrees during the day these barrels get
way<00:01:58.560> hotter<00:01:58.950> than<00:01:59.130> that<00:02:07.579> anyway<00:02:08.579> that's<00:02:08.789> an

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
way hotter than that anyway that's an

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.110 
way hotter than that anyway that's an
update<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.239> my<00:02:09.509> larvae<00:02:09.890> or<00:02:10.890> some<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.610> my<00:02:11.730> larvae

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
update on my larvae or some of my larvae

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.660 
update on my larvae or some of my larvae
like<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.110> said<00:02:13.620> some<00:02:13.829> of<00:02:13.890> my<00:02:14.010> other<00:02:14.160> videos<00:02:14.190> I've

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.009 
like I said some of my other videos I've
got<00:02:14.819> plenty<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.120> larvae<00:02:15.390> out<00:02:15.420> in<00:02:15.660> their<00:02:15.810> rows

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019

and in my larva bins and my larva bins

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.850 
and in my larva bins and my larva bins
which<00:02:22.470> I'll<00:02:22.650> show<00:02:23.519> another<00:02:23.549> video<00:02:24.060> later
