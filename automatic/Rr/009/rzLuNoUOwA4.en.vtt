the sh shs and these BB tickets we're
not<00:01:04.920> really<00:01:05.189> sure<00:01:05.460> what<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.479> BB<00:01:06.750> tickets<00:01:07.260> are

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
not really sure what the BB tickets are

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.660 
not really sure what the BB tickets are
yet<00:01:08.689> but<00:01:09.689> there's<00:01:10.350> an<00:01:10.650> idea<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.369> has<00:01:11.490> to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
yet but there's an idea that it has to

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.640 
yet but there's an idea that it has to
do<00:01:11.790> something<00:01:12.060> with<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.630> baseband<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.470> that

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
do something with the baseband so that

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.920 
do something with the baseband so that
you<00:01:13.770> could<00:01:13.950> unlock<00:01:14.070> your<00:01:14.520> iphones<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.420> be<00:01:15.659> used

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
you could unlock your iphones to be used

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.880 
you could unlock your iphones to be used
on<00:01:16.229> different<00:01:16.799> carriers<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.560> it's<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.710> good

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
on different carriers so it's a good

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.660 
on different carriers so it's a good
idea<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.310> save<00:01:21.119> these<00:01:21.479> right<00:01:22.049> now<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.549> if

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
idea to save these right now so that if

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.510 
idea to save these right now so that if
there<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.500> some<00:01:25.500> kind<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.799> hack<00:01:25.979> later<00:01:26.310> on

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
there is a some kind of hack later on

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.100 
there is a some kind of hack later on
down<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.729> line<00:01:26.880> you'll<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.509> these<00:01:27.720> BB
