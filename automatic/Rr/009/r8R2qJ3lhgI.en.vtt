00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
a spur gear and pinion you can see that

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.330 
a spur gear and pinion you can see that
it's<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.930> little<00:02:29.110> tougher<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.620> get<00:02:29.740> to<00:02:29.980> but

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
it's a little tougher to get to but

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.980 
it's a little tougher to get to but
without<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.060> gear<00:02:31.210> cover<00:02:31.450> on<00:02:31.660> there<00:02:31.840> you

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
without the gear cover on there you

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.210 
without the gear cover on there you
should<00:02:32.050> be<00:02:32.230> able<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.590> reach<00:02:32.860> it

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
should be able to reach it

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.770 
should be able to reach it
once<00:02:33.520> you<00:02:33.640> pull<00:02:33.820> out<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:34.090> grub<00:02:34.300> screw<00:02:34.570> then

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
once you pull out the grub screw then

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.060 
once you pull out the grub screw then
you<00:02:34.870> can<00:02:34.990> go<00:02:35.110> ahead<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.470> pull<00:02:35.590> off<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.860> top<00:02:36.040> of

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
you can go ahead and pull off the top of

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.020 
you can go ahead and pull off the top of
the<00:02:36.250> driveshaft

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
painting the rims black the reason why I

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.550 
painting the rims black the reason why I
did<00:04:10.000> that<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.330> first<00:04:10.360> time<00:04:10.660> was<00:04:11.050> because<00:04:11.410> the

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
did that the first time was because the

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.290 
did that the first time was because the
back<00:04:11.739> ones<00:04:12.040> were<00:04:12.190> chrome<00:04:12.489> and<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:12.850> front<00:04:13.120> ones

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
back ones were chrome and the front ones

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.120 
back ones were chrome and the front ones
were<00:04:13.480> dark<00:04:13.750> chrome<00:04:13.989> and<00:04:14.320> I<00:04:14.680> thought<00:04:14.860> looked

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
were dark chrome and I thought looked

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.830 
were dark chrome and I thought looked
goofy<00:04:15.459> so<00:04:15.670> I<00:04:15.700> painted<00:04:16.000> on<00:04:16.209> black<00:04:16.480> so<00:04:16.720> they

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
goofy so I painted on black so they

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.780 
goofy so I painted on black so they
would<00:04:16.959> match<00:04:17.200> but<00:04:17.890> now<00:04:18.010> I<00:04:18.040> don't<00:04:18.190> have<00:04:18.459> to<00:04:18.640> do

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
would match but now I don't have to do

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.460 
would match but now I don't have to do
that<00:04:18.970> and<00:04:19.299> remember<00:04:19.959> if<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.169> don't<00:04:20.350> know
