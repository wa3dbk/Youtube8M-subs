something<00:04:18.930> Matt<00:04:19.260> because<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.739> shimmer<00:04:20.010> just

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
something Matt because the shimmer just

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.770 
something Matt because the shimmer just
gives<00:04:20.459> it<00:04:20.549> away<00:04:20.669> that<00:04:21.000> it's<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.209> failure<00:04:21.450> that

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
it's a blush it's not natural coloring
