the parrot cichlids they always look
small<00:01:27.729> because<00:01:28.030> they're<00:01:28.270> always<00:01:28.390> going<00:01:28.600> to

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
small because they're always going to

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.069 
small because they're always going to
become<00:01:29.020> completely<00:01:29.380> not<00:01:29.710> this<00:01:29.920> but<00:01:30.280> do

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079

another one we got them the yellow one
looks<00:01:35.469> smaller<00:01:35.829> than<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.219> red<00:01:36.399> one<00:01:36.549> and<00:01:36.939> now

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.990 
it's vice versa the rope fish is
probably<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.570> most<00:01:41.460> active<00:01:42.460> and<00:01:42.549> well<00:01:42.820> he's

probably the most active and well he's

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.169 
probably the most active and well he's
not<00:01:43.119> a<00:01:43.180> real<00:01:43.420> fish<00:01:43.630> there<00:01:43.840> we<00:01:44.020> go<00:01:44.200> good<00:01:44.710> run<00:01:45.179> the

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
not a real fish there we go good run the

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:56.919 
not a real fish there we go good run the
most<00:01:46.359> active<00:01:46.810> of<00:01:46.929> them<00:01:47.109> all

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.719 

air<00:01:57.929> tubes<00:01:58.789> and<00:01:59.789> the<00:01:59.969> filter<00:02:00.920> that<00:02:01.920> we<00:02:02.159> rarely

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
air tubes and the filter that we rarely

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:11.360 
air tubes and the filter that we rarely
ever<00:02:03.090> use<00:02:09.380> yeah

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
ever use yeah
