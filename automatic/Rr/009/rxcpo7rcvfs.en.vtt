00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.099
 venezia giulia we will prepare the fridge 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.590
 a cheese omelette is a recipe 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.680
 very simple in the region there are 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.420
 several variants the best known is 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.010
 the one with the addition of potatoes 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.820
 the ingredients for this recipe 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.640
 always for 4 people are 300 g of 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.579
 cheese minister we have cheese 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.620
 seasoned grated cheese one 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:41.760
 a knob of butter, an onion, salt and pepper 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.140
 I prepare the onion then the hair and the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:53.070
 I will cut into very thin slices 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:58.489
 so in this way then we find a 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:10.140
 half vertically and then slice 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:14.700
 finely horizontally a little bit of 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.189
 salt so the onion will blow out the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.820
 own humidity and therefore will become more 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.820
 soft 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.380

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.590

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:40.660
 grate the cheese this point 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:47.580
 we begin to arrange the two cheeses in 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:50.170
 this is also grated cheese 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.890
 and we practically suspect that yes 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.810
 melt and become a nice omelette 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.800
 then it should have formed the crust 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:04.450
 let's try turning it over here now 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.880
 let's brown on the opposite side well 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.720
 ready I put out the fire 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.500
 so now we pour it on a card 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.330
 absorbent so that it loses little bit 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.440
 of fat because the cheese and leaves 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.440

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.540
