00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:15.240
 to the new hp test project the hp pavilion 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:18.630
 11 x360 you do not just see it then 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.150
 hp product hidden but also to 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.380
 beats audio chip integrates the better 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.410
 Sound should bring the whole in one 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:34.350
 We pack very stable cardboard 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:38.329
 put to the masters first we see 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.980
 Here is a few setup instructions for us 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.129
 the entry with the device something 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.539
 to facilitate 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:52.890
 the side then we look at her 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:57.110
 the side is the clear edge 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.110
 We'll put that aside for the first time 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:13.070
 and hp pavilion right with one 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.070

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:18.840
 260 smooth surface and for time too 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:36.460
 in the notebooks of hp is now only 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:40.780
 times no connections on the side view 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:43.800
 We once a little led lienz the 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:48.190
 action of the hard disk on indicates 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:54.700

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:59.590

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:04.900
 Ethernet connection and connection for 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:08.530
 the mains or charging cable below are then 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:15.340
 no additional connections and here 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:20.380
 let's see the power button one more time 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.570

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:29.850
 Connection for a headphone headset 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:36.670

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:40.269
 We just found that gentleman with 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:43.709
 Windows 8 is equipped for relaxation 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.709
 notes on the charge 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.750

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.000
 go out 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:04:09.330
 ok, we turn the whole thing around and 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:14.760
 open the hp pavilion we see here 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:18.329
 a reflective surface and not the 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:22.290
 it is a reflection how to look like 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:28.139
 Take a little time this time 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:33.770

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:38.960

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.960
 that an intel chip was installed here 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.770

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:54.150
 how much he optics and a page and 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:05:01.250

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.910
 attack 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:17.060

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:21.479
