00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.370 
I would take a deep breath realizing
that<00:01:41.730> my<00:01:41.910> social<00:01:42.300> cachet<00:01:42.480> was<00:01:42.900> about<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.230> land

squarely<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.280> dumper<00:01:44.700> again<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.740> take<00:01:46.740> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
squarely in the dumper again I take a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.770 
squarely in the dumper again I take a
deep<00:01:47.010> breath<00:01:47.160> in<00:01:47.370> for<00:01:47.520> one<00:01:47.700> moment<00:01:47.940> I<00:01:48.330> would

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
deep breath in for one moment I would

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.660 
deep breath in for one moment I would
think<00:01:48.990> about<00:01:49.170> saying<00:01:49.880> whale<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:56.100> migration

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
think about saying whale the migration

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.500 
think about saying whale the migration
of<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.850> Arctic<00:01:57.390> minke<00:01:57.810> whale<00:01:59.210> do<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.240> great

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
of the Arctic minke whale do a great

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.480 
of the Arctic minke whale do a great
deal<00:02:00.660> of<00:02:00.840> research<00:02:01.170> I'm<00:02:01.890> very<00:02:02.640> intelligent

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
deal of research I'm very intelligent

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.400 
deal of research I'm very intelligent
but<00:02:05.490> I'm<00:02:05.640> basically<00:02:06.300> an<00:02:06.480> honest<00:02:06.750> person<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.380> I

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
but I'm basically an honest person so I

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.250 
but I'm basically an honest person so I
would<00:02:07.800> have<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.759> tell<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.060> truth<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.110> would

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
would have to tell the truth and I would

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.420 
would have to tell the truth and I would
take<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> deep<00:02:10.679> breath<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.100> it<00:02:11.190> would<00:02:11.280> look

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
take a deep breath and it would look

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.160 
take a deep breath and it would look
them<00:02:11.550> all<00:02:11.670> squarely<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.390> eye<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.020> would

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
them all squarely in the eye and I would

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.910 
them all squarely in the eye and I would
say<00:02:13.459> knitting<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:15.380> write<00:02:16.380> books<00:02:16.680> about

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.550 

because<00:02:27.390> they<00:02:27.720> thought<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:27.990> was<00:02:28.290> interesting
