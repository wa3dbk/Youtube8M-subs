00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.670 

our<00:00:17.580> technique<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.210> very<00:00:18.540> important<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.529> when

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
our technique is very important so when

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.830 
our technique is very important so when
you<00:00:19.770> set<00:00:20.040> up<00:00:20.070> gotta<00:00:20.939> make<00:00:21.150> sure<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.600> put

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
you set up gotta make sure you put

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.120 
you set up gotta make sure you put
yourself<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.290> best<00:00:22.470> possible<00:00:22.800> position

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
yourself in the best possible position

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.510 
yourself in the best possible position
to<00:00:23.670> get<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.300> way<00:00:24.480> not<00:00:25.140> once<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:25.830> many<00:00:26.160> times

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
to get that way not once but many times

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.819 
to get that way not once but many times
you<00:00:26.820> can<00:00:26.940> get<00:00:27.030> it<00:00:27.180> effectively

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:29.829 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:59.990 

so<00:00:30.829> here<00:00:30.980> we<00:00:31.070> go

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.299 

that's<00:01:01.000> what<00:01:01.210> you<00:01:01.330> call<00:01:01.510> a<00:01:01.540> set<00:01:01.930> if<00:01:02.920> you're<00:01:03.040> not

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
that's what you call a set if you're not

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.740 
that's what you call a set if you're not
dizzy<00:01:03.670> it's<00:01:04.059> not<00:01:04.449> heavy<00:01:04.690> enough

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.800 

the<00:01:08.260> key<00:01:08.530> to<00:01:08.680> getting<00:01:08.800> big<00:01:09.130> you<00:01:09.970> have<00:01:10.000> to<00:01:10.240> force

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
the key to getting big you have to force

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.460 
the key to getting big you have to force
yourself<00:01:11.100> or<00:01:12.100> surprises<00:01:12.820> you<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.300> gain<00:01:14.140> muscle

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
yourself or surprises you to gain muscle

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.950 
yourself or surprises you to gain muscle
mass<00:01:14.800> it<00:01:15.580> has<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:16.000> have<00:01:16.090> a<00:01:16.150> reason<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.630> do<00:01:16.840> it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
mass it has to have a reason to do it

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.240 
mass it has to have a reason to do it
otherwise<00:01:17.290> it's<00:01:17.500> not<00:01:17.620> going<00:01:17.770> to<00:01:17.860> do<00:01:17.920> you<00:01:18.100> gotta

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
otherwise it's not going to do you gotta

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.130 
otherwise it's not going to do you gotta
have<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.460> give<00:01:18.610> it<00:01:18.730> the<00:01:18.820> club<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.750> correct

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
have to give it the club the correct

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.200 
have to give it the club the correct
amount<00:01:20.590> of<00:01:20.710> stimulus<00:01:21.190> that<00:01:21.400> means<00:01:21.880> heavy

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
amount of stimulus that means heavy

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.070 
amount of stimulus that means heavy

you in heaven so what we do is I'm gonna
increase<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.800> poundage<00:01:30.220> to<00:01:30.250> 400<00:01:31.080> I'm<00:01:32.080> not

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
increase the poundage to 400 I'm not

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.750 
increase the poundage to 400 I'm not
gonna<00:01:32.440> go<00:01:32.590> fast<00:01:32.830> with<00:01:33.100> it<00:01:33.190> I'm<00:01:33.370> gonna<00:01:33.520> doing

gonna go fast with it I'm gonna doing
negative<00:01:33.910> breakdown<00:01:34.510> my<00:01:34.630> fibers<00:01:35.050> I'll<00:01:35.530> come

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
negative breakdown my fibers I'll come

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.800 
negative breakdown my fibers I'll come
up<00:01:36.040> and<00:01:36.160> I'll<00:01:36.310> show<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.670> pump<00:01:42.510> my<00:01:43.510> rule<00:01:43.780> of

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
up and I'll show you the pump my rule of

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.100 
up and I'll show you the pump my rule of
thumb<00:01:43.900> and<00:01:44.740> you<00:01:44.830> can<00:01:44.980> apply<00:01:45.250> this<00:01:45.310> if<00:01:45.610> you<00:01:45.700> like

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
thumb and you can apply this if you like

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.020 
thumb and you can apply this if you like
if<00:01:47.110> you<00:01:47.380> can<00:01:47.650> get<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.100> weight<00:01:48.340> whatever<00:01:48.730> say

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
if you can get the weight whatever say

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.780 
if you can get the weight whatever say
it's<00:01:49.150> to<00:01:49.300> place<00:01:49.510> you<00:01:49.840> can<00:01:49.960> get<00:01:50.110> it<00:01:50.260> for<00:01:50.350> 10<00:01:50.790> my

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
it's to place you can get it for 10 my

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.910 
it's to place you can get it for 10 my
theory<00:01:52.240> which<00:01:52.720> holds<00:01:52.900> true<00:01:53.290> most<00:01:53.500> of<00:01:53.620> the<00:01:53.710> time

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
theory which holds true most of the time

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.160 
theory which holds true most of the time
then<00:01:54.760> she'd<00:01:55.060> be<00:01:55.180> able<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.360> add<00:01:55.510> one<00:01:55.810> more<00:01:55.840> play

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
then she'd be able to add one more play

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.420 
then she'd be able to add one more play
can<00:01:56.350> go<00:01:56.470> for<00:01:56.680> one<00:01:56.860> rep<00:01:57.040> max<00:01:57.300> so<00:01:58.300> I<00:01:59.430> normally

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
can go for one rep max so I normally

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.250 
can go for one rep max so I normally
don't<00:02:00.610> know<00:02:00.820> this<00:02:01.030> heavy<00:02:01.300> when<00:02:01.840> I'm<00:02:01.930> generated

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
don't know this heavy when I'm generated

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.530 
don't know this heavy when I'm generated
especially<00:02:02.860> being<00:02:03.010> to<00:02:03.160> a<00:02:03.190> half<00:02:03.370> weeks<00:02:03.550> out<00:02:03.760> but

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
especially being to a half weeks out but

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.820 
especially being to a half weeks out but
I'm<00:02:04.630> gonna<00:02:04.750> test<00:02:05.020> that<00:02:05.200> theory<00:02:05.410> so<00:02:05.620> you<00:02:05.710> can

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
I'm gonna test that theory so you can

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.980 
I'm gonna test that theory so you can
see<00:02:05.950> what<00:02:06.040> I'm<00:02:06.130> talking<00:02:06.370> about

lot of the top notch about bodybuilders

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.530 
lot of the top notch about bodybuilders
to<00:02:34.130> incorporate<00:02:34.670> powerlifting<00:02:35.180> in<00:02:35.300> there<00:02:35.390> do

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
to incorporate powerlifting in there do

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:50.250 
to incorporate powerlifting in there do
the<00:02:35.660> same<00:02:35.900> thing<00:02:36.110> so<00:02:36.680> let's<00:02:36.710> go

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:58.960 

what<00:02:51.260> G

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.240 

do<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.120> shoot<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:02.640> over<00:03:02.790> -<00:03:03.200> but<00:03:04.200> once<00:03:04.950> pretty

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
do it shoot it over - but once pretty

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:14.920 
do it shoot it over - but once pretty
good

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.970 

so<00:03:17.079> just<00:03:18.079> remember<00:03:18.530> when<00:03:18.680> you're<00:03:18.769> lifting

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
so just remember when you're lifting

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.899 
so just remember when you're lifting
lips<00:03:19.459> smart<00:03:19.959> lift<00:03:20.959> heavy<00:03:21.409> and<00:03:22.099> your<00:03:22.370> body<00:03:22.670> will

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:22.909 
lips smart lift heavy and your body will

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.750 
lips smart lift heavy and your body will
gain<00:03:23.209> mass<00:03:23.680> provided<00:03:24.680> you<00:03:24.799> eat<00:03:25.010> right<00:03:25.220> the

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
gain mass provided you eat right the

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.990 
gain mass provided you eat right the
nutrition<00:03:26.209> support<00:03:27.220> that's<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.459> part<00:03:28.849> of<00:03:28.939> the

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
nutrition support that's a part of the
