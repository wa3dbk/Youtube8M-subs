a couple of new projects that we just
started<00:00:05.130> working<00:00:05.400> on<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:06.720> first<00:00:06.990> one<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.529> the

started working on the first one is the

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.999 
started working on the first one is the
bamboo<00:00:10.580> it's<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.639> really<00:00:12.000> cool<00:00:12.780> snake<00:00:13.019> he's<00:00:13.740> got

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
bamboo it's a really cool snake he's got

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.129 
bamboo it's a really cool snake he's got
a<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.490> little<00:00:14.880> bit<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.089> stuck<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.570> skin<00:00:15.870> on<00:00:15.990> his

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
a a little bit of stuck to skin on his

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.170 
a a little bit of stuck to skin on his
head<00:00:16.500> which<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.310> pretty<00:00:17.550> common<00:00:17.789> with<00:00:17.970> ball

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
head which is pretty common with ball

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.099 
head which is pretty common with ball
pythons<00:00:19.100> this<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> both<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.359> color<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.960> a

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
pythons this is a both a color and a

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.470 
pythons this is a both a color and a
pattern<00:00:22.380> mutation<00:00:23.160> it's<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> blue<00:00:24.330> eyed

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
pattern mutation it's in the blue eyed

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.050 
pattern mutation it's in the blue eyed
leucistic<00:00:24.869> complex<00:00:28.310> it<00:00:29.310> gives<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.640> really<00:00:30.029> cool

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
leucistic complex it gives a really cool

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.889 
leucistic complex it gives a really cool
look<00:00:30.630> two<00:00:31.560> ball<00:00:32.099> python<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.910> kind<00:00:33.840> of

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
look two ball python it's a kind of

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.020 
look two ball python it's a kind of
similar<00:00:34.230> colors<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.890> lesser<00:00:35.219> platinum<00:00:35.760> but

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
similar colors to a lesser platinum but

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.270 
similar colors to a lesser platinum but
definitely<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> different<00:00:37.440> pattern<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
definitely a different pattern and the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.979 
definitely a different pattern and the
color<00:00:38.460> scheme<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.820> pretty<00:00:39.180> different<00:00:39.420> too

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
color scheme is pretty different too

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.619 
color scheme is pretty different too
I<00:00:40.430> think<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.520> combo<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.390> guy<00:00:42.570> is

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
I think the combo is what this guy is

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.540 
I think the combo is what this guy is
gonna<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:43.110> really<00:00:43.350> cool<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.040> our<00:00:44.280> breeder

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
gonna be really cool this is our breeder

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.069 
gonna be really cool this is our breeder
male<00:00:44.850> we've<00:00:45.180> got<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> couple<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.719> clutches

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
male we've got a couple of clutches

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.920 
male we've got a couple of clutches
incubating<00:00:46.620> right<00:00:46.800> now<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:48.059> hopefully<00:00:48.719> those

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
incubating right now so hopefully those

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.389 
incubating right now so hopefully those
will<00:00:48.960> be<00:00:49.260> hatching<00:00:49.469> soon<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.219> some

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
will be hatching soon and have some

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:59.990 
will be hatching soon and have some
bamboo<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.000> offer

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.330 

so<00:01:00.600> that's<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.990> bamboo<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:06.440> next<00:01:07.440> one<00:01:08.310> that

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
so that's the bamboo the next one that

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.700 
so that's the bamboo the next one that
we<00:01:08.550> have<00:01:08.580> here's<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.120> another<00:01:09.690> brand<00:01:09.780> new<00:01:10.410> more

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
we have here's a another brand new more

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.290 
we have here's a another brand new more
this<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.790> called<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.120> bongo<00:01:14.060> kind<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.120> almost

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
this is called a bongo kind of almost

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.500 
this is called a bongo kind of almost
looks<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.780> little<00:01:16.430> cinnamon<00:01:17.430> or<00:01:17.640> black<00:01:17.880> pastel

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
looks a little cinnamon or black pastel

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.080 
looks a little cinnamon or black pastel
kind<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.860> maybe<00:01:20.100> with<00:01:20.370> some<00:01:20.670> mystic

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
kind of like and maybe with some mystic

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.730 
kind of like and maybe with some mystic
in<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.900> kind<00:01:22.050> of<00:01:22.080> hard<00:01:22.260> to<00:01:22.290> describe

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
in it it's kind of hard to describe

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.540 
in it it's kind of hard to describe
bongos<00:01:23.340> but<00:01:23.670> really<00:01:24.420> neat<00:01:24.570> looking<00:01:24.870> snakes

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
bongos but really neat looking snakes

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.460 
bongos but really neat looking snakes
the<00:01:26.550> combos<00:01:27.360> we<00:01:27.690> really<00:01:27.930> haven't<00:01:28.080> met<00:01:28.260> a<00:01:28.290> lot

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
the combos we really haven't met a lot

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.830 
the combos we really haven't met a lot
of<00:01:28.560> combos<00:01:28.890> done<00:01:29.130> with<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.550> yet<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.240> think

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
of combos done with this yet I think

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.420 
of combos done with this yet I think
there'll<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.260> lot<00:01:31.440> of<00:01:31.590> potential<00:01:31.979> with<00:01:32.280> them

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
there'll be a lot of potential with them

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.370 
there'll be a lot of potential with them
especially<00:01:32.550> mixing<00:01:33.240> with<00:01:33.360> other<00:01:33.540> dark<00:01:33.930> morphs

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
especially mixing with other dark morphs

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.170 
especially mixing with other dark morphs
I'm<00:01:35.130> really<00:01:35.369> interested<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.760> see<00:01:35.880> what'll

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
I'm really interested to see what'll

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.030 
I'm really interested to see what'll
happen<00:01:36.210> when<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.720> mix<00:01:36.960> these<00:01:37.110> with<00:01:37.740> some<00:01:37.920> of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
happen when you mix these with some of

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.350 
happen when you mix these with some of
the<00:01:38.130> other<00:01:38.280> darker<00:01:38.700> morphs<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.060> are<00:01:39.240> out

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
the other darker morphs that are out

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.219 
the other darker morphs that are out
there

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
there

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.650 
there
GHI<00:01:41.040> would<00:01:41.220> be<00:01:41.340> pretty<00:01:41.580> interesting<00:01:42.119> Leopard

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
GHI would be pretty interesting Leopard

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.870 
GHI would be pretty interesting Leopard
and<00:01:42.960> then<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.590> course<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.010> you<00:01:44.610> look<00:01:44.759> my

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
and then of course the you look my

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.070 
and then of course the you look my
hobbies<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.420> things<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.780> would<00:01:46.020> be

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
hobbies and things like that would be

00:01:46.080 --> 00:02:00.410 
hobbies and things like that would be
pretty<00:01:46.200> cool<00:01:46.680> too<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:50.280> that's<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.670> Bongo

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.390 

next<00:02:00.930> one<00:02:01.110> I'm<00:02:01.170> gonna<00:02:01.260> have<00:02:01.560> here<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.160> last

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
next one I'm gonna have here the last

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.469 
next one I'm gonna have here the last
one<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.760> should<00:02:02.940> say<00:02:05.030> this<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.240> micro<00:02:06.870> scale

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
one it should say this is a micro scale

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.840 
one it should say this is a micro scale
so<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:09.780> very<00:02:09.960> similar<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.560> be<00:02:10.890> HBS<00:02:11.400> scale

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
so it's very similar to be HBS scale

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.300 
so it's very similar to be HBS scale
this<00:02:12.060> project<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:13.380> can<00:02:13.410> see<00:02:13.770> what<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.100> had

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
this project you can see what the had

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.230 
this project you can see what the had
all<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.330> scales<00:02:15.600> that<00:02:15.810> are<00:02:15.870> missing<00:02:16.260> there<00:02:17.240> so

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
all the scales that are missing there so

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.660 
all the scales that are missing there so
it's<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.540> different<00:02:18.870> line<00:02:19.050> than<00:02:19.080> BH<00:02:19.560> B's<00:02:19.890> scale

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
it's a different line than BH B's scale

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.970 
it's a different line than BH B's scale
this<00:02:20.820> project<00:02:21.390> but<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:22.290> should<00:02:22.500> have<00:02:22.680> very

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
this project but it should have very

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.510 
this project but it should have very
similar<00:02:23.480> results<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.020> super<00:02:26.010> form<00:02:26.340> of

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
similar results of the super form of

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.040 
similar results of the super form of
this<00:02:26.610> should<00:02:26.850> be<00:02:26.970> pretty<00:02:27.300> much<00:02:27.420> an<00:02:27.600> all<00:02:27.690> scale

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
this should be pretty much an all scale

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.010 
this should be pretty much an all scale
a<00:02:28.080> snake<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:32.459> not<00:02:33.000> too<00:02:33.180> much<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.510> look<00:02:33.690> at<00:02:33.870> on

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
a snake so not too much to look at on

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.479 
a snake so not too much to look at on
its<00:02:34.230> own<00:02:34.380> other<00:02:34.620> than<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.980> scales<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.400> are

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
its own other than the scales that are

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.930 
its own other than the scales that are
missing<00:02:35.850> from<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:37.020> front<00:02:37.320> of<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.440> head

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
missing from the front of the head

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.979 
missing from the front of the head
otherwise<00:02:38.940> it's<00:02:39.209> pretty<00:02:39.360> much<00:02:39.570> just<00:02:39.630> looks

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
otherwise it's pretty much just looks

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.680 
otherwise it's pretty much just looks
like<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.140> normal<00:02:40.320> ball<00:02:40.709> python<00:02:41.300> but<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.510> think

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
like a normal ball python but I think

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.600 
like a normal ball python but I think
the<00:02:42.900> combo<00:02:43.380> potential<00:02:43.890> with<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:44.250> could<00:02:44.459> be

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
the combo potential with this could be

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.000 
the combo potential with this could be
really<00:02:44.940> really<00:02:45.480> interesting<00:02:46.020> especially<00:02:46.680> the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
really really interesting especially the

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.030 
really really interesting especially the
super<00:02:47.340> form<00:02:47.870> imagine<00:02:48.870> scale<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.470> bananas

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
super form imagine scale is bananas

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.240 
super form imagine scale is bananas
scale<00:02:50.850> is<00:02:51.090> spinner<00:02:52.080> blasts<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:52.830> things<00:02:53.040> like

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
scale is spinner blasts and things like

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.410 
scale is spinner blasts and things like
that<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:53.489> mean<00:02:53.640> there<00:02:53.850> could<00:02:54.000> be<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.120> lot<00:02:54.390> of

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
that I mean there could be a lot of

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.960 
that I mean there could be a lot of
really<00:02:54.840> cool<00:02:55.050> combos<00:02:55.680> done<00:02:55.980> with<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:56.880> it

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
really cool combos done with that so it

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.550 
really cool combos done with that so it
brings<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.330> whole<00:02:57.510> new<00:02:57.540> dimension<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.350> ball

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
brings a whole new dimension to the ball

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.690 
brings a whole new dimension to the ball
python<00:02:58.770> morph<00:02:59.340> game<00:03:03.920> so<00:03:04.920> this<00:03:05.040> guy<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.310> growing

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
python morph game so this guy is growing

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.190 
python morph game so this guy is growing
pretty<00:03:05.880> well<00:03:06.030> we<00:03:06.269> hope<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.540> have<00:03:06.660> him<00:03:06.840> breeding

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
egg over here these pastel clowns almost

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.620 
egg over here these pastel clowns almost
look<00:04:37.220> like<00:04:37.250> killer<00:04:37.700> clowns<00:04:38.060> at<00:04:38.270> least<00:04:38.420> this

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
look like killer clowns at least this

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.740 
look like killer clowns at least this
one<00:04:38.900> almost<00:04:39.680> looks<00:04:39.890> like<00:04:39.950> a<00:04:40.100> killer<00:04:40.370> clown<00:04:40.750> but

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
one almost looks like a killer clown but

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.780 
one almost looks like a killer clown but
the<00:04:42.350> male<00:04:42.530> doesn't<00:04:42.890> have<00:04:42.980> any<00:04:43.130> past<00:04:43.370> all<00:04:43.610> on

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.220 
the male doesn't have any past all on
him<00:04:43.970> so<00:04:44.180> they<00:04:44.300> got<00:04:44.450> to<00:04:44.570> be<00:04:44.660> just<00:04:44.990> regular

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230
