got the fill plug out that was a
challenge<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.790> tried<00:00:15.389> using<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.660> chisel<00:00:15.960> which

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
challenge I tried using the chisel which

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.220 
challenge I tried using the chisel which
I'm<00:00:16.500> dribbling<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:17.160> little<00:00:17.369> slot<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:18.080> to<00:00:19.080> get

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
I'm dribbling a little slot in it to get

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.179 
I'm dribbling a little slot in it to get
it<00:00:19.430> to<00:00:20.430> try<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.609> get<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.820> out<00:00:20.939> done<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.449> worked

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
it to try to get it out done that worked

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.769 
it to try to get it out done that worked
ended<00:00:23.189> up<00:00:23.310> just<00:00:23.730> getting<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.029> welded<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.600> this

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
ended up just getting it welded so this

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.609 
ended up just getting it welded so this
is<00:00:24.869> what<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.080> looks<00:00:25.199> like<00:00:25.289> now<00:00:25.880> Ida<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.210> got<00:00:27.480> a

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
is what it looks like now Ida I got a

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.179 
is what it looks like now Ida I got a
nut<00:00:28.619> welded<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.130> there<00:00:30.859> down<00:00:31.859> there<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.040> was

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
nut welded on there down there I was

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.250 
nut welded on there down there I was
able<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:33.180> spin<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.719> out<00:00:33.809> finally

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
able to spin it out finally

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.040 
able to spin it out finally
so<00:00:35.450> that<00:00:36.450> was<00:00:36.600> my<00:00:36.890> final<00:00:38.000> solution<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.570> didn't

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
so that was my final solution I didn't

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.510 
so that was my final solution I didn't
want<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.230> use<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.559> drill<00:00:40.800> out<00:00:40.920> method<00:00:41.160> just

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
want to use the drill out method just

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.430 
want to use the drill out method just
because<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.879> didn't<00:00:42.780> want<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.930> get<00:00:43.079> any<00:00:43.170> metal

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
because I didn't want to get any metal

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.840 
because I didn't want to get any metal
shavings<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.980> there<00:00:44.420> there's<00:00:45.420> where<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.660> goes

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
shavings in there there's where it goes

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.400 
shavings in there there's where it goes
you<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:47.969> see<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> hole<00:00:48.450> there<00:00:50.270> so<00:00:51.270> now<00:00:51.420> hoping

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
you can see the hole there so now hoping

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.799 
you can see the hole there so now hoping
that<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.739> fill<00:00:52.949> plug<00:00:53.160> right<00:00:53.370> here<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.850> not<00:00:54.210> any

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
that the fill plug right here is not any

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.330 
that the fill plug right here is not any
trouble<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:57.390> go<00:00:57.570> ahead<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:58.020> use<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.410> see

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
trouble and go ahead and just use it see

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.200 
trouble and go ahead and just use it see
if<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.460> can

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:12.980

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
use my impact here easy one came right

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:29.600 
use my impact here easy one came right
out<00:01:13.020> with<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:14.090> so<00:01:15.090> here<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:15.390> go

on how much this has been done before so

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.679 
on how much this has been done before so
just<00:03:24.859> remember<00:03:25.099> to<00:03:25.250> use<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:25.400> 6-point<00:03:25.939> that's<00:03:26.209> 24

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:26.689 
just remember to use a 6-point that's 24

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:41.960 
just remember to use a 6-point that's 24
millimeter<00:03:27.280> for<00:03:28.280> both<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.700> fill<00:03:28.939> and<00:03:29.180> drain

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
I did this after driving a couple miles

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.980 
I did this after driving a couple miles
probably<00:03:49.680> around<00:03:49.980> 100<00:03:50.280> miles

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
probably around 100 miles

because<00:04:48.050> definitely<00:04:48.409> do

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.100 

this<00:05:05.340> could

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
this could

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.050 
this could
the<00:05:07.620> mountain<00:05:07.979> there<00:05:08.190> too

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.880

you end up getting this one stripped or
it's<00:05:26.910> just<00:05:27.090> stuck<00:05:27.360> already<00:05:27.690> you're<00:05:27.960> going<00:05:28.110> to

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
you're just able to get it off but a few

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.010 
you're just able to get it off but a few
people<00:05:37.140> have<00:05:38.150> taken<00:05:39.150> the<00:05:39.270> train<00:05:39.660> plug<00:05:39.870> off

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
people have taken the train plug off

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.230 
people have taken the train plug off
first<00:05:40.320> and<00:05:40.590> not<00:05:41.130> really<00:05:41.340> had<00:05:41.430> a<00:05:41.460> solution<00:05:42.120> at

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
first and not really had a solution at

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.550 
first and not really had a solution at
hand<00:05:42.270> to<00:05:42.570> get<00:05:42.720> it<00:05:42.840> going<00:05:42.990> that<00:05:43.290> was<00:05:43.440> their

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
hand to get it going that was their

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.970 
hand to get it going that was their
daily<00:05:43.830> driver<00:05:45.350> didn't<00:05:46.350> really<00:05:46.530> have<00:05:46.710> the

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
daily driver didn't really have the

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.190 
daily driver didn't really have the
tools<00:05:47.670> to<00:05:47.820> get<00:05:48.000> going<00:05:48.360> again

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
tools to get going again

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.570 
tools to get going again
so<00:05:49.620> make<00:05:50.490> sure<00:05:50.520> you<00:05:51.230> prepared<00:05:52.230> and<00:05:52.470> do<00:05:53.370> the

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
so make sure you prepared and do the

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.700 
so make sure you prepared and do the
fill<00:05:54.120> plug<00:05:54.270> first<00:05:54.600> I<00:05:55.400> think<00:05:56.400> I<00:05:57.560> think<00:05:58.560> that's

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
fill plug first I think I think that's

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:07.100 
fill plug first I think I think that's
pretty<00:05:59.610> good<00:05:59.730> a<00:06:00.920> little<00:06:01.920> more<00:06:02.190> drip<00:06:02.490> there<00:06:02.670> but

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:34.940 

soak<00:06:08.110> some<00:06:08.290> up<00:06:08.550> tell

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:43.520 

call<00:06:35.950> it<00:06:36.130> good

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.330 

so<00:06:44.600> make<00:06:45.600> sure<00:06:45.720> you<00:06:45.810> get<00:06:45.870> the<00:06:46.020> aluminum<00:06:46.340> crush

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
so make sure you get the aluminum crush

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:53.130 
so make sure you get the aluminum crush
gasket

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.140 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.070 

and<00:06:53.680> this<00:06:53.770> is<00:06:53.920> no<00:06:54.070> one<00:06:54.250> I'm<00:06:54.340> using<00:06:54.750> for<00:06:55.750> the

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 
and this is no one I'm using for the
