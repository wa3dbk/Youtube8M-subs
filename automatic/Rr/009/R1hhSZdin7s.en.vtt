00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
Kinect games already where you're

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.180 
Kinect games already where you're

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
running in place you're jumping and all

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.590 
running in place you're jumping and all
that<00:00:53.399> sort<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.670> stuff<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:54.120> know<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
that sort of stuff you know but the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600 
that sort of stuff you know but the
thing<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.840> with<00:00:55.440> rise<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:56.010> nightmares<00:00:56.399> you've

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
thing is with rise of nightmares you've

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.020 
thing is with rise of nightmares you've
got<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.910> do<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.629> hours<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.410> end<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:59.670> you

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
got to do that for hours on end and you

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.430 
got to do that for hours on end and you
would<00:01:00.180> think<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.390> would<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.780> really<00:01:00.809> tiring

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
would think that would be really tiring

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.650 
would think that would be really tiring
but<00:01:01.739> Sega<00:01:02.370> has<00:01:02.550> kind<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.000> come<00:01:03.149> up<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> way

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
but Sega has kind of come up with a way

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.170 
but Sega has kind of come up with a way
that<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.049> not<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:04.769> much<00:01:04.830> where<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:06.030> go

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
that it's not so much where you can go

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.030 
that it's not so much where you can go
into<00:01:06.330> ottimo<00:01:06.869> by<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.260> holding<00:01:07.439> up<00:01:07.650> your<00:01:07.830> hand

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
into ottimo by just holding up your hand

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
like this and it goes and shows you

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.539 
like this and it goes and shows you
where<00:01:10.530> exactly<00:01:10.799> you're<00:01:11.070> supposed<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.460> be

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
where exactly you're supposed to be

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
character in place and you can go about

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.289 
character in place and you can go about
and<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.380> switch<00:01:16.830> back<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.299> actually

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
and then switch back to actually

have a core basic foundation of the
gameplay<00:02:40.530> top<00:02:40.829> you've<00:02:41.220> got<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.549> have<00:02:41.670> a

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
gameplay top you've got to have a

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.089 
gameplay top you've got to have a
variety<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:43.110> appears<00:02:43.530> every<00:02:43.920> now

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
variety to that that appears every now

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.069 
variety to that that appears every now
and<00:02:44.310> then<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:44.940> one<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.569> things<00:02:45.599> is

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
and then and so one of the things is

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.830 
and then and so one of the things is
that<00:02:46.410> it's<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:46.920> simple<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.610> go<00:02:48.000> out<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.360> pick<00:02:48.810> a

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
that it's so simple to go out and pick a

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.119 
that it's so simple to go out and pick a
weapon<00:02:49.260> but<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.530> thing<00:02:49.739> is<00:02:49.769> that<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.099> can

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
weapon but the thing is that you can

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.580 
weapon but the thing is that you can
only<00:02:50.310> carry<00:02:50.609> one<00:02:50.760> weapon<00:02:51.269> at<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.420> time<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.989> then

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
only carry one weapon at a time and then

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.250 
only carry one weapon at a time and then
from<00:02:53.099> there<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.700> particular<00:02:54.000> weapon<00:02:54.690> has

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
from there that particular weapon has

from there that particular weapon has
kind<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.620> like<00:02:55.739> a<00:02:55.769> health<00:02:56.129> meter<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.299> it<00:02:57.480> so

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
kind of like a health meter to it so

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.420 
kind of like a health meter to it so
you'll<00:02:57.989> notice<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.349> as<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:59.099> keep<00:02:59.250> on

you're curious as to what exactly this

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.099 
you're curious as to what exactly this
weapon<00:03:23.970> does<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.329> lot<00:03:24.720> of<00:03:24.780> them<00:03:24.959> are

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
weapon does a lot of them are

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.809 
weapon does a lot of them are
projectiles<00:03:25.680> but<00:03:25.980> then<00:03:26.099> a<00:03:26.130> lot<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.579> them<00:03:26.669> are

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
projectiles but then a lot of them are

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.300 
projectiles but then a lot of them are
slashed<00:03:27.299> weapons<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.049> it's<00:03:28.680> just<00:03:28.889> a<00:03:29.010> huge

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
slashed weapons and it's just a huge

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.250 
slashed weapons and it's just a huge
sort<00:03:29.579> of<00:03:29.639> variety<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.150> weapons<00:03:30.450> at<00:03:30.840> hand<00:03:31.079> and
