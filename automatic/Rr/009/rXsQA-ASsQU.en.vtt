00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
just wasn't working for me Lex was a

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.480 
just wasn't working for me Lex was a
tiny<00:01:54.720> bit<00:01:54.990> smaller<00:01:55.350> than<00:01:55.619> Hogan<00:01:56.009> maybe<00:01:56.340> a

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
tiny bit smaller than Hogan maybe a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.520 
tiny bit smaller than Hogan maybe a
little<00:01:56.729> bit<00:01:56.939> less<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.390> worker<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:58.079> he<00:01:58.320> had<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
little bit less of a worker and he had a

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.440 
little bit less of a worker and he had a
lot<00:01:58.799> less<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.250> charisma<00:01:59.520> then<00:01:59.969> Hogan<00:02:00.329> did

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
lot less of the charisma then Hogan did

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.359 
lot less of the charisma then Hogan did
so<00:02:00.689> if<00:02:00.869> he<00:02:00.990> asked<00:02:01.229> me<00:02:01.380> he<00:02:01.590> was<00:02:01.710> an<00:02:01.799> impostor

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
Hogan and I was happy that they decided

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.050 
Hogan and I was happy that they decided
not<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.829> put<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.219> belt<00:02:05.399> on<00:02:05.579> him<00:02:05.729> because<00:02:05.939> the
