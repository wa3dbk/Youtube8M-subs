people<00:01:46.200> always<00:01:46.350> ask<00:01:46.619> us<00:01:46.799> why<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.100> ride<00:01:47.460> shuts

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
people always ask us why the ride shuts

people always ask us why the ride shuts
down<00:01:47.909> frequently<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.869> has<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.290> do<00:01:49.409> with<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
down frequently that has to do with the

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.740 
down frequently that has to do with the
thousands<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.340> components<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.240> ride<00:01:51.420> and

electrical components has a failure life
it's<00:01:56.640> going<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.000> go<00:01:57.149> bad<00:01:57.420> at<00:01:57.659> some<00:01:57.840> point<00:01:58.110> there

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
it's going to go bad at some point there

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.700 
it's going to go bad at some point there
are<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.860> many<00:01:59.130> components<00:01:59.759> in<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.149> system

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
are so many components in this system

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.070 
are so many components in this system
that<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:02.070> we<00:02:02.369> have<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:03.030> keep<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.509> top<00:02:03.720> of<00:02:03.960> them

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
that that we have to keep on top of them

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.499 
that that we have to keep on top of them
and<00:02:04.289> we<00:02:05.009> have<00:02:05.159> gotten<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.520> lot<00:02:05.759> better<00:02:06.060> at<00:02:06.360> doing

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
and we have gotten a lot better at doing

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.979 
and we have gotten a lot better at doing
that<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.899> last<00:02:07.399> last<00:02:08.399> five<00:02:09.119> six<00:02:09.569> seven<00:02:09.690> years

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
that in last last five six seven years

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.080 
that in last last five six seven years
and<00:02:10.440> we<00:02:10.830> were<00:02:10.979> when<00:02:11.220> we<00:02:11.250> originally<00:02:11.819> got<00:02:11.940> the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
and we were when we originally got the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.610 
and we were when we originally got the
ride<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.480> was<00:02:12.569> new<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.870> us<00:02:12.900> we<00:02:13.050> never<00:02:13.350> had

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
ride it was new to us we never had

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.380 
ride it was new to us we never had
anything<00:02:13.830> like<00:02:14.099> this<00:02:14.250> before<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.819> now<00:02:15.330> we

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
anything like this before and now we

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.840 
anything like this before and now we
have<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.050> we<00:02:16.890> have<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.280> under<00:02:17.370> control<00:02:17.459> we

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
have this we have it under control we

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.559
