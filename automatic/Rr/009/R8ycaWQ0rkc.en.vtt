00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 people in the range are dissatisfied 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.899
 with the replacement of the bus fleet 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.340
 say vehicles are old slow 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.280
 and break new paint hides a 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.080
 vehicle with five years of use and over 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.939
 100 thousand kilometers shot disappointed 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.820
 because they all produce are in the new range 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.210
 not instead of zero mile bus to 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.490
 fleet of 130 viplan vehicles that up to 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.210
 last week operated in the range was 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.540
 replaced by new vehicles 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:39.540
 appears because there is nothing says that only 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.040
 one is emergency and any time the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.309
 I get the new ones and I do not know 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.710
 when the government does not run and says 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.700
 the exchange of old collectives for others 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.010
 not so old so it's temporary 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.190
 the end of travel on these buses 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.670
 with more than five years of use 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.149
 and depends on the end of the works of the express 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.360
 df that was already scheduled for June 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:10.280
 last year was the frost for December 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.930
 2013 and now we do not know for sure 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.720
 When will it be finalized? 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.600
 the expres df will connect the range and santa 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.930
 to the pilot plan and reduce travel 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.780
 from 90 to 40 minutes but different from 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.479
 fleet that caters to the range of santa maria 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.250
 replaced by new buses 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.290
 a disregard for the staff of the range because 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.320
 everybody walks by the new bus and we 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.750
 with old bus the dftrans explains that 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.570
 the two lines that today meet the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.040
 inhabitants of the range will be extinguished with 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.530
 expressed df 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.130
 only circular buses will do the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.189
 transport of passengers to the station 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:53.430
 the reformed vehicles circulating today 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.470
 are the planet companies and the pioneer 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.840
 Most of 2009 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.880
 outside the standards required in the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.170
 bidding for the new transport system 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.930
 public does not have gps for example 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.280
 can not be scheduled and 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.470
 this is another 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.480
 passenger claim they do not 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.730
 They pass the time that's passed is 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.680
 a mess and schedule the worst that is 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.240
 Because I take time and now nobody 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.610
 there is more time today 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.890
 according to the director of the DFTRANS 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.060
 former company operated with 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.850
 irregular 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.370
 therefore with a higher frequency than the 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.510
 bus of the old companies old 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.569
 operator her she operated with links 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.300
 pirates or between one 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.370
 time and another one to put another 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.170
 other time to function only that the 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.070
 lady was not registered here on df 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.850
 trans and now this new operator she is 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:53.220
 adapting to the times of the lines 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.459
 dftrans has registered 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.709
 then you can not create new schedules without 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.709
 authorization of the right of the dftrans
