00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:11.880
 I'm here at ms's booth if it's 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.549
 2015 here in the show room they set up 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.450
 here at the hotel and thomas and has here in 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.949
 my front one of the most 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.240
 interesting things that are showing here 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.789
 the first time you are having the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.000
 first contact here at the fair 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.369
 here is gt gt 80 thai tam 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.390
 he is a model that already draws attention to 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.429
 Where are you looking and calling already? 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.570
 attention where the keyboard is already in a 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.880
 very different place that we are 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.320
 accustomed to a good reason for everything 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.260
 this displacement here we have a 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.610
 certainly one mechanical keyboard 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.079
 very difficult feature of 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.329
 to find out if we already have any 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.820
 notebook with that then the guys that 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.899
 game that is a keyboard there we have 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.760
 cheney that this feature very 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.219
 difficult to find notebooks and this is a 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.570
 model that will bring this to both 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.280
 they had to have the ms 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.530
 in the project you must bring the keyboard here 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.390
 Down I do not have a table here 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.039
 to see how the economy gets is 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.470
 I can not figure out what to do. 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.150
 comfortable and such but realize that we 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.130
 we have a very different design 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.530
 another thing that is the touchpad that I 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.540
 I have a space here on the right side 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.280
 and to whom is the complete keyboard 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.420
 including numbers do not have 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.390
 problem does not have bad weather too 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.740
 rebate sertãozinho here from the top and you 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.350
 now also has the keyboard 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.270
 then you have both 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.680
 together 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.450
 besides this characteristic as if it no longer 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.490
 in common but here we have the keyboard 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.720
 mechanic here down that whole area 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.799
 is with practically every 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.689
 components 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.579
 so when you open the lid on top 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.490
 you have access to things like joseph 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.250
 htc sure the memory you can not 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.759
 is a notebook that has a construction that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.259
 very easy to upgrade even in the 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.700
 below you can open that 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.280
 you have a little more access 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.110
 facilitated for the graphics chip and then we 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.250
 we enter into something else that is quite 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.649
 unusual 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.210
 msi here in the united states is already 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.950
 starting to work on a concept of 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.060
 gpu upgrade 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.530
 in brazil this is not yet available 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.290
 market does not yet have a full 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.619
 structure to receive this type of 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.420
 thing in the United States to 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.209
 the revenue beginning to work with 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.549
 idea of ​​you buying a kit do you take 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.190
 in the company a distributor and he does the 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.840
 upgrade of your graphics chip is one of the 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.090
 things that night does not move the notebook 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.519
 the processor is not upgraded . 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.739
 chip graphic sefaz babies memory makes 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.470
 hd switch but graphic chip stayed 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.840
 out of the account and is usually the first 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.670
 component that is unable to face 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.260
 new generation of games is the first pre 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.610
 component to be adapted 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.400
 it means that then this notebook 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.410
 has gained a life cycle because it is 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.150
 high performance would already have a good circle 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.060
 to nobody but it is to increase even more 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.370
 this cycle the possibility of doing the 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.870
 graphics chip upgrade 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.970
 this model should appear there in the future 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.409
 in Brazil we do not yet have any idea of 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.959
 price also has no notion of the 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:59.629
 configurations is a project of high 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.569
 performance is different then oms 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:05.269
 aiming to bring and below the 20 thousand reais 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.220
 at a very high price but of course 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.810
 we are not talking about a notebook of 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.730
 performance we do not have the 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.730
 setting but we will see 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.870
 something from 1970 980 here that 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.630
 model in front of me and has more 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.790
 of the 980 for you to have an idea then 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.389
 us but we will see some setup here 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.919
 high-performance games and 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:27.200
 possibly below 20 thousand reais there 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.519
 I do not have a price yet because the 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.989
 dollar is floating in a way that 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.829
 no one can say anything at the fair to 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.010
 people 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.989
 This is Gt 80 python here. 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.970
 notebook gamer model that has a 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.819
 mechanical keyboard and possibility of 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.319
 upgrade to the graphics chip in Brazil 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.810
 people will not see it yet but he already 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.699
 is moving towards this and if you 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.470
 want to see more news and products 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:50.060
 innovators that even this is not to leave 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.650
 to sign our channel on youtube or 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.849
 accompany your own adrenaline to 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.739
 you stay within everything that the 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.540
 people are meeting here for us 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.290

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.549
 vegas 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.019
 and we see in the next video a hug 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.959
 we're here at the gigabyte booth at 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.150

 What are you presenting to us? 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.069
 This is where I'm going to start at that table over there. 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.549
 because it's more important we have here 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:19.159
