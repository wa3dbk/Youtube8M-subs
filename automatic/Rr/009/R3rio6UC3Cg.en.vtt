00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.060
 how about friends of rafael punto com.mx 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.650
 I greet you at christian martinoli 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.000
 we talked a little about this topic 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.270
 that is in vogue in Mexican football 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.100
 which is called white roosters of querétaro 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.020
 a very nice square very interesting 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.240
 with a fantastic stadium with people 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.980
 Brava seriously if you have not gone to the 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.210
 corrective if one day has a chance is 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.490
 a turn because beyond the 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.190
 show that sees the stands on the court 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.140
 the audience is very effusive and some 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.940
 some even passed threads 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.370
 but that they support the projects that 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.350
 no doubt now that the projects 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.300
 be good that's another thing in 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.280
 querétaro have eaten any type 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.890
 The team has always been 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.110
 immersed in questions of the decline in 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.570
 murky issues in some management 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.400
 for several years it seemed that the 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.979
 things had gotten cleaned up they even got 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.489
 with a league with cardoso the club 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:03.739
 began to have an economic feeling 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.470
 important an interesting boom came a 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.780
 owner with a lot of money at least in 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.090
 appearance that things were going to 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.620
 handle much better than inside went in 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.170
 in a sector of stability its 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.280
 results so they had indicated there 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.860
 external things that 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.540
 these have nothing to do with some of 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.760
 they are owed money or if not all of 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.100
 campus even the organization is in 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.290
 we will see already the strong men came out 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.570
 of the federation and the league mx a 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.130
 to rule that there will not be at the moment 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.800
 of that affiliation of the Queretano painting 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.840
 many teams that are playing the 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.270
 Descent mustaches are layered with this 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.700
 possibility urges them to be able to take 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.530
 a decision are lobbying for 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.299
 that the querétaro is not caught or so that 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.820
 this franchise is sold or so that 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.220
 even disappear or to be thrown out 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.810
 the hand to the atlantean possibly to the 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.880
 classe possibly to Veracruz 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.130
 possibly the town possibly to 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.649
 jaguars and the one that accumulates that is 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.750
 there are five teams that would not hurt 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.819
 a sharp and strong decision against 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.740
 a team that good has problems with 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.539
 justice and that is at this moment 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.580
 being researched in an important way 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.560
 not the team but the company that 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.750
 belongs the team that has then in 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.430
 this moment we insist things that 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.920
 arrange with the Mexican authorities 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.780
 what is going to be done 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.000
 we can hardly understand it because 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.410
 Mexican soccer is very exotic there 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.700
 things that are regulated and that 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.590
 generally not 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.390
 they comply because they say they are coastal 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.800
 culturally and painfully to our 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.560
 country on many occasions like this we 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.420
 we do not see why they will now 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.790
 to make a decision under regulation 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.530
 which will be ideal but then in Mexico 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.209
 You have to wait until the end of the 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.010
 championship see in what position is the 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.470
 querétaro how is the current situation 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.959
 at that moment when they handle the 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.840
 legal conditions of what happens 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.019
 with the owner of the Queretaro club what 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.000
 it is a fact that in the hands of who goes 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.010
 to be Mexican soccer for the 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.890
 future would have to start doing 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.769
 some important calls especially 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.299
 for the high salaries that are paid and not 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.060
 It is the player's fault to earn a lot of money 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.959
 but it is the fault of the managers and the 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.610
 men who are in long pants 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.200
 giving so much amount of silver is 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.599
 unsustainable to have a football team 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.829
 in Mexico it is almost impossible for a 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.329
 Mexican soccer team has 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.370
 gains if the 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.650
 sponsors that is the problem that 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.910
 they have several institutions and many 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.959
 franchises that do not find 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.360
 stability 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.190
 there is the town there are jaguars the 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.060
 veracruz has of its movements if not 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.700
 they support the government 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.870
 because the thing gets complicated is difficult 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.000
 great impression on Mexican soccer 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.280
 that put a lot of money and that even 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.440
 they even lose money with that but they do not 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.660
 matter are companies that have all the 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.270
 life inside Mexican football and that 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.709
 they have an economic solvency 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.180
 unblemished there are some elements that 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.519
 they come with a lot of money but sometimes 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.860
 as the months go by, he does not know 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.050
 one either where the silver was or how 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.849
 he handled his business he does not want 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.170
 say that all are illegal but you 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.660
 can give this kind of inconvenience 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.750
 with the Mexican justice for questions 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.360
 of not knowing how to handle money well 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.519
 in the end the only thing that is expected is that 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.340
 in Mexico I insist there is a salary cap 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:13.010
 foreigners are reduced and this little 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.440
 little in 5 or 10 years is going to make a 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.530
 football team nominally speaking 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.510
 a month I do not have to pay 15 20 or 25 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.419
 million pesos because you have to see what 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.050
 particular is going to get us a hug and 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.050
 Have a nice day
