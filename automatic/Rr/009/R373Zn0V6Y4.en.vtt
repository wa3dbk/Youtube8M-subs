that I forgot to tell you people about
if<00:00:30.250> you<00:00:30.609> want<00:00:30.970> a<00:00:31.180> tougher<00:00:31.690> challenge<00:00:31.720> you<00:00:32.410> can

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
if you want a tougher challenge you can

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.770 
if you want a tougher challenge you can
do<00:00:32.739> and<00:00:33.219> hit<00:00:33.399> enter<00:00:33.579> and<00:00:33.940> type<00:00:34.149> in<00:00:34.329> backslash

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
do and hit enter and type in backslash

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.090 
do and hit enter and type in backslash
players<00:00:35.309> space<00:00:36.309> 8<00:00:36.670> and<00:00:37.469> it'll<00:00:38.469> basically<00:00:38.679> set

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
players space 8 and it'll basically set

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.430 
players space 8 and it'll basically set
the<00:00:39.219> game<00:00:39.399> to<00:00:39.429> think<00:00:39.850> that<00:00:39.999> there<00:00:40.210> are<00:00:40.440> eight

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
the game to think that there are eight

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.770 
the game to think that there are eight
people<00:00:41.769> playing<00:00:42.249> so<00:00:42.729> all<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.149> monsters<00:00:43.569> will

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
people playing so all the monsters will

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.319 
people playing so all the monsters will
be<00:00:44.609> much<00:00:45.609> more<00:00:45.819> difficult<00:00:45.879> and<00:00:47.699> they<00:00:48.699> also<00:00:48.879> job

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
be much more difficult and they also job

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.930 
be much more difficult and they also job
better<00:00:49.539> loot<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.920> it's<00:00:51.069> a<00:00:51.129> way<00:00:51.280> if<00:00:51.549> you<00:00:51.699> need<00:00:51.850> to

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
better loot so it's a way if you need to

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.969 
better loot so it's a way if you need to
grind<00:00:52.120> out<00:00:52.269> some<00:00:52.479> levels<00:00:52.780> you<00:00:52.960> can<00:00:52.989> do<00:00:53.769> that

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:53.979 
grind out some levels you can do that

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.180 
grind out some levels you can do that
let's<00:00:54.639> go<00:00:54.819> over<00:00:54.969> our<00:00:54.999> skills<00:00:55.889> I'm<00:00:56.889> going<00:00:57.039> to<00:00:57.100> be
