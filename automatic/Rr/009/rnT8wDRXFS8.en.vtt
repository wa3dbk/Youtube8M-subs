00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.200
I cut the top of the water heater with an electric wheel, with a thin cutting disc

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.560
Then I cut another section for the door

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.300
Cut pieces of building iron on the grate of the stove after calculating their length.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.900
We use the wheel to remove the rust protection layer internally to stick the irons

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.940
We drill from the opposite side of the door and upward to the exit of the smoke, a hole 1 cm smaller than our stovepipes

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.680
Then, attach a 5 cm long tube to the hole diameter to connect the stovepipes

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.200
The bottom of the water heater (electrical input) will be used to leave the ash

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.420
4 pieces of metal tube for the feet of the stove cut at an angle to align it

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.060
The top piece that we cut is turned upside down and stuck

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.480
Let's look at the construction of one Chimney Cap Wood Stove Pipe

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.880
Under the door build an adjustable sliding door opening for air

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.600
Fine sand that will warm up and bake our coffee

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.600
and our coffee is being prepared ...

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.900
Cheers

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:43.900
