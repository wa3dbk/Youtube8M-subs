00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.979 
working together which is kind of weird
I<00:03:16.670> kind<00:03:16.910> of<00:03:16.970> hoped<00:03:17.150> they'd<00:03:17.239> have<00:03:17.360> a<00:03:17.390> fight<00:03:17.630> my

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
I kind of hoped they'd have a fight my

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.840 
I kind of hoped they'd have a fight my
idea<00:03:18.320> for<00:03:18.380> this<00:03:18.590> was<00:03:18.860> who<00:03:19.400> would<00:03:19.550> win<00:03:19.670> in<00:03:19.730> a

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
idea for this was who would win in a

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.430 
idea for this was who would win in a
fight<00:03:19.880> allover<00:03:20.420> tight<00:03:20.600> so<00:03:20.810> you<00:03:20.870> just<00:03:21.140> created

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
fight allover tight so you just created

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.250 
fight allover tight so you just created
some<00:03:21.709> horrifying<00:03:22.070> death<00:03:22.550> pit<00:03:22.910> yeah<00:03:23.660> by

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
some horrifying death pit yeah by

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.650
