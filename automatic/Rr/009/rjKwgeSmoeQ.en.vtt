00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
a cup of potatoes - one full cup of

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.079 
a cup of potatoes - one full cup of
liquid<00:00:52.519> in<00:00:53.239> this<00:00:53.479> case<00:00:54.159> they're<00:00:55.159> saying<00:00:55.190> 3/4

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
liquid in this case they're saying 3/4

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.660

cup<00:00:56.269> of<00:00:56.299> water<00:00:56.540> and<00:00:56.690> 1/2<00:00:57.140> cup<00:00:57.409> of<00:00:57.440> milk<00:00:57.979> I<00:00:58.280> think

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
cup of water and 1/2 cup of milk I think

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.479 
cup of water and 1/2 cup of milk I think
my<00:00:59.000> life<00:00:59.210> does<00:00:59.540> maybe<00:01:00.080> more<00:01:00.470> milk<00:01:00.799> than<00:01:01.040> that

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
my life does maybe more milk than that

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.399 
my life does maybe more milk than that
and<00:01:01.820> we<00:01:02.210> use<00:01:02.449> butter<00:01:02.750> instead<00:01:02.960> of<00:01:03.320> margarine

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
and we use butter instead of margarine

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.130 
and we use butter instead of margarine
but<00:01:04.339> they<00:01:04.519> are<00:01:04.580> excellent<00:01:05.120> you<00:01:05.690> could<00:01:05.840> you

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
but they are excellent you could you

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.840 
but they are excellent you could you
know<00:01:06.290> if<00:01:06.560> you<00:01:06.740> like<00:01:06.890> you<00:01:07.070> tell<00:01:07.549> you<00:01:07.610> this<00:01:07.700> is

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
know if you like you tell you this is

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.660 
know if you like you tell you this is
flavored<00:01:08.299> with<00:01:08.479> chives<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:09.290> other<00:01:09.590> stuff<00:01:09.950> you

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
flavored with chives and other stuff you

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.789 
flavored with chives and other stuff you
can<00:01:10.700> certainly<00:01:11.000> put<00:01:11.270> that<00:01:11.450> in<00:01:11.570> there<00:01:11.720> but<00:01:11.869> let

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
can certainly put that in there but let

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.050 
can certainly put that in there but let
me<00:01:12.860> just<00:01:13.040> show<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:13.159> the<00:01:13.340> vacuum<00:01:13.670> seal<00:01:13.880> on

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
me just show you the vacuum seal on

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.430 
me just show you the vacuum seal on
these<00:01:14.240> real<00:01:14.450> quick<00:01:14.720> but<00:01:14.900> I<00:01:14.930> thought<00:01:15.140> I<00:01:15.200> would

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
these real quick but I thought I would

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.620 
these real quick but I thought I would
do<00:01:15.560> just<00:01:15.830> a<00:01:15.950> separate<00:01:16.310> video<00:01:16.760> and<00:01:17.180> to<00:01:17.360> show<00:01:17.570> you

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
do just a separate video and to show you

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.490 
do just a separate video and to show you
that<00:01:17.780> this<00:01:18.200> box<00:01:18.470> that<00:01:18.680> comes<00:01:18.979> from<00:01:19.909> Sam's<00:01:20.500> 3.25

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
that this box that comes from Sam's 3.25

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.190 
that this box that comes from Sam's 3.25
pounds<00:01:23.079> does<00:01:24.079> 4<00:01:24.439> quarts<00:01:24.979> got<00:01:25.189> a<00:01:25.219> little<00:01:25.579> bit

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
pounds does 4 quarts got a little bit

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.440 
pounds does 4 quarts got a little bit
left<00:01:27.200> over<00:01:27.380> in<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.680> bottom<00:01:28.060> but<00:01:29.060> not<00:01:29.210> a<00:01:29.270> whole

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
left over in the bottom but not a whole

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.760 
left over in the bottom but not a whole
lot<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:29.960> it<00:01:30.079> does<00:01:30.289> 4<00:01:30.530> quarts<00:01:30.979> 4<00:01:31.909> quart<00:01:32.179> jars

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
lot so it does 4 quarts 4 quart jars

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.010 
lot so it does 4 quarts 4 quart jars
also<00:01:33.770> I<00:01:33.799> did<00:01:34.159> not<00:01:34.369> freeze<00:01:34.850> these<00:01:35.270> like<00:01:35.840> I

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
also I did not freeze these like I

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.020 
also I did not freeze these like I
typically<00:01:36.439> do<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.159> like<00:01:37.280> I<00:01:37.399> told<00:01:37.609> you<00:01:37.789> to<00:01:37.880> do

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
typically do and like I told you to do

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.109 
typically do and like I told you to do
with<00:01:38.210> the<00:01:38.359> rice<00:01:39.399> but<00:01:40.399> it<00:01:40.520> would<00:01:40.670> probably<00:01:40.700> a

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
with the rice but it would probably a

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.090 
with the rice but it would probably a
good<00:01:41.270> idea<00:01:41.329> I<00:01:41.929> just<00:01:42.200> did<00:01:42.380> not<00:01:42.560> do<00:01:42.799> it

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
good idea I just did not do it

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.209 
good idea I just did not do it
forgot<00:01:43.969> and<00:01:44.299> then<00:01:44.530> again<00:01:45.530> like<00:01:45.679> I<00:01:45.829> said<00:01:46.070> with

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
forgot and then again like I said with

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.580 
forgot and then again like I said with
the<00:01:46.340> rice<00:01:46.549> if<00:01:46.909> you<00:01:47.270> freeze<00:01:47.869> something<00:01:48.259> like

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
the rice if you freeze something like

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.310 
the rice if you freeze something like
this<00:01:48.799> put<00:01:49.219> these<00:01:49.399> in<00:01:49.549> the<00:01:49.609> freezer<00:01:50.229> maybe<00:01:51.229> a

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
this put these in the freezer maybe a

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.899 
this put these in the freezer maybe a
day<00:01:51.560> or<00:01:51.710> two<00:01:51.859> before<00:01:52.039> you're<00:01:52.429> going<00:01:52.549> to<00:01:52.640> can

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
day or two before you're going to can

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.590 
day or two before you're going to can
them<00:01:54.880> try<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:55.939> try<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.420> warm<00:01:57.170> them<00:01:57.469> up<00:01:57.499> gently

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
them try to try to warm them up gently

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.870 
them try to try to warm them up gently
and<00:02:00.159> so<00:02:01.159> they'll<00:02:01.340> reach<00:02:01.549> room<00:02:01.850> temperature

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
and so they'll reach room temperature

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.450 
and so they'll reach room temperature
without<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:03.560> don't<00:02:03.740> want<00:02:03.920> them<00:02:04.039> go<00:02:04.159> in<00:02:04.280> these

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
without you don't want them go in these

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.819 
without you don't want them go in these
jars<00:02:04.880> cold<00:02:05.240> ok<00:02:05.689> you're<00:02:05.899> going<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.079> condensate

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
jars cold ok you're going to condensate

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.230 
jars cold ok you're going to condensate
you're<00:02:07.100> going<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.369> just<00:02:07.850> going<00:02:07.999> to<00:02:08.060> mess<00:02:08.210> up

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
you're going to just going to mess up

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.430 
you're going to just going to mess up
your<00:02:08.509> product<00:02:08.869> but<00:02:08.990> it<00:02:09.050> wouldn't<00:02:09.259> hurt<00:02:09.319> to

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
your product but it wouldn't hurt to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.550 
your product but it wouldn't hurt to
freeze<00:02:09.710> these<00:02:09.950> first<00:02:11.020> just<00:02:12.020> like<00:02:12.140> we<00:02:12.290> do<00:02:12.440> the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
freeze these first just like we do the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.180 
freeze these first just like we do the
