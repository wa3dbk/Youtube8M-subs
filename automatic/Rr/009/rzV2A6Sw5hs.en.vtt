00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 seeing chaos was put together in the concert of 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.170
 joan sebastian the concert began at 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.980
 eight thirty in the evening but the king 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.500
 del jaripeo arrived three hours later 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.680
 what caused a nuisance to the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.020
 assistants 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.120
 shows very annoying very annoying we have 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.610
 sitting there from 8 o'clock at night 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.180
 the mariachi was two hours and 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.529
 now there is the tambora and even 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.350
 singing is nervous because 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.310
 I think you do not know what's not going to happen to you 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.379
 that is, it was a bad experience 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.710
 firstly because we have gone to 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:39.850
 look at several concepts of Juan Grabiel 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.739
 of vicente fernández de rocío dúrcal de 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.640
 marco antonio solís and we had never 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.640
 had an experience 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.140
 namely 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.740
 I breathe the world you 're not 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.740
 breathed 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.369
 9 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.369
 but I do not care 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.340
 when 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.219
 wei wei wei 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.560
 okay 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.140
 the weapon was very green 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.490
 my daughter arrives that is the good thing 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.270
 for men 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.450
 indeed, I said it and the 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.060
 media have communicated it 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.330
 effectively and the cancer came back as 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.310
 it's obvious the disease I'm 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.080
 conscious for many years that 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.560
 I was just going to give myself some 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.130
 truces and this has been 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.989
 after 15 years he is back in my 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.270
 life in my body and we are 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.819
 facing all means is 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.730
 say with what is within reach the 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.280
 science medicine and with a lot of faith with 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.819
 a lot of love for life 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.819
 yes 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.140
 for 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:45.710
 throughout the concert good I do not know 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.860
 how I would expose it not as I was promoted 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.920
 but if we actually arrive a 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.740
 a little late or almost an hour after 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.560
 what was planned by reality 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.660
 this was due more than anything to the times 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.320
 that we were tied unfortunately 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.090
 and above as I said in the show as a 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.310
 see this one brings the wind against 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.640
 times the wind now this time came in 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.390
 against and that's what made us get 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.840
 Well, not at the time we arrived in a 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.840
 hour later 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:24.310
 and we wait 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.310
 I thank you very much 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:33.290
 so 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.290
 thank you thank you we are halfway down the street
