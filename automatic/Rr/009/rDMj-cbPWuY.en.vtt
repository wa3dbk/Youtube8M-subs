00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.460
 this was the player in the region picks up 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.109
 Let's have a look at landon donovan 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.649
 is second in the form of a priest 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.380
 informed 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.830
 This year you will first come to his 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.970
 card 27 80 euro weddinger at 85 82 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.939
 schulz 83 suitable 80 69 61 73 small with 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.430
 working tomb right foot forest area 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.439
 am I gonna why number 20 cable 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.210
 costs for four games actually 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.310
 six games shot but one 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.800
 Someone who sometimes it is man 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.510
 the xbox hear a sharp turn off 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.890
 and that's why I got the call 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.780
 but actually my six goals 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.160
 The template in four play a game 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.120
 on his mental and physical weather 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.739
 on the market quite okay 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.700
 the skills are pretty, too 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.500
 you have to say pretty strong 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.620
 shot power short pass ball control 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.809
 all very very well play through before 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.640
 a 32 year old man and a sheep 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.379
 he has no vitality but comes 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.420
 what you do about it really makes you feel right now 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.160
 so in reality in the square and not 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.050
 reality because it knows and says a lot 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
 tempo for tempo he notices the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.500
 Type is just great spots 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.239
 super fast super agile super on the way 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.700
 was also a very very high 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.350
 firepower so with shot power should 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.990
 one is not a problem often in 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.280
 Do not build a dangerous shot 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.450
 of course, recently gone in 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.640
 I have no more protection the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.080
 feeling but otherwise in any case nimble 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.710
 and can also close similar to one 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.479
 bull problem he is 81 graduation 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.759
 in ingame stats and that already be 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:29.280
 biggest manko you do not notice such 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.450
 scenes here graduation 81 I had real 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.130
 to fight with a conclusion then 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.280
 he has me often the one or 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.960
 another point or goal or cup also 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.579
 tasted I found little funny of 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.259
 landon donovan has one in common 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.150
 shot in the sixteen is a bit 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.280
 shit and yes in such scenes there 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.390
 true because so so must Marta was 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.950
 a 80s graduation though 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.740
 Often little robot asks how can 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.829
 You do not make a few play 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.750
 actually with its biggest plus must 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.770
 say as can fit so I had 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.180
 just a form of people made what 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.700
 a stranger is just because clint 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.320
 dempsey for example the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.030
 has played no bock had the ball 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.890
 somehow we turn in good ones 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.149
 but alluded position having fits 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.860
 for banks but also determined 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.519
 every ball control also great 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.989
 accepted ball is absolutely no problem and 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.670
 the walkways as we just 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.680
 for example, see now too 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.970
 always super runs super free 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.620
 actually always playable you have 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.849
 no difficulties to find and 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.940
 that's why you always bring him 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.830
 easy in good dangerous position 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.069
 next manko is he is very small and 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.630
 Faint 172 bodies are 60 in the 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:35.330
 If you want to say you have a say 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.459
 who comes in a fight is over 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.829
 just directly over to just three 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.930
 that 's it is not great 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.280
 optimally looking forward to the outside purely 10 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.549
 often difficult, mostly difficult 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.790
 with exaggerate either way is okay 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.799
 but 34 stands while already nice 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.970
 To league nation has dive my team 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.849
 I saw I was really proud 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:01.610
 just absolute packed there team 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:03.380
 because mls usa is difficult because of that too 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.150
 migration but not optimal it 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.799
 I already said the conclusion is 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.430
 real i have in my situation the 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.989
 worst situation no more 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.160
 taken because I simply thought that 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.680
 you can not show against it only 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.540
 eye cancer and so overall you have 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.130
 landon donovan then even if he is only 20 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.980
 card costs you my passion too 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.500
 In any case, that's the type of me 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.220
 Will I be in school for a game 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.600
 the bbl is mostly strong behind 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.250
 Donovan I mean the least 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.200
 now necessarily need a left outside 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.940
 except usa 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.280
 that's the reason why something almost gets carried away 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.750
 every he on landon donovan and dead me 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.970
 no idea of a semmel it needs 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.530
 no one take more like one 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.849
 follow said that comes on the mist 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.430
 Many people ask where they are now 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.630
 but i believe in landon donovan 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.760
 by one or the other better 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.810
 So that's why you change it 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.310
 though I did not want to be instructed 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.400
 but there you were 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.480
 interview from me landon donovan 70 and 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.950
 the thumb down not so that is 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.180
 the worst rating for this one 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.190
 year got from me to the player 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.690

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.189

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.840

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.459

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.080
 MÃ¼ller the country ruled in the comment 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.610
 not even tevez and more 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.710

 temporarily with at least a thumb 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.420
 down for landon donovan one 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.420
