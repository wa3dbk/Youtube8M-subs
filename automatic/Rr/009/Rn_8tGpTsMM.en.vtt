silent<00:04:42.779> hill<00:04:42.900> games<00:04:43.169> this<00:04:43.439> this<00:04:43.710> game<00:04:43.919> is<00:04:44.129> very

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:44.219 
silent hill games this this game is very

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:46.369 
silent hill games this this game is very
sure<00:04:44.849> it<00:04:44.969> took<00:04:45.150> me<00:04:45.300> about<00:04:45.509> five<00:04:45.840> hours<00:04:45.870> to

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:46.379 
sure it took me about five hours to

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:47.629 
sure it took me about five hours to
complete<00:04:46.409> and<00:04:46.889> there's<00:04:47.009> a<00:04:47.069> reason<00:04:47.430> for<00:04:47.460> that

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
complete and there's a reason for that

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.089 
complete and there's a reason for that
because<00:04:48.240> there's<00:04:48.779> alternate<00:04:49.379> endings<00:04:49.889> I

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
because there's alternate endings I

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.830 
because there's alternate endings I
think<00:04:50.310> there's<00:04:50.490> a<00:04:50.550> total<00:04:50.879> of<00:04:51.029> five<00:04:51.270> endings

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
think there's a total of five endings

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.820 
think there's a total of five endings
that<00:04:51.960> you<00:04:52.139> can<00:04:52.289> get<00:04:52.409> throughout<00:04:52.710> the

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
that you can get throughout the

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.740 
that you can get throughout the

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
unfortunately shattered Memories doesn't

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.689 
unfortunately shattered Memories doesn't
have<00:04:54.900> that<00:04:55.080> scary<00:04:55.500> factor<00:04:56.009> that<00:04:56.219> all<00:04:56.460> of<00:04:56.610> the
