watch and every time the time change it
just<00:01:03.329> grows<00:01:04.970> so<00:01:05.970> there's<00:01:06.180> plenty<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.630> watch

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
there and so it's really convenient when

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.789 
there and so it's really convenient when
you're<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.460> know<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.939> home<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:37.619> get<00:01:37.770> a

phone out of your pocket it's kind of

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.569 
phone out of your pocket it's kind of
surprising<00:01:42.060> how<00:01:42.659> often<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.649> prefer<00:01:44.220> not<00:01:44.250> to

surprising how often you prefer not to
pull<00:01:44.970> your<00:01:45.119> phone<00:01:45.299> out<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.540> your<00:01:45.689> pocket<00:01:45.780> and

pull your phone out of your pocket and

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.230 
pull your phone out of your pocket and
it's<00:01:46.619> really<00:01:46.710> convenient<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.520> get<00:01:47.670> messages

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
it's really convenient to get messages

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.569 
it's really convenient to get messages
that<00:01:48.450> way<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.860> really<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579

that way and so I really like the
notifications<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:53.329> besides<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.540> display

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.440 
and everything it does you can see
hardware-wise<00:01:58.920> you've<00:01:59.579> got<00:01:59.790> some<00:02:00.030> buttons

I've<00:02:32.900> downloaded<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.560> stopwatch<00:02:34.390> which<00:02:35.390> is<00:02:35.540> a

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
I've downloaded the stopwatch which is a

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.450 
I've downloaded the stopwatch which is a
pretty<00:02:35.840> cool<00:02:36.080> app<00:02:38.590> but<00:02:39.590> you'll<00:02:39.740> notice<00:02:40.130> here

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
pretty cool app but you'll notice here

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.210 
pretty cool app but you'll notice here
where<00:02:40.960> we're<00:02:41.960> there<00:02:42.200> aren't<00:02:42.530> buttons<00:02:42.860> you've

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
where we're there aren't buttons you've

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.490 
where we're there aren't buttons you've
got<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.460> charging<00:02:43.910> port<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.390> what<00:02:45.080> that<00:02:45.290> does

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
got a charging port and what that does

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.000 
got a charging port and what that does
it<00:02:45.680> uses<00:02:45.980> magnets<00:02:46.460> so<00:02:47.420> that<00:02:47.600> every<00:02:48.110> I<00:02:48.470> do<00:02:48.710> it

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
it uses magnets so that every I do it

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.740 
it uses magnets so that every I do it
for<00:02:49.040> like<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.400> half<00:02:49.670> hour<00:02:49.820> every<00:02:49.970> day<00:02:50.210> just<00:02:50.540> to

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
for like a half hour every day just to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.130 
for like a half hour every day just to
be<00:02:50.780> sure<00:02:50.960> that<00:02:51.140> I'm<00:02:51.470> I've<00:02:51.860> got<00:02:52.160> some<00:02:52.460> power<00:02:53.140> but

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
be sure that I'm I've got some power but

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.490 
be sure that I'm I've got some power but
about<00:02:54.950> every<00:02:55.460> week<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:56.090> need<00:02:56.810> to<00:02:56.870> charge<00:02:57.260> the

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
about every week you need to charge the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.430 
about every week you need to charge the
pebble<00:02:57.860> is<00:02:58.040> how<00:02:58.730> much<00:02:58.940> battery<00:02:59.810> life<00:03:00.170> it's

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
pebble is how much battery life it's

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.130 
pebble is how much battery life it's
supposed<00:03:00.740> to<00:03:00.860> have<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.900> I've<00:03:02.990> been

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
supposed to have and so I've been

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.410 
supposed to have and so I've been
impressed<00:03:03.290> with<00:03:03.590> that<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:04.160> even<00:03:04.880> with<00:03:05.150> all<00:03:05.300> the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
impressed with that I even with all the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.570 
impressed with that I even with all the
notifications<00:03:05.690> I<00:03:06.440> get<00:03:06.650> it<00:03:06.860> still<00:03:07.160> seems<00:03:07.370> to

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
notifications I get it still seems to

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:15.070 
notifications I get it still seems to
always<00:03:07.760> last<00:03:08.240> about<00:03:08.570> a<00:03:08.630> week<00:03:13.240> so<00:03:14.240> it's

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
always last about a week so it's

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.699 
always last about a week so it's
impressive<00:03:15.560> that<00:03:15.590> way<00:03:15.950> even<00:03:16.610> with<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.060> apps<00:03:17.240> I

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
impressive that way even with the apps I

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.410 
impressive that way even with the apps I
think<00:03:18.709> as<00:03:18.860> we<00:03:19.070> get<00:03:19.250> more<00:03:19.280> taxing<00:03:19.910> apps<00:03:20.150> that

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
think as we get more taxing apps that

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.470 
think as we get more taxing apps that
might<00:03:20.600> be<00:03:21.820> more<00:03:22.820> taxing<00:03:23.360> on<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.920> battery<00:03:24.920> life

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
might be more taxing on the battery life

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.449 
might be more taxing on the battery life
for<00:03:26.480> example<00:03:26.959> there's<00:03:27.680> this<00:03:27.830> new<00:03:28.070> pebble

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
for example there's this new pebble

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.699 
for example there's this new pebble
cycling<00:03:28.940> app<00:03:29.150> I<00:03:29.420> mean<00:03:29.990> this<00:03:30.110> is<00:03:30.170> what's<00:03:30.500> really

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
cycling app I mean this is what's really

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.260 
cycling app I mean this is what's really
exciting<00:03:30.950> is<00:03:31.370> you've<00:03:31.550> got<00:03:31.730> developers

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
exciting is you've got developers

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.780 
exciting is you've got developers
creating<00:03:32.720> stuff<00:03:33.050> like<00:03:33.260> this<00:03:33.440> where<00:03:33.740> it's<00:03:34.640> an

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
creating stuff like this where it's an

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.500 
creating stuff like this where it's an
app<00:03:35.000> for<00:03:35.390> your<00:03:36.040> your<00:03:37.040> watch<00:03:37.280> but<00:03:37.760> really<00:03:38.300> the

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
app for your your watch but really the

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.930 
app for your your watch but really the
app<00:03:38.660> that<00:03:38.860> matters<00:03:39.860> is<00:03:40.070> on<00:03:40.220> your<00:03:40.400> phone<00:03:40.670> and

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
app that matters is on your phone and

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.440 
app that matters is on your phone and
it's<00:03:41.900> a<00:03:42.080> smart<00:03:42.320> app<00:03:42.530> that<00:03:42.800> allows<00:03:42.950> you<00:03:43.459> to<00:03:43.490> when

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
it's a smart app that allows you to when

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.080 
it's a smart app that allows you to when
you<00:03:44.540> start<00:03:44.840> cycling<00:03:45.500> it'll<00:03:46.400> figure<00:03:46.610> out<00:03:46.850> that

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
you start cycling it'll figure out that

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.510 
you start cycling it'll figure out that
you're<00:03:47.209> cycling<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:47.900> so<00:03:48.800> that<00:03:48.980> app<00:03:49.190> starts

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
you're cycling and so that app starts

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.730 
you're cycling and so that app starts
and<00:03:49.850> then<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.420> starts<00:03:50.750> your<00:03:50.870> GPS<00:03:51.260> and<00:03:51.500> then<00:03:51.620> it

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
and then it starts your GPS and then it

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.400 
and then it starts your GPS and then it
will<00:03:51.890> also<00:03:52.310> start<00:03:52.700> this<00:03:53.480> app<00:03:53.780> so<00:03:54.140> that<00:03:54.170> I<00:03:54.350> can

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
will also start this app so that I can

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.760 
will also start this app so that I can
keep<00:03:54.740> track<00:03:54.980> of<00:03:55.040> speed<00:03:55.490> and<00:03:56.170> so<00:03:57.170> that's<00:03:57.350> fairly

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
keep track of speed and so that's fairly

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.870 
keep track of speed and so that's fairly
cool<00:03:58.100> and<00:03:59.650> really<00:04:00.650> all<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:01.100> third<00:04:01.310> party<00:04:01.700> apps

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
cool and really all the third party apps

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.150 
cool and really all the third party apps
is<00:04:02.150> what<00:04:02.420> what<00:04:03.020> makes<00:04:03.230> this<00:04:03.440> thing<00:04:03.620> amazing

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
is what what makes this thing amazing

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
technology the most excited I've been

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.130 
technology the most excited I've been
about<00:04:15.890> technology<00:04:16.580> since<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:17.870> first

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
about technology since the first

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.740 
about technology since the first
generation<00:04:18.830> ipod<00:04:19.270> just<00:04:20.270> because<00:04:20.570> it's

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
generation ipod just because it's

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.020 
generation ipod just because it's
game-changing<00:04:20.989> in<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.650> way<00:04:21.770> that<00:04:21.979> it<00:04:22.580> changes

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
game-changing in the way that it changes

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.240
