down into that first flush filter which
fills<00:00:38.750> up<00:00:39.019> the<00:00:39.860> pushes<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:40.309> water<00:00:40.489> up<00:00:40.820> it<00:00:41.150> is

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
fills up the pushes the water up it is

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.020 
fills up the pushes the water up it is
plugged<00:00:41.960> that<00:00:42.230> sends<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:43.100> water<00:00:43.250> across<00:00:43.790> it

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
plugged that sends the water across it

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.340 
plugged that sends the water across it
into<00:00:44.239> our<00:00:44.330> tank<00:00:44.920> it's<00:00:45.920> working<00:00:46.460> oleh<00:00:48.940> and<00:00:50.350> this

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
into our tank it's working oleh and this

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.720 
into our tank it's working oleh and this
is<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:51.650> roof<00:00:51.829> that<00:00:52.010> we're<00:00:52.160> covering<00:00:52.489> we're

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
is the roof that we're covering we're

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.869 
is the roof that we're covering we're
getting<00:00:52.969> this<00:00:53.059> little<00:00:53.329> overhang<00:00:53.840> here<00:00:54.820> so<00:00:55.820> it

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
getting this little overhang here so it

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.100 
getting this little overhang here so it
comes<00:00:56.090> off<00:00:56.300> of<00:00:56.329> there<00:00:56.690> falls<00:00:57.110> down<00:00:57.440> here<00:00:59.110> and

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
comes off of there falls down here and

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.920 
comes off of there falls down here and
all<00:01:00.379> this<00:01:00.620> roof<00:01:00.890> area<00:01:01.190> collects<00:01:01.989> down<00:01:02.989> in<00:01:03.199> this

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
all this roof area collects down in this

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.930 
all this roof area collects down in this
deal<00:01:05.930> here<00:01:06.289> let's<00:01:07.190> see<00:01:07.340> that<00:01:07.490> great<00:01:07.700> water

water there
the<00:01:47.789> point<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.299> continuous<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:48.990> it's

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the point is it's continuous and it's

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.249 
the point is it's continuous and it's
doing<00:01:49.350> all<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:49.560> work<00:01:49.740> for<00:01:49.770> us<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:51.140> this<00:01:52.140> is

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
kind of a little arrangement going onto

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.350 
kind of a little arrangement going onto
here<00:01:55.289> and<00:01:55.470> that's<00:01:56.070> actually<00:01:56.250> getting<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:57.119> big

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
here and that's actually getting to big

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.120 
here and that's actually getting to big
rough<00:01:57.569> areas<00:01:57.990> I'm<00:01:58.560> going<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.770> show<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.069> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
rough areas I'm going to show you in a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.620 
rough areas I'm going to show you in a
second<00:01:59.429> so<00:01:59.550> the<00:01:59.670> big<00:01:59.850> one<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.210> getting<00:02:00.390> that

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
second so the big one is getting that

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.149 
second so the big one is getting that
whole<00:02:00.899> roof<00:02:01.080> area<00:02:01.380> that's<00:02:01.560> dumping<00:02:01.860> into<00:02:01.979> that

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
whole roof area that's dumping into that

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.460 
whole roof area that's dumping into that
drain<00:02:02.520> anything<00:02:03.090> that's<00:02:03.240> up<00:02:03.390> there<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.869> this

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
whole roof area that's coming down here

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.160 
whole roof area that's coming down here
is<00:02:06.479> all<00:02:07.229> coming<00:02:07.470> down<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.800> this<00:02:07.920> one<00:02:08.160> pipe

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
is all coming down in this one pipe

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.680 
is all coming down in this one pipe
which<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.200> then<00:02:10.470> coming<00:02:10.830> over<00:02:11.009> here<00:02:11.690> follow

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
which is then coming over here follow

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.449 
which is then coming over here follow
down<00:02:13.019> head<00:02:13.830> into<00:02:14.130> our<00:02:14.280> big<00:02:14.819> tank<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:16.470> we'll<00:02:17.280> see

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
down head into our big tank so we'll see

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.650 
down head into our big tank so we'll see
how<00:02:17.610> much<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:18.739> dumps<00:02:19.739> in<00:02:19.860> here<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.600> okay<00:02:21.600> so

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
how much this dumps in here and okay so

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.509 
how much this dumps in here and okay so
it<00:02:21.840> might<00:02:21.900> not<00:02:22.080> look<00:02:22.170> like<00:02:22.230> as<00:02:22.530> much<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:23.100> rain

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
it might not look like as much the rain

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.240 
it might not look like as much the rain
is<00:02:23.700> really<00:02:23.940> not<00:02:24.330> coming<00:02:24.600> down<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:25.049> fast<00:02:25.380> but

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
is really not coming down that fast but

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.970 
is really not coming down that fast but
this<00:02:26.489> is<00:02:26.670> putting<00:02:26.940> in<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.510> much<00:02:27.690> water<00:02:28.019> and<00:02:28.290> the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
this is putting in so much water and the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.319 
this is putting in so much water and the
thing<00:02:29.160> is<00:02:29.280> already<00:02:29.519> like<00:02:29.670> half<00:02:29.880> full<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.299> just

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
thing is already like half full I just

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.630 
thing is already like half full I just
looked<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:30.810> there<00:02:30.930> it's<00:02:31.110> insane<00:02:31.530> just<00:02:32.459> by<00:02:32.579> this

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
looked in there it's insane just by this

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.520 
looked in there it's insane just by this
continuous<00:02:33.360> trickle<00:02:33.720> just<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.019> fact<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.380> it

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
continuous trickle just the fact that it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.259 
continuous trickle just the fact that it
keeps<00:02:34.680> pouring<00:02:35.430> keeps<00:02:35.730> pouring<00:02:36.090> keeps

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
keeps pouring keeps pouring keeps

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.410 
keeps pouring keeps pouring keeps
pouring<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.600> filling<00:02:36.870> up<00:02:36.900> this<00:02:37.049> giant
