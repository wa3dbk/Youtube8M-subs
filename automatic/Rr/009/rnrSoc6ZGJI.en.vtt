00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
Cybertronian jet who knows where he got

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.860 
Cybertronian jet who knows where he got
this<00:03:09.049> form<00:03:09.380> from<00:03:09.590> though<00:03:09.799> he<00:03:10.220> may<00:03:10.370> have

transformation<00:03:41.849> I<00:03:42.150> give<00:03:42.719> this<00:03:42.840> mode<00:03:43.109> on<00:03:43.439> a

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
transformation I give this mode on a

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.110 
transformation I give this mode on a
scale<00:03:43.890> of<00:03:43.920> one<00:03:44.189> to<00:03:44.219> ten<00:03:44.579> ten<00:03:44.819> being<00:03:45.060> the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
scale of one to ten ten being the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.539 
scale of one to ten ten being the
highest<00:03:45.299> I<00:03:45.810> gave<00:03:46.530> this<00:03:46.620> about<00:03:46.859> at<00:03:46.950> seven

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
highest I gave this about at seven

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.539 
highest I gave this about at seven
I'm<00:03:48.359> really<00:03:48.540> isn't<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:48.930> bad<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:49.319> mean<00:03:49.650> yeah

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
I'm really isn't that bad I mean yeah

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.309 
I'm really isn't that bad I mean yeah
you<00:03:50.609> can't<00:03:51.000> really<00:03:51.150> do<00:03:51.329> anything<00:03:51.540> with<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:51.900> but

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
you can't really do anything with it but

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:58.309 
you can't really do anything with it but
oh<00:03:52.939> well<00:03:55.340> they<00:03:56.340> did<00:03:56.519> a<00:03:56.700> good<00:03:57.569> job<00:03:57.629> trying<00:03:58.140> to

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
oh well they did a good job trying to

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.890 
oh well they did a good job trying to
get<00:03:58.500> it<00:03:58.620> as<00:03:58.799> close<00:03:58.980> as<00:03:59.189> they<00:03:59.310> could<00:03:59.870> to<00:04:00.870> the

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
get it as close as they could to the

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.149 
get it as close as they could to the
movie<00:04:01.319> and<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.370> transform<00:04:02.879> him<00:04:03.180> yeah<00:04:04.159> it's

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
movie and to transform him yeah it's

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.039 
movie and to transform him yeah it's
basically<00:04:05.389> everything<00:04:06.389> is<00:04:06.480> held<00:04:06.689> together<00:04:06.810> by

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
basically everything is held together by

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:13.309 
basically everything is held together by
pegs<00:04:08.420> they<00:04:09.420> just<00:04:09.750> undo<00:04:10.349> all<00:04:10.859> the<00:04:11.700> pegs<00:04:12.319> that

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
pegs they just undo all the pegs that

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.819 
pegs they just undo all the pegs that
keep<00:04:13.650> them<00:04:13.859> together<00:04:15.259> at<00:04:16.259> least<00:04:16.349> that's<00:04:16.620> how<00:04:16.709> I

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
keep them together at least that's how I

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.740 
keep them together at least that's how I
like<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:17.190> do<00:04:17.459> other<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.729> take<00:04:18.030> their<00:04:18.269> to<00:04:18.539> take

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
like to do other to take their to take

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:28.550 
like to do other to take their to take
their<00:04:22.400> pull<00:04:23.400> this<00:04:23.550> flap<00:04:23.789> down<00:04:27.289> basically<00:04:28.289> rip

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
their pull this flap down basically rip

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.680 
their pull this flap down basically rip
them<00:04:28.680> apart<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:29.280> he<00:04:29.400> comes<00:04:29.610> adjusted<00:04:30.090> pieces

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
them apart and he comes adjusted pieces

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.860 
them apart and he comes adjusted pieces
so<00:04:30.870> easily<00:04:31.580> after<00:04:32.580> you<00:04:32.789> but<00:04:33.449> he<00:04:33.539> does<00:04:33.690> hold
