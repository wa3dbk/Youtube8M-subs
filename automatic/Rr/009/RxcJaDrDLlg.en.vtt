of the bunny ears pink so I've got my
pink<00:01:37.570> construction<00:01:37.750> paper<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:40.530> those<00:01:41.530> are

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
pink construction paper and those are

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.560 
pink construction paper and those are
going<00:01:41.799> to<00:01:41.890> go<00:01:42.039> inside<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:44.590> white<00:01:44.770> ears

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.600 

now<00:01:49.570> you<00:01:49.630> need<00:01:49.930> to<00:01:49.990> add<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.560> little<00:01:50.890> drop<00:01:51.219> of<00:01:51.460> hot

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
now you need to add a little drop of hot

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.969 
now you need to add a little drop of hot
glue<00:01:51.909> to<00:01:51.939> the<00:01:52.299> bottom<00:01:52.659> of<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.930> ear<00:01:53.110> so<00:01:53.409> we<00:01:53.829> can

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
glue to the bottom of the ear so we can

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.740 
glue to the bottom of the ear so we can
stick<00:01:54.219> it<00:01:54.340> on<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.640> back<00:01:54.820> of<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.210> head<00:01:55.390> on<00:01:55.570> the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
stick it on the back of the head on the

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.640 
stick it on the back of the head on the
back<00:01:55.930> of<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.229> egg

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.320 

so<00:02:00.650> they<00:02:00.920> might<00:02:01.100> be<00:02:01.220> leaning<00:02:01.550> forward<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.120> all

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
so they might be leaning forward and all

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.640 
so they might be leaning forward and all
you're<00:02:02.510> going<00:02:02.690> to<00:02:02.840> do<00:02:02.990> is<00:02:03.110> add<00:02:03.260> a<00:02:03.290> little

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.590 
you're going to do is add a little
crease<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.190> it

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
crease to it

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.700 
crease to it
remember<00:02:05.600> don't<00:02:05.810> push<00:02:05.960> too<00:02:05.990> hard<00:02:06.170> this<00:02:06.530> might

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
remember don't push too hard this might

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.440 
remember don't push too hard this might
be<00:02:06.830> a<00:02:06.860> real<00:02:07.070> egg<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:07.970> there<00:02:08.119> we<00:02:08.209> have<00:02:08.330> her

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
be a real egg and so there we have her

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.310 
be a real egg and so there we have her
at<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.630> top<00:02:08.810> of<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:08.990> bunny

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
at the top of the bunny

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.320 
at the top of the bunny
and<00:02:09.530> now<00:02:10.310> we're<00:02:10.490> going<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.700> move<00:02:10.850> over<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.120> our

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
and now we're going to move over to our

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.570 
and now we're going to move over to our
toilet<00:02:11.690> paper<00:02:11.840> roll<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.320> we're<00:02:13.280> going<00:02:13.490> to

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
toilet paper roll and we're going to

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.580 
toilet paper roll and we're going to
cover<00:02:13.820> this<00:02:14.090> with<00:02:14.390> white<00:02:14.720> construction<00:02:15.320> paper

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
cover this with white construction paper

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.890 
cover this with white construction paper
so<00:02:16.190> that<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.610> looks<00:02:16.880> like<00:02:16.970> it's<00:02:17.180> part<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.510> the

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
so that it looks like it's part of the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.250 
so that it looks like it's part of the
lower<00:02:18.230> half<00:02:18.410> of<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.740> bunny

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.930 

and<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:23.010> last<00:02:23.190> thing<00:02:23.400> I'm<00:02:23.459> going<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.670> add<00:02:23.730> is

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
and the last thing I'm going to add is

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.250 
and the last thing I'm going to add is
little<00:02:24.209> feet<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.840> looks<00:02:24.989> like<00:02:25.080> he's

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
little feet so it looks like he's

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.350 
little feet so it looks like he's
standing<00:02:25.680> up<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:26.040> think<00:02:26.340> just<00:02:26.519> little<00:02:26.760> feet

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
standing up I think just little feet

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.020 
standing up I think just little feet
sticking<00:02:27.390> out<00:02:27.930> it's<00:02:28.140> gonna<00:02:28.230> be<00:02:28.409> really<00:02:28.590> cute
