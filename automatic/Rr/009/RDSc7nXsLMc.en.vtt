00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
about today what I talked about was

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.930 
about today what I talked about was
sensitivity<00:00:32.200> in<00:00:32.259> Call<00:00:32.529> of<00:00:32.559> Duty<00:00:33.010> and<00:00:33.550> this<00:00:33.790> is

sensitivity in Call of Duty and this is

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.700 
sensitivity in Call of Duty and this is
a<00:00:33.969> huge<00:00:34.420> part<00:00:34.690> of<00:00:34.780> your<00:00:34.899> game<00:00:35.020> you<00:00:35.230> can<00:00:35.379> get<00:00:35.559> all

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
a huge part of your game you can get all

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.770 
a huge part of your game you can get all
the<00:00:35.829> advanced<00:00:36.280> tips<00:00:36.489> you<00:00:36.670> want<00:00:36.910> but<00:00:37.510> in<00:00:37.629> the

the advanced tips you want but in the

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.050 
the advanced tips you want but in the
end<00:00:37.990> the<00:00:38.680> core<00:00:38.980> of<00:00:39.280> a<00:00:39.400> player's<00:00:39.700> has

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.060 
end the core of a player's has

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.800 
end the core of a player's has
sensitivity<00:00:40.750> and<00:00:40.840> how<00:00:40.960> well<00:00:41.200> you<00:00:41.410> can<00:00:41.530> aim<00:00:42.810> so

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 
sensitivity and how well you can aim so

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.960 
sensitivity and how well you can aim so
I've<00:00:44.500> seen<00:00:44.680> a<00:00:44.740> lot<00:00:44.800> of<00:00:44.980> other<00:00:45.100> commentators<00:00:45.820> -

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
I've seen a lot of other commentators -

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.490 
I've seen a lot of other commentators -
stab<00:00:46.300> at<00:00:46.480> this<00:00:46.600> and<00:00:46.780> they<00:00:46.870> do<00:00:46.930> an<00:00:47.170> excellent

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
stab at this and they do an excellent

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.490 
stab at this and they do an excellent
job<00:00:48.060> but<00:00:49.060> they<00:00:49.720> really<00:00:50.710> only<00:00:50.739> talk<00:00:51.130> about

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
job but they really only talk about

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.790 
job but they really only talk about
console<00:00:53.500> specific<00:00:54.250> things<00:00:55.650> they'll<00:00:56.650> mention

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
console specific things they'll mention

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.400 
console specific things they'll mention
things<00:00:57.190> like<00:00:57.750> personal<00:00:58.750> preference<00:00:59.200> is<00:00:59.350> the

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
things like personal preference is the

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.290 
things like personal preference is the
most<00:00:59.590> important<00:01:00.010> which<00:01:00.220> I<00:01:00.430> totally<00:01:01.000> agree

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
most important which I totally agree

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.240 
most important which I totally agree
with<00:01:01.329> personal<00:01:01.930> preference<00:01:02.290> in<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:02.530> end<00:01:02.710> it's

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
with personal preference in the end it's

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.679 
with personal preference in the end it's
gotta<00:01:03.399> be<00:01:03.520> more<00:01:03.730> important<00:01:04.149> than<00:01:04.180> everything

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
gotta be more important than everything

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.080 
gotta be more important than everything
because<00:01:05.470> you<00:01:06.159> can<00:01:06.310> have<00:01:06.399> a<00:01:06.430> high<00:01:06.640> sensitivity

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
because you can have a high sensitivity

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.660 
because you can have a high sensitivity
and<00:01:07.299> be<00:01:07.720> about<00:01:07.869> to<00:01:07.960> turn<00:01:08.049> on<00:01:08.200> kids<00:01:08.500> a<00:01:08.710> ton<00:01:09.009> but

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
and be about to turn on kids a ton but

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.209 
and be about to turn on kids a ton but
if<00:01:09.909> you<00:01:10.030> can't<00:01:10.299> hit<00:01:10.869> all<00:01:11.079> your<00:01:11.319> shots<00:01:11.560> then

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:12.219 
if you can't hit all your shots then

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:13.770 
if you can't hit all your shots then
you're<00:01:12.729> never<00:01:12.880> going<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:13.119> be<00:01:13.240> as<00:01:13.359> good<00:01:13.569> of<00:01:13.600> a

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
you're never going to be as good of a

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.169 
you're never going to be as good of a
player<00:01:13.990> as<00:01:14.259> you<00:01:14.289> could<00:01:14.679> be<00:01:15.179> these

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
player as you could be these

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:18.239 
player as you could be these
commentators<00:01:16.630> have<00:01:16.960> really<00:01:17.319> small<00:01:17.619> ranges

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:18.249 
commentators have really small ranges

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:21.059 
commentators have really small ranges
for<00:01:18.689> sensitivities<00:01:19.689> you<00:01:19.719> should<00:01:19.990> use<00:01:20.170> I<00:01:20.439> think

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:21.069 
for sensitivities you should use I think

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:22.949 
for sensitivities you should use I think
actually<00:01:21.579> would<00:01:21.850> recommend<00:01:22.329> kind<00:01:22.569> of<00:01:22.630> a<00:01:22.689> wider

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:22.959 
actually would recommend kind of a wider

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:26.279 
actually would recommend kind of a wider
range<00:01:23.770> because<00:01:24.609> in<00:01:25.389> the<00:01:25.569> end<00:01:25.689> it's<00:01:26.049> really

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
range because in the end it's really

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.550 
range because in the end it's really
about<00:01:26.499> personal<00:01:27.009> preference<00:01:27.249> like<00:01:27.520> I<00:01:27.639> said

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
about personal preference like I said

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.889 
about personal preference like I said
some<00:01:29.560> people<00:01:29.619> say<00:01:29.979> okay<00:01:30.850> I've<00:01:31.090> seen<00:01:31.270> jaws<00:01:31.600> say

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
some people say okay I've seen jaws say

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.889 
some people say okay I've seen jaws say
he<00:01:32.200> says<00:01:32.439> the<00:01:33.340> lower<00:01:33.549> the<00:01:33.819> better<00:01:33.999> which<00:01:34.509> is

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
he says the lower the better which is

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.749 
he says the lower the better which is
true<00:01:35.109> for<00:01:35.139> Xbox<00:01:35.770> been<00:01:36.009> definitely<00:01:36.579> not

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
true for Xbox been definitely not

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.190 
true for Xbox been definitely not
necessarily<00:01:37.359> true<00:01:37.539> for<00:01:37.569> ps3<00:01:40.020> none<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.139> these

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
necessarily true for ps3 none of these

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.840 
necessarily true for ps3 none of these
commentators<00:01:41.740> seem<00:01:42.130> to<00:01:42.310> mention<00:01:42.490> both

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
commentators seem to mention both

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.179 
commentators seem to mention both
consoles<00:01:43.420> what<00:01:43.659> they<00:01:43.810> do<00:01:43.869> as<00:01:44.619> they<00:01:44.889> play

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
consoles what they do as they play

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.059 
consoles what they do as they play
mainly<00:01:46.149> on<00:01:46.359> one<00:01:46.630> console<00:01:47.200> so<00:01:47.740> they<00:01:47.889> make

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
mainly on one console so they make

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.459 
mainly on one console so they make
generalizations<00:01:48.549> from<00:01:49.029> both<00:01:49.420> using<00:01:50.200> just

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:50.469 
generalizations from both using just

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:51.870 
generalizations from both using just
their<00:01:50.560> one<00:01:50.770> console<00:01:51.219> the<00:01:51.279> ones<00:01:51.459> I<00:01:51.609> have

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
their one console the ones I have

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.699 
their one console the ones I have
watchfully<00:01:52.450> they're<00:01:52.869> not<00:01:53.049> with<00:01:53.200> gamer<00:01:53.560> tag

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
watchfully they're not with gamer tag

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:57.199 
watchfully they're not with gamer tag
team<00:01:53.979> art<00:01:54.219> and<00:01:54.779> extras<00:01:55.779> they<00:01:56.409> talk<00:01:56.649> about

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:57.209 
team art and extras they talk about

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:59.879 
team art and extras they talk about
having<00:01:58.209> really<00:01:58.389> low<00:01:58.659> sense<00:01:58.929> maybe<00:01:59.200> like<00:01:59.499> three

00:01:59.879 --> 00:01:59.889 
having really low sense maybe like three

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:03.029 
having really low sense maybe like three
or<00:02:00.189> two<00:02:00.579> five<00:02:00.819> and<00:02:01.209> that's<00:02:01.840> that's<00:02:02.469> good

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
or two five and that's that's good

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.279 
or two five and that's that's good
that's<00:02:03.459> fine<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:03.909> dandy<00:02:04.029> for<00:02:04.209> Xbox<00:02:04.869> but<00:02:05.139> none

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
that's fine and dandy for Xbox but none

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.019 
that's fine and dandy for Xbox but none
of<00:02:05.380> them<00:02:05.499> seem<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.770> talking<00:02:06.189> about<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.490> ps3

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:07.029 
of them seem to talking about the ps3

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:10.080 
of them seem to talking about the ps3
side<00:02:07.270> of<00:02:07.419> things<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:08.039> not<00:02:09.039> another<00:02:09.610> vice

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
versa works - none of the ps3 guys seem

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.509 
versa works - none of the ps3 guys seem
to<00:02:12.310> mention<00:02:12.640> about<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.720> Xbox<00:02:14.560> people<00:02:14.980> so

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
to mention about the Xbox people so

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.229 
to mention about the Xbox people so
alright<00:02:16.239> so<00:02:16.510> also<00:02:17.069> really<00:02:18.069> what's<00:02:18.909> going<00:02:19.090> on

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
alright so also really what's going on

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:19.570 
alright so also really what's going on
here

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
here

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.880 
here
is<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:20.240> lot<00:02:20.570> of<00:02:20.660> people<00:02:20.870> don't<00:02:20.990> know<00:02:21.170> that<00:02:21.440> the

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
is a lot of people don't know that the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.970 
is a lot of people don't know that the
Xbox<00:02:22.280> controller<00:02:22.670> actually<00:02:22.970> has<00:02:23.920> it's<00:02:24.920> a

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
Xbox controller actually has it's a

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.260 
Xbox controller actually has it's a
little<00:02:25.190> bit<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.340> joysticks<00:02:25.910> are<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.090> little

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
little bit the joysticks are a little

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.700 
little bit the joysticks are a little
bit<00:02:26.510> harder<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:26.960> press<00:02:27.380> down<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:29.710> ps3

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
bit harder to press down so the ps3

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.500 
bit harder to press down so the ps3
joysticks<00:02:31.130> are<00:02:31.250> just<00:02:31.490> a<00:02:31.550> little<00:02:31.820> bit<00:02:31.940> smoother

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
joysticks are just a little bit smoother

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.070 
joysticks are just a little bit smoother
and<00:02:32.780> they<00:02:32.930> have<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.170> lot<00:02:33.410> more<00:02:33.440> precision<00:02:35.080> so

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
and they have a lot more precision so

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.380 
and they have a lot more precision so
because<00:02:37.040> of<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.340> want<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.880> stick<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.150> the

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
because of this you want to stick to the

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.140 
because of this you want to stick to the
lower<00:02:38.570> sensitivity<00:02:38.990> on<00:02:39.560> Xbox<00:02:40.070> then<00:02:40.760> someone

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
lower sensitivity on Xbox then someone

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.820 
lower sensitivity on Xbox then someone
on<00:02:41.390> ps3<00:02:41.660> would<00:02:42.080> so<00:02:42.800> you<00:02:42.860> can<00:02:43.220> still<00:02:43.520> have<00:02:44.830> play

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
on ps3 would so you can still have play

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.350 
on ps3 would so you can still have play
on<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.040> xbox<00:02:46.430> but<00:02:46.520> still<00:02:46.790> have<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.030> level<00:02:47.300> of

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
on the xbox but still have the level of

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.470 
on the xbox but still have the level of
precision<00:02:47.510> then<00:02:48.020> you<00:02:48.110> could<00:02:48.620> on<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:48.980> ps3

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
precision then you could on the ps3

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.100 
precision then you could on the ps3
fortunately<00:02:50.480> that's<00:02:50.570> gonna<00:02:50.840> sacrifice

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
fortunately that's gonna sacrifice

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.650 
fortunately that's gonna sacrifice
reaction<00:02:51.950> time<00:02:52.190> which<00:02:52.700> kind<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:52.970> sucks<00:02:53.330> for<00:02:53.600> us

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
reaction time which kind of sucks for us

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.520 
reaction time which kind of sucks for us
Xbox<00:02:54.140> guys<00:02:54.350> but<00:02:55.010> that's<00:02:55.100> alright<00:02:55.930> so<00:02:56.930> because

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
Xbox guys but that's alright so because

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.800 
Xbox guys but that's alright so because
this<00:02:57.680> I<00:02:57.830> would<00:02:57.950> recommend<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.640> sensitivity<00:02:59.600> of

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
this I would recommend a sensitivity of

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.470 
this I would recommend a sensitivity of
around<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.380> three<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.070> six<00:03:01.580> again<00:03:02.120> it's

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
around a three to a six again it's

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.120 
around a three to a six again it's
personal<00:03:02.870> preference<00:03:03.200> so<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:03.620> can<00:03:03.770> extend

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
personal preference so you can extend

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.270 
personal preference so you can extend
that<00:03:04.310> range<00:03:04.520> if<00:03:04.790> you<00:03:04.970> need<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:05.660> ps3<00:03:06.620> probably

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
that range if you need to ps3 probably

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.040 
that range if you need to ps3 probably
amount<00:03:07.459> of<00:03:07.580> five<00:03:07.820> to<00:03:08.060> eight<00:03:08.330> maybe<00:03:08.630> a<00:03:08.720> nine<00:03:09.020> a

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
amount of five to eight maybe a nine a

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.410 
amount of five to eight maybe a nine a
nine<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:09.410> kind<00:03:09.590> of<00:03:09.650> pushing<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.100> but<00:03:11.090> I<00:03:11.180> did

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
nine is kind of pushing it but I did

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.000 
nine is kind of pushing it but I did
play<00:03:11.570> them<00:03:11.780> nine<00:03:12.020> for<00:03:12.260> a<00:03:12.290> while<00:03:12.500> there<00:03:12.770> and<00:03:12.800> I

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
play them nine for a while there and I

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.970 
play them nine for a while there and I
did<00:03:13.190> pretty<00:03:13.459> good<00:03:13.600> so<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:16.730> thing<00:03:16.970> is<00:03:17.800> if<00:03:18.800> you

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
did pretty good so the thing is if you

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.540 
did pretty good so the thing is if you
have<00:03:19.160> two<00:03:19.790> consoles<00:03:20.300> like<00:03:20.420> I<00:03:20.720> do<00:03:20.780> then<00:03:21.440> it's<00:03:22.220> a

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
have two consoles like I do then it's a

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.150 
have two consoles like I do then it's a
totally<00:03:23.209> different<00:03:23.270> story

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
totally different story

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.460 
totally different story
what<00:03:25.160> you<00:03:25.280> want<00:03:25.430> to<00:03:25.550> do<00:03:25.700> here<00:03:26.209> is<00:03:26.390> not<00:03:26.780> keep<00:03:27.320> the

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
what you want to do here is not keep the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.550 
what you want to do here is not keep the
same<00:03:27.709> sensitivity<00:03:28.130> but<00:03:28.940> keep<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.410> towards<00:03:30.410> the

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
same sensitivity but keep it towards the

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.860 
same sensitivity but keep it towards the
in<00:03:31.160> between<00:03:31.640> these<00:03:31.760> two<00:03:32.000> ranges<00:03:32.269> here<00:03:32.750> you

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
in between these two ranges here you

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.680 
in between these two ranges here you
want<00:03:33.050> to<00:03:33.140> have<00:03:33.290> them<00:03:33.500> more<00:03:34.430> reasonable<00:03:35.060> you

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
want to have them more reasonable you

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.430 
want to have them more reasonable you
don't<00:03:35.930> it<00:03:36.410> all<00:03:36.530> I<00:03:36.560> have<00:03:38.050> sorry<00:03:39.050> about<00:03:39.230> that<00:03:39.260> I

don't it all I have sorry about that I

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.840 
don't it all I have sorry about that I
thought<00:03:39.680> I<00:03:39.739> heard<00:03:39.890> something<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.550> don't<00:03:40.730> want

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
to have too much of a drastic change

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.350 
to have too much of a drastic change
between<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.370> consoles<00:03:43.850> or<00:03:44.060> else<00:03:44.209> you're
