00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
guys are about the Joker so they don't

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.170 
guys are about the Joker so they don't
have<00:00:50.280> any<00:00:50.579> kind<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:52.879> abilities<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.120> are

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
have any kind of abilities that are

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.590 
have any kind of abilities that are
superhuman<00:00:54.899> like<00:00:55.500> no<00:00:55.860> super<00:00:56.309> string<00:00:56.640> or<00:00:57.210> no

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
superhuman like no super string or no

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.069 
superhuman like no super string or no
super<00:00:58.020> speed<00:00:58.320> nothing<00:00:59.309> like<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.809> they<00:01:00.809> both

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
super speed nothing like that they both

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.290 
super speed nothing like that they both
are<00:01:01.410> very<00:01:01.680> crazy<00:01:02.190> they<00:01:02.579> both<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
are very crazy they both have the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.630 
are very crazy they both have the
mindset<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.870> kill<00:01:04.260> each<00:01:04.439> other<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.070> this

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
mindset to kill each other so this

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.370 
mindset to kill each other so this
probably<00:01:06.119> will<00:01:06.299> end<00:01:06.510> up<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.810> fight<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.350> the

he just caused pure chaos destroyed
hospitals<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:27.210> mean<00:04:27.750> he<00:04:28.350> did<00:04:28.560> all<00:04:28.740> kinds<00:04:28.980> of

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
hospitals I mean he did all kinds of

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.690 
hospitals I mean he did all kinds of
crazy<00:04:29.400> stuff<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:31.100> Jack<00:04:32.100> was<00:04:32.460> no<00:04:32.640> slouch

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
crazy stuff and Jack was no slouch

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.000 
crazy stuff and Jack was no slouch
either<00:04:33.240> he<00:04:33.660> did<00:04:33.840> some<00:04:34.020> pretty<00:04:34.170> bad<00:04:34.470> things<00:04:34.500> as

well<00:04:35.250> but<00:04:35.280> he<00:04:35.850> I<00:04:36.120> think<00:04:36.900> was<00:04:37.080> a<00:04:37.110> little<00:04:37.440> bit

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
well but he I think was a little bit

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.940 
well but he I think was a little bit
more<00:04:37.920> evil<00:04:38.400> in<00:04:38.900> his<00:04:39.900> film<00:04:40.910> and<00:04:42.290> as<00:04:43.290> for<00:04:43.590> who<00:04:43.830> has

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
more evil in his film and as for who has

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.390 
more evil in his film and as for who has
the<00:04:44.280> brain<00:04:44.580> power<00:04:44.940> over<00:04:45.510> the<00:04:45.630> other<00:04:45.810> well<00:04:46.530> they

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
the brain power over the other well they

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.580 
the brain power over the other well they
both<00:04:47.610> are<00:04:47.880> the<00:04:48.030> Joker<00:04:48.360> so<00:04:48.870> they<00:04:49.110> both<00:04:49.320> are

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
both are the Joker so they both are

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.070 
both are the Joker so they both are
smart<00:04:50.040> I'm<00:04:50.940> not<00:04:51.120> sure<00:04:51.210> who<00:04:51.570> to<00:04:51.600> give<00:04:51.810> it<00:04:51.840> to
