we've got coyotes so it's it's really

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.150 
we've got coyotes so it's it's really
just<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.630> walk<00:03:10.810> on<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:11.020> park<00:03:11.290> really<00:03:11.650> now<00:03:12.010> this

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
just a walk on the park really now this

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.320 
just a walk on the park really now this
shot<00:03:12.310> we're<00:03:12.490> playing<00:03:12.670> up<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:12.940> elevated

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
shot we're playing up to the elevated

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.490 
shot we're playing up to the elevated
green<00:03:13.450> here<00:03:13.660> what's<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.990> what's<00:03:14.260> your<00:03:14.320> advice

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
green here what's the what's your advice

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.229 
green here what's the what's your advice
here<00:03:14.830> well<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:15.460> usually<00:03:15.700> plays<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.090> little

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
here well it usually plays a little

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.990 
here well it usually plays a little
longer<00:03:16.570> probably<00:03:17.530> about<00:03:17.709> 78<00:03:18.310> yards<00:03:18.640> longer

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
longer probably about 78 yards longer

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.630 
longer probably about 78 yards longer
because<00:03:19.300> it's<00:03:19.480> uphill<00:03:19.810> so<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:21.400> thing<00:03:21.610> is

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
because it's uphill so the thing is

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.400 
because it's uphill so the thing is
don't<00:03:22.120> be<00:03:22.300> short<00:03:22.510> in<00:03:22.720> those<00:03:22.870> traps<00:03:23.170> you're

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
don't be short in those traps you're

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.660 
don't be short in those traps you're
better<00:03:23.590> off<00:03:23.680> being<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.070> little<00:03:24.250> longer<00:03:24.430> than

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
better off being a little longer than

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.340 
better off being a little longer than
short<00:03:24.910> okay<00:03:25.390> and<00:03:25.600> it's<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.870> actually<00:03:26.200> it's<00:03:26.320> a

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
short okay and it's it actually it's a

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.160 
short okay and it's it actually it's a
good<00:03:26.530> it's<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.890> easier<00:03:27.459> pin<00:03:27.730> today<00:03:28.030> it's<00:03:28.870> a<00:03:28.959> deep

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
good it's a easier pin today it's a deep

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.620 
good it's a easier pin today it's a deep
pin<00:03:29.470> so<00:03:29.709> you<00:03:29.770> got<00:03:29.920> lots<00:03:30.130> of<00:03:30.340> green<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:31.420> most

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
pin so you got lots of green the most

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.210 
pin so you got lots of green the most
difficult<00:03:32.050> shot<00:03:32.260> is<00:03:32.410> when<00:03:32.440> they<00:03:32.709> put<00:03:32.860> a<00:03:32.890> reg<00:03:33.100> at

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
difficult shot is when they put a reg at

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.400 
difficult shot is when they put a reg at
the<00:03:33.310> front<00:03:33.550> false<00:03:34.540> front<00:03:34.900> there<00:03:35.110> and<00:03:35.140> then<00:03:35.320> you

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
the front false front there and then you

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.870 
the front false front there and then you
can<00:03:35.530> get<00:03:35.620> into<00:03:35.830> trouble<00:03:36.130> pretty<00:03:36.280> easily<00:03:36.489> okay

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
can get into trouble pretty easily okay
