Hi guys! I'm Silvano Del Pesce

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.726
With this video we start a series of lessons about learning how to play drums!

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:32.365
Today we start with the snare that is the heart of the drums.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:39.506
First we need to understand how to place the snare.

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:48.715
You reach the right position when the snare skin it's at the same height of your lower abdomen.

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:53.353
Let's now talk about the correct position for playing the snare...

00:00:53.353 --> 00:01:01.161
To maintain the proper position we have to place our arms as if we were carrying a trayÉ

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:07.000
That's the correct position, it's important to be as relaxed as we can.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.970
You don't want your arms to be tense when you play.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.044
You wrist must be placed as if you wanted to slap the skin of the snare.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:20.246
Just like that...

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:25.051
You have to hold the drum stick at a third of it's length 

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:29.189
creating a grommet with your thumb and your index finger

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.491
never squeezing to much.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:37.730
By doing this your fingers have become the fulcrum of a lever...

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.102
We have to say that there are many methods of holding drum sticks...

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:47.507
The one that we'll use during this video-series it's called "matched grip"

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:49.175
because of the exact same position of the two hands.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:53.012
This kind of method it's also called "German grip"

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:56.382
and that's because there's another one called "Matched Grip French"

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:59.686
and also another one called "Matched Grip American".

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:03.823
In many videos and concerts you probably have seen also this way of holding the drum sticks

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:12.899
that were introduced in marching bands, where the drum player needs to play and march

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:19.606
without moving the drum with his legs.

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:22.876
To prevent the drummer to keep his shoulder always raised 

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:26.179
someone thought that was better to hold the stick in this position...

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:32.085
In this series we'll use the "German Matched Grip" because it's more practical for beginners.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:39.559
The first thing to do, it's learn how to hit the snare

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:46.699
and how to master the bounce of the stick on the skin.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:52.305
The first technique we need to master it's called "full stroke".

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:57.043
that consists in hitting the skin by using only your wrist motion.

00:02:57.043 --> 00:03:04.484
To hit the snare properly we're not going to use only the wrist motion

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:14.694
but also our fingers's and our arm's too (our arm's when we need to hit with more strength). 

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:19.132
Let's get back to the "full stroke" technique...

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:27.807
We need to start with the stick perpendicular to the floor, just like that... 

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:32.045
then we hit the snare once and we return in the starting positionÉ.

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:41.354
Remember to keep always the correct position that we've discussed before in this video

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:49.262
To simplify that, try to remember that it's like you're carrying a tray with your handsÉ

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:54.334
Try to hit the snare by using only the wrist motion...

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:59.005
We need to do the same exact thing with the other hand...

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:03.543
For the most of us the left hand it's weaker of the twoÉ

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:11.884
so try to practice until the two hands produce the same sound.

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:19.425
When you practice try not to push the head of the stick on the snare's skin.

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:21.694
That's what you don't want to happen...

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:29.669
You'll hear the difference by the vibrato produced by the pressure of the stick on the skin.

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.840
Remember to return in the starting position after hitting the skin.

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:42.515
Pay attention on the regularity of the two hands 

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:49.922
and try to care about the quality of the sound.

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:56.896
I'll repeat this all along this series: the quality of the stroke it's important, not the speed.

00:04:56.896 --> 00:05:01.034
That means practicing on the quality of the sound, and on keeping the right position.

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:06.139
Speed will come with time and hard practice.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:13.379
Practicing with the metronome will be very helpful...

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:19.786
Start with a low speed and play in unison with the metronome click...

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:26.459
always trying to care about regularity and quality of your strokes.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:33.066
When you have mastered this motion with the two hands...

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:35.468
you can start to alternate the two hands...

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:44.544
Try to play with the same intensity and volume with both the two sticks.

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:50.283
To practice on that you can use some strokes sequences

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:54.787
that you can download from the dedicated area on MusicOff.com

00:05:54.787 --> 00:05:59.525
You'll find sequences with 3 strokes with the left and 3 with the right

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:04.097
4/4, 6/6 and 8/8.

00:06:04.097 --> 00:06:11.838
Obviously in a sequence of 8 strokes, you need to care more about intensity

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:15.007
because they have to sound the same with the left hand as with the right. 

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:25.051
For now that's all guys! In the next video I'll show other techniques

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:27.520
that involve your fingers' motion and your arm's movement too.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.023
Good luck with your practice. See you on the next video!
