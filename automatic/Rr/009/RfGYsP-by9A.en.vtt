00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
we'll be touching on a few of the ones

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.510 
we'll be touching on a few of the ones
that<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.469> can<00:00:34.620> do<00:00:34.739> during<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.100> laning<00:00:35.250> phase

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
that you can do during the laning phase

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.639

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
and just as we're making this video I

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.200 
and just as we're making this video I
was<00:00:37.860> very<00:00:38.040> excited<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.640> learn<00:00:38.760> about<00:00:38.820> these

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
was very excited to learn about these

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.240 
was very excited to learn about these
concepts<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.930> learned<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.500> great<00:00:40.620> deal<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.070> I

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
concepts I learned a great deal and I

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.470 
concepts I learned a great deal and I
hope<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.520> guys<00:00:41.640> will<00:00:41.850> too<00:00:44.180> so<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> first

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
hope you guys will too so the first

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.720 
hope you guys will too so the first
concept<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.989> pretty<00:00:46.020> simple<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.340> lane<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
concept is pretty simple in a lane the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.430 
concept is pretty simple in a lane the
opponent<00:00:48.120> will<00:00:48.239> almost<00:00:48.420> always<00:00:48.719> be<00:00:48.930> standing

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
opponent will almost always be standing

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.380 
opponent will almost always be standing
across<00:00:49.649> from<00:00:49.770> minions<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:51.030> happens

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
across from minions this happens

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.939 
across from minions this happens
naturally<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.140> simply<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.530> avoid<00:00:52.620> taking

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
naturally and is simply to avoid taking

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.920 
naturally and is simply to avoid taking
free<00:00:53.309> damage<00:00:53.489> if<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.570> move<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.840> your

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
free damage if you move to your

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.810 
free damage if you move to your
opponent's<00:00:55.320> side<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:56.190> very<00:00:56.370> likely<00:00:56.670> that

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
opponent's side it's very likely that

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.279 
opponent's side it's very likely that
you<00:00:57.030> will<00:00:57.059> move<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.600> other<00:00:57.690> side<00:00:57.899> and

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
you will move to the other side and

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.069 
you will move to the other side and
that's<00:00:58.440> something<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.829> can<00:00:58.949> abuse<00:00:59.190> how<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.210> if

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
that's something you can abuse how so if

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.779 
that's something you can abuse how so if
your<00:01:01.260> jungler<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:01.829> later<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.309> coming<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
your jungler or later is coming for a

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.700 
your jungler or later is coming for a
gank<00:01:03.059> first<00:01:03.899> thing<00:01:04.019> your<00:01:04.140> opponent<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.530> move

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
gank first thing your opponent to move

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.870 
gank first thing your opponent to move
towards<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.100> side<00:01:05.280> they're<00:01:05.489> coming<00:01:05.760> from

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
towards the side they're coming from

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.399 
towards the side they're coming from
will<00:01:06.210> increase<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> chances<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.170> gang

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
will increase the chances of that gang

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.740 
will increase the chances of that gang
being<00:01:07.710> successful<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.909> don't<00:01:09.330> even<00:01:09.420> have

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
being successful so you don't even have

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.690 
being successful so you don't even have
to<00:01:09.810> give<00:01:10.140> away<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.560> gank<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.250> just<00:01:11.460> push

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
to give away the gank you can just push

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.100 
to give away the gank you can just push
your<00:01:11.939> opponent<00:01:12.000> towards<00:01:12.659> your<00:01:12.780> gankers

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
your opponent towards your gankers

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.800 
your opponent towards your gankers
exactly<00:01:16.700> this<00:01:17.700> next<00:01:17.909> concept<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.390> about<00:01:18.600> using

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
exactly this next concept is about using

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.929 
exactly this next concept is about using
site<00:01:19.170> or<00:01:19.439> lack<00:01:19.740> thereof<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.580> force<00:01:20.790> your

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
site or lack thereof to force your

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.460 
site or lack thereof to force your
opponent<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.420> other<00:01:21.600> enemies<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.229> map

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
opponent and other enemies on the map

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.770 
opponent and other enemies on the map
into<00:01:22.830> playing<00:01:23.040> differently<00:01:23.580> again<00:01:24.509> there<00:01:24.689> are

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
into playing differently again there are

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.149 
into playing differently again there are
lots<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.049> things<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.350> can<00:01:25.409> do<00:01:25.650> with<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:25.920> so

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
lots of things you can do with this so

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.620 
lots of things you can do with this so
I'll<00:01:26.250> focus<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> ones<00:01:27.000> concerning<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
I'll focus on the ones concerning the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.630 
I'll focus on the ones concerning the
laning<00:01:27.900> phase<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.350> know<00:01:28.740> I've<00:01:29.009> experienced

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
laning phase I know I've experienced

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.640 
laning phase I know I've experienced
that<00:01:29.729> one<00:01:29.909> often<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.479> get<00:01:30.750> shoved<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.290> my<00:01:31.409> Tower

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
that one often I get shoved to my Tower

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.410 
that one often I get shoved to my Tower
and<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> enemy<00:01:32.369> laner<00:01:32.640> disappears<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
and the enemy laner disappears in the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.149 
and the enemy laner disappears in the
fog<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.780> war<00:01:33.810> yeah<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:35.040> be

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
fog of war yeah and that can be

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.490 
fog of war yeah and that can be
dangerous<00:01:35.340> vote<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.450> your<00:01:36.570> team<00:01:36.780> the
