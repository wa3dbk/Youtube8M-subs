00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 there are people who welcome to this new 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.600
 video of my mega nintendo bona channel and 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.880
 well we are already narrating here what is 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.309
 for me, the doctor 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.230
 this is a video about the two players 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.509
 that will come out in new super smash bros 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.449
 wii and 3ds until now has shown us 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:22.680
 many characters many characters from 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.449
 the old generation and this new 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.300
 super smash that have shown us good 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.019
 let's start with the top video in my opinion 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.899
 of the ops characters in this explained 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.630
 ops is the strongest character 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.989
 considering american there is as instagram 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.480
 of god meditating is the one that most interest 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.430
 in sauce is born good in this case would be 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.559
 seen the strongest characters that were 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.829
 come in this game let's start with the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.829
 video 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.400
 at number 5 we put the mini and 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.680
 you see that it is a character observe that 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.809
 will be very strong appears with the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.260
 previous reads has not had a good 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.690
 position has been a player the mister not 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.610
 he has been a very strong player who 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.200
 let say 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.790
 but in this room you see that with the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.340
 speed that this game has, you can see that 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.510
 I live and make a character better than 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.850
 the previous saga 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.010
 it looks like he has his same abilities 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.640
 previous but I think it could be 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.240
 a character who talks a lot about talking 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.240
 in this game 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:34.260
 good and in position number 4 I put a 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.200
 a pikachu pikachu was a 'top' player 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.590
 in the previous room of this super max 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.929
 brod 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.689
 in this pikachu game you see that it has 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.780
 its minimal attacks you see its speed 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.440
 what if there are many attacks that 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.909
 can do 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.460
 many appearances are seen 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.069
 it looks like it's going to have its same attacks 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.579
 including changing a bit of 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.109
 speed a little faster and I'm going to 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.869
 make this player continue without ductor 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:07.270
 the thing so far can not be said 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.910
 nothing because we have not tried the fire in 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.430
 yes but this is 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.450
 analyzing well 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.109
 could make this player a top 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.109
 we went to the next post 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.970
 the number 3 place I put nothing else and 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.940
 nothing less than very filtered and the wiifit 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.090
 trainer is a new player in this saga 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.860
 eat you see in the video that there was 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.890
 show you see it's a character 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:43.270
 very quick to for the sincere if we are 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:46.210
 it looks very fast and me 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.730
 at my option it seems that it could be a 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.560
 top player I know he has many 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.570
 skills then get very 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.570
 fast I know what 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:03.510
 at sight previewed at a glance 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.270
 I could say that it is a weight that is going to be 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.120
 a top character good to me seem to me 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.400
 it seems you too if you stand out 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.100
 it could also appear and good 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.460
 let's pass someone indisposed 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.460
 when tax number 2 and I put nothing 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.580
 more and nothing less than he asked me to file 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:27.000
 pinging is a top character in the room 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.940
 previous of supermax world world a 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.590
 character that was in as the second 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.060
 plus the second one on the tennis list is 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.910
 a character that has the best 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.130
 serious in this topic you see that it's going to 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.890
 own the same attacks they had 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.630
 the previous sagas and it could be a 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.630
 very good character for this saga 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.360
 well I have put number one I do not 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.110
 I put nothing more and nothing less than the leader 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.020
 Italian in Spanish is seen to be a 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.510
 character very at first sight looks very or 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.440
 you see that it has not be very suitable 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.630
 we follow very good attacks you who 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.440
 is going to be a very top character 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.739
 the 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.830
 and I think it seems to me that their 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.660
 attacks that has to grab things 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.450
 of 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.300
 his tactics his flight attacks to 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.860
 simple view for me it seems to me that it's going to 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.400
 be one of the best characters in 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.330
 this super smartbox 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.120
 but 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.080
 and we still can not say anything 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.780
 specifically because we have not tested it 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.719
 but at first glance it seems to me that this 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.280
 character would be a good top people 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:49.129
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.159
 about the top characters of this game to 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:55.250
 my opinion the best characters of 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:58.969
 super smash bros wii and 3ds until now 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.710
 we have nothing in particular but 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:02.860
 simple view to me it seems to me that this 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.379
 would be one of the best characters that 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.969
 would have this saga good people I hope that 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:09.979
 you liked the subscribing video 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:12.370
 for we are all aware of ciao 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.370
