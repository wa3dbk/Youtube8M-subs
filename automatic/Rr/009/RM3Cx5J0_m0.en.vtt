00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.670 
is
funny<00:03:43.840> but<00:03:44.620> um<00:03:45.570> through<00:03:46.570> holidays<00:03:46.960> good<00:03:47.170> men<00:03:47.440> I

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
funny but um through holidays good men I

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.860 
funny but um through holidays good men I
think<00:03:48.100> if<00:03:48.220> you<00:03:48.340> just<00:03:48.610> have<00:03:49.180> him<00:03:49.390> play<00:03:49.570> a<00:03:49.600> full

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
think if you just have him play a full

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.590 
think if you just have him play a full
season<00:03:50.140> which<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:51.280> know<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.760> could<00:03:52.390> be<00:03:52.420> a

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
season which you know that could be a

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.830 
season which you know that could be a
legitimate<00:03:52.780> concern<00:03:53.440> I<00:03:54.420> think<00:03:55.420> he<00:03:55.690> could<00:03:55.810> be

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
legitimate concern I think he could be

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.420 
legitimate concern I think he could be
the<00:03:55.900> right<00:03:56.140> point<00:03:56.410> guard<00:03:56.620> next<00:03:56.830> to<00:03:57.070> Anthony

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
the right point guard next to Anthony

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.930 
the right point guard next to Anthony
Davis<00:03:57.760> he's<00:03:57.850> already<00:03:58.060> made<00:03:58.240> an<00:03:58.390> all-star<00:03:58.540> team

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
Davis he's already made an all-star team

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.250 
Davis he's already made an all-star team
