as<00:01:59.289> soon<00:01:59.799> as<00:01:59.950> you<00:02:00.039> engage<00:02:00.219> the<00:02:00.909> lethal<00:02:01.329> boost

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
as soon as you engage the lethal boost

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.380 
as soon as you engage the lethal boost
button<00:02:02.170> you<00:02:02.859> get<00:02:03.070> much<00:02:03.520> better<00:02:03.759> clock<00:02:04.090> speech

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
button you get much better clock speech

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.940 
button you get much better clock speech
you<00:02:04.689> get<00:02:04.899> a<00:02:04.929> twelve<00:02:05.289> hundred<00:02:05.439> megahertz<00:02:05.710> on

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
you get a twelve hundred megahertz on

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.410 
you get a twelve hundred megahertz on
the<00:02:06.070> core<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:06.549> then<00:02:06.670> sixteen<00:02:07.179> hundred

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
the core and then sixteen hundred

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.779 
the core and then sixteen hundred
megahertz<00:02:07.689> on<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.500> memory<00:02:08.890> now<00:02:09.369> on<00:02:09.670> our

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
megahertz on the memory now on our

unboxing<00:02:10.149> video<00:02:10.630> we<00:02:10.810> would<00:02:10.960> just<00:02:11.080> read<00:02:11.230> you

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
unboxing video we would just read you

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.020 
unboxing video we would just read you
some<00:02:11.500> of<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.680> specs<00:02:11.980> that<00:02:12.070> said<00:02:12.400> of<00:02:12.520> effective

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
some of the specs that said of effective

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.270 
some of the specs that said of effective
memory<00:02:13.300> but<00:02:13.900> this<00:02:14.050> time<00:02:14.290> we<00:02:14.470> actually<00:02:14.650> use<00:02:15.070> the

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
memory but this time we actually use the

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.130 
memory but this time we actually use the
trick<00:02:15.520> software<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.330> this<00:02:16.720> shows<00:02:16.960> you

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
trick software and this shows you

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.320 
trick software and this shows you
clearly<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.710> accurately<00:02:18.040> what<00:02:18.760> you're<00:02:18.970> doing

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
clearly and accurately what you're doing

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.750 
clearly and accurately what you're doing
so<00:02:19.900> today's<00:02:20.260> video<00:02:20.440> is<00:02:20.650> just<00:02:20.800> basically<00:02:21.280> how

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
so today's video is just basically how

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.140 
so today's video is just basically how
to<00:02:21.820> use<00:02:22.240> their<00:02:22.870> lethal<00:02:23.590> boost<00:02:23.980> button<00:02:24.460> this<00:02:24.970> is

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
to use their lethal boost button this is

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.300 
to use their lethal boost button this is
on<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.420> card<00:02:25.690> watch<00:02:26.290> for<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.560> series<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.010> videos

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
on the card watch for a series of videos

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.339 
on the card watch for a series of videos
we're<00:02:27.640> going<00:02:27.820> to<00:02:27.910> do<00:02:28.030> for<00:02:28.390> game<00:02:28.659> comparison

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
we're going to do for game comparison

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.730 
we're going to do for game comparison
starting<00:02:29.769> off<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.129> number<00:02:30.340> one

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
starting off to the number one

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.680 
starting off to the number one
which<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.310> guys<00:02:31.490> will<00:02:31.730> see<00:02:31.910> tomorrow<00:02:32.090> which
