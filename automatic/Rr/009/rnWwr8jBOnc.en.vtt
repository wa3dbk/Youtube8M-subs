hello<00:00:00.780> my<00:00:00.900> name<00:00:01.050> is<00:00:01.079> triple<00:00:01.410> backspace<00:00:01.770> and

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
hello my name is triple backspace and

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.679 
hello my name is triple backspace and
today<00:00:02.220> we<00:00:02.370> are<00:00:02.460> comparing<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:03.060> video<00:00:03.330> anchored

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
today we are comparing a video anchored

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.760 
today we are comparing a video anchored
on<00:00:03.890> x264<00:00:04.890> Nvidia<00:00:05.549> encoder<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.299> X<00:00:06.540> sub<00:00:06.720> 64<00:00:07.410> are

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
on x264 Nvidia encoder and X sub 64 are

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.879 
on x264 Nvidia encoder and X sub 64 are
both<00:00:08.099> video<00:00:08.610> encoders<00:00:09.179> which<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:09.599> can<00:00:09.780> use<00:00:10.290> in

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
both video encoders which you can use in

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.640 
both video encoders which you can use in
OBS<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:12.059> obvious<00:00:12.900> as<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> program<00:00:13.620> which

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
OBS and obvious as a program which

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.829 
OBS and obvious as a program which
allows<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.429> stream<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.179> record<00:00:15.540> gameplay

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
allows you to stream and record gameplay

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.830 
allows you to stream and record gameplay
footage<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.369> was<00:00:17.640> comparing<00:00:18.180> these<00:00:18.300> two

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
footage so I was comparing these two

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.060 
footage so I was comparing these two
different<00:00:19.289> ways<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.680> encoding<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.460> video<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:22.070> and

video<00:00:53.399> encoder<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.829> was<00:00:56.010> curious<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.489> see

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
video encoder so I was curious to see

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.760 
video encoder so I was curious to see
how<00:00:57.000> well<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.449> would<00:00:57.600> perform<00:00:57.809> at<00:00:58.260> low<00:00:58.530> bit

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
how well it would perform at low bit

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.920 
how well it would perform at low bit
rates<00:00:59.039> at<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.489> same<00:00:59.730> quality<00:01:00.210> settings<00:01:00.629> I'm

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
rates at the same quality settings I'm

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.340 
rates at the same quality settings I'm
using<00:01:01.440> 720p<00:01:02.340> 30<00:01:03.149> frames<00:01:03.390> per<00:01:03.480> second<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.110> both

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
using 720p 30 frames per second and both

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.429 
using 720p 30 frames per second and both
of<00:01:04.379> these<00:01:04.619> clips<00:01:05.689> the<00:01:06.689> only<00:01:06.960> real<00:01:07.229> difference

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
of these clips the only real difference

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.200 
of these clips the only real difference
between<00:01:08.010> these<00:01:08.130> clips<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.970> video

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
between these clips is that a video

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.050 
between these clips is that a video
encoders<00:01:11.150> produced<00:01:12.150> during<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> night<00:01:12.810> which

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
encoders produced during the night which

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.020 
encoders produced during the night which
it's<00:01:15.060> not<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> really<00:01:15.810> good<00:01:16.650> thing<00:01:17.030> because

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
it's not a really good thing because

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.929 
it's not a really good thing because
it's<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.659> little<00:01:18.840> bit<00:01:18.960> harder<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.549> process<00:01:20.549> all

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
it's a little bit harder to process all

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.670 
it's a little bit harder to process all
the<00:01:21.090> lightning<00:01:21.630> differences<00:01:22.200> because<00:01:22.500> that

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the lightning differences because that

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.440 
the lightning differences because that
means<00:01:23.070> different<00:01:23.460> colors<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.180> kind<00:01:24.360> of

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
means different colors that kind of

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.330 
means different colors that kind of
stuff<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:26.060> Diesel's<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.210> more<00:01:27.390> pixelated

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
stuff so Diesel's on a more pixelated

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.069 
stuff so Diesel's on a more pixelated
screen<00:01:29.340> however<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.329> can<00:01:30.570> already<00:01:30.780> conclude

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
screen however I can already conclude

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.410 
screen however I can already conclude
that<00:01:31.560> MV<00:01:32.009> anchor<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> little<00:01:33.090> bit<00:01:33.180> worse

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
that MV anchor is a little bit worse

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.200 
that MV anchor is a little bit worse
because<00:01:34.049> I've<00:01:34.350> seen<00:01:34.680> footage<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.700> Nvidia

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
because I've seen footage of Nvidia

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.210 
because I've seen footage of Nvidia
anchor<00:01:36.540> already<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.320> even<00:01:37.920> doing<00:01:38.159> a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
anchor already and even doing a

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.300 
anchor already and even doing a
minecraft<00:01:38.579> day<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:38.970> an<00:01:39.090> x264<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:40.770> performs<00:01:41.220> a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
minecraft day like an x264 it performs a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.530 
minecraft day like an x264 it performs a
lot<00:01:41.430> worse<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:42.240> still<00:01:42.590> they<00:01:43.590> are<00:01:43.860> still

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
lot worse but still they are still

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.819 
lot worse but still they are still
pixelation<00:01:45.540> issues<00:01:46.130> using<00:01:47.130> Nvidia<00:01:47.610> encoder

however<00:01:50.899> video<00:01:51.899> encoder<00:01:52.259> has<00:01:52.290> lots<00:01:53.040> better

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
however video encoder has lots better

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.819 
however video encoder has lots better

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
think I've seen below 105 and the

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.620 
think I've seen below 105 and the
maximum<00:02:05.460> frame<00:02:05.670> rate<00:02:05.729> at<00:02:06.030> average<00:02:06.390> frame

maximum frame rate at average frame

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.900 
maximum frame rate at average frame
rates<00:02:06.869> are<00:02:07.170> four<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.009> via<00:02:08.129> encode<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> lot

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.300 
rates are four and via encode a lot
higher<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:10.170> if<00:02:10.319> you're<00:02:10.440> streaming<00:02:10.739> some<00:02:11.160> kind

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
higher so if you're streaming some kind

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.350 
higher so if you're streaming some kind
of<00:02:11.370> resource<00:02:11.760> intensive<00:02:12.300> game

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
of resource intensive game

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.490 
of resource intensive game
might<00:02:13.540> consider<00:02:13.990> using<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.560> video<00:02:14.710> encoder<00:02:15.190> and

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
might consider using a video encoder and

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.110 
might consider using a video encoder and
you<00:02:17.500> have<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:17.980> probably<00:02:18.820> have<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.940> better

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
you have a probably have a better

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.760 
you have a probably have a better
experience<00:02:19.480> in<00:02:19.930> your<00:02:19.990> views<00:02:20.290> but<00:02:20.530> we<00:02:20.560> have<00:02:20.740> a

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
experience in your views but we have a

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.550 
experience in your views but we have a
better<00:02:21.400> experience<00:02:21.850> as<00:02:22.150> well<00:02:22.300> if<00:02:23.080> you're<00:02:23.380> not

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
better experience as well if you're not

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.960 
better experience as well if you're not
stream<00:02:23.860> is<00:02:23.980> something<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.340> resource

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
stream is something that resource

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.880 
stream is something that resource
intensive<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.600> would<00:02:25.870> really<00:02:26.110> bother<00:02:26.380> using<00:02:26.680> a

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
intensive I would really bother using a

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.430 
intensive I would really bother using a
VI<00:02:27.070> encoder<00:02:28.260> because<00:02:29.730> it's<00:02:30.730> it's<00:02:31.270> it's<00:02:31.780> decent

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
VI encoder because it's it's it's decent

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.880 
VI encoder because it's it's it's decent
but<00:02:33.160> it's<00:02:33.310> not<00:02:33.490> as<00:02:33.670> good<00:02:33.850> as<00:02:33.960> x264<00:02:34.960> if<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.710> can

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
but it's not as good as x264 if you can

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.130 
but it's not as good as x264 if you can
especially<00:02:36.130> see<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.970> when<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.300> pulse<00:02:37.630> these

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
especially see it when you pulse these

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.310 
especially see it when you pulse these
pillows<00:02:38.890> that's<00:02:39.880> you<00:02:40.300> see<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:40.780> can<00:02:40.959> see<00:02:41.110> that

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
pillows that's you see you can see that

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.670 
pillows that's you see you can see that
the<00:02:41.800> colors<00:02:42.130> are<00:02:42.160> way<00:02:42.459> off<00:02:42.490> and<00:02:43.380> when<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:44.500> go

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
the colors are way off and when you go

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.620 
the colors are way off and when you go
through<00:02:44.890> this<00:02:45.070> mountain<00:02:45.280> Phinney<00:02:45.730> it's

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
through this mountain Phinney it's

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.520 
through this mountain Phinney it's
really<00:02:47.290> pixelated<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:48.430> wood<00:02:49.330> x264<00:02:50.140> is<00:02:50.290> also

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
really pixelated and wood x264 is also

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.170 
really pixelated and wood x264 is also
soluble<00:02:50.740> of<00:02:50.950> pixelation<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:51.850> we've<00:02:51.970> also

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
soluble of pixelation and we've also

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.030 
soluble of pixelation and we've also
seen<00:02:52.450> some<00:02:52.630> color<00:02:52.900> issues<00:02:53.290> but<00:02:53.530> it's<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:53.860> lot

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
seen some color issues but it's a lot

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.479 
seen some color issues but it's a lot
less<00:02:54.430> than<00:02:55.000> that<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.630> vignette<00:02:56.350> encoder<00:02:56.800> so

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
less than that a vignette encoder so

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.100 
less than that a vignette encoder so
basically<00:02:57.820> it's<00:02:58.030> just<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.360> trade<00:02:58.570> off<00:02:58.720> if<00:02:58.989> you

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
basically it's just a trade off if you

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.640 
basically it's just a trade off if you
what<00:02:59.530> you<00:02:59.560> want<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.010> use<00:03:00.840> anyway<00:03:01.840> I<00:03:02.110> hope<00:03:02.470> you

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
what you want to use anyway I hope you

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.900 
what you want to use anyway I hope you
enjoyed<00:03:02.950> this<00:03:03.100> video<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.459> I<00:03:03.730> hope<00:03:03.850> you

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
enjoyed this video and I hope you

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.540 
enjoyed this video and I hope you
learned<00:03:04.510> something<00:03:04.810> from<00:03:04.959> it<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.550> basically

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
learned something from it and basically

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:16.340 
learned something from it and basically
I<00:03:06.820> will<00:03:07.030> see<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.209> next<00:03:07.330> time<00:03:07.450> bye<00:03:08.410> bye
