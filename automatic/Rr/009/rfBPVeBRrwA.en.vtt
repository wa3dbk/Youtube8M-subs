00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.460
 let's talk a little about hooks 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.550
 hooks are a huge variety and not 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.350
 happens from different materials 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.869
 let's say this is bamboo hooks 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.599
 they are very comfortable and light and practical 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:30.410
 here it is the aluminum hook it goes with 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.410
 bamboo handle 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:40.219
 metal hook with plastic 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.219
 the handle is just a metal hook 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:47.520
 aluminum hook them exist 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.600
 there are a lot of plastic 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.640
 hooks hooks 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.170
 from the bone beautiful different colored from 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.629
 the trees are painted 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.629
 different hooks are their huge 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.590
 a lot of here are the hooks 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.590
 Teflon coated 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:09.869
 how not to get lost how to choose for 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.390
 right hook yourself first need 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.570
 try it in some stores 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.759
 give yarn and hook so you can 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.049
 pick the hook that you will 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.990
 more 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.890
 fit which you will like which 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.549
 it will be good to lie in your hand but to 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.549
 Unfortunately this is not in all stores 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:36.600
 It seems therefore it is necessary to have 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.670
 be like you or turn to the experience of those 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.150
 who already knits with some hooks 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.700
 knit others like this one here 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.939
 these are all my hooks personal hooks 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.790
 which i see 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:53.060
 look another feature 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.729
 hooks of different brands 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.070
 may be a different size look 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.369
 that's it that's all we have hook three with 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.140
 half a millimeter but the head of this 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.710
 hooks are completely different 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.630
 so if you have a clear indication 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.590
 clear instructions to take any 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.690
 hook just in case you check 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.050
 knitting density about this we are a little bit 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.850
 talk to you later 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.280
 there are different heads at the hook 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.510
 accordingly, different loops will be 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.830
 the thickness itself is obtained here 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.580
 here 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:36.160
 handles further it fits u all 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.110
 hooks but here's the head different in 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:44.620
 according to the head you have just 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:46.300
 the loops themselves will be terrible 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.600
 the trouble will turn out if you 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.850
 acquire a hook which is considered 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.670
 wrong 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.180
 look at this hook with him 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.270
 very small head and he goes on 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.910
 wide accordingly when knitting 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.320
 you will grab the loops of this one 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.620
 here's a little head 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.239
 and then they will expand with you 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.610
 there you can 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.540
 knit only very small loops 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.640
 push here to here 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.640
 if you promote it right here 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.660
 then the loops will tighten a 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.570
 not to shrink back and vice versa 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:32.620
 It turns out if you knit loops 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:37.090
 here then further you will have a very 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:41.260
 widely so try to hook 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.650
 he was uniform ie head 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.280
 she was not much different from herself 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.280
 rod hook
