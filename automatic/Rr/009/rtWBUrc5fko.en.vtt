what i would call weak links in the
chain<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:27.090> Health<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:28.130> my<00:01:29.130> little<00:01:29.400> weak<00:01:29.670> link

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
chain of Health and my little weak link

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.300 
chain of Health and my little weak link
is<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.360> thyroid<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> slow<00:01:31.530> thyroid<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.280> I

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
is is thyroid is a slow thyroid so I

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.010 
is is thyroid is a slow thyroid so I
could<00:01:32.759> be<00:01:32.820> eating<00:01:32.970> perfectly<00:01:33.600> but<00:01:33.750> if<00:01:33.869> I'm

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
could be eating perfectly but if I'm

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.770 
could be eating perfectly but if I'm
stressed<00:01:34.409> then<00:01:35.310> my<00:01:35.790> thyroid<00:01:36.060> will<00:01:36.299> take<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> hit

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
stressed then my thyroid will take a hit

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.450 
stressed then my thyroid will take a hit
but<00:01:36.930> here's<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> really<00:01:37.740> interesting<00:01:37.920> thing
