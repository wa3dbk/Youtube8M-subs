 the exercise 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:13.569
 October 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:16.139
 we 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.139
 there will be Bima 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.449
 the car tilted photo Valdrin 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.260
 but I have it all 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.699
 loud 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:30.909
 just because 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:32.520
 up there 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.480
 everywhere the staging takes place 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.590
 the internet is not 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.070
 average there are according to initial findings 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.870
 Sport Coordinator Hans long look like this 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.190
 the animal 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.350
 1 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.350
 Priebe so it's even that he was back then 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.000
 not yet optimally adjusted but 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.810
 the most magnificent 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.810
 it runs super fluently at 30 frames per second 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.590
 the corals the chamber can pull 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.790
 according to the transmitter confessed to her 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.420
 Ing 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.420
 1 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.470
 rtr 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.210
 I think I'm nicely done 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.100
 I'm not supposed to be I think we have to be percent 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.340
 now comes pollution from the seas 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.330
 I believe it makes it possible the typical customers had it 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.020
 for Kampa restraint that reflects everything sulzbach-run 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.840
 withdrew 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.730
 the rest of the country is now visually successful 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.730
 that is not illuminated now for completely piece way 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.720
 in the boat 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.120
 the criticism of Haywards had burned down 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.520
 we have 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.520
 they gamble 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.450
 50 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.970
 The resolution means this would also mean 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.089
 Of course, not even test before 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:12.019
 Yes exactly 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.019
 both scorer 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:20.229
 Tour of Britain Connecticut Eric Boyer points super-gau 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:24.059
 is not to be believed 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.919
 we do not need to hide fact is 16 percent 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.249
 to 15 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:36.240
 That's right 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.579
 the seal does not allow how high April finished thought it's old 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.599
 the guests we needed to get important 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.099
 do not give says 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.169
 Hans join in 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.649
 the 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.799
 You're welcome 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.980
 the problem that in that is the essence adjustment does not take that over 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:02.129
 certainly does not appear where you suspect Sulzbach 4 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.219
 18 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.780
 Paffett FX Regal back Â»next Werder not yet 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.379
 still unsolved 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.379
 and percent 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.059
 b 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:24.889
 Dealers said that we finally ticked off 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.459
 interested 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.510
 I will find the water from the ground coordinate words 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.510
 It also played watch that too 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.149
 Sarkozy sometimes lured any problem of her probably Nadal switched the 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:42.549
 SG Robert Strohal 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.549
 she has the most quiet program around 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.319

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.079
 round 

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:07.389
 the tension rises and 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.389
 ddp 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:16.589
 that's pretty much a problem 

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:20.859
 Okubo or too fast Jak three solid 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:21.840
 the report contains 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.999
 he treasures it protect 

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:25.289
 first have to pull light
