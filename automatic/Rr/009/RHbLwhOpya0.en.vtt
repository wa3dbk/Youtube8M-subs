00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
then the Shocker of the year I would say

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.570 
then the Shocker of the year I would say
is<00:02:20.450> last<00:02:21.170> month<00:02:21.560> we<00:02:21.769> found<00:02:22.040> out<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.280> we<00:02:22.459> were

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
is last month we found out that we were

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.850 
is last month we found out that we were
not<00:02:22.790> only<00:02:23.120> having<00:02:23.450> one<00:02:23.840> baby<00:02:24.049> we're<00:02:24.560> having

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
not only having one baby we're having

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.410 
not only having one baby we're having
two<00:02:25.220> babies<00:02:25.519> so<00:02:26.739> we<00:02:27.739> are<00:02:27.920> expecting<00:02:28.549> twins<00:02:28.940> and

um I guess that's the reason why I've
been<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:33.319> sick<00:02:33.920> is<00:02:34.190> because<00:02:34.430> of<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.239> extra

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
been so sick is because of the extra

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.430 
been so sick is because of the extra
hormones<00:02:36.260> in<00:02:36.440> my<00:02:36.560> system<00:02:37.180> so<00:02:38.180> yeah<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:39.260> we're

Soho and i went with april and she did a
great<00:04:03.470> job<00:04:03.500> so<00:04:04.040> in<00:04:04.580> addition<00:04:04.940> to<00:04:05.150> have<00:04:05.390> him<00:04:05.510> a

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
great job so in addition to have him a

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.870 
great job so in addition to have him a
raggedy<00:04:05.990> ends<00:04:06.440> my<00:04:06.620> hair<00:04:06.920> just<00:04:06.950> was<00:04:07.340> grown<00:04:07.640> out

so<00:04:08.270> the<00:04:08.420> bottom<00:04:09.140> part<00:04:09.350> was<00:04:09.560> way<00:04:09.800> longer<00:04:10.160> than

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
so the bottom part was way longer than

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.970 
so the bottom part was way longer than
the<00:04:10.580> top<00:04:10.790> so<00:04:11.480> she<00:04:11.540> just<00:04:11.720> basically<00:04:12.080> blended<00:04:12.860> it

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
the top so she just basically blended it

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.190 
the top so she just basically blended it
in<00:04:13.250> now<00:04:13.580> this<00:04:13.820> is<00:04:14.000> a<00:04:14.030> seven<00:04:14.450> day<00:04:14.570> or<00:04:14.750> washing<00:04:15.080> go

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
so you can't really see definition or

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.460 
so you can't really see definition or
anything<00:04:17.570> like<00:04:17.600> that<00:04:17.720> but<00:04:17.989> I<00:04:18.049> didn't<00:04:18.320> want<00:04:18.440> to

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
anything like that but I didn't want to

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.740

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.030 
it's kind of just blended all in as
opposed<00:04:23.390> to<00:04:23.570> having<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.960> top<00:04:24.200> part<00:04:24.500> and<00:04:24.680> then

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
opposed to having a top part and then

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.850 
opposed to having a top part and then
the<00:04:25.190> bottom<00:04:25.580> being<00:04:25.790> wrong<00:04:26.180> so<00:04:26.840> that's<00:04:27.680> what

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
the bottom being wrong so that's what

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.100 
the bottom being wrong so that's what
she<00:04:28.040> did<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.490> she<00:04:28.700> still<00:04:28.940> left<00:04:29.240> my<00:04:29.390> length<00:04:29.720> um

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
she did and she still left my length um

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.000 
she did and she still left my length um
and<00:04:31.100> in<00:04:31.700> addition<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.510> that<00:04:32.780> my<00:04:33.350> front<00:04:33.800> was

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
and in addition to that my front was

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.130 
and in addition to that my front was
totally<00:04:34.550> grown<00:04:34.910> out<00:04:35.180> what<00:04:35.360> I<00:04:35.390> used<00:04:35.630> to<00:04:35.750> do<00:04:35.960> is

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
totally grown out what I used to do is

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.530 
totally grown out what I used to do is
just<00:04:36.320> put<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:36.710> front<00:04:36.980> back<00:04:37.190> on<00:04:37.400> my<00:04:37.490> ears<00:04:37.760> cuz<00:04:38.420> I

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
just put the front back on my ears cuz I

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.150 
just put the front back on my ears cuz I
just<00:04:38.780> didn't<00:04:39.020> know<00:04:39.140> what<00:04:39.260> to<00:04:39.410> do<00:04:39.560> with<00:04:39.740> it<00:04:39.770> so

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
just didn't know what to do with it so

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.840 
just didn't know what to do with it so
she<00:04:40.250> gave<00:04:40.520> me<00:04:40.730> like<00:04:40.880> a<00:04:40.910> bang<00:04:41.300> um<00:04:42.130> and<00:04:43.130> you<00:04:43.820> know

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
she gave me like a bang um and you know

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.160 
she gave me like a bang um and you know
cut<00:04:44.240> this<00:04:44.510> side<00:04:45.850> Dom<00:04:46.850> to<00:04:47.300> be<00:04:47.420> even<00:04:47.810> with<00:04:47.990> the

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
cut this side Dom to be even with the

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.330 
cut this side Dom to be even with the
right<00:04:48.350> side<00:04:48.620> because<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:48.860> right<00:04:49.010> side<00:04:49.220> is

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
right side because the right side is

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.220 
right side because the right side is
usually<00:04:49.730> shorter<00:04:50.030> than<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.330> left<00:04:50.360> because<00:04:51.020> it

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
usually shorter than the left because it

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.320 
usually shorter than the left because it
shrinks<00:04:51.590> more<00:04:51.860> so<00:04:52.400> she<00:04:52.490> just<00:04:52.580> did<00:04:52.910> a<00:04:52.940> bunch<00:04:53.180> of

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
shrinks more so she just did a bunch of

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.090 
shrinks more so she just did a bunch of
things<00:04:53.570> I'm<00:04:53.780> really<00:04:54.080> happy<00:04:54.470> with<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:54.919> cut

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100

natural<00:05:24.020> so<00:05:24.320> I<00:05:24.350> was<00:05:24.560> just<00:05:24.710> really<00:05:25.070> excited

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
natural so I was just really excited

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.670 
natural so I was just really excited
about<00:05:25.520> that<00:05:25.640> because<00:05:25.850> when<00:05:26.570> I<00:05:26.600> started<00:05:27.410> this

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
about that because when I started this
