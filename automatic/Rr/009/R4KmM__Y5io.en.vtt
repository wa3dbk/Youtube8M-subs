00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.620 
ends just to refresh my hair because
surprisingly<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.670> know<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:48.060> really<00:01:48.420> really

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
surprisingly you know it's really really

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.080 
surprisingly you know it's really really
thick<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.530> doesn't<00:01:49.590> leave<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> lot<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.610> coating

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
thick it doesn't leave a lot of coating

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.730 
thick it doesn't leave a lot of coating
on<00:01:51.210> your<00:01:51.240> hair<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.899> don't<00:01:52.170> get<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> lot<00:01:52.680> of

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
on your hair so you don't get a lot of

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.740 
on your hair so you don't get a lot of
build-up<00:01:53.280> when<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.579> use<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.000> when<00:01:54.600> it

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
build-up when you use it when it

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.870 
build-up when you use it when it
dissolves<00:01:55.259> or<00:01:55.680> when<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:56.100> done<00:01:56.280> absorbing

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
dissolves or when it's done absorbing

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.760 
dissolves or when it's done absorbing
into<00:01:57.119> your<00:01:57.240> hair<00:01:57.509> it's<00:01:58.020> not<00:01:58.259> like<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.680> a

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
into your hair it's not like you have a

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.200 
into your hair it's not like you have a
lot<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.920> white<00:01:59.250> flakes<00:01:59.610> or<00:01:59.759> anything<00:01:59.939> like

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
lot of white flakes or anything like

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.149 
lot of white flakes or anything like
that<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:00.750> really<00:02:00.780> good<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.500> adding

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
that so it's really good for adding

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.429 
that so it's really good for adding
moisture<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.820> your<00:02:02.850> hair<00:02:03.000> after<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.990> have<00:02:04.259> had

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
not just within oil I like to get a

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.900 
not just within oil I like to get a

little bit of moisture on my ends to

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.510 
little bit of moisture on my ends to

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
make sure they're not all dry funky no

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.210 
make sure they're not all dry funky no
one<00:03:09.640> wants<00:03:09.910> drying<00:03:10.150> funky<00:03:10.540> ends<00:03:10.740> so<00:03:11.740> I<00:03:11.770> think

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
one wants drying funky ends so I think

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.550 
one wants drying funky ends so I think
that<00:03:12.489> is<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:13.030> great<00:03:13.360> way<00:03:13.630> to<00:03:13.660> use<00:03:14.080> this<00:03:14.200> product

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
that is a great way to use this product

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.670 
that is a great way to use this product
however<00:03:14.739> I<00:03:15.130> know<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:16.690> is<00:03:16.930> going<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.260> take<00:03:17.500> me

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
however I know that is going to take me

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.180 
however I know that is going to take me
forever<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:18.370> use<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:18.940> up<00:03:19.090> so<00:03:19.780> when<00:03:20.769> I<00:03:20.800> get<00:03:21.070> to

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
forever to use it up so when I get to

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.860 
forever to use it up so when I get to
the<00:03:21.280> end<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.580> it<00:03:21.700> sometimes<00:03:22.000> my<00:03:22.390> opinion

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
the end of it sometimes my opinion

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.960 
the end of it sometimes my opinion
eventually<00:03:23.350> changes<00:03:23.709> so<00:03:23.860> then<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.340> might<00:03:24.820> be

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
eventually changes so then it might be

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.430 
eventually changes so then it might be
six<00:03:25.209> months<00:03:25.450> down<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.630> road<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:26.050> might<00:03:26.230> feel

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
you have finer hair I think you need to

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.040 
you have finer hair I think you need to
be<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.830> bit<00:03:48.310> careful<00:03:48.610> with<00:03:49.060> how<00:03:49.269> much<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:49.750> use

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050

be a bit careful with how much you use
my<00:03:50.260> hair<00:03:50.440> really<00:03:50.920> well<00:03:51.220> not<00:03:51.610> really<00:03:51.880> coarse<00:03:52.180> oh

it's<00:03:52.450> medium<00:03:52.780> coarse<00:03:53.049> so<00:03:53.739> I<00:03:53.769> think<00:03:54.280> I<00:03:54.370> can<00:03:54.519> get

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
it's medium coarse so I think I can get

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.070 
it's medium coarse so I think I can get
away<00:03:54.700> with<00:03:55.030> it<00:03:55.180> a<00:03:55.269> little<00:03:55.480> bit<00:03:55.660> more<00:03:55.840> but<00:03:55.989> if
