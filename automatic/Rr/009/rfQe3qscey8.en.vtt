ok<00:01:29.610> now<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.790> graphics<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> dlc<00:01:30.750> are<00:01:31.229> just

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
ok now the graphics in the dlc are just

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.679 
ok now the graphics in the dlc are just
as<00:01:31.979> good<00:01:32.159> as<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.700> graphics<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.180> Ellen<00:01:33.509> week

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
as good as the graphics on Ellen week

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.410 
as good as the graphics on Ellen week
one<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.680> i<00:01:34.710> gotta<00:01:35.040> say<00:01:35.250> first<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.610> all<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
one so i gotta say first of all the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.300 
one so i gotta say first of all the
graphics<00:01:36.869> are<00:01:37.140> amazing<00:01:37.409> now<00:01:37.829> actually<00:01:38.220> i

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
graphics are amazing now actually i

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.620 
graphics are amazing now actually i
would<00:01:38.490> say<00:01:38.759> they're<00:01:38.939> probably<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.360> little<00:01:39.479> bit

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
would say they're probably a little bit

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.719 
would say they're probably a little bit
better<00:01:39.810> maybe<00:01:40.590> because<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.070> had<00:01:41.369> two<00:01:41.549> more

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
better maybe because it had two more

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.389 
better maybe because it had two more
months<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.150> polish<00:01:42.509> maybe<00:01:42.840> Helena<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:44.250> also

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
months to polish maybe Helena it's also

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.190 
months to polish maybe Helena it's also
much<00:01:44.850> shorter<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.390> maybe<00:01:45.570> they<00:01:45.689> had<00:01:45.810> more<00:01:46.020> time

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
much shorter so maybe they had more time

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.679 
much shorter so maybe they had more time
to<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:46.710> focus<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.610> graphics<00:01:48.180> themselves

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
to just focus on the graphics themselves

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.940 
to just focus on the graphics themselves
I<00:01:48.810> think<00:01:48.840> they<00:01:49.079> look<00:01:49.200> better<00:01:49.259> because<00:01:49.590> it's

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
I think they look better because it's

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.460 
I think they look better because it's
much<00:01:50.220> more<00:01:50.460> moody<00:01:50.909> much<00:01:51.240> more<00:01:51.479> dark<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.020> get<00:01:52.259> a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
much more moody much more dark you get a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.399 
much more moody much more dark you get a
couple<00:01:53.430> new<00:01:53.549> enemy<00:01:53.880> types<00:01:54.060> view<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.600> get<00:01:54.750> TVs

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
couple new enemy types view you get TVs

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.859 
couple new enemy types view you get TVs
this<00:01:55.860> time<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.340> try<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.880> kill<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.299> that's

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
this time that try to kill you that's

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.230 
this time that try to kill you that's
pretty<00:01:58.049> awesome<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.590> think<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.759> get<00:01:59.880> books

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
not really different here you don't get

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.550 
not really different here you don't get
many<00:02:28.440> cg<00:02:28.890> cutscenes<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:29.960> yeah<00:02:30.960> you<00:02:31.020> just<00:02:31.350> get

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
many cg cutscenes so yeah you just get

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.310 
many cg cutscenes so yeah you just get
mostly<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.160> game<00:02:32.370> itself<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:33.170> still<00:02:34.170> the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
mostly the game itself so still the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.020 
mostly the game itself so still the
character<00:02:34.890> models<00:02:35.100> are<00:02:35.220> okay<00:02:35.490> but<00:02:35.790> not<00:02:35.970> great

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
character models are okay but not great
