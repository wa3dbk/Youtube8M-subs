00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello to you necrosis and we 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.610
 continue doing brutality in mortal 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.139
 kombat x this time for jacks brix 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.429
 daughter of jax brix 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.780
 and the first brainstorming is done 8 in 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.250
 styles we have to kill the opponent 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.490
 taking back forward 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.779
 2 + block peonies blast I mean and press 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:35.910
 three times go ahead 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:40.530
 we fill and perform well bionic 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.870
 Jackie's hands are a pretty tough subject they 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.820
 make the opponent's body burst 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.280
 to pieces and leave very cruel wounds 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:53.730
 and the holes in fact she is all in her 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.780
 dad, too, with his hands only she has it 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.300
 their hands and have it in their hands jaxx 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.219
 natural it is not him as Ermak 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:09.350
 I tore them off in my opinion in the ninth martel 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:11.850
 yet it chronologically UAH JAXA hands 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.700
 normal is no longer in mk3 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.820
 but that's another story next 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.619
 brutal to firearrow is also done in all 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.180
 styles 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:26.250
 the player must hold 4 while 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:31.229
 perform reception squall glove back 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:36.890
 forward 4 + block this is this reception 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.890
 only enhanced version will try 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:57.440
 and keep the four even better now 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:02.759
 hole in the whole body we have but more 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:07.440
 there will be quite an interesting typo good 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:10.800
 I'll tell you about him now we 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.940
 we are in shotgun style and in this 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:19.230
 style we perform 3 brutality shrapnel 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:22.940
 must use three times objects 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.739
 at the level of not one but 3 until the end of the match 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.209
 done at a cutting distance of about 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:33.810
 the final blow should be the bottom blow 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.920
 down back two or bottom blast down 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.239
 back 2 + block 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.820
 they are no different therefore 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.950
 the result will be the same this does 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:47.910
 secret brutalities in casey for example yes 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.860
 with a blow to the balls where to fly first 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.810
 head in one case and in another case 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.350
 there is no such thing here I did not check 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.350
 so take a word 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.599
 down back two 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.180
 well, it's time to change the style yet 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.600
 that I like everything 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:26.260
 brutality fast and yet colorful 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:33.210
 really similar to each other but not 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.210
 less so style we will have an automaton 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.720
 4 finishing off heavy artillery in style 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:55.159
 machine must be applied to the enemy 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.590
 hit with three missiles up down back two 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.629
 and the final blow should be the reception 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.230
 hand gun 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:04.790
 down in front of two and then a block that is not 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.159
 down front 2 + block 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:12.140
 and down-forward 2 and then blogs that is 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:13.810
 like this is an extra hit you probably 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:19.250
 already aware that some beats 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:24.669
 amplify with a delay but we have two 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:27.830
 times his rocket head hit it like this 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:30.610
 by the way brutal to very cool here personally 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.610
 I like her I think my favorite 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.610
 doing 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:47.540
 isn't it cool well and we have left 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:53.440
 choose high-tech style 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.440
 with white hands beat 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.919
 brutality will touch 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:11.169
 amplification plasma gain and 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:14.889
 blow where jacks 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:18.910
 from the air strikes the ground and 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:21.340
 causes an earthquake that hits 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:25.900
 but unfortunately only close to the enemy 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:29.169
 and blow as I understood the bottom on the bottom 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:33.070
 lines hit means we have to do 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:35.260
 of true shock 5 brutal k in hi-tech style 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.870
 spark gloves must be active or 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:41.530
 ignite glove down back two 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:45.070
 or the same with a block with a meter 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:49.060
 and the final blow should be the reception 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.010
 down down four or he with a meter up 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:56.130
 reinforced 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:56.130
 he runs in the air here he 

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:05.209
 Well, we try to first strengthen 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:11.619
 gloves down back 2 and then down bottom 4 

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:14.839
 and knock him legs like these bottles 

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:17.899
 pretty simple and all friends 

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:20.860

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:20.860
