now i'm waiting a little bit for it to
load<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:42.430> then<00:01:43.360> maybe<00:01:44.259> i<00:01:44.350> can<00:01:44.530> actually<00:01:44.920> lower

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
load and then maybe i can actually lower

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.800 
load and then maybe i can actually lower
the<00:01:45.670> text<00:01:46.240> size<00:01:46.860> let's<00:01:47.860> do<00:01:48.009> that<00:01:48.780> take<00:01:49.780> a

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
the text size let's do that take a

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.760 
the text size let's do that take a
smallest<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:52.030> what<00:01:52.180> happens

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
smallest so what happens

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:01.150 
smallest so what happens
so<00:01:54.770> if<00:01:54.920> i<00:01:55.040> click<00:01:55.100> i<00:01:56.560> click<00:01:57.560> on<00:01:58.060> engadget<00:02:00.040> then<00:02:01.040> i

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
so if i click i click on engadget then i

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:08.499 
so if i click i click on engadget then i
can<00:02:01.340> then<00:02:01.490> scroll<00:02:01.910> down<00:02:01.970> I<00:02:04.360> can<00:02:07.149> it's<00:02:08.149> kind<00:02:08.420> of

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
can then scroll down I can it's kind of

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.660 
can then scroll down I can it's kind of
hard<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:08.869> load<00:02:09.290> this<00:02:09.440> page<00:02:09.679> I<00:02:09.890> guess<00:02:12.670> maybe
