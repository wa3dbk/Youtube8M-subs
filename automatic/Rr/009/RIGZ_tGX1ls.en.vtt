it's no surprise socialism fails

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.310 
it's no surprise socialism fails
everywhere<00:01:23.030> its<00:01:23.210> tried<00:01:23.540> because<00:01:23.990> eventually

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
everywhere its tried because eventually

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.640 
everywhere its tried because eventually
you<00:01:24.560> run<00:01:24.890> out<00:01:24.950> of<00:01:25.190> other<00:01:25.460> people's<00:01:25.940> money<00:01:26.240> and

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
you run out of other people's money and

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.789 
you run out of other people's money and
this<00:01:27.650> is<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:27.950> case<00:01:28.220> with<00:01:28.729> with<00:01:29.330> Greece<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:30.020> of

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
this is the case with with Greece and of

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.770 
this is the case with with Greece and of
course<00:01:31.040> France<00:01:31.460> is<00:01:31.670> experiencing<00:01:32.270> and

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
course France is experiencing and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.570 
course France is experiencing and
honestly<00:01:33.200> even<00:01:33.799> here<00:01:33.979> in<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:34.220> United<00:01:34.549> States

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
honestly even here in the United States

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.640 
honestly even here in the United States
we're<00:01:35.510> leaning<00:01:35.720> much<00:01:36.110> more<00:01:36.350> in<00:01:36.500> that

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
we're leaning much more in that

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.100 
we're leaning much more in that
direction<00:01:36.970> than<00:01:37.970> ever<00:01:38.240> before<00:01:38.780> especially

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
direction than ever before especially

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.560 
direction than ever before especially
with<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:39.830> advent<00:01:40.250> of<00:01:40.430> Obamacare<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:41.510> the

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
with the advent of Obamacare and the

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.310 
with the advent of Obamacare and the
like<00:01:42.350> so<00:01:42.670> very<00:01:43.670> sad<00:01:44.000> situation<00:01:44.210> and<00:01:44.900> hopefully

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
like so very sad situation and hopefully

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.740 
like so very sad situation and hopefully
the<00:01:45.470> lesson<00:01:45.920> will<00:01:46.100> be<00:01:46.250> learned<00:01:46.520> in<00:01:46.909> Greece<00:01:47.390> but

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
the lesson will be learned in Greece but

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.950 
the lesson will be learned in Greece but
as<00:01:47.950> is<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.220> case<00:01:49.430> they're<00:01:50.090> kicking<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.750> can

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
as is the case they're kicking the can

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.920 
as is the case they're kicking the can
down<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.260> road<00:01:51.790> and<00:01:52.790> just<00:01:53.060> like<00:01:53.210> we<00:01:53.420> do<00:01:53.600> here

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
down the road and just like we do here

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.330 
down the road and just like we do here
any<00:01:54.229> in<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:54.560> United<00:01:54.920> States<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:56.650> so<00:01:57.650> what

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
any in the United States and so what

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.370 
any in the United States and so what
what<00:01:58.670> what<00:01:58.939> is<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.299> what<00:01:59.570> does<00:01:59.630> that<00:01:59.840> mean<00:02:00.080> for

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
what what is the what does that mean for

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.609 
what what is the what does that mean for
us<00:02:00.439> here<00:02:00.950> well<00:02:01.250> it<00:02:01.640> means<00:02:02.450> that<00:02:02.689> it's<00:02:03.229> a<00:02:03.409> lesson

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
us here well it means that it's a lesson

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.640 
us here well it means that it's a lesson
that<00:02:03.799> could<00:02:04.130> be<00:02:04.280> learned<00:02:04.930> by<00:02:05.930> watching<00:02:05.960> what's

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
that could be learned by watching what's

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.550 
that could be learned by watching what's
happening<00:02:06.740> there<00:02:07.400> as<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:08.569> how<00:02:08.720> we<00:02:08.780> deal<00:02:09.259> with

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
happening there as to how we deal with

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.369 
happening there as to how we deal with
our<00:02:09.590> situation<00:02:10.099> in<00:02:10.939> the<00:02:11.540> United<00:02:11.629> States<00:02:11.900> and

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
our situation in the United States and

our situation in the United States and
in<00:02:12.859> other<00:02:13.040> nations<00:02:13.340> but<00:02:13.879> nonetheless<00:02:14.419> a<00:02:14.989> lot

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
in other nations but nonetheless a lot

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.120 
in other nations but nonetheless a lot
of<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.469> pseudo

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
of the pseudo

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
of the pseudo
lecture<00:02:16.550> walls<00:02:17.320> that<00:02:18.320> went<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.580> the

lecture walls that went to the the

lecture walls that went to the the
schools<00:02:20.540> of<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.930> day<00:02:21.110> have<00:02:21.380> essentially

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
schools of the day have essentially

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.880 
schools of the day have essentially
become<00:02:22.340> beauty<00:02:22.790> school<00:02:23.090> dropouts<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:24.050> it's<00:02:24.740> a

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
become beauty school dropouts and it's a

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.680 
become beauty school dropouts and it's a
shame<00:02:25.220> because<00:02:25.550> essentially<00:02:26.270> that<00:02:26.630> means

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
shame because essentially that means

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.350 
shame because essentially that means
that<00:02:27.200> they've<00:02:27.350> become<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:28.610> unrated<00:02:29.330> version

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
that they've become the unrated version

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.470 
that they've become the unrated version
of<00:02:30.050> dumb<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:31.070> dumber<00:02:32.260> but<00:02:33.260> i<00:02:33.410> hearken<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.480> to

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
government situations but what does that

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.000 
government situations but what does that
mean<00:02:47.270> for<00:02:47.300> precious<00:02:47.690> metals<00:02:47.870> well<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:48.770> see

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
mean for precious metals well you see

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.010 
mean for precious metals well you see
here<00:02:49.280> are<00:02:49.310> some<00:02:49.490> gold<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.000> silver<00:02:50.420> before<00:02:50.600> you

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
here are some gold and silver before you

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.550 
here are some gold and silver before you
and<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:53.330> prices<00:02:53.870> have<00:02:54.050> essentially

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
and the and the prices have essentially

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.910 
and the and the prices have essentially
stabilized<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.520> bit<00:02:55.550> and<00:02:56.320> it's<00:02:57.320> fascinating

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
stabilized a bit and it's fascinating

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.610 
stabilized a bit and it's fascinating
because<00:02:58.100> they<00:02:58.760> were<00:02:58.820> going<00:02:59.300> up<00:02:59.660> or<00:03:00.350> they<00:03:00.530> were

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
because they were going up or they were

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.540 
because they were going up or they were
going<00:03:00.890> down<00:03:00.970> with<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.210> with<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.900> talk<00:03:03.260> of

Greece going out of the eurozone and

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.150 
Greece going out of the eurozone and

that<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:14.840> will<00:03:14.930> stay<00:03:15.140> within<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.620> euro<00:03:15.860> the

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
that it will stay within the euro the

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.420 
that it will stay within the euro the
prices<00:03:16.640> have<00:03:16.820> gone<00:03:16.850> up<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.510> bit<00:03:18.430> stabilizing

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
prices have gone up a bit stabilizing

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.210 
prices have gone up a bit stabilizing
the<00:03:19.460> euro<00:03:19.790> at<00:03:20.210> least<00:03:20.390> temporarily<00:03:21.080> and<00:03:21.500> it's

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
the euro at least temporarily and it's

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.340 
the euro at least temporarily and it's
amazing<00:03:22.640> correlation<00:03:23.540> because<00:03:23.660> we're<00:03:24.080> saying

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
amazing correlation because we're saying

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.550 
amazing correlation because we're saying
the<00:03:24.470> same<00:03:24.650> thing<00:03:24.950> with<00:03:25.130> quantitative<00:03:25.640> easing

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
the same thing with quantitative easing

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.930 
the same thing with quantitative easing
the<00:03:27.560> quantitative<00:03:28.070> easing<00:03:28.340> that's<00:03:28.730> been

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
the quantitative easing that's been

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.370 
the quantitative easing that's been
happening<00:03:29.120> not<00:03:29.570> only<00:03:29.630> in<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:30.020> United<00:03:30.050> States

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
happening not only in the United States

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.470 
happening not only in the United States
but<00:03:30.920> essentially<00:03:31.720> around<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.870> world<00:03:34.480> has

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
but essentially around the world has

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.620 
but essentially around the world has
staved<00:03:35.960> off<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:37.030> hike<00:03:38.030> in<00:03:38.330> price<00:03:38.600> from

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
staved off the hike in price from

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.070 
staved off the hike in price from
precious<00:03:39.320> metals<00:03:39.680> prices<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.600> I<00:03:41.600> believe

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
precious metals prices and I believe

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.949 
precious metals prices and I believe
they<00:03:42.260> want<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.560> do<00:03:42.710> that<00:03:42.860> as<00:03:43.100> long<00:03:43.340> as<00:03:43.400> possible

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
they want to do that as long as possible

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.180 
they want to do that as long as possible
but<00:03:44.959> just<00:03:45.290> as<00:03:45.470> my<00:03:45.910> analogy<00:03:46.910> between<00:03:47.110> the

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
but just as my analogy between the

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.790 
but just as my analogy between the
sterilization<00:03:49.190> of<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.940> money<00:03:50.209> supply<00:03:50.800> where

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
sterilization of the money supply where

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.090 
sterilization of the money supply where
you're<00:03:51.950> injecting<00:03:53.200> essentially<00:03:54.200> steroids<00:03:54.830> to

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
you're injecting essentially steroids to

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.790 
you're injecting essentially steroids to
keep<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.670> value<00:03:56.480> of<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:56.930> value<00:03:57.290> of<00:03:57.440> them<00:03:57.620> up

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
keep the value of the value of them up

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.370 
keep the value of the value of them up
you<00:03:58.730> know<00:03:58.850> everybody's<00:03:59.750> hurting<00:04:00.020> and<00:04:00.320> the

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
you know everybody's hurting and the

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.770 
you know everybody's hurting and the
dollar<00:04:00.590> is<00:04:00.920> at<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.430> top<00:04:01.640> of<00:04:01.940> most<00:04:02.540> of<00:04:02.720> the

dollar is at the top of most of the

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
other currencies out there and hence why

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.300 
other currencies out there and hence why
you<00:04:05.570> see<00:04:05.900> a<00:04:05.930> strong<00:04:06.290> dollar<00:04:06.530> but<00:04:06.800> everybody<00:04:07.190> is

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
you see a strong dollar but everybody is

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.850 
you see a strong dollar but everybody is
essentially<00:04:08.209> hurting<00:04:08.660> and<00:04:08.959> eventually<00:04:09.680> will

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
essentially hurting and eventually will

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.699 
essentially hurting and eventually will
come<00:04:10.070> back<00:04:10.250> to<00:04:10.430> bite<00:04:10.640> us<00:04:11.050> but<00:04:12.050> the<00:04:12.290> precious

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
but i believe that silver is undervalued

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.550 
but i believe that silver is undervalued
at<00:05:22.180> the<00:05:22.330> point<00:05:22.599> this<00:05:22.810> probably<00:05:23.110> is<00:05:23.259> a<00:05:23.289> good

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
at the point this probably is a good

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.420 
at the point this probably is a good
time<00:05:23.830> to<00:05:23.860> buy<00:05:24.599> and<00:05:25.599> gold<00:05:25.930> is<00:05:26.289> undervalued<00:05:26.830> as

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
time to buy and gold is undervalued as

time to buy and gold is undervalued as
well<00:05:27.699> but<00:05:28.090> not<00:05:28.270> quite<00:05:28.330> as<00:05:28.719> much<00:05:28.930> a<00:05:28.990> silver<00:05:29.530> is

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
well but not quite as much a silver is

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.290 
well but not quite as much a silver is
but<00:05:30.759> i<00:05:30.789> believe<00:05:31.000> these<00:05:31.389> prices<00:05:31.719> are<00:05:32.229> low<00:05:32.800> and
