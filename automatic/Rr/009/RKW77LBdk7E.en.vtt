let's get into the simplified version of
rambling<00:00:07.750> on<00:00:07.870> my<00:00:08.020> mind<00:00:08.320> the<00:00:08.559> place<00:00:08.770> to<00:00:08.950> start

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.010 
rambling on my mind the place to start

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.340 
rambling on my mind the place to start
if<00:00:10.000> you're<00:00:10.120> not<00:00:10.270> absolutely<00:00:10.420> ready<00:00:10.960> to<00:00:11.170> dive

straight into Clapton's licks and you

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.769 
straight into Clapton's licks and you
can<00:00:14.530> add<00:00:14.740> his<00:00:14.950> licks<00:00:15.250> in<00:00:15.429> as<00:00:15.849> and<00:00:16.660> when<00:00:16.750> you

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:16.779 
can add his licks in as and when you

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:18.630 
can add his licks in as and when you

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
learn them from the as played version

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.429 
learn them from the as played version
you<00:00:19.150> can<00:00:19.330> start<00:00:19.540> to<00:00:19.660> replace<00:00:19.900> some<00:00:20.259> of<00:00:20.380> the

four and and exactly the same pattern on
strings<00:00:50.490> strings<00:00:51.579> five<00:00:52.120> and<00:00:52.390> four<00:00:52.870> that

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
strings strings five and four that

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:00.120 
strings strings five and four that
represents<00:00:53.920> an<00:00:54.040> a<00:00:54.280> chord<00:00:58.800> okay<00:00:59.800> so<00:00:59.860> that's

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
represents an a chord okay so that's

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.790 
represents an a chord okay so that's
that's<00:01:00.430> bass<00:01:01.120> five<00:01:01.420> and<00:01:01.630> six<00:01:01.900> and<00:01:02.200> then<00:01:02.560> we

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
that's bass five and six and then we

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.920 
that's bass five and six and then we
come<00:01:03.070> to<00:01:03.280> an<00:01:03.460> equal<00:01:04.030> again<00:01:04.299> just<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.750> fifth

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
come to an equal again just the fifth

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.980 
come to an equal again just the fifth
string<00:01:05.110> second<00:01:05.530> fret<00:01:05.649> page<00:01:06.009> six<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.490> five<00:01:06.990> but

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
string second fret page six and five but

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.480 
string second fret page six and five but
instead<00:01:08.320> of<00:01:08.409> playing<00:01:08.620> that<00:01:08.890> pair<00:01:09.130> of<00:01:09.250> strings

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
instead of playing that pair of strings

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.460 
instead of playing that pair of strings
again<00:01:09.820> this<00:01:10.150> time<00:01:10.450> probably<00:01:10.810> with<00:01:11.140> your<00:01:11.290> ring

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
again this time probably with your ring

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.440 
again this time probably with your ring
finger<00:01:11.500> but<00:01:11.890> it<00:01:12.010> could<00:01:12.190> be<00:01:12.280> any<00:01:12.460> finger<00:01:12.909> flick

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
finger but it could be any finger flick

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.290 
finger but it could be any finger flick
up<00:01:13.690> from<00:01:14.080> the<00:01:14.170> first<00:01:14.350> string<00:01:14.820> if<00:01:15.820> you<00:01:15.940> get<00:01:16.090> one

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
up from the first string if you get one

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.880 
up from the first string if you get one
that's<00:01:16.510> fine<00:01:16.810> if<00:01:16.990> you<00:01:17.020> get<00:01:17.170> one<00:01:17.440> and<00:01:17.620> two

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
that's fine if you get one and two

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.070 
that's fine if you get one and two
that's<00:01:18.130> fine<00:01:18.630> probably<00:01:19.630> don't<00:01:19.810> want<00:01:19.930> to<00:01:19.990> get

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
that's fine probably don't want to get

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.910 
that's fine probably don't want to get
three<00:01:20.440> and<00:01:21.360> then<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.450> Boogie<00:01:22.750> continues<00:01:23.320> for

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
three and then the Boogie continues for

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.040 
three and then the Boogie continues for
four<00:01:24.430> two<00:01:24.760> two<00:01:25.270> four<00:01:25.659> four<00:01:26.110> so<00:01:26.740> we<00:01:26.950> get<00:01:27.100> this

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.860 

in<00:01:31.050> the<00:01:31.200> count<00:01:31.440> one<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.160> two<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.180> three<00:01:33.480> and

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
in the count one and two and three and

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:34.730 
in the count one and two and three and
four

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
four

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.890 
four
so<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:35.310> up<00:01:35.430> flick<00:01:35.730> is<00:01:35.880> simply<00:01:36.180> replacing<00:01:36.690> one

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
so the up flick is simply replacing one

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.860 
so the up flick is simply replacing one
pick<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.170> string<00:01:37.530> six<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.980> five<00:01:38.690> now<00:01:39.690> that

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
pick of string six and five now that

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.890 
pick of string six and five now that
last<00:01:40.110> pick<00:01:40.440> of<00:01:40.470> four<00:01:40.920> six<00:01:41.550> and<00:01:41.700> six<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.570> 6th

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
last pick of four six and six the 6th

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.810 
last pick of four six and six the 6th
and<00:01:43.020> 5th<00:01:43.110> strings<00:01:43.380> at<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.620> 4th<00:01:43.860> fret<00:01:44.070> you

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
and 5th strings at the 4th fret you

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.610 
and 5th strings at the 4th fret you
might<00:01:45.090> want<00:01:45.300> to<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.540> play<00:01:45.660> the<00:01:45.810> open<00:01:46.230> sixth

going<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.710> suggest<00:02:25.860> replacing<00:02:26.220> those<00:02:26.910> with

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120

the<00:02:27.210> open<00:02:27.630> sixth<00:02:27.990> string<00:02:28.880> because<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.060> gives

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
the open sixth string because that gives

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.390 
the open sixth string because that gives
you<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.420> moment<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.960> move<00:02:31.110> again<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.950> exactly

you a moment to move again to exactly

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
the same lip we played at bar eight and

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.990 
the same lip we played at bar eight and
again<00:02:37.709> when<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:37.950> reach<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.280> end<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.520> that<00:02:38.730> bar

replace<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.720> pinch<00:02:40.320> of<00:02:40.500> six<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:40.920> five<00:02:41.100> with

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
replace the pinch of six and five with

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.670 
replace the pinch of six and five with
just<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.120> open<00:02:42.450> sixth<00:02:42.750> string<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.440> give<00:02:43.590> you

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
just the open sixth string to give you

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.260 
just the open sixth string to give you
some<00:02:43.860> time<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.130> move<00:02:44.370> again<00:02:44.550> back<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.060> the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
some time to move again back to the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.380
