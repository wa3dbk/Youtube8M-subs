00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
pull this thing up to this is pretty

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.319 
pull this thing up to this is pretty
sweet<00:01:57.750> there's<00:01:58.750> also<00:01:58.959> a<00:01:59.170> light<00:01:59.530> on<00:01:59.709> it<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.880> yet

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
sweet there's also a light on it and yet

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.669 
sweet there's also a light on it and yet
but<00:02:01.509> you<00:02:01.600> have<00:02:01.689> to<00:02:01.810> put<00:02:01.959> in<00:02:02.079> batteries<00:02:02.500> and

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
but you have to put in batteries and

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.949 
but you have to put in batteries and
there's<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:02.950> switch<00:02:03.250> record<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:06.959> this

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
there's a switch record and this

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.469 
there's a switch record and this
actually<00:02:08.200> shows<00:02:08.410> farther<00:02:09.069> than<00:02:09.549> the<00:02:10.090> normal

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
actually shows farther than the normal

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.880 
actually shows farther than the normal
default<00:02:10.920> then<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:12.040> surprised<00:02:12.519> me<00:02:12.760> because<00:02:13.890> if

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
default then it surprised me because if

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.330 
default then it surprised me because if
I<00:02:15.099> can<00:02:15.310> get<00:02:15.430> this<00:02:15.610> out<00:02:16.799> for<00:02:17.799> some<00:02:17.950> reason<00:02:18.250> this

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
I can get this out for some reason this

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.900 
I can get this out for some reason this
one<00:02:18.519> is<00:02:18.670> harder<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.180> get<00:02:19.569> out<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:21.340> it's<00:02:21.579> not<00:02:21.760> in

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
one is harder to get out and it's not in

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.220 
one is harder to get out and it's not in
the<00:02:22.030> wrong<00:02:22.209> way<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:24.760> can<00:02:25.030> see<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.720> in<00:02:25.930> there

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
the wrong way you can see it in there

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.900 
the wrong way you can see it in there
you<00:02:27.160> probably<00:02:27.459> can't<00:02:28.030> but<00:02:29.069> there<00:02:30.069> is<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.310> little

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
you probably can't but there is a little

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.479 
you probably can't but there is a little
hole<00:02:31.299> right<00:02:31.329> there<00:02:31.599> so<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.170> thought<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.129> lot<00:02:33.280> of

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
hole right there so I thought a lot of

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.000 
hole right there so I thought a lot of
air<00:02:33.730> would<00:02:33.910> come<00:02:34.150> out<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:38.530> handle<00:02:38.799> I<00:02:38.829> see

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
air would come out and you handle I see

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.940 
air would come out and you handle I see
that<00:02:39.160> well<00:02:39.310> but<00:02:39.489> there<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.849> a<00:02:39.879> little<00:02:40.150> hole<00:02:40.510> and

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
that well but there is a little hole and

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.949 
that well but there is a little hole and
a<00:02:41.950> lot<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.310> air<00:02:42.670> might<00:02:42.970> come<00:02:43.239> out<00:02:43.420> but<00:02:43.629> it's<00:02:43.810> not

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
a lot of air might come out but it's not

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.470 
a lot of air might come out but it's not
as<00:02:44.079> big<00:02:44.260> as<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.650> other<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.980> boy<00:02:45.190> so<00:02:46.180> this<00:02:46.329> one

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
as big as the other the boy so this one

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.289 
as big as the other the boy so this one
is<00:02:46.629> is<00:02:46.930> really<00:02:47.590> really<00:02:47.799> far<00:02:48.099> now<00:02:48.760> it's<00:02:49.030> very

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
is is really really far now it's very

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.319 
is is really really far now it's very
impressive<00:02:49.810> this<00:02:50.200> so<00:02:50.639> this<00:02:51.639> is<00:02:51.910> an<00:02:52.030> overall

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
impressive this so this is an overall

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.259 
impressive this so this is an overall
better<00:02:52.599> gun<00:02:53.079> then<00:02:53.769> be<00:02:54.250> regular<00:02:54.639> nerve<00:02:54.849> deploy

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
better gun then be regular nerve deploy

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.199 
better gun then be regular nerve deploy
which<00:02:56.230> my<00:02:56.620> brother<00:02:56.920> will<00:02:57.130> probably<00:02:57.579> have<00:02:57.819> it

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
which my brother will probably have it

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.990 
which my brother will probably have it
will<00:02:58.630> be<00:02:58.720> on<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:59.049> because<00:02:59.440> it's<00:03:00.010> his<00:03:00.220> gun<00:03:00.489> so

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
will be on that because it's his gun so

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.240 
will be on that because it's his gun so
this<00:03:01.180> is<00:03:01.209> my<00:03:01.510> cuz<00:03:01.930> it's<00:03:02.290> clear<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:02.889> this<00:03:03.099> is

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
this is my cuz it's clear and this is

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.979 
this is my cuz it's clear and this is
awesome<00:03:03.609> and<00:03:05.910> this<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:07.060> really<00:03:07.299> cool<00:03:07.720> because

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
awesome and this is really cool because

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.680 
awesome and this is really cool because
it's<00:03:08.500> mostly<00:03:08.680> for<00:03:09.099> graduations<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:12.269> like<00:03:13.269> you

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
it's mostly for graduations and like you

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.050 
it's mostly for graduations and like you
know<00:03:13.750> you<00:03:13.870> hold<00:03:14.290> it<00:03:14.410> like<00:03:14.440> this<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.799> then<00:03:15.730> once

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
know you hold it like this and then once

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.449 
know you hold it like this and then once
you're<00:03:16.239> about<00:03:16.389> to<00:03:16.630> shoot<00:03:16.840> someone<00:03:17.310> go<00:03:18.310> like

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
you're about to shoot someone go like

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.030 
you're about to shoot someone go like
that<00:03:18.730> but<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.239> guess<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.750> could<00:03:20.079> lose<00:03:21.010> some

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
that but I guess that could lose some

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.860 
that but I guess that could lose some
time<00:03:21.549> to<00:03:21.760> shoot<00:03:21.970> them<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:22.359> they<00:03:22.450> put<00:03:22.690> on<00:03:22.840> a

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
time to shoot them and they put on a

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.930 
time to shoot them and they put on a
wedding<00:03:23.049> Boise<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.970> bad<00:03:25.569> side<00:03:25.959> to<00:03:26.169> this<00:03:26.940> not

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
wedding Boise a bad side to this not

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.289 
wedding Boise a bad side to this not
that<00:03:27.970> it's<00:03:28.359> bad<00:03:28.599> as<00:03:29.349> clear<00:03:29.799> I<00:03:30.040> mean<00:03:30.220> idea<00:03:30.579> it

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
that it's bad as clear I mean idea it

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.020 
that it's bad as clear I mean idea it
says<00:03:32.200> stealth<00:03:32.620> on<00:03:32.859> the<00:03:32.980> box<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.519> I<00:03:33.609> don't<00:03:33.790> see

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
says stealth on the box and I don't see

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.009 
says stealth on the box and I don't see
this<00:03:34.359> is<00:03:34.540> going<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:34.840> be<00:03:34.900> stuff<00:03:35.549> but<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:37.810> cool

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
this is going to be stuff but the cool

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.449 
this is going to be stuff but the cool
thing<00:03:38.049> about<00:03:38.319> this<00:03:38.560> is<00:03:38.620> you<00:03:38.859> can<00:03:38.889> see<00:03:39.040> all<00:03:39.430> the

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
thing about this is you can see all the

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.289 
thing about this is you can see all the
internals<00:03:40.650> without<00:03:41.650> having<00:03:42.099> to<00:03:42.310> open<00:03:42.340> it<00:03:42.849> up<00:03:42.970> I

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
internals without having to open it up I

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.110 
internals without having to open it up I
guess<00:03:44.079> you<00:03:44.230> can<00:03:44.530> do<00:03:44.859> sweet<00:03:45.220> minds<00:03:45.430> on<00:03:45.669> this<00:03:45.819> and

guess you can do sweet minds on this and

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.960 
guess you can do sweet minds on this and
I've<00:03:46.480> never<00:03:46.660> done<00:03:46.930> mods<00:03:47.410> on<00:03:48.220> any<00:03:48.459> of<00:03:48.579> my<00:03:48.639> guns

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
I've never done mods on any of my guns

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.970 
I've never done mods on any of my guns
they<00:03:49.510> set<00:03:49.810> my<00:03:49.959> buzz<00:03:50.139> we<00:03:50.349> don't<00:03:50.530> get<00:03:50.709> a<00:03:50.739> shot

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.640 
they set my buzz we don't get a shot
there<00:03:51.160> which<00:03:51.970> will<00:03:52.150> be<00:03:52.269> Italian<00:03:53.109> review<00:03:53.440> out

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.610 
there which will be Italian review out
soon<00:03:54.890> this<00:03:55.879> gun<00:03:56.269> is<00:03:56.299> really<00:03:56.959> cool<00:03:57.290> because

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
soon this gun is really cool because

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.259 
soon this gun is really cool because
it's<00:03:58.610> clear<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.930> that's<00:04:00.349> not<00:04:00.730> so<00:04:01.730> I<00:04:02.060> think

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
it's clear and that's not so I think

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.149 
it's clear and that's not so I think
it's<00:04:02.390> pretty<00:04:02.480> much<00:04:02.659> it<00:04:02.959> and<00:04:03.230> there's<00:04:04.010> also

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 
it's pretty much it and there's also

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.720 
it's pretty much it and there's also
tactical<00:04:04.939> rail<00:04:05.120> you<00:04:05.870> have<00:04:05.989> to<00:04:06.110> mention<00:04:06.319> that

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
tactical rail you have to mention that

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.080 
tactical rail you have to mention that
cleator<00:04:08.799> so<00:04:09.799> I<00:04:10.040> guess<00:04:10.340> it's<00:04:10.370> kind<00:04:10.700> of<00:04:10.730> a<00:04:10.849> hard

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
cleator so I guess it's kind of a hard

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.339 
cleator so I guess it's kind of a hard
grip<00:04:11.359> on<00:04:11.540> it<00:04:11.569> because<00:04:11.810> I<00:04:11.900> thought<00:04:11.930> you<00:04:12.230> know

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
grip on it because I thought you know

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.599 
grip on it because I thought you know
you<00:04:12.409> soon<00:04:12.890> but<00:04:13.280> it's<00:04:13.400> fine<00:04:13.609> and<00:04:15.609> nothing

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
you soon but it's fine and nothing

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.670 
you soon but it's fine and nothing
really<00:04:16.820> actually<00:04:17.060> try<00:04:17.419> the<00:04:17.479> scope<00:04:17.959> before<00:04:18.410> so

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
really actually try the scope before so

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.870 
really actually try the scope before so
I<00:04:18.970> can't<00:04:19.970> tell<00:04:20.180> you<00:04:20.269> anything<00:04:20.509> about<00:04:20.660> that

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
I can't tell you anything about that

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.370 
I can't tell you anything about that
that's<00:04:22.880> pretty<00:04:23.030> much<00:04:23.210> it<00:04:23.419> for<00:04:23.600> this<00:04:23.810> and

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
that's pretty much it for this and

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.420 
that's pretty much it for this and
