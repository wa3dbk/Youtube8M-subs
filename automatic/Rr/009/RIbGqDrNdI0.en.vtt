00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
case I will kick a little bit higher to

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.890

person directly into my hands

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.260 
person directly into my hands
here<00:01:39.159> we<00:01:39.250> look<00:01:39.340> at<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.549> structure<00:01:40.060> that

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
here we look at the structure that

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.590 
here we look at the structure that
happens<00:01:40.840> when<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.320> are<00:01:41.590> able<00:01:42.399> to<00:01:42.430> use<00:01:42.909> a<00:01:42.939> good

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
happens when you are able to use a good

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.219 
happens when you are able to use a good
palm<00:01:44.140> strike<00:01:44.680> into<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.759> face<00:01:46.000> first<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:47.110> have

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
palm strike into the face first you have

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.370 
palm strike into the face first you have
to<00:01:47.350> have<00:01:47.500> proper<00:01:48.479> elbow<00:01:49.479> mechanics<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.350> have

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
to have proper elbow mechanics you have

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.990 
to have proper elbow mechanics you have
to<00:01:50.590> have<00:01:50.710> proper<00:01:51.070> mechanics<00:01:51.520> all<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.759> way<00:01:51.880> up

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
to have proper mechanics all the way up

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.609 
to have proper mechanics all the way up
the<00:01:52.119> body<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:53.049> other<00:01:53.200> thing<00:01:53.409> that<00:01:53.439> you<00:01:53.590> have

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
the body the other thing that you have

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.800 
the body the other thing that you have
to<00:01:53.740> have<00:01:54.009> is<00:01:54.219> is<00:01:54.429> that<00:01:54.850> you<00:01:55.000> have<00:01:55.210> to<00:01:55.390> have<00:01:55.600> a

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
to have is is that you have to have a

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.309 
to have is is that you have to have a
good<00:01:56.530> hand<00:01:57.280> structure<00:01:58.240> for<00:01:58.780> the<00:01:58.869> strike<00:01:59.140> that

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
good hand structure for the strike that

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.779 
good hand structure for the strike that
you're<00:01:59.439> going<00:01:59.679> to<00:01:59.710> use<00:01:59.979> so<00:02:00.250> that<00:02:00.280> you<00:02:00.399> make

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
you're going to use so that you make

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.749 
you're going to use so that you make
sure<00:02:01.090> that<00:02:01.119> it<00:02:01.450> fits<00:02:01.750> exactly<00:02:02.049> with<00:02:03.039> the<00:02:03.460> face

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
sure that it fits exactly with the face

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.139 
sure that it fits exactly with the face
so<00:02:04.630> we<00:02:04.979> mechanically<00:02:05.979> chain<00:02:06.340> these<00:02:06.579> movements

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
so we mechanically chain these movements

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.300

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.630 
vehicle is attacking him as I attack him
and<00:03:55.120> in<00:03:55.660> this<00:03:55.810> next<00:03:56.080> little<00:03:56.380> segment<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:57.400> can

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
and in this next little segment you can

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.330 
and in this next little segment you can
see<00:03:57.940> him<00:03:58.600> bounce<00:03:59.110> off<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.800> vehicle<00:04:02.250> one<00:04:03.250> of

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
see him bounce off the vehicle one of

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.830 
see him bounce off the vehicle one of
the<00:04:03.400> questions<00:04:03.730> that<00:04:03.790> I<00:04:03.910> most<00:04:04.150> often<00:04:04.360> get<00:04:04.720> is

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
the questions that I most often get is

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.450 
the questions that I most often get is
is<00:04:05.080> why<00:04:05.500> are<00:04:05.560> you<00:04:05.680> doing<00:04:05.890> these<00:04:05.950> cupped<00:04:06.250> hand

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
is why are you doing these cupped hand

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.280 
is why are you doing these cupped hand
blows<00:04:06.700> why<00:04:07.000> don't<00:04:07.150> why<00:04:07.300> don't<00:04:07.450> you<00:04:07.630> you<00:04:08.170> know

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
blows why don't why don't you you know

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.710 
blows why don't why don't you you know
punch<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.740> person<00:04:09.100> the<00:04:10.060> amount<00:04:10.330> of<00:04:10.510> power

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
punch the person the amount of power

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.140 
punch the person the amount of power
that<00:04:10.960> you<00:04:11.020> can<00:04:11.230> see<00:04:11.470> that<00:04:11.650> comes<00:04:12.010> from<00:04:12.610> the

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
that you can see that comes from the

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.930 
that you can see that comes from the
mechanical<00:04:13.780> structure<00:04:14.170> and<00:04:14.620> it's<00:04:15.220> a<00:04:15.340> constant

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
mechanical structure and it's a constant

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.920 
mechanical structure and it's a constant
driving<00:04:16.950> into<00:04:17.950> him<00:04:18.160> I'm<00:04:18.340> using<00:04:18.850> a<00:04:19.030> bone<00:04:19.270> vector

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
driving into him I'm using a bone vector

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.140 
driving into him I'm using a bone vector
that<00:04:20.440> is<00:04:20.590> going<00:04:20.920> straight<00:04:21.460> through<00:04:21.489> so<00:04:22.030> I'm

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
that is going straight through so I'm

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.200 
that is going straight through so I'm
getting<00:04:22.390> a<00:04:22.810> full<00:04:23.410> structure<00:04:23.980> behind<00:04:24.700> that

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
getting a full structure behind that

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.540 
getting a full structure behind that
hand<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:26.380> can<00:04:26.560> see<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.830> power<00:04:27.040> that<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:27.370> does

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
hand you can see the power that it does

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.990 
hand you can see the power that it does
to<00:04:27.850> bounce<00:04:28.120> him<00:04:28.480> off<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.720> car<00:04:29.850> combined<00:04:30.850> with

the bracing of the body and the proper
mechanical<00:04:32.980> structure<00:04:33.430> this<00:04:33.880> is<00:04:34.060> a<00:04:34.090> very<00:04:34.690> very

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
mechanical structure this is a very very

mechanical structure this is a very very
powerful<00:04:35.290> blow<00:04:35.830> it<00:04:36.340> does<00:04:36.850> so<00:04:37.150> much<00:04:37.390> damage<00:04:37.960> and

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
powerful blow it does so much damage and

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.560 
powerful blow it does so much damage and
to<00:04:38.710> attack<00:04:39.070> to<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.340> vehicle<00:04:39.850> you<00:04:40.360> can<00:04:40.540> see

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
to attack to the vehicle you can see

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.330 
to attack to the vehicle you can see
that<00:04:40.870> bounce<00:04:41.170> now<00:04:41.470> imagine<00:04:41.980> that<00:04:42.010> bounce

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
that bounce now imagine that bounce

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.420 
that bounce now imagine that bounce
being<00:04:42.700> the<00:04:42.790> person's<00:04:43.180> head<00:04:43.420> so<00:04:44.310> when<00:04:45.310> you

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
being the person's head so when you

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.670 
being the person's head so when you
replay<00:04:45.970> this<00:04:46.210> look<00:04:46.660> at<00:04:46.810> these<00:04:46.990> things<00:04:47.350> and

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
replay this look at these things and

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.320 
replay this look at these things and
then<00:04:47.830> when<00:04:47.979> you<00:04:48.070> go<00:04:48.340> through<00:04:48.640> and<00:04:48.910> you<00:04:49.030> begin

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
then when you go through and you begin

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.840 
then when you go through and you begin
to<00:04:49.540> work<00:04:49.840> on<00:04:50.020> them<00:04:50.200> yourself<00:04:50.680> you<00:04:50.979> can<00:04:51.580> take

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
to work on them yourself you can take

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.010 
to work on them yourself you can take
these<00:04:52.090> snippets

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
these snippets

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.140 
these snippets
and<00:04:53.110> look<00:04:53.650> at<00:04:53.800> them<00:04:53.979> and<00:04:54.160> use<00:04:54.699> them<00:04:54.940> for<00:04:54.970> your

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
and look at them and use them for your

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.510 
and look at them and use them for your
own<00:04:55.270> training<00:04:55.840> purposes<00:04:56.080> to<00:04:56.860> make<00:04:56.889> sure<00:04:57.340> that

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
own training purposes to make sure that

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.159 
own training purposes to make sure that
you're<00:04:57.639> reinforcing<00:04:58.030> with<00:04:58.569> your<00:04:58.720> students

you're reinforcing with your students

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.320 
you're reinforcing with your students
what<00:04:59.350> you<00:04:59.500> should<00:04:59.710> do

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.049 

exactly<00:05:04.330> what<00:05:04.449> I'm<00:05:04.539> going<00:05:04.809> to<00:05:04.839> do<00:05:05.939> even<00:05:06.939> in

00:05:07.049 --> 00:05:07.059 
exactly what I'm going to do even in

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:09.179 
exactly what I'm going to do even in
this<00:05:07.149> situation<00:05:07.749> which<00:05:07.899> is<00:05:07.930> controlled<00:05:08.680> and<00:05:08.949> I

00:05:09.179 --> 00:05:09.189 
this situation which is controlled and I

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:12.179 
this situation which is controlled and I
knew<00:05:09.369> he<00:05:09.550> was<00:05:09.669> coming<00:05:09.999> up<00:05:10.149> things<00:05:11.139> miss<00:05:11.680> my

knew he was coming up things miss my
first<00:05:12.399> thing<00:05:12.669> that<00:05:12.789> I<00:05:12.819> went<00:05:13.029> for<00:05:13.360> let's<00:05:14.199> get<00:05:14.379> my

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:14.529 
first thing that I went for let's get my

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:18.299 
first thing that I went for let's get my
hands<00:05:14.889> up<00:05:15.129> and<00:05:15.629> get<00:05:16.629> him<00:05:16.869> bent<00:05:17.309> I'm

00:05:18.299 --> 00:05:18.309 
hands up and get him bent I'm

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:21.450 
hands up and get him bent I'm
controlling<00:05:18.849> the<00:05:19.059> hand<00:05:19.270> here<00:05:19.979> and<00:05:20.979> I

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
controlling the hand here and I

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.760 
controlling the hand here and I
immediately<00:05:21.759> came<00:05:22.240> across<00:05:22.509> into<00:05:23.469> a<00:05:23.499> cupped

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
immediately came across into a cupped

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.629 
immediately came across into a cupped
hand<00:05:23.979> strike<00:05:24.539> then<00:05:25.539> started<00:05:26.319> working<00:05:26.639> much

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
hand strike then started working much

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.329 
hand strike then started working much
strikes<00:05:27.999> up<00:05:28.270> against<00:05:28.779> a<00:05:28.869> vehicle<00:05:29.259> I<00:05:29.439> came<00:05:30.009> to

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:30.339 
strikes up against a vehicle I came to

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:32.790 
strikes up against a vehicle I came to
this<00:05:30.580> hard<00:05:30.939> edge<00:05:31.210> and<00:05:31.689> that's<00:05:32.199> where<00:05:32.439> I<00:05:32.469> wanted

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
this hard edge and that's where I wanted

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.179 
this hard edge and that's where I wanted
the<00:05:32.919> strikes<00:05:33.219> to<00:05:33.430> happen<00:05:33.819> was<00:05:34.330> the<00:05:34.539> hard<00:05:34.779> edge

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:35.189 
the strikes to happen was the hard edge

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:38.820 
the strikes to happen was the hard edge
everything<00:05:36.189> stayed<00:05:36.490> tight<00:05:36.789> inside<00:05:37.209> and<00:05:38.050> then

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
everything stayed tight inside and then

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.189 
everything stayed tight inside and then
once<00:05:39.219> I<00:05:39.369> got<00:05:39.550> him<00:05:39.669> up<00:05:39.759> against<00:05:40.089> it<00:05:40.240> that's<00:05:40.899> when

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 
once I got him up against it that's when

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.649 
once I got him up against it that's when
the<00:05:41.289> slamming<00:05:41.709> happened<00:05:42.069> now<00:05:43.059> what<00:05:43.270> happens

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:43.659 
the slamming happened now what happens

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.529 
the slamming happened now what happens
in<00:05:43.809> this<00:05:43.930> situation<00:05:43.990> is<00:05:44.709> is<00:05:44.949> that<00:05:45.580> if<00:05:46.029> he<00:05:46.330> had<00:05:46.509> a

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
in this situation is is that if he had a

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:51.119 
in this situation is is that if he had a
knife<00:05:47.759> which<00:05:48.759> he<00:05:48.939> does<00:05:49.149> and<00:05:49.619> he<00:05:50.619> had<00:05:50.709> pulled<00:05:50.949> it

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:51.129 
knife which he does and he had pulled it

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:52.679 
knife which he does and he had pulled it
I<00:05:51.309> have<00:05:51.699> controlled<00:05:52.149> it<00:05:52.209> up<00:05:52.330> against<00:05:52.659> the

00:05:52.679 --> 00:05:52.689 
I have controlled it up against the

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:55.619 
I have controlled it up against the
vehicle<00:05:53.430> go<00:05:54.430> ahead<00:05:54.580> and<00:05:54.669> get<00:05:54.759> your<00:05:54.849> knife<00:05:54.999> hold

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:57.389 
vehicle go ahead and get your knife hold
it<00:05:55.749> in<00:05:55.809> your<00:05:55.899> hand<00:05:56.080> don't<00:05:56.499> come<00:05:57.009> out<00:05:57.099> with<00:05:57.159> it

00:05:57.389 --> 00:05:57.399 
it in your hand don't come out with it

00:05:57.399 --> 00:06:01.920 
it in your hand don't come out with it
so<00:05:57.939> I<00:05:58.149> can<00:05:58.930> slam<00:05:59.289> the<00:05:59.319> knife<00:06:00.309> down<00:06:01.029> while

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
so I can slam the knife down while

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.149 
so I can slam the knife down while
working<00:06:02.740> the<00:06:03.729> head<00:06:04.169> but<00:06:05.169> I<00:06:05.469> don't<00:06:05.889> have<00:06:06.099> a

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:06.159 
working the head but I don't have a

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:08.309 
working the head but I don't have a
means<00:06:06.490> of<00:06:06.639> escape<00:06:06.759> at<00:06:07.180> this<00:06:07.330> point<00:06:07.629> because

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 
means of escape at this point because

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:10.170 
means of escape at this point because
I'm<00:06:08.769> blocked<00:06:09.189> back<00:06:09.610> here

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
I'm blocked back here

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.629 
I'm blocked back here
that's<00:06:10.689> why<00:06:10.959> confined<00:06:11.439> spaces<00:06:11.740> are<00:06:12.399> so

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 
that's why confined spaces are so

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.459 
that's why confined spaces are so
important<00:06:13.180> is<00:06:13.300> realizing<00:06:13.899> where<00:06:14.050> our<00:06:14.169> walls

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:14.469 
important is realizing where our walls

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:18.179 
important is realizing where our walls
are<00:06:14.740> at<00:06:15.099> this<00:06:15.550> point<00:06:15.939> to<00:06:16.419> escape<00:06:16.839> I<00:06:17.169> would<00:06:17.979> have

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:18.189 
are at this point to escape I would have

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:21.239 
are at this point to escape I would have
to<00:06:18.459> come<00:06:18.669> around<00:06:18.819> and<00:06:19.409> push<00:06:20.409> him<00:06:20.680> back<00:06:20.919> and

00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:21.249 
to come around and push him back and

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:27.299 
to come around and push him back and
then<00:06:22.089> make<00:06:22.300> my<00:06:22.330> way<00:06:22.569> backwards<00:06:23.519> or<00:06:26.009> from<00:06:27.009> here

00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:27.309 
then make my way backwards or from here

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:30.929 
then make my way backwards or from here
I<00:06:27.719> could<00:06:28.719> bring<00:06:28.899> him<00:06:29.110> around<00:06:29.199> and<00:06:29.800> drive<00:06:30.550> him

00:06:30.929 --> 00:06:30.939 
I could bring him around and drive him

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:34.980 
I could bring him around and drive him
into<00:06:31.209> there<00:06:31.839> and<00:06:32.619> then<00:06:33.069> make<00:06:33.519> my<00:06:33.550> way<00:06:33.990> these

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
into there and then make my way these

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.570 
into there and then make my way these
are<00:06:35.229> the<00:06:35.319> things<00:06:35.559> that<00:06:35.649> we<00:06:35.860> have<00:06:36.009> to<00:06:36.189> concern

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
are the things that we have to concern

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.809 
are the things that we have to concern
ourselves<00:06:36.610> with<00:06:37.059> our<00:06:37.599> initial<00:06:38.019> strikes<00:06:38.819> how

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:39.819 
ourselves with our initial strikes how

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:42.230 
ourselves with our initial strikes how
do<00:06:39.879> we<00:06:40.119> get<00:06:40.360> that<00:06:40.539> person<00:06:40.749> off<00:06:41.169> of<00:06:41.199> us<00:06:41.469> quickly

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
do we get that person off of us quickly

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.909 
do we get that person off of us quickly
then<00:06:43.240> what<00:06:43.569> are<00:06:43.629> we<00:06:43.689> doing<00:06:44.080> to<00:06:44.169> control<00:06:44.619> them

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 
then what are we doing to control them

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.869 
then what are we doing to control them
at<00:06:45.129> that<00:06:45.490> point<00:06:45.789> and<00:06:46.089> drive<00:06:46.719> them<00:06:47.110> to<00:06:47.830> our<00:06:48.249> hard

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:48.879 
at that point and drive them to our hard

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:51.480 
at that point and drive them to our hard
edges<00:06:49.559> then<00:06:50.559> we<00:06:50.740> have<00:06:50.860> to<00:06:50.979> figure<00:06:51.219> out<00:06:51.249> are<00:06:51.399> we

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
edges then we have to figure out are we

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.399 
edges then we have to figure out are we
going<00:06:51.699> to<00:06:51.789> fight<00:06:52.029> or<00:06:52.689> are<00:06:52.839> we<00:06:52.930> going<00:06:53.110> to<00:06:53.229> make

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:53.409 
going to fight or are we going to make

00:06:53.409 --> 00:07:01.570 
going to fight or are we going to make
an<00:06:53.529> escape

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.580 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.639
