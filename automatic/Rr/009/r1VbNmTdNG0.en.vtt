00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
what's going on at this moment and

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.770 
what's going on at this moment and
there's<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.460> tons<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.969> new<00:00:33.149> crew<00:00:33.420> members

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
that I don't know yet but it seems to me

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.479 
that I don't know yet but it seems to me
like<00:00:35.610> they're<00:00:35.940> all<00:00:36.030> separated<00:00:36.600> anyway<00:00:36.960> so

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
like they're all separated anyway so

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.459 
like they're all separated anyway so
maybe<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:38.760> better<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.149> way<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:39.930> me<00:00:40.079> I'm

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
maybe it's better that way for me I'm

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.750 
maybe it's better that way for me I'm

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
them in the newspaper so i think it says

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
she was calling him lady but then i

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.249 
she was calling him lady but then i
remember<00:01:44.579> they<00:01:44.729> they<00:01:44.970> I've<00:01:45.630> been<00:01:45.840> told<00:01:46.049> his

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
remember they they I've been told his

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.590 
remember they they I've been told his
name<00:01:46.439> its<00:01:46.680> relay<00:01:47.520> or<00:01:47.939> something<00:01:48.390> like<00:01:48.540> that

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
name its relay or something like that

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.880 
name its relay or something like that
which<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.350> guess<00:01:49.560> could<00:01:49.860> sound<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.399> Lady<00:01:51.890> so

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
which I guess could sound like Lady so

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.039 
which I guess could sound like Lady so
it<00:01:53.490> makes<00:01:53.670> more<00:01:53.850> sense<00:01:53.909> though<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
it makes more sense though so in the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.149 
it makes more sense though so in the
middle<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.409> island<00:01:55.680> there's<00:01:56.009> this

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
middle of this island there's this

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.899 
middle of this island there's this
massive<00:01:56.460> tree<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.180> looks<00:01:57.210> like<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:58.049> giant<00:01:58.909> die

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
massive tree that looks like a giant die

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.880 
massive tree that looks like a giant die
cool<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.719> they<00:02:00.810> watch<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.170> thought<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.710> could

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
cool but they watch I thought this could

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.920 
cool but they watch I thought this could
be<00:02:02.070> important<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.240> there's<00:02:03.420> also<00:02:03.600> some

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
be important so there's also some

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.010 
be important so there's also some

giant elephants attacks just by casually

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.910 
giant elephants attacks just by casually
stepping<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.190> side<00:02:42.370> now<00:02:43.209> he<00:02:43.750> has<00:02:44.110> her

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
stepping to the side now he has her

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.039 
stepping to the side now he has her
zapping<00:02:45.430> powers<00:02:45.640> though<00:02:46.420> I<00:02:46.450> know<00:02:46.630> he<00:02:46.870> doesn't

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049

I've seen him swim so I think he's

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.059 
I've seen him swim so I think he's
saying<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:52.329> he<00:02:52.989> relies<00:02:53.260> too<00:02:53.530> much<00:02:53.560> on<00:02:53.890> his

saying that he relies too much on his

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.910 
saying that he relies too much on his
devil<00:02:54.370> fruit<00:02:54.400> power<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.209> he<00:02:55.269> has<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.890> miss<00:02:56.890> a

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
devil fruit power and he has to miss a

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.449 
devil fruit power and he has to miss a
game<00:02:57.250> power<00:02:57.549> beyond<00:02:59.040> devil<00:03:00.040> fruit<00:03:00.250> power

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459

because<00:05:05.190> according<00:05:05.669> to<00:05:05.850> comments<00:05:06.750> I<00:05:06.810> received

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
because according to comments I received

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.080 
because according to comments I received
in<00:05:07.229> the<00:05:07.260> past<00:05:07.320> there's<00:05:07.740> a<00:05:07.800> two<00:05:07.979> year<00:05:08.190> time<00:05:08.790> job

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
in the past there's a two year time job

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.090 
in the past there's a two year time job
so<00:05:09.479> I<00:05:09.510> guess<00:05:09.840> maybe<00:05:10.310> one<00:05:11.310> piece<00:05:11.640> as<00:05:12.710> we<00:05:13.710> know<00:05:13.890> it

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.610
