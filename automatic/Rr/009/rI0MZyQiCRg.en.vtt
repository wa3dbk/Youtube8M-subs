 lifeless hollow their souls hollow out to them 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.940
 snatched away and the sickly green light 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.120
 his lantern are trapped

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.119
 full attention 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.430

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.050
 as soon as fresh interest in a soul
