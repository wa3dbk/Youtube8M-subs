00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.179
 I'll show you now 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.130
 The biggest innovation is the new one 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:27.320
 Variety of bio there have been so many 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.460
 flowers are added to that 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.110
 not all can remember 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.810
 Among other things, the deep sea was 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.500
 added that is deeper than that 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:40.520
 normal more then the icicles tundra 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.110
 this is a huge area of thyrnau 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.120
 out of pack ice 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.890
 this is a new block of the now too 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.860
 was added then there is the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.070
 Sunflowers flatten the normal levels 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.200
 that are authorized with sunflowers that is 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.010
 new then there are flowers forests 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:01.310
 fields with flowers schavan finally so 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.910
 There is a new tree there 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:07.490
 Acacia calls and also the whole that 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:11.390
 All the grass I would say was 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:15.170
 adapted to color yes then there is 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:20.090
 even the table mountains these table mountains 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:23.570
 also call themselves mesa biome and that is 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.310
 a canyon-like area where there is 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.799
 now also high sand 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.350
 So there is also a new blog under there 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.229
 dead bushes and different lives 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.090
 blocks so different colored yes then 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.810
 there are still the giant tigers that are 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.000
 very large spruce forests are the trees 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.520
 two times two or mostly twice two 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.320
 blocks are thick and are also very tall 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.770
 Among other things, there is also pop 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.369
 soul 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:53.210
 that is a new blog is such a 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:57.500
 Variant of the earth and that dives in 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.750
 then there are those giant tigers 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.360
 tigers are still huge 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.550
 very large spruce forests there now 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.910
 a dense forest there 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:11.300
 come big big big big mushrooms 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.040
 before this happens automatically then there are still 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.530
 the cold tiger that is that again 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.240
 normal tiger but that contains snow 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.640
 and then there are the extreme hills 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.230
 that's huge mountains who mine 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.690
 snapshot as videos has looked 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.450
 know how big they are 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.270
 and last but not least the bios update 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.710
 There is also a new world type 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.550
 the one generating the world 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.800
 can choose 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.060
 The name is Amplify images rugged 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.760
 There it is so that these biome huge 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.450
 So they are so huge 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.630
 and went up so high in the air 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.360
 200 blocks high or low 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.750
 So that's really the hammer needed 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.100
 but to generate a very good pc 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.200
 as already mentioned there are 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.200
 now also many new blocks under 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.050
 other the portal as I said in the 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.460
 giant tigers can turn up on him 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.450
 no grass grow 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.580
 and yes then there are new trees and that 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.550
 the acacia dives in the savannahs 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:21.290
 up and give you acacia wood that way 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:23.090
 a happy man thought happy 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.340
 is still the dense trees if you 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.580
 these dense trees are the two times two 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.090
 Blocks are destroyed you get 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.100
 black oak so a new home 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.400
 a new wood has then there is the 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.739
 pack ice what in the icicles trasfor 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.660

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.200
 new flowers and the sunflowers 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:49.459

 Silver would have the silverfish yours 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.010
 changed or changed then there is 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.530
 red sand was something in the table mountains 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.070
 in the media occurs then there is 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.420
 now also finally colored glass 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.010
 So you can put that glass in now 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.590
 create different colors and 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.590
 put up 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:22.070
 and of course there are new ones 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:26.090
 tree species also new types of wood from her 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.350
 different boards and so on 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.200
 can continue to produce so then 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.910
 In addition, this was the color 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:36.680
 system changed that means there are 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.750
 You can treasure up now 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.160
 These are, for example, enchanted fishing 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.720
 enchanted bows generally enchanted 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.370
 armor parts or rather said weapons 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.080
 then there is junk that is one 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.180
 broken things you theoretically 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.940
 throw away and there are new ones 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.010

 fishing and luck brings the sea 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.889
 the chance was wearing TrÃ¶te fishing 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.630
 So you do not need that anyway 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.270
 the enticements have not been the time 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.410
 so biting fish was then reduced 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.300
 including the menu 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.979

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.000
