let's use a lot of interesting parts in
it<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:01.670> that<00:02:01.820> people<00:02:02.119> can<00:02:02.240> manipulate<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.899> or

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
it so that people can manipulate it or

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.469 
it so that people can manipulate it or
we<00:02:03.229> can<00:02:03.409> change<00:02:03.619> it<00:02:03.880> why<00:02:04.880> don't<00:02:05.000> we<00:02:05.090> bring<00:02:05.210> back

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
we can change it why don't we bring back

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.209 
we can change it why don't we bring back
Blood<00:02:05.990> Gulch<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.409> carve<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:06.799> all<00:02:06.920> up<00:02:07.070> into

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
Blood Gulch and carve it all up into

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.940 
Blood Gulch and carve it all up into
pieces<00:02:07.430> so<00:02:07.939> that<00:02:07.969> people<00:02:08.750> can<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.709> start

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
pieces so that people can and start

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.039 
pieces so that people can and start
manipulating<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.820> and<00:02:11.090> interesting<00:02:11.570> ways<00:02:11.780> and

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
manipulating it and interesting ways and

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.339 
manipulating it and interesting ways and
then<00:02:12.799> sanctuary<00:02:13.610> was<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:13.940> other<00:02:14.090> one<00:02:14.349> the

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
then sanctuary was the other one the

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.690 
then sanctuary was the other one the
cage

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
cage

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.390

paradiso that's just Chad and I playing

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.280 
paradiso that's just Chad and I playing
with<00:02:20.490> a<00:02:20.610> map<00:02:20.850> editor<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.480> actually<00:02:21.870> building

with a map editor and actually building

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.010 
with a map editor and actually building
cool<00:02:23.010> maps<00:02:23.370> within<00:02:24.000> forge<00:02:24.300> world<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.780> mean

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
cool maps within forge world I mean

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.990 
cool maps within forge world I mean
you're<00:02:25.170> doing<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.500> exactly<00:02:25.710> how<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.760> fans

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
you're doing that exactly how the fans

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.530 
you're doing that exactly how the fans
would<00:02:27.150> do<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:28.790> we<00:02:29.790> definitely<00:02:29.970> looked<00:02:30.270> at<00:02:30.390> what

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
would do it we definitely looked at what

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.480 
would do it we definitely looked at what
we<00:02:30.630> did<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.840> Halo<00:02:31.050> 3<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.530> said<00:02:32.130> what<00:02:32.310> can<00:02:32.400> we

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
we did in Halo 3 and said what can we

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.520 
we did in Halo 3 and said what can we
learn<00:02:32.610> from<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:33.030> it's<00:02:33.780> one<00:02:34.020> thing<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.260> build

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
learn from this it's one thing to build

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.010 
learn from this it's one thing to build
just<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.220> stunning<00:02:35.970> amount<00:02:36.240> of<00:02:36.390> Matt<00:02:36.570> fairings

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
just a stunning amount of Matt fairings

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.890 
just a stunning amount of Matt fairings
but<00:02:37.440> like<00:02:38.010> nobody<00:02:38.610> was<00:02:38.910> expecting<00:02:39.420> for<00:02:39.660> George

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
but like nobody was expecting for George

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.300 
but like nobody was expecting for George
I<00:02:40.020> don't<00:02:40.050> think<00:02:40.290> like<00:02:40.710> that<00:02:40.740> was<00:02:41.010> just<00:02:41.040> a

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
I don't think like that was just a

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.960 
I don't think like that was just a
completely<00:02:41.670> whoa<00:02:42.380> what<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.730> Rube<00:02:44.730> Goldberg

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
completely whoa what the Rube Goldberg

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.240 
completely whoa what the Rube Goldberg
machines<00:02:45.540> yeah<00:02:45.840> those<00:02:46.110> are<00:02:46.260> everywhere<00:02:46.740> in

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.890 

Halo<00:02:50.250> 3<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.760> was<00:02:50.910> cool<00:02:51.240> that<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.630> can<00:02:51.720> move

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
Halo 3 it was cool that you can move

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.330 
Halo 3 it was cool that you can move
things<00:02:52.080> around<00:02:52.290> but<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.709> was<00:02:52.830> still<00:02:53.010> kind<00:02:53.280> of

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
things around but it was still kind of

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.780 
things around but it was still kind of
clunky<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:54.260> we're<00:02:55.260> like<00:02:55.410> we<00:02:56.280> have<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:56.610> make

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
clunky and we're like we have to make

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.970 
clunky and we're like we have to make
this<00:02:56.940> better<00:02:57.440> what<00:02:58.440> are<00:02:58.530> some<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.800> tricks

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
this better what are some of the tricks

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.850 
this better what are some of the tricks
at<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.280> communities<00:02:59.700> using<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.180> how<00:03:01.170> can<00:03:01.740> we

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
at the communities using and how can we

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.470 
at the communities using and how can we
make<00:03:01.980> those<00:03:02.220> not<00:03:02.459> be<00:03:02.610> tricks<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.209> just<00:03:03.360> make

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
make those not be tricks and just make

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.160 
make those not be tricks and just make
those<00:03:03.660> be<00:03:03.780> tools<00:03:04.430> we<00:03:05.430> we<00:03:05.910> took<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.450> stuff<00:03:06.840> and

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
those be tools we we took that stuff and

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.440 
those be tools we we took that stuff and
made<00:03:08.100> it<00:03:08.220> like<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.400> real<00:03:08.670> feature<00:03:08.910> there's

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
made it like a real feature there's

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.050 
made it like a real feature there's
normal<00:03:09.870> phased<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.590> fixed<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.550> normal<00:03:11.880> is

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
normal phased and fixed so normal is

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.880 
normal phased and fixed so normal is
like<00:03:12.390> halo<00:03:12.690> 3<00:03:12.870> style<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.380> know<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.590> bumps<00:03:13.830> into

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
like halo 3 style you know it bumps into

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.620 
like halo 3 style you know it bumps into
stuff<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.459> let<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:14.640> go<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:15.120> falls<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:15.510> the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
stuff and you let it go it falls to the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.020 
stuff and you let it go it falls to the
ground<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:16.110> moves<00:03:16.500> around<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.800> stuff<00:03:17.030> fixed

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
ground and moves around the stuff fixed

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.479 
ground and moves around the stuff fixed
is<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:19.080> same<00:03:19.260> thing<00:03:19.530> except<00:03:20.010> when<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.280> let<00:03:20.400> it

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
is the same thing except when you let it

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.820 
is the same thing except when you let it
go<00:03:20.519> it<00:03:20.910> stays<00:03:21.180> exactly<00:03:21.420> where<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:21.930> was<00:03:22.080> and

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
go it stays exactly where it was and

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.120 
go it stays exactly where it was and
then<00:03:23.220> phase<00:03:23.670> is<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.420> coolest<00:03:24.739> because<00:03:25.739> it

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
then phase is the coolest because it

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.350 
then phase is the coolest because it
means<00:03:26.340> that<00:03:26.459> while<00:03:26.880> you're<00:03:27.030> editing<00:03:27.120> the

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
means that while you're editing the

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.910 
means that while you're editing the
object<00:03:27.720> it's<00:03:27.870> not<00:03:28.080> actually<00:03:28.500> directing<00:03:28.800> the

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
object it's not actually directing the

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.949 
object it's not actually directing the
environment<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:30.000> can<00:03:30.150> put<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:30.540> through<00:03:30.930> a

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
environment you can put it through a

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.140 
environment you can put it through a
wall<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.620> can<00:03:31.800> put<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:32.790> know<00:03:32.880> through

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
wall you can put it you know through

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.170 
wall you can put it you know through
other<00:03:33.330> objects<00:03:33.830> which<00:03:34.830> changed<00:03:35.670> everything

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
other objects which changed everything

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.750 
other objects which changed everything
for<00:03:36.209> forge<00:03:36.690> like<00:03:37.019> immediately<00:03:37.590> it's<00:03:38.489> much

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
for forge like immediately it's much

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.090 
for forge like immediately it's much
easier<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:39.420> build<00:03:39.840> afford<00:03:40.200> space<00:03:40.470> there's

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
easier to build afford space there's

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.060 
easier to build afford space there's
snaps<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:42.000> rotates<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.780> degrees<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.920> and

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
snaps and rotates and degrees and and

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.949 
snaps and rotates and degrees and and
units<00:03:44.880> that<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.120> can<00:03:45.299> move<00:03:45.390> things<00:03:45.660> you<00:03:45.840> can

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
units that you can move things you can

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.150 
units that you can move things you can
be<00:03:46.049> very<00:03:46.260> precise<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:48.780> camera<00:03:49.019> controls<00:03:49.380> it's

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
be very precise the camera controls it's

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.440 
be very precise the camera controls it's
actually<00:03:50.519> really<00:03:50.640> good<00:03:50.910> for<00:03:51.060> object

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
actually really good for object

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.270 
actually really good for object
placement<00:03:51.660> because<00:03:51.959> like<00:03:52.290> little<00:03:52.560> touches<00:03:53.100> on

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
placement because like little touches on

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
sudden jumpy movements and then we also

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.930 
sudden jumpy movements and then we also

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
like three hours trying to get one block

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.420 
like three hours trying to get one block
to<00:04:06.570> line<00:04:06.989> up<00:04:07.170> directly<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.920> three<00:04:08.400> other

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
to line up directly to three other

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.699 
to line up directly to three other
blocks<00:04:08.880> you<00:04:09.330> can<00:04:09.480> select<00:04:09.690> individual<00:04:10.230> objects

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
blocks you can select individual objects

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.199 
blocks you can select individual objects
and<00:04:10.799> say<00:04:10.980> get<00:04:11.250> rid<00:04:11.280> of<00:04:11.459> all<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:11.730> objects<00:04:12.090> of

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
and say get rid of all the objects of

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.240 
and say get rid of all the objects of
this<00:04:12.299> type<00:04:12.570> so<00:04:12.930> if<00:04:13.590> you're<00:04:13.739> trying<00:04:13.950> to<00:04:14.040> get<00:04:14.160> rid

you<00:04:16.019> want<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.229> go<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.650> replace<00:04:17.160> all<00:04:17.430> this<00:04:17.549> bump

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
you want to go and replace all this bump

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.750 
you want to go and replace all this bump
points<00:04:18.120> you<00:04:18.840> can<00:04:18.870> do<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.560> you<00:04:20.220> can<00:04:20.280> do<00:04:20.519> custom
