00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.759
 for lancillotto you are really you fraud 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.680
 that alone has been able to win every 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.139
 opponent in the two days of battle 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.120
 of geneva have only merit aspect 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.210
 of victory but also to so many brave 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.000
 knights such as these do not 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:24.859
 perform if not for the sake of a woman 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:30.900
 tell me if I'm not a decent lady 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:38.129
 so then you love me and since when since 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:40.920
 first moment living there then the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.649
 result but as lillo and greg il would say 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.780
 6 10 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.579
 I enjoyed ourselves and the staff 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.579
 left atesini real probabilissima non 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.730
 it is more but also the victim of everyone's love 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.719
 the times hello see you general 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.359
 yes in short, that of the theater is one of the 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.940
 games that have always fascinated i 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.589
 children and seen that today in the Epiphany e 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.600
 this may not be the case for this 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.369
 that we together with them at no cost 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.659
 we have lucia cuffaro from the university 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.360
 know how to do well back then everything 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.509
 how much in the group house everything in 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.400
 home today we will do something unexpected 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.350
 we will stage the family like 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.180
 maybe starting from a gap that 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.340
 contained a game and I assure you that i 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.810
 children after this activity will lose 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.670
 interest in the game that was 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.170
 inside and they will have wife I am afraid 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.900
 pros that will begin to shred all 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.930
 family photos 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.030
 the gisa dinora camerina challenge anyway 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.570
 happy in the theater serves one 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.430
 cardboard box scissors enough 100 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.100
 for plants and a sterile cord 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.830
 fabric designs instead runs for le 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.860
 puppets of cardboard strips 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.410
 of elements for decorating scotch 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.340
 with old magazines or felt-tip pens 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.040
 family photo 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.990
 lucia then we start immediately 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.510
 with a nice box this as you see 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.280
 it has a homogeneous color and if you can't find it 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.869
 maybe we have the brands of 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.820
 of the purchase made we can 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.440
 cover or with wrapping paper o 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.959
 paper maybe even for racing 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.620
 first recycled we must create the 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.240
 cracks to pass through 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.760
 marionettes and a scouring spear with le 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.570
 fifths from which to interact the fifths a 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.270
 year already done the other hand I owe it 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.770
 chop again and they are simple 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.590
 small squares that allow to 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.040
 puppets to be maneuvered with 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.220
 hands then I also read the second one 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.310
 and as you can see I entered for two 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.760
 passages and then then we have one 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.470
 nation or not before seabed 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.820
 the children will have fun to die for 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.489
 because they will have the possibility of 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.180
 draw whatever you go through 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.390
 the mind 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.370
 I did something fabulous and I did it 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.530
 I insert directly into the bottom of the 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.410
 box as maybe increasing a 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.840
 little bit of glue so it remains fixed 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:08.380
 however we can do so many ago fact 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:11.780
 today is today as this is now 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.350
 then let's put a little bit of glue and 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.230
 we attack and attack ours 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.060
 backdrop and at this point of birth that 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.190
 that you were telling me in the meantime about 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.840
 curtain then consider me 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.960
 first the computer will move 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.640
 and I'll get my shirts 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.030
 and we must take a cloth one 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.430
 skirt a remnant if at a seam 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.920
 as this is ideal because we succeed 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.800
 to let our stick pass 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.020
 I have already cut two curtains 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.910
 squares as you can see I have so many 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.150
 red recycling shirts I don't know why 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:51.080
 but I really like this color and therefore 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.870
 it may be it is in fact this dates back 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.030
 at middle school then I insert a 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.490
 garden stick but who is not 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.050
 much but saiano giardino then it 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:06.470
 I insert very quickly inside 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.960
 of the laws of the seams then one of 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.360
 here and now we put an even 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.950
 on the other hand there is we push it so far 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:19.160
 and we also insert the primary flower e 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.770
 we created the curtain then the curtain 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.260
 we will have to go inside to mount it 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.350
 of our box for those who do not have the 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.350
 stick put down the classic too 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.150
 curtain rod flying from window 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.880
 neighbors can spy but in the meantime there is 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.920
 so mario then I did two 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.370
 small holes that allow me to 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:44.330
 let the stick enter and fix it 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:48.290
 see excuse we get to the flab 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:51.290
 we arrive of those characters certainly also 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:55.430
 the cord really looks at you 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:58.550
 see we tie the first curtain curtain 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.320
 let's talk let's say the second one when 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.509
 we owe it to live this theater 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:07.029
 so we have to make puppets 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:09.099
 then I do for this time 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:11.499
 I would do the princess again my name is 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:14.529
 present you offend no because like us 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:16.749
 I think we have passed since then 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:19.869
 always need recycled cardboard 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:23.139
 cut this time to middle school two 

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:25.689
 small this length allows us 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.159
 to get inside this box 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:28.599
 height allows us to build the 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:31.899
 our character 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.969
 I start from the dress and dress me 

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:35.439
 they served with a puff so I took it 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.990
 an old sponge of those for 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:40.869
 to undress the clothes was undone and not 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.479
 I knew that making it then I transform it 

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:46.919
 fast fast in a nice little dress there 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.919
 I also add some 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:54.490
 veil tool of favors and I think 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.139
 with a stapler then we do 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.240
 all very fast but still a minute 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.580
 we don't like it before going into crisis 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.880
 going out I don't particularly like sewing 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:09.250
 use the stapler with the scoma size e 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:11.830
 then you say then we must 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.599
 build a small body cipulli la 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.030
 top base we can use gods 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:18.759
 magazine clippings taking the part 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:21.160
 maybe white and we have to paste the 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:23.259
 little head of miriam then I would have 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.330
 also many familiar elements though 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:28.449
 this time we want family one 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:31.080
 then family morning then 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:34.000
 we put a dot of glue we work 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:37.110
 sticky we attack the body and it 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.750
 we assemble fairly quickly over the 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:43.199
 our stecchetto 20 seconds share 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:46.300
 the body is made then I would put in for 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:47.889
 speed up everything fake see how it is 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:52.030

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:54.550
 bacciosi place the wool they are fun 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.229
 I put a little piece of scò p's and after 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.880
 calmly when I do them 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:59.979
 a hairstyle like the braid I have 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.560
 made for himself the weight but only one 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:06.070
 miriam the 3d I averaged while 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.870
 of this one for andrè and ended with 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.000
 calm I 'd let you see again what 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.800
 we have done that before that much is 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.150
 exactly the same I had to 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.219
 simply add them too 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.630
 the dress above and this was the miriam 

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:19.700
 birthday 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:22.430
 the cost is really everything 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.350
 we come a drop of glue box of 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.090
 cardboard and plant stick scissors 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.890
