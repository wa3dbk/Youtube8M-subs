okay so let's have a look basically it's

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.889 
okay so let's have a look basically it's
using<00:01:34.310> three<00:01:35.179> different<00:01:35.210> kinds<00:01:35.570> of<00:01:35.720> patterns

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
using three different kinds of patterns

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.260 
using three different kinds of patterns
there's<00:01:39.100> using<00:01:40.100> that<00:01:40.250> couple<00:01:40.580> of<00:01:40.640> times<00:01:40.850> I'm

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
but for today we keep on the snare so

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:15.970 
but for today we keep on the snare so
the<00:01:56.270> pattern<00:01:56.600> goes<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:14.780> goes<00:02:15.080> quite<00:02:15.410> quite<00:02:15.950> a

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
the pattern goes I goes quite quite a

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.070 
the pattern goes I goes quite quite a
lot<00:02:16.129> to<00:02:16.250> take<00:02:16.370> in<00:02:16.430> there<00:02:16.760> one<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.239> if<00:02:17.780> we<00:02:17.900> just

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
lot to take in there one so if we just

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.110 
lot to take in there one so if we just
break<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.410> down<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.770> little<00:02:18.950> tiny<00:02:19.190> more<00:02:19.520> if<00:02:20.000> you

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
break it down a little tiny more if you

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.050 
break it down a little tiny more if you
think<00:02:20.270> about<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.599> i'm<00:02:20.750> just<00:02:20.900> doing<00:02:21.970> if<00:02:22.970> you

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060

each of those groups i think those

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.949 
each of those groups i think those
numbers<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:55.220> kicks<00:02:55.489> part<00:02:55.879> the<00:02:56.000> last<00:02:56.209> long<00:02:56.450> just

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
numbers to kicks part the last long just

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:26.199 
numbers to kicks part the last long just

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
okay I hope that's enough although i

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.100 
okay I hope that's enough although i
will<00:03:29.700> show<00:03:29.880> you<00:03:29.940> how<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.239> works<00:03:30.269> i'll<00:03:30.690> play<00:03:30.900> an

will show you how it works i'll play an
up-tempo<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.709> then<00:03:31.799> we<00:03:31.860> can<00:03:32.010> break<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.340> down

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
up-tempo and then we can break it down

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.340 
up-tempo and then we can break it down
while<00:03:32.640> we<00:03:32.730> sort<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:32.970> playing<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:33.480> again<00:03:33.959> it's

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
while we sort of playing it again it's

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.870 
while we sort of playing it again it's
