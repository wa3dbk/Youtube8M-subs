00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.249
 how far on the rubble frosting collard 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:10.709
 then you need 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.419
 140 grams 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:14.229
 liquid cream 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:15.669
 70 grams 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.759
 dark chocolate in 110 grams of milk chocolate 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.119
 and 70 grams 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.349
 the caster sugar 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.249
 then we'll finish tonight 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.249
 with 110 grams 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.950
 for m I fired this Wednesday ever chocolate so the chocolate 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:37.790
 milk chocolate 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.960
 and chocolate 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.570
 dark chocolate cgem and sugar 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.700
 you see there 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.390
 so everything is melted no 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.180
 so it's not worth it 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.650
 go further 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.650
 the hall the corporation quite well done 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.510
 walter ten minutes so that ol the chocolate is a little bit less 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.440
 hot in this camp we resume 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.250
 the frosting so see he has 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.100
 slightly cooled 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.100
 p in agreement for the butter 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.640
 in the aisles for one of 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.320
 of royer it takes relatively quickly 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.750
 that's all I put 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.730
 he welcomes incorporation is doing well 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.070
 so go on a plate but the plate does not work we do not work 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.250
 and especially those when we go we slipped we will sink satio does not go to sea 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.860
 we will start with the center of course 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.080
 then on the edge 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.420
 enormously I planned a spatula no network 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.580
 but normally we do not have it was alas little more 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.770
 because may be lucky we need no mark but then 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.550
 no mark at any time 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.810
 then of course we're going to do that on a sponge cake 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.470
 all natures and we do that for example on a chocolate cake face 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.760
 chocolate chocolate 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.870
 that's something fantastic 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.060
 that's full fare and keep the gold device as it is see 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.560
 so stewardship 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.250
 we have a grid 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.550
 and we have a slap 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.139
 if I am allowed to recover precisely 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.229
 too much chocolate ball because first there are the other chocolates 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:13.879
 yes look 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.879
 so it's in the middle after a party around like this 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.929
 and there you go on the edge of the cake 

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:26.659
 the edge of the sponge cake and the single mom of chocolate head see 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.039
 there the guy is practically perfect all around 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:35.029
 so that I jump on of course also in a vote in what to do the 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:37.590
 famous agent attachment for that two other 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.140
 of passage the justice
