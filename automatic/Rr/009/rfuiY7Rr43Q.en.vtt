00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.500
 hey people what papers an ex with one 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 more comments and today it's about 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.890
 the times of beta today at this 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.750
 Wednesdays have been unbelievably many new ones 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.980
 information about beta announced 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.690
 today you could do that too 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.280
 very first time log in tonight 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.810
 half past two or so there went the server 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.910
 online that was a pretty stupid time 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.400
 for us europeans however subdivided 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.380
 you can follow com / beta from now on 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.910
 Sign up for the times of beta and have 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.009
 then a chance on one of the hot 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.449
 coveted beta-keys with the one then 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.789
 Tibetans can play that means if you are 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.019
 then have an xbox one or a pc 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.759
 you should definitely be there 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.170
 sign up and then you have everyone 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.940
 fall a chance on one of these beta 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.470
 keys it's not about who is 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.580
 otherwise logged in first 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.480
 I would be at three or even at night 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.280
 got up 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.080
 but you have now until now 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.210
 friday time until friday the 14 february 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.920
 you have time to register and 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.170
 then these people become the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.890
 first then select a beta 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.110
 get a key 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.490
 the whole thing is just good for that 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.480
 you do not like an open beta yourself 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.890
 just register 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.180
 and then, in the end, everyone goes 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.560
 very first day in and the server 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.090
 will be totally overloaded no one can 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.710
 Play really well and after three days 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.300
 no one really has more bock that is 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.890
 respawn entertainment wants the whole thing 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.939
 regulate it a bit and become it 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.070
 so gradually a few people 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.780
 admitted that means also if 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.520
 your very first day now on friday 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.439
 gets an e-mail from electronic arts 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.670
 So still has not got a beta key 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.380
 it may still be that its a 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.569
 few days later this beta key gets 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.640
 and still until tuesday the 18th 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.259
 february you can play that is the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.490
 whole meter is so five days from 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.899
 14 until the 18th 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.789
 in time we can talk about that 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.350
 play the beta for a long time and me 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.729
 I hope I can do that too 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.079
 case beta-key get 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.090
 because then I will be a lot of videos 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.530
 bring and so a bit the whole 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.420
 describe my impressions and stuff 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.770
 everything will be pretty much me anyway 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.030
 annoying if I do not have a beta key 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.649
 I'll be happy if I'm happy 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.600
 pretty much on this beta there on everyone 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.159
 if you can catch it now 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.240
 if I'm really playing for me 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.670
 I missed it on the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.380
 gamescom itself to play and must 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.490
 always just look at me the whole 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.149
 could not do it yet 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.829
 play yourself 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.149
 That's why I'm really looking forward to it 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.950
 and would you also definitely 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.329
 recommend sign up and secure 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.279
 you the chance to play here 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.899
 the whole is as I said in complete 

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:02.490
 So that's available all over the world 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.840
 means the game is in English 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.670
 However, we can definitely do that 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.529
 here in germany the pc 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.910
 players need an origin account 

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:10.530
 that's perfect too 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.420
 understandable is there of electronic arts 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.500
 The game does not even have to be clear 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.300
 but most of you come 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.880
 Battle will play a lot , of course 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.650
 an origin account so reported 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.850
 you are subdivided by com / peter 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.770
 and otherwise there are as I said 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.420
 some new information about this 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.100
 For example, beta is what we do 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.390
 It can play two new dates 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.860
 So do not necessarily give new maps 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.060
 but it will definitely be two maps 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.800
 give on which can play 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.330
 the one is fracture you see here 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.250
 just in the background the other one 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.900
 We have another angel city both 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.210
 relatively common in any 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.650
 e3 demos or you could on the 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.180
 gamescom, for example, to play games 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.860
 you can assume that this 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.820
 Both maps have the least wax 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.990
 I think so 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.400
 that means that we are here on 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.690
 least of all will have problems 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.610
 probably because the studio is here 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.780
 two of them are working longest 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.490
 Unfortunately, maps are not like that now 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.850
 I think so much 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.800
 times 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.030
 I mean there are only four days we 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.010
 the beta can play as I think 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.660
 we'll be fine with that 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.610
 There are three pieces of normal fashion 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.840
 team deathmatch a relatively normal 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.060
 that they just different 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.380
 So I did not know 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.180
 as they have described it sounded 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.740
 I very much for dominion and one 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.540
 however, art search industry with 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.610
 titans that sounds pretty cool 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.750
 Bond is everyone in a titan 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.700
 and of course there are as in search 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.260
 then do not destroy any response and you have 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.250
 no chance on the new title 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.380
 and then there's of course 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.400
 Research in various rounds and 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.690
 that's the point then of course in 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.250
 Ultimately, we survived that longest 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.600
 I think so pretty cool and if 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.890
 I then as I said a beta-key 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.350
 I will definitely get you there 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.070
 sometimes bring a gameplay of 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.320
 otherwise you can only say 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.880
 the score that you somehow there 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.530
 that means if you are there 10 or 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.940
 20 level or so does that unfortunately 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.380
 not on the game then later 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.150
 that's all he's doing now 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.580
 power does not matter and is 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.810
 irrelevant to the game later and you 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.090
 then you can just let off steam 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.890
 and try everything and otherwise 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.950
 it remains only to say whatever I always have 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.660
 quite happy to have mentioned it again 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.950
 is a beta last there are errors in it 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.420
 that is also the meaning of the whole 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.920
 The developers want to see where else 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.310
 mistakes are where they still improve something 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.870
 can 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.190
 I want to have your feedback and that's it 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.620
 that is the original meaning of one 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.430
 beta and that's why you let yourself 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.110
 maybe not necessarily of it 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.459
 impress that the game is just like 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.570
 for example, battlefield maybe on 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.760
 not perfect at first 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.110
 You just have to do it 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.739
 go out in the beta it will not now 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.030
 to be perfect 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.650
 However, I think we already 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.269
 very well 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.070
 will get too much like that 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.299
 beta because actually I can play 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.949
 give you another tip from today 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.900
 evening at 6 will be the very first 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:25.460
 Gameplays come online, too 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.650
 from german youtube to the eg in 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.759
 munich was on the time of event 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.240
 and because the game is already playing 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.800
 could 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.110
 and there is, for example, a chimpanzee 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.970
 on his canal and on the canal of 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.250
 commander gigawatt come first 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.320
 comments the first impressions and stuff like that 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.940
 whole richie so claim and 90 becomes 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.770
 probably upload gameplay and 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.669
 I know that I was also on this event 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.380
 in Munich 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.970
 And there will definitely be a few 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.539
 otherwise, videos will be released in two days 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.220
 is it starting 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.350
 until then you can still sign up 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.060
 sharing follows later and when it does 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.410
 Any new information gives 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.610
 then you will definitely join them 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.610
 can find me that is under 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.199
 facebook and at twitter.com 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.120
 everything that is somehow important right now 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.919
 on the subject did full but of course 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.300
 to my channel so if you covered 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.530
 want to be then just follow me 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.630
 twitter or like my page on 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.650
 facebook and then you are always quasi 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.030
 Up to date 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.770
 otherwise I can only say that I am happy 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.840
 I'm writing incredibly on the beta 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.610
 something you expected from the beta and 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.050
 what you think like this beta will be 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.330
 and otherwise, as always, I say a lot 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.409
 for watching until next time that 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.709
 an ex 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:23.709
 I go 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.210
 you give 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.229
 always completely 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.229
 newey
