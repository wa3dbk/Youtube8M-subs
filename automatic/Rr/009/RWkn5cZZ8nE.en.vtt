00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello I have nautas there is something important 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.339
 what do you have to know if you think 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.160
 buy a high- end mobile in this 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.019
 2015 so be careful because the thing is 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.740
 pretty warm with qualcomm 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.740
 we start 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.520
 you buy a high-end car for 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.230
 all high with luxury finishes all 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.660
 the extras and an impressive speed 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.180
 we are going to put 300 kilometers per hour 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.400
 You take it out of the dealer at the beginning 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.260
 everything you step on is going at the speed that 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.510
 you want but the time you start to feel 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.030
 it warms up too much not really you 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.650
 it seems unnatural you take it back 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.140
 to the dealer they tell you no 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.330
 We are going to modify this problem here 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.010
 put a limiter so that when the 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.430
 hot car do not go so fast and 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.290
 ram to 300 that go to 220 you think 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.510
 a good solution seems like a 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.489
 reliable solution good basically this 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.680
 what is happening with the mobiles of 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.720
 high end of 2015 and that's why I think 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.329
 interesting to make a video about this 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.600
 theme everything starts with the samsung galaxy 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.059
 s 6 what good was said always come out 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.850
 in two models one with snapdragon of 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.160
 qualcomm and another with samsung successes not 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.590
 well this time it was said that 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.119
 there were major problems so 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.130
 they said we are not going to do ranch apart 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.440
 we just want to get it out with our 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.270
 own teacher so samsung I do them 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.700
 with the 74 20 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.310
 the thing continues a little bit out there when 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.189
 they begin to begin to be rumored that 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.490
 the xperia z4 is having problems of 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.079
 overheating for now good up 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.000
 now we have not seen it was expected that 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.890
 it was for January it was expected that 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.100
 was for the mobil it is expected that 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.039
 be for some day of the year to deign 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.560
 to present yourself really it seems that 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.600
 still can not solve the thing 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.659
 it worsens a bit when presented the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.869
 htc one m 9 all these last ones this one 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.179
 commented with the ex with the snapdragon 810 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.729
 well it turns out that he puts it in a 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.380
 performance test and at the beginning 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.189
 all good but it turns out that it starts to 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.649
 heat and reaches up to 55 degrees 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.360
 temperature let's get your hand burned 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.679
 come on, you start so you do not have to 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.640
 have like this so you do not burn yourself 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.680
 it really is something quite serious but 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.480
 really good you wait a little bit to 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.549
 some update or something to eat 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.400
 less than this warming that 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.560
 that update comes out and really it 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.030
 controls are quite temperature 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.620
 12 degrees 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.160
 differential with respect to the model 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.870
 previous but the thing I do not think it 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.330
 solve as easy not as can be 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.760
 that one day for the other something hot 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.640
 so much and it turns out that after they do not heat up 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.489
 nothing good basically let's talk in 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.459
 this case of flex 2 that is the only 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.640
 high end that is really now in the 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.620
 market with the snapdragon 810 and that this one 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.660
 it just does not heat the exercise 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.239
 This does not warm up to no good the 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.730
 solution that they have implemented is the 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.650
 thermal thermal truck link if not me 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.330
 I am wrong as it is said in English that 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.370
 basically it 's a limiter of 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.760
 warming that when he sees that the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.800
 mobile heats too much cuts you into the 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.290
 processing speed taking it to 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.480
 lower levels and they really are not 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.550
 the ones wished good basically this is 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.360
 the solution that has both on the axis 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.370
 flex 2 like the htc one m 9 really a 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.489
 I do not convince too much we are 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.110
 talking about that if you buy a car for 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.459
 that pull a lot 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.049
 you want me to pull to its maximum 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.130
 speed and not have these problems 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.090
 what 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.940
 they are a little fixed with wire 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.810
 it really is very bad 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.030
 basically the heating does not 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.610
 only annoying in the hand also that 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.160
 It can harm all the components 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.480
 of the telephone and mainly to the 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.370
 battery we know that batteries 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.890
 when they are exposed to temperatures 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.210
 very high lose the performance of 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.620
 permanent form 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.600
 so if this video more than anything for 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.490
 that you have in consideration before 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.470
 buy one of these phones that can 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.510
 have these problems anyway 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.120
 it's completely proven but really 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.380
 the signs are quite important 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.120
 we are going to follow it very closely 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.850
 because we really always cover these 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.340
 very close mobile phones are also 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.050
 speculates that starting in the middle of 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.240
 this year, a new chipset of 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.310
 qualcomm that would be the one found at 815 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.810
 I would not have this problem but 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.330
 obviously all those made with 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.830
 810 they will have it because you can not 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.720
 change the chipset later when it comes out 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.180
 the other so that's really why it's 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.590
 better wait a bit too if you want 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.510
 you can buy an iphone or also 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.520
 you can buy the galaxy s 6 that is not 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.560
 come with this chipset but it comes 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.520
 with his own as we said Ã lex 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.349
 hinno 74 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.680
 which in fact it is one of the best in the 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:42.569
 market at least currently so 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.430
 soon tell you that if you liked this 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.199
 Give video if you do not like me 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.090
 known subscribe to our channel 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.669
 We are posting videos with the best of 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.740
 technology with annacone carolina and 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.400
 it's really worth it, we're not going to 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.710
 defraud
