00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.080
 gentlemen good morning everyone will be good 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.460
 I do n't know any of this 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.189
 video you have to watch it because it's the first one 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.590
 player review in video of a player 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.820
 by lpf today we will review 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.160
 alessandro diamonds 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.630
 I tried it I said oh well it will be a 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.720
 a player like the others is not 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.570
 really a phenomenon is a phenomenon is 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.210
 truly a phenomenon that continues to 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.859
 say it fibula now as you see a forest 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.170
 not the statistics there is only to say that 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.730
 already the ultimate team card had a 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.710
 increase of more 5 as overall 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.350
 supported by a plus 31 of the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.590
 statistics has gone from having 81 to 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.329
 pulled 87 ok and the statistics you are 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.590
 seeing now with skill attributes 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.750
 they really did increase 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.440
 amazing ball control for example 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:55.770
 it has gone from 86 to 93 8 of the effect from 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.570
 89 to 99 I don't know I don't know how 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.449
 really describe it because it really is 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.449
 too strong is too strong 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.060
 to me it's true they ca n't really be 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.520
 liked as open seriously speaking 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.460
 this player because the punishments 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.030
 knows how to beat the passages of safari the shootings 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:22.830
 shoot from afar to the 97 shooting from afar 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.500
 of long shots from 85 to 97 past the penalties 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.130
 but 90 passing penalties 89 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.340
 short of power there is the other 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.659
 day I tried cardozo ok the cardozo 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.259
 man of the match said cabbage shoots e 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.470
 makes goals 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.479
 no diamonds even better now in a 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.860
 video you see the scroll punishment 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.020
 attributes 94 of strength or 98 is an 80 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.280
 in the stuff like that he sees punishments 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.990
 which are the most incredible 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.180
 I never did punishment 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.750
 in my life ok su fifa okay okay 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:02.040
 I did and I did three with him 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.360
 two goal punishments to score goals from years not 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.560
 I would have even thought he said that 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.479
 buoys I try so much for I don't know 99 of 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.270
 effect that is felt 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.120
 the only flaw is the speed because at 4 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.640
 a4 discs of weak foot in fact 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.200
 you will see you see you have also seen some goals 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.730
 with the right foot it pulls very strong 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.830
 here it is in theory this honor with 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.000
 right foot in par 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.890
 here is a strong pull it's good for you is good to 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.019
 seeing with a blue shirt is beautiful 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.670
 the same or talking about things 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.290
 series 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.880
 we usually do the best with the pros and the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.470
 against the own against the speed that 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.470
 okay if it would be the fastest 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:53.760
 perfect player at 70 the card 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:57.630
 ultimate team at 76 speed like 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.680
 mentally more 4 and anyway okay 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.230
 in short with the record for the role he has 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.750
 you don't need the ride because it's a c or even 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.400
 a moment in fact please done the 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.170
 gift not to use it michael 4 2 2 2 2 2 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.989
 2 yes I said right with the best 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.600
 because it would mean making him run and him 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.250
 to run it will not make to run 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.230
 this player is good with the ball and 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.359
 good to pull everything good then not 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.980
 put yourself in the middle of the shoulder brisk field 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.680
 here and there because it also launches 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.140
 long site lippi sa boozer like me if 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.390
 always if I said it right to what it is 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:38.430
 portanta 7 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:44.550
 and another flaw is the head though here 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:47.160
 you saw the goal from the head and then oh well 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.140
 I have come back with him I will score goals 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.730
 only to act again at the beginning before 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.290
 still try it because I thought it was 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.240
 a player totally different from 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.250
 what I tried because what 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.670
 I tried think of one of the best 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:04.080
 Players I've ever used is great 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.640
 and ittiri and turn said to make them of 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.650
 face face no less entered one e 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.470
 it's fine except for one right or not 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:15.540
 it's his foot is good at everything 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.940
 above all I repeat he is good at shooting 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.959
 punishments to do everything from the version 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:25.020
 enix and it changes a lot because the version 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.520
 will make me a nice player ok but he has not 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.580
 nothing to do with this because the 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.450
 squat version of this player is 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.669
 awesome 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.410
 in the coming days I will see to review 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.220
 also nozzles or other players who 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.140
 but I think that nobody will succeed in 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.390
 beat this maybe donovan ove from 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.490
 because they are very paid but none 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.200
 will manage to beat this time on mine 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.280
 arrangement has expired I think I have him 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.479
 made it clear that he is a player 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.240
 phenomenal and to the next and we feel 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:59.630
 with the next riviera the last thing 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.630
 he is worth 180,000 yes for strength doctor 9
