00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
dr. Phibbs here on 4-momentum revisited

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.840 
dr. Phibbs here on 4-momentum revisited
and<00:00:02.669> some<00:00:03.030> comments<00:00:03.540> on<00:00:03.659> four<00:00:03.959> vectors<00:00:04.850> that

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
and some comments on four vectors that

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.760 
and some comments on four vectors that
we<00:00:05.910> encountered<00:00:06.480> earlier<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.049> four<00:00:07.290> momentum

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
we encountered earlier the four momentum

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.430 
we encountered earlier the four momentum
we<00:00:07.890> already<00:00:08.160> have<00:00:08.370> seen<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:09.230> since<00:00:10.230> the

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
we already have seen and since the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.249 
we already have seen and since the
energy<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:11.460> MC<00:00:12.360> squared<00:00:12.750> over<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.960> square

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
energy is MC squared over the square

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.499 
energy is MC squared over the square
root<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.469> 1<00:00:14.250> minus<00:00:14.280> B<00:00:14.639> Square<00:00:14.880> C<00:00:15.059> square<00:00:15.179> we

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
root of 1 minus B Square C square we

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.140 
root of 1 minus B Square C square we
have<00:00:15.750> energy<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.650> also<00:00:17.070> gamma<00:00:17.400> MC<00:00:17.850> square

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
have energy is also gamma MC square

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.880 
have energy is also gamma MC square
which<00:00:18.330> means<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:19.789> zeroth<00:00:20.789> component<00:00:20.970> here

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
which means this zeroth component here

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.570 
which means this zeroth component here
can<00:00:22.890> be<00:00:23.070> written<00:00:23.310> as<00:00:23.930> the<00:00:24.930> energy<00:00:25.500> divided<00:00:26.250> by

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
can be written as the energy divided by

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.210 
can be written as the energy divided by
C<00:00:26.970> if<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.750> divide<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.140> by<00:00:28.199> C<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:28.800> get<00:00:28.980> that

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
C if you divide this by C you get that

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.669 
C if you divide this by C you get that
now<00:00:29.400> that's<00:00:29.580> really<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.210> neat<00:00:30.779> observation

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
now that's really a neat observation

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.040 
now that's really a neat observation
because<00:00:33.320> that<00:00:34.320> means<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:36.050> momentum

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
because that means the for momentum

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.240 
because that means the for momentum
consists<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.219> regular<00:00:38.579> momentum<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.300> the

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
consists of the regular momentum and the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.610 
consists of the regular momentum and the
extra<00:00:41.250> slot<00:00:41.579> here<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.600> fourth<00:00:42.899> dimension<00:00:43.140> is

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
extra slot here the fourth dimension is

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.479 
extra slot here the fourth dimension is
energy<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.969> just<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:45.480> your<00:00:46.050> four<00:00:46.890> dimensions

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
energy so just like your four dimensions

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.340 
energy so just like your four dimensions
in<00:00:47.670> space<00:00:47.820> has<00:00:48.420> your<00:00:48.690> XYZ<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.620> time<00:00:50.300> your

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
in space has your XYZ and time your

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.350 
in space has your XYZ and time your
momentum<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:52.739> momentum<00:00:53.070> has<00:00:53.550> your<00:00:54.059> regular

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
momentum for momentum has your regular

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.080 
momentum for momentum has your regular
momentum<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:54.960> energy<00:00:55.020> your<00:00:56.010> four<00:00:56.399> velocity

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
momentum and energy your four velocity

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.830 
momentum and energy your four velocity
has<00:00:57.449> your<00:00:57.690> regular<00:00:58.079> velocity<00:00:58.710> here<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.840> your

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
has your regular velocity here and your

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.500 
has your regular velocity here and your
speed<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.440> light<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:03.030> gamma<00:01:03.239> factor

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
speed of light and the gamma factor

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.359 
speed of light and the gamma factor
because<00:01:04.110> we're<00:01:04.320> taking<00:01:04.650> derivative<00:01:05.189> with

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
because we're taking derivative with

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.670 
because we're taking derivative with
respect<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.360> proper<00:01:06.750> time<00:01:06.960> as<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.409> which

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
respect of the proper time as is which

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.830 
respect of the proper time as is which
is<00:01:07.799> very<00:01:07.979> important<00:01:08.400> now<00:01:08.939> notice<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.510> I'm

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
is very important now notice this I'm

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.649 
is very important now notice this I'm
free<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.530> move<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:11.250> space<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.420> pick

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
free to move in space I can pick

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.760 
free to move in space I can pick
different<00:01:12.830> fees<00:01:13.830> but<00:01:14.760> what<00:01:15.390> about<00:01:15.689> time<00:01:16.290> I

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
different fees but what about time I

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.370 
different fees but what about time I
can't<00:01:17.189> stop<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.689> other<00:01:18.869> words<00:01:19.110> I'm

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
can't stop that in other words I'm

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.850 
can't stop that in other words I'm
pulled<00:01:19.710> forward<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.490> time<00:01:20.790> at<00:01:21.240> speed<00:01:22.200> at<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
pulled forward in time at speed at the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.289 
pulled forward in time at speed at the
speed<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.189> light<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.790> think<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.119> this

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
speed of light so you can think of this

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.140 
speed of light so you can think of this
as<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:24.869> my<00:01:25.110> XY<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.830> Z<00:01:26.009> speed<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.610> my<00:01:26.790> time

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
as like my XY and Z speed and my time

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.840 
as like my XY and Z speed and my time
speed<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.470> I'm<00:01:28.710> forced<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.310> go<00:01:29.490> into<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
speed so I'm forced to go into the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.929 
speed so I'm forced to go into the
future<00:01:30.030> at<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.140> speed<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.530> light<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.549> can

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
future at the speed of light but I can

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.359 
future at the speed of light but I can
settle<00:01:33.930> down<00:01:34.170> here<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.619> make<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.920> zero<00:01:35.280> I

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
settle down here and make this zero I

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.149 
settle down here and make this zero I
can<00:01:35.700> stop<00:01:36.060> my<00:01:36.329> speed<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.960> space<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.680> can't

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
can stop my speed in space but I can't

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.810 
can stop my speed in space but I can't
stop<00:01:38.640> my<00:01:38.909> speed<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.630> time<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.890> that's<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.670> nice

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
stop my speed in time so that's a nice

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.109 
stop my speed in time so that's a nice
observation<00:01:42.659> here<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.710> rest<00:01:43.920> frame<00:01:44.250> if<00:01:44.729> P

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
observation here in the rest frame if P

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.780 
observation here in the rest frame if P
in<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> restaurant<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.680> don't<00:01:46.740> move<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.430> P<00:01:47.670> is

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
in the restaurant you don't move so P is

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.510 
in the restaurant you don't move so P is
zero<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.780> have<00:01:49.049> energy<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:50.070> might<00:01:50.280> think

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
zero and you have energy you might think

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.039 
zero and you have energy you might think
of<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:50.880> sort<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.060> like<00:01:51.149> momentum<00:01:51.570> in

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
of that it's sort of like momentum in

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.690 
of that it's sort of like momentum in
time<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.930> here<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> nice<00:01:55.229> little<00:01:55.500> trick<00:01:55.799> we

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
time and here a nice little trick we

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.260 
time and here a nice little trick we
already<00:01:57.299> saw<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:59.310> length<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.030> form

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
already saw that the length of the form

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.010 
already saw that the length of the form
of<00:02:00.420> venom<00:02:00.630> vector<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.820> M<00:02:02.820> Squared<00:02:03.659> C<00:02:03.990> squared

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
of venom vector is M Squared C squared

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.130 
of venom vector is M Squared C squared
so<00:02:04.829> if<00:02:05.189> we<00:02:05.369> are<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.820> apply<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.240> now<00:02:06.600> with<00:02:06.869> our

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
so if we are to apply it now with our

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.410 
so if we are to apply it now with our
new<00:02:07.560> form<00:02:07.950> for<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.429> we<00:02:08.550> have<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.149> know<00:02:09.239> how<00:02:09.360> you

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
new form for it we have you know how you

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.150 
new form for it we have you know how you
do<00:02:09.629> these<00:02:09.780> things<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.229> take<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.560> time<00:02:10.830> 1

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
do these things you take the time 1

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.710
