00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
out to get her hero on but I highly

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.390 
out to get her hero on but I highly
doubt<00:04:24.360> that<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:25.020> new<00:04:25.050> suspect<00:04:25.860> is<00:04:26.040> Ross

we<00:04:28.770> are<00:04:28.800> led<00:04:29.040> to<00:04:29.070> believe<00:04:29.190> that<00:04:29.430> Solomon<00:04:30.000> is

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
we are led to believe that Solomon is

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.810 
we are led to believe that Solomon is
the<00:04:30.390> new<00:04:30.510> Thor<00:04:30.810> I<00:04:31.110> don't<00:04:31.740> think<00:04:31.980> it<00:04:32.100> is<00:04:32.220> her<00:04:32.430> but

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
the new Thor I don't think it is her but

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.130 
the new Thor I don't think it is her but
I<00:04:32.850> ran<00:04:33.090> out<00:04:33.120> of<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.330> guess<00:04:33.510> as<00:04:33.690> to<00:04:33.870> who<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.110> may

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
I ran out of the guess as to who it may
