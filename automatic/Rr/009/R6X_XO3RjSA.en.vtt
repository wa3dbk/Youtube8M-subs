00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.100
 I'm not going to change this time 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.550
 and well I was looking at the 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:21.490
 sheet music and talking to me 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.460
 learn me the blue king of manuel and 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:28.430
 I found nothing that sounded like 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.920
 songs and things 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.110
 good very x 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.090
 after until my version 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.160
 now they like it is a tutorial for 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.110
 touch the blue king 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.390
 where it looks different your energy is more 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.910
 easy 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.510
 also very well and another that is more 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.510
 similar 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.110
 nothing live of value 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.810
 sustained 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.530
 ah 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.630
 ah 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:32.930
 then one result gone and without touching the 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:36.320
 first rope travel the bass 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:40.120
 and they pretend to be these three 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.120
 ropes the second third and fourth 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.890
 if you are like in the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.900
 but they just put these three and with the bass 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.900
 home 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.480
 the next one is the same as if it were a 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.930
 D minor seventh but put this finger 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.930
 with bass 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.950
 and all that 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.190
 I know nothing 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.190
 seventh largest 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.610
 the sustained 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.849
 - the highest sativa 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.100
 is a version of the choir they change the 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.310
 little things but studied even if they see it 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.860
 on any website there 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.040
 we use the actors write from here 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.380
 with what he tells them and for the chorus that 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.980
 does not change almost anything 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.670
 and the other version that is more like the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.670
 a video 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.020
 to the live version of manuel 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.590
 it's more complicated according to me to touch it 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.590
 and sing it 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.010
 ah 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.099
 ah 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.540
 so the change now then is 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.620
 except let's say what you do is very 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.620
 easy but it's the change what 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:11.060
 we put on the fourth string 'of the 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:14.260
 fret and the third second and first in 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.260
 at number 10 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:23.680
 and what it consists is that the fourth and the 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.680
 first they always move together 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:32.330
 while the second and the third 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.330
 they are in the same place 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.680
 and 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.530
 the story goes alone 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.240
 then it is still as in another version has 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.240
 sustained 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.650
 to greater 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.270
 Y 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.320
 and 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.500
 same is the colo colo already go to local 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.020
 of the metallic tip cord 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:50.520
 serious versions making a video 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:55.490
 explaining a song 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.490
 explaining although they are not video and therefore 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.690
 investment 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.240
 novais
