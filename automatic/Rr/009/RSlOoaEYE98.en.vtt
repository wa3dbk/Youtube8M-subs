 hands and tell you not 3 to do it 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.080
 you need to resist the kinect because 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.059
 just more comfortable to sit on the couch so 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.660

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.720
 entertain you and not force 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.490
