print of what he's gonna produce

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.419 
print of what he's gonna produce
afterwards<00:02:03.750> with<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.170> fiberglass<00:02:04.500> then<00:02:05.250> when

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
afterwards with the fiberglass then when

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.940 
afterwards with the fiberglass then when
this<00:02:05.610> print<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.090> made<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.110> just<00:02:07.259> gonna<00:02:07.409> lay

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
this print is made is it just gonna lay

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.390 
this print is made is it just gonna lay
fiberglass<00:02:08.519> inside<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.379> then<00:02:10.379> trim<00:02:11.220> out<00:02:11.370> a

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
fiberglass inside and then trim out a

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.970 
fiberglass inside and then trim out a
piece<00:02:11.730> like<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:12.629> is<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.840> piece<00:02:13.170> that

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
piece like this so this is a piece that

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.140 
piece like this so this is a piece that
came<00:02:14.129> off<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:14.519> mold<00:02:14.849> and<00:02:15.140> then<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:17.760> excess

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
came off this mold and then the excess

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.020 
came off this mold and then the excess
fiberglass<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:18.989> trimmed<00:02:19.260> out<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.030> made

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
fiberglass is trimmed out and made

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.509 
fiberglass is trimmed out and made
smooth<00:02:21.390> everywhere<00:02:22.110> then<00:02:22.830> Prime<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.370> it's

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
smooth everywhere then Prime and it's

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:37.770 
smooth everywhere then Prime and it's
ready<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.790> paint

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780
