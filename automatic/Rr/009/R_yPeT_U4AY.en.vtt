00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.820
 and on we go with our next one 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.679
 film and that's exactly the way 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.690
 namely that of georg büchner 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.059
 but this time adapted and 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.460
 staged by nuran david calis 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.070
 and I am glad that we are against 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.470
 have the producer ingenious head and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:30.349
 brandnights that made the camera 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:34.260
 halo why do you do that as a movie? 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.600
 yes so we already have with zdfkultur 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.239
 make another theater available 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.010
 that was spring awakening and 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.270
 We thought then what could you 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.670
 because next maybe together 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.370
 approach and since this year the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.180
 the 200th birthday of georg 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.660
 We then thought about the value of books 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.670
 but this material us time to take 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.890
 only on together and then has that 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.120
 script written and we 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.469
 could then filmed last year 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.830
 and it will be in this year, too 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.920
 october to the gate around the toastag around 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.360
 Being shown on TV on TV 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.810
 that's exactly what coproduction is between 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.280
 zdfkultur 3sat and arte and we have 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.320
 still get a world sales because 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.330
 that was a low budget production and 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.939
 they were so nice to us there too 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.280
 to give a little money , yes 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.920
 is played by tom shilling and the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.329
 marie of nora von waldstätten me 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.159
 faith has very little 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.560
 preparation time and also little 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.189
 The two of them were already spinning 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.299
 at the beginning so the dream cast or how 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.049
 quickly everything had to happen 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.299
 go 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.790
 yes it was we had one already 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.130
 normal preparation time but it became 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.619
 then relatively close because then we are 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.360
 also cast relatively large so 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.549
 even with something less familiar 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.670
 Actors also from the theater 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.829
 young actor and in casting has 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.280
 But that is relatively clear 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:05.399
 shown that tom and nora ours 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.899
 desire occupation were and are and yes 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.640
 then we have 18 turn days with those 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.680
 actually only had to turn 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.360
 but nice to know you that 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.489
 actually a grab had that and me 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.439
 immediately a prominent one 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.750
 prominent occupation were drivers 1 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.370
 yes, we'll take a look right now 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.959
 a cutout to give you a feeling 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.959
 get in for it 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.300
 nope 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.460
 yes what you cut in this section now 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:20.019
 not so clearly sees but you have in 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:22.240
 Berlin has something to think about 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:27.210
 because the whole thing led to that 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.210
 to put in today's berlin 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:35.950
 So it was important for us, so to speak 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.950
 to find a place where different 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:43.810
 where ethnic cultures are mixed as well 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:45.820
 so to speak, part of the company off 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.630
 is the not so often shown 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:52.030
 So maybe something will be 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:55.150
 lower educational layers or too 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.740
 poverty becomes visible and offer in berlin 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.370
 actually only two 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.900
 neighborhoods really to Neukölln and 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.280
 wedding where we are for wedding 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.520
 we have not decided that 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.970
 no place is he now more often in filming 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.910
 occurs and that a bit more 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.470
 authentic us appeared as Neukölln 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.200
 where now is a bit now 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.180
 hipper will this process of revolution and 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.880
 essentially in the measure of Berlin-Neukölln 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.260
 I think that's why you still have it there 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:30.010
 very nice structures with the man 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:32.350
 can work and it is still so 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.800
 dad I think the drum major will yes 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:41.430
 from a cafe or restaurant owner 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:45.720
 the believing muslim is played 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.830
 is the figure at least and that gets 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:52.979
 at the same time again it's doing well 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:54.520
 a bit of identity or yes, well 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:57.449
 the 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:02.379
 is or the prehistory is so that 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:04.690
 büchner because even then the question 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:07.210
 has put so deep how can a human 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.770
 sink what is poverty means in such a way 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.500
 a prosperity society 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:14.949
 and of course we are now in 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.379
 we try our modern adaptation 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:19.780
 to reproduce that by ourselves 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:22.030
 a tambourmajor to one to one 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.039
 have made Berlin size yes 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.500
 so to speak say in this quarter 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:29.560
 and in the middle of it and that's it 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.569
 another alien, so to speak, and there 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.699
 in the middle of it sits woyzeck with 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:38.319
 Marie and his clique even deeper 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:40.599
 still socially even lower 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:42.610
 are poorer and work even harder 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:46.000
 then just wanted and wanted to 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:49.150
 look what happened in there so as to 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.940
 You also have this world under the sun 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:54.330
 still shot where was that 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:58.300
 That was support was the sheep 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:00.219
 Castle street in the subway there 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.380
 yes not so many places in Berlin where you 

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:04.960
 to turn something like that you have access to 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.240
 stretch bvg and that was one of the 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.919
 few can then interfere really times from 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.460
 The route networks you enter 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:16.090
 So it was great that we could 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.440
 shut up in this berliner 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.469
 then turn the subway shafts too 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.909
 could be subject of the result 

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:23.680
 we are now at the festival 

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:25.539
 before in advance before watching TV 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:31.710
 come convince 

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:31.710
 exactly was off nuran david calis
