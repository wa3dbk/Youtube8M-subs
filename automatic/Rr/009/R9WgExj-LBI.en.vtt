fishtail and we're going to go under

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.900 
fishtail and we're going to go under
this<00:01:39.050> time<00:01:39.320> so<00:01:40.070> we're<00:01:40.160> crossing<00:01:40.280> it<00:01:40.640> under

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
this time so we're crossing it under

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.540 
this time so we're crossing it under
back<00:01:41.570> into<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.050> middle<00:01:42.380> again<00:01:42.680> just<00:01:43.460> like

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
back into the middle again just like

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.730 
back into the middle again just like
before<00:01:44.050> we're<00:01:45.050> going<00:01:45.080> to<00:01:45.200> go<00:01:45.290> to<00:01:45.380> this<00:01:45.500> side

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
before we're going to go to this side

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.970 
before we're going to go to this side
pick<00:01:46.730> up<00:01:46.790> some<00:01:47.000> hair<00:01:47.180> cross<00:01:47.570> it<00:01:47.750> under<00:01:48.050> into

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
pick up some hair cross it under into

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.130 
pick up some hair cross it under into
the<00:01:49.010> middle<00:01:49.310> so<00:01:49.730> we<00:01:50.000> have<00:01:50.150> now<00:01:50.330> done<00:01:50.390> one

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
the middle so we have now done one

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.620 
the middle so we have now done one
stitch<00:01:51.440> of<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:51.920> reverse<00:01:52.220> fishtail<00:01:52.550> we're<00:01:53.510> going

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
stitch of a reverse fishtail we're going

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.060 
stitch of a reverse fishtail we're going
to<00:01:53.690> do<00:01:53.780> another<00:01:54.140> reverse<00:01:54.500> again<00:01:55.390> grab<00:01:56.390> a<00:01:56.420> piece

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
to do another reverse again grab a piece

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.950 
to do another reverse again grab a piece
pull<00:01:58.070> it

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
pull it

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.399 
pull it
under<00:02:00.659> make<00:02:01.659> sure<00:02:01.810> you<00:02:01.900> don't<00:02:01.990> pick<00:02:02.170> up<00:02:02.260> the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
under make sure you don't pick up the

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.649 
under make sure you don't pick up the
other<00:02:02.530> pieces<00:02:02.770> when<00:02:03.130> you<00:02:03.220> do<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:03.490> put<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:04.570> in

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
other pieces when you do it put it in

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.790 
other pieces when you do it put it in
the<00:02:04.720> middle<00:02:04.869> and<00:02:05.880> then<00:02:06.930> switch<00:02:07.930> it<00:02:07.960> over<00:02:08.229> now

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
the middle and then switch it over now

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.230 
the middle and then switch it over now
the<00:02:08.860> first<00:02:09.190> couple<00:02:09.340> stitches<00:02:09.700> are<00:02:10.000> just<00:02:10.149> the

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
the first couple stitches are just the

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.790 
the first couple stitches are just the
hardest<00:02:10.600> because<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:11.110> braid<00:02:11.260> hasn't<00:02:11.620> really

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
hardest because the braid hasn't really

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.320 
hardest because the braid hasn't really
formed<00:02:12.100> yet<00:02:12.250> after<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:12.970> it<00:02:13.060> gets<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.240> lot

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
formed yet after that it gets a lot

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.320 
formed yet after that it gets a lot
easier<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:14.680> we've<00:02:14.830> done<00:02:15.040> essentially<00:02:15.910> two

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
easier so we've done essentially two

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.600 
easier so we've done essentially two
normal<00:02:16.690> stitches<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.590> reverse<00:02:17.980> stitches<00:02:18.400> and

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
normal stitches to reverse stitches and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.740 
normal stitches to reverse stitches and
now<00:02:18.850> we're<00:02:18.970> going<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.120> go<00:02:19.239> back<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.569> just

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
now we're going to go back and just

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.900 
now we're going to go back and just
repeat<00:02:20.020> this<00:02:20.140> over<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:20.530> over<00:02:20.680> now<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.430> only

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
repeat this over and over now the only

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.580 
repeat this over and over now the only
bummer<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.450> this<00:02:22.569> is<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:23.050> it's<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.230> fishtail

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
bummer to this is that it's a fishtail

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.110 
bummer to this is that it's a fishtail
which<00:02:23.890> means<00:02:24.160> it's<00:02:24.400> going<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.700> take<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:24.880> few

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
which means it's going to take a few

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.850 
which means it's going to take a few
minutes<00:02:25.239> because<00:02:25.780> their<00:02:25.989> intricate<00:02:26.380> stitches

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
minutes because their intricate stitches

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.370 
minutes because their intricate stitches
so<00:02:27.520> we're<00:02:27.640> going<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.790> go<00:02:27.940> again<00:02:28.239> over<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.170> top

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
so we're going to go again over the top

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.150 
so we're going to go again over the top
into<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:30.160> middle<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.840> again<00:02:32.350> over<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:32.980> top

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
into the middle and again over the top

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.080 
into the middle and again over the top
into<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.670> middle<00:02:35.010> about<00:02:36.010> stitch<00:02:36.340> one<00:02:36.580> here

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
into the middle about stitch one here

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.800 
into the middle about stitch one here
stitch<00:02:37.420> two<00:02:37.690> over<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.620> top<00:02:38.800> into<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.160> middle

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
stitch two over the top into the middle

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.130 
stitch two over the top into the middle
over<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.930> top<00:02:41.110> into<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.470> middle<00:02:42.900> that's<00:02:43.900> the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
over the top into the middle that's the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.070 
over the top into the middle that's the
second<00:02:44.470> one<00:02:44.560> now<00:02:44.739> we're<00:02:44.950> going<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.100> reverse<00:02:45.370> it

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
second one now we're going to reverse it

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.949 
second one now we're going to reverse it
so<00:02:47.080> we're<00:02:47.200> going<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.350> go<00:02:47.470> over<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.010> back<00:02:48.959> into

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
so we're going to go over the back into

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.470 
so we're going to go over the back into
the<00:02:50.050> middle<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:53.100> over<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.580> back<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.090> into

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
the middle and over the back and into

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.770 
the middle and over the back and into
the<00:02:55.570> middle<00:02:56.700> okay<00:02:57.700> now<00:02:57.880> here's<00:02:58.150> my<00:02:58.300> other<00:02:58.450> tip

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
the middle okay now here's my other tip

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.540 
the middle okay now here's my other tip
when<00:02:59.530> you're<00:02:59.650> taking<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.040> piece<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.430> hair

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
when you're taking the piece of hair

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.559 
when you're taking the piece of hair
make<00:03:00.730> sure<00:03:00.760> you're<00:03:01.000> taking<00:03:01.239> it<00:03:01.300> from<00:03:01.420> the

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
make sure you're taking it from the

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.069 
make sure you're taking it from the
outside<00:03:01.870> edge<00:03:02.459> take<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:03.579> underneath<00:03:03.850> and<00:03:04.239> make

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
outside edge take it underneath and make

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.600 
outside edge take it underneath and make
sure<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.350> take<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:05.650> right<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.190> middle<00:03:06.459> and

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
sure you take it right to the middle and

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.940 
sure you take it right to the middle and
now<00:03:07.090> hang<00:03:07.390> on<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:07.780> hair<00:03:08.019> like<00:03:08.200> don't<00:03:08.799> let

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
now hang on to that hair like don't let

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.949 
now hang on to that hair like don't let
this<00:03:09.100> back<00:03:09.340> hair<00:03:09.640> like<00:03:09.910> flip<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.390> this<00:03:10.540> outside

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
this back hair like flip to this outside

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.420 
this back hair like flip to this outside
edge<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:11.200> accidentally<00:03:11.950> pick<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.250> back<00:03:12.370> up

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
edge and accidentally pick it back up

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.520 
edge and accidentally pick it back up
because<00:03:13.209> it<00:03:13.329> won't<00:03:13.480> look<00:03:13.570> as<00:03:13.720> good<00:03:13.780> make<00:03:14.380> sure

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
because it won't look as good make sure

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.900 
because it won't look as good make sure
it<00:03:14.620> goes<00:03:14.739> right<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.220> middle<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.610> today's

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
it goes right to the middle and today's

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.030 
it goes right to the middle and today's
put<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:16.480> make<00:03:16.510> sure<00:03:17.140> you're<00:03:17.260> picking<00:03:17.380> up<00:03:17.680> new

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
put and make sure you're picking up new

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.160 
put and make sure you're picking up new
hair<00:03:18.340> from<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.880> outside<00:03:19.269> edge<00:03:19.480> all<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.840> time

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
hair from the outside edge all the time

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.810 
hair from the outside edge all the time
so<00:03:21.160> back<00:03:21.340> across<00:03:21.610> that<00:03:22.269> was<00:03:22.420> stitch<00:03:22.600> one

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
so back across that was stitch one

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.880 
so back across that was stitch one
here's<00:03:24.820> reverse<00:03:25.209> stitch<00:03:25.510> two

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.720 

and<00:03:29.540> back<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:31.310> we're<00:03:32.310> just<00:03:32.340> going<00:03:32.670> to

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
and back and we're just going to
