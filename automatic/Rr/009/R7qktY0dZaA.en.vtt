00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
the QR W 100's which you know gives the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.690 
the QR W 100's which you know gives the
fpv<00:00:34.090> video<00:00:35.090> back<00:00:35.480> to<00:00:35.510> your<00:00:35.840> phone<00:00:36.370> so<00:00:37.370> this<00:00:37.550> way

and we'll check it out alright so that

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:51.299 
and we'll check it out alright so that
was<00:00:48.620> super<00:00:49.160> easy<00:00:49.190> to<00:00:49.670> install<00:00:49.820> there's<00:00:50.660> just

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
was super easy to install there's just

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.849 
was super easy to install there's just
two<00:00:52.309> parts<00:00:52.760> here<00:00:53.089> there's<00:00:53.359> this<00:00:54.289> little<00:00:54.559> front

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 
two parts here there's this little front

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.509 
two parts here there's this little front
arm<00:00:55.399> and<00:00:56.030> then<00:00:56.600> a<00:00:56.629> back<00:00:56.989> piece<00:00:57.320> that<00:00:57.800> has<00:00:58.010> two

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
arm and then a back piece that has two

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.239 
arm and then a back piece that has two
screws<00:00:58.999> that<00:00:59.449> it<00:01:00.199> even<00:01:00.499> comes<00:01:00.769> with<00:01:00.920> the

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249 
screws that it even comes with the

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:03.880 
screws that it even comes with the
little<00:01:01.460> tool<00:01:01.699> to<00:01:01.940> screw<00:01:02.269> them<00:01:02.359> in<00:01:02.589> so<00:01:03.589> you<00:01:03.679> just

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
little tool to screw them in so you just

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.800 
little tool to screw them in so you just
kind<00:01:04.159> of<00:01:04.220> fit<00:01:04.489> it<00:01:04.640> over<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:04.970> notches<00:01:05.360> on<00:01:05.780> the

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
kind of fit it over the notches on the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.840 
kind of fit it over the notches on the
antenna<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:06.650> then<00:01:06.740> screw<00:01:07.130> it<00:01:07.220> together<00:01:07.430> and

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
antenna and then screw it together and

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.000 
antenna and then screw it together and
that<00:01:07.970> holds<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.390> into<00:01:08.480> place<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:09.080> then<00:01:09.770> this

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
that holds it into place and then this

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.260 
that holds it into place and then this
piece<00:01:10.370> just<00:01:10.990> pressure<00:01:11.990> fits<00:01:12.530> on<00:01:12.829> to<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.460> to

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
piece just pressure fits on to the to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.870 
piece just pressure fits on to the to
the<00:01:14.360> arm<00:01:14.570> here<00:01:14.899> so<00:01:15.110> you<00:01:15.200> can<00:01:15.320> actually<00:01:15.700> take<00:01:16.700> it

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
the arm here so you can actually take it

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.600 
the arm here so you can actually take it
off<00:01:16.970> just<00:01:17.030> kind<00:01:17.630> of<00:01:17.750> pops<00:01:18.500> off<00:01:18.799> so<00:01:19.220> if<00:01:19.369> you're

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
off just kind of pops off so if you're

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.090 
off just kind of pops off so if you're
not<00:01:20.329> using<00:01:20.720> it<00:01:21.020> it's<00:01:21.200> not<00:01:21.350> really<00:01:21.680> in<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:21.950> way

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
not using it it's not really in the way

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.709 
not using it it's not really in the way
and<00:01:22.340> you<00:01:22.399> can<00:01:22.579> just<00:01:22.759> leave<00:01:22.969> that<00:01:23.240> installed

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
and you can just leave that installed

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.440 
and you can just leave that installed
and<00:01:24.020> then<00:01:24.110> when<00:01:24.259> you<00:01:24.380> want<00:01:24.590> this<00:01:24.799> you<00:01:24.979> can<00:01:25.130> just

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
and then when you want this you can just

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.510 
and then when you want this you can just
pop<00:01:26.450> it<00:01:26.630> back<00:01:26.659> on<00:01:27.049> and<00:01:27.439> then<00:01:27.560> that<00:01:27.829> allows<00:01:27.979> this

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
pop it back on and then that allows this

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.959 
pop it back on and then that allows this
to<00:01:28.600> you<00:01:29.600> can<00:01:29.750> change<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.469> angle<00:01:31.009> on<00:01:31.189> it<00:01:31.219> and

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
to you can change the angle on it and

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:33.789 
to you can change the angle on it and
it's<00:01:32.630> just<00:01:32.719> spring-loaded

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
it's just spring-loaded

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.399 
it's just spring-loaded
so<00:01:34.100> it<00:01:34.189> has<00:01:34.369> this<00:01:34.610> arm<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:35.540> it<00:01:35.630> can<00:01:35.840> account<00:01:36.259> for

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
so it has this arm so it can account for

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.709 
so it has this arm so it can account for
a<00:01:36.560> bunch<00:01:36.799> of<00:01:36.920> different<00:01:37.070> phone<00:01:37.549> sizes<00:01:38.299> and

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
a bunch of different phone sizes and

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.950 
a bunch of different phone sizes and
this<00:01:39.409> is<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.740> iPhone<00:01:40.219> 5<00:01:40.610> with<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.030> case<00:01:41.450> on<00:01:41.750> it

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
this is the iPhone 5 with the case on it

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.289 
this is the iPhone 5 with the case on it
and<00:01:42.170> actually<00:01:42.369> fits<00:01:43.369> in<00:01:43.579> there<00:01:43.789> with<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.060> case

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
and actually fits in there with the case

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.590 
and actually fits in there with the case
no<00:01:44.630> problem<00:01:45.140> just<00:01:45.380> slides<00:01:45.920> right<00:01:46.130> in<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:46.600> kind

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
no problem just slides right in and kind

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.249 
no problem just slides right in and kind
of<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:47.960> spring<00:01:48.560> pressure<00:01:48.920> holds<00:01:49.399> it<00:01:49.520> in<00:01:49.610> place

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
of the spring pressure holds it in place

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.810 
of the spring pressure holds it in place
and<00:01:51.259> then<00:01:51.500> again<00:01:51.740> you<00:01:51.859> can<00:01:52.009> you<00:01:52.310> can<00:01:52.460> change

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
and then again you can you can change

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.660 
and then again you can you can change
your<00:01:53.090> angle<00:01:53.329> so<00:01:53.869> however<00:01:54.079> you<00:01:54.549> however<00:01:55.549> you

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
your angle so however you however you

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.399 
your angle so however you however you
want<00:01:55.820> to<00:01:55.939> hold<00:01:56.119> it<00:01:56.329> it's<00:01:56.509> got<00:01:56.810> plenty<00:01:57.259> of

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
want to hold it it's got plenty of

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.569 
want to hold it it's got plenty of
options<00:01:58.250> for<00:01:58.670> angle<00:01:59.420> of<00:01:59.630> view<00:01:59.869> there<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:01.039> looks

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
options for angle of view there so looks

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.490 
options for angle of view there so looks
like<00:02:01.759> it's<00:02:02.210> going<00:02:02.359> to<00:02:02.420> work<00:02:02.509> pretty<00:02:02.869> well<00:02:03.020> and

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
like it's going to work pretty well and

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.469 
like it's going to work pretty well and
hopefully<00:02:04.039> I'll<00:02:04.310> have<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.549> chance<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:05.119> actually

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
hopefully I'll have a chance to actually
