incredible<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.350> think<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.770> one<00:01:40.979> where

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
incredible I think this is the one where

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.850 
incredible I think this is the one where
goes<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:41.970> just<00:01:42.119> some<00:01:42.329> crazy<00:01:42.990> run<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.649> see

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
goes on just some crazy run you can see

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.219 
goes on just some crazy run you can see
right<00:01:43.890> now<00:01:44.130> from<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.820> halfway<00:01:45.060> line<00:01:45.329> and

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
right now from like the halfway line and

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.350 
right now from like the halfway line and
he<00:01:46.320> doesn't<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:46.740> great<00:01:47.210> dribbling<00:01:48.210> which

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
he doesn't have great dribbling which

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.630 
he doesn't have great dribbling which
she's<00:01:48.570> very<00:01:48.780> surprising<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:49.950> he<00:01:50.040> just<00:01:50.220> runs

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
she's very surprising but he just runs

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.609 
she's very surprising but he just runs
and<00:01:50.970> he<00:01:51.329> smashes<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:52.049> one<00:01:52.200> into<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.470> back

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
and he smashes that one into the back

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.069
