okay alright so this piece right here
this<00:04:42.570> is<00:04:42.630> our<00:04:42.840> tail<00:04:43.080> that<00:04:43.410> we're<00:04:43.560> not<00:04:43.680> working

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
this is our tail that we're not working

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.120 
this is our tail that we're not working
with<00:04:44.100> and<00:04:45.060> then<00:04:45.270> here's<00:04:45.870> our<00:04:46.020> loops<00:04:46.380> here<00:04:46.949> that

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
with and then here's our loops here that

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.460 
with and then here's our loops here that
we've<00:04:47.250> created<00:04:47.870> all<00:04:48.870> right<00:04:49.080> so<00:04:49.410> our<00:04:50.340> tail<00:04:51.470> and

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
we've created all right so our tail and

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.780 
we've created all right so our tail and
I'm<00:04:52.590> just<00:04:52.710> kind<00:04:52.889> of<00:04:52.919> keep<00:04:53.070> it<00:04:53.190> over<00:04:53.340> here<00:04:53.490> on<00:04:53.520> to

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
I'm just kind of keep it over here on to

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.030 
I'm just kind of keep it over here on to
the<00:04:53.880> side<00:04:54.090> and<00:04:55.050> then<00:04:55.260> here<00:04:55.500> are<00:04:55.620> leeks<00:04:55.889> and

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
the side and then here are leeks and

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.500 
the side and then here are leeks and
like<00:04:56.220> I<00:04:56.310> said<00:04:56.370> I<00:04:56.520> always<00:04:56.699> like<00:04:56.940> try<00:04:57.150> to<00:04:57.180> even

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
like I said I always like try to even

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.930 
like I said I always like try to even
them<00:04:57.600> up<00:04:57.690> a<00:04:57.810> little<00:04:58.020> bit<00:04:58.610> alright<00:04:59.610> so<00:04:59.880> I'm

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
gonna hold your working yarn in your

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.159 
gonna hold your working yarn in your
hand<00:05:14.580> you're<00:05:15.090> gonna<00:05:15.180> take<00:05:15.360> this<00:05:15.479> first<00:05:15.840> link

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
hand you're gonna take this first link

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.730 
hand you're gonna take this first link
that<00:05:16.650> we<00:05:16.800> did<00:05:17.300> pull<00:05:18.300> it<00:05:18.419> over<00:05:18.600> I'm<00:05:19.169> gonna<00:05:19.289> grab

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
that we did pull it over I'm gonna grab

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.740 
that we did pull it over I'm gonna grab
the<00:05:19.860> working<00:05:19.979> yarn<00:05:20.160> with<00:05:20.400> this<00:05:20.550> Dan<00:05:20.760> and<00:05:21.570> then

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
the working yarn with this Dan and then

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.330 
the working yarn with this Dan and then
I'm<00:05:21.840> gonna<00:05:22.020> drop<00:05:22.380> that<00:05:22.650> loop<00:05:22.860> so<00:05:23.130> I'm<00:05:23.220> not

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
I'm gonna drop that loop so I'm not

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.659 
I'm gonna drop that loop so I'm not
creating<00:05:23.850> another<00:05:24.030> loop<00:05:24.500> all<00:05:25.500> right<00:05:25.710> so<00:05:26.550> I'm

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
creating another loop all right so I'm

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.219 
creating another loop all right so I'm
gonna<00:05:26.789> put<00:05:26.910> the<00:05:27.270> working<00:05:27.539> yarn<00:05:27.570> back<00:05:27.930> in<00:05:28.139> this

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
gonna put the working yarn back in this

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.050 
gonna put the working yarn back in this
hand<00:05:28.500> and<00:05:28.680> this<00:05:28.830> is<00:05:28.889> casting<00:05:29.490> off<00:05:29.610> this<00:05:29.820> is<00:05:29.970> how

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
hand and this is casting off this is how

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.550 
hand and this is casting off this is how
you<00:05:30.120> end<00:05:30.479> whatever<00:05:30.900> project<00:05:31.320> that<00:05:31.410> you're

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
you end whatever project that you're

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.800 
you end whatever project that you're
gonna<00:05:31.650> do<00:05:32.150> so<00:05:33.150> I'm<00:05:33.210> just<00:05:33.330> going<00:05:33.479> to<00:05:33.539> create

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
gonna do so I'm just going to create

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.860 
gonna do so I'm just going to create
another<00:05:34.020> link<00:05:34.620> okay<00:05:35.550> and<00:05:36.240> then<00:05:36.690> I'm<00:05:36.780> gonna

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
another link okay and then I'm gonna

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.890 
another link okay and then I'm gonna
take<00:05:37.139> the<00:05:37.380> last<00:05:38.010> loop<00:05:38.460> here<00:05:38.850> and<00:05:39.570> I'm<00:05:39.750> gonna

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
take the last loop here and I'm gonna

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.670 
take the last loop here and I'm gonna
pull<00:05:40.110> it<00:05:40.229> over

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
pull it over

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.089 
pull it over
dropping<00:05:41.220> my<00:05:41.370> working<00:05:41.760> yarn<00:05:41.789> and<00:05:42.440> then<00:05:43.440> just

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
dropping my working yarn and then just

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:46.100 
dropping my working yarn and then just
grabbing<00:05:44.639> it<00:05:44.729> so<00:05:44.970> before<00:05:45.539> you<00:05:45.630> let<00:05:45.780> go<00:05:45.900> of<00:05:46.020> that

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
grabbing it so before you let go of that

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.420 
grabbing it so before you let go of that
loop<00:05:46.320> that<00:05:46.500> way<00:05:46.650> you<00:05:46.710> don't<00:05:46.830> lose<00:05:46.919> it<00:05:47.250> and<00:05:47.340> you

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
loop that way you don't lose it and you

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
loop that way you don't lose it and you
don't<00:05:47.520> want<00:05:47.729> to<00:05:47.789> over<00:05:47.970> tighten<00:05:48.000> it<00:05:48.330> or

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
don't want to over tighten it or

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.940 
don't want to over tighten it or
anything<00:05:48.950> just<00:05:49.950> create<00:05:50.400> your<00:05:51.740> stitch<00:05:52.740> back

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
anything just create your stitch back

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.089 
anything just create your stitch back
onto<00:05:53.099> your<00:05:53.340> arm<00:05:53.930> and<00:05:54.930> then<00:05:55.440> just<00:05:55.680> kind<00:05:55.860> of<00:05:55.919> move

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
onto your arm and then just kind of move

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:03.200 
onto your arm and then just kind of move
it<00:05:56.190> over<00:05:57.260> don't<00:05:58.260> pull<00:05:58.440> it<00:05:58.470> through<00:05:58.770> though<00:06:02.210> and

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
it over don't pull it through though and

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:16.950 
it over don't pull it through though and
here<00:06:03.930> we<00:06:04.050> go<00:06:07.430> almost<00:06:08.430> didn't<00:06:09.030> draw<00:06:09.120> that

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.270 

and<00:06:17.960> just<00:06:18.140> tighten<00:06:18.440> it<00:06:18.470> up<00:06:18.620> every<00:06:18.890> time<00:06:18.920> that

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
and just tighten it up every time that

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.060 
and just tighten it up every time that
you're<00:06:19.460> bringing<00:06:19.580> one<00:06:19.850> over<00:06:20.120> and<00:06:21.050> then<00:06:21.260> start

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
you're bringing one over and then start

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.470 
you're bringing one over and then start
to<00:06:22.160> bring<00:06:22.370> this<00:06:22.490> over<00:06:22.670> and<00:06:22.850> then<00:06:22.970> I'll<00:06:23.120> grab<00:06:23.360> it

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.480 
to bring this over and then I'll grab it

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.090 
to bring this over and then I'll grab it
with<00:06:23.600> this<00:06:23.750> hand<00:06:24.050> and<00:06:24.470> then<00:06:25.160> let<00:06:25.220> it<00:06:25.430> go<00:06:25.600> okay

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
with this hand and then let it go okay

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:32.710 
with this hand and then let it go okay
and<00:06:28.100> then<00:06:28.250> here's<00:06:28.490> our<00:06:28.640> last<00:06:28.940> loop<00:06:29.390> I<00:06:31.630> grab<00:06:32.630> it

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 
and then here's our last loop I grab it

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.630 
and then here's our last loop I grab it
with<00:06:32.840> this<00:06:32.960> hand<00:06:33.260> and<00:06:33.650> then<00:06:33.770> pull<00:06:34.010> this<00:06:34.160> over

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.640 
with this hand and then pull this over

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.450 
with this hand and then pull this over
and<00:06:35.150> then<00:06:35.390> you<00:06:35.480> have<00:06:35.630> this<00:06:35.840> loop<00:06:36.080> here<00:06:36.440> what<00:06:37.430> I

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460 
and then you have this loop here what I

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.050 
and then you have this loop here what I
usually<00:06:37.880> like<00:06:38.060> to<00:06:38.090> do<00:06:38.390> is<00:06:39.430> create<00:06:40.430> a<00:06:40.580> little

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.060 
usually like to do is create a little

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:46.390 
usually like to do is create a little
nut<00:06:41.840> here<00:06:42.310> and<00:06:43.310> this<00:06:43.460> is<00:06:43.580> how<00:06:43.730> I<00:06:43.790> tie<00:06:44.210> off<00:06:45.400> my

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
nut here and this is how I tie off my

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.900 
nut here and this is how I tie off my
