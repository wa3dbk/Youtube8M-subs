00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
20-foot bed a little bit not much

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.480 
20-foot bed a little bit not much
because<00:02:21.850> these<00:02:22.360> two<00:02:22.690> were<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.920> truck<00:02:24.190> here

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
because these two were this truck here

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.060 
because these two were this truck here
was<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.820> same<00:02:25.060> as<00:02:25.360> this<00:02:25.750> but<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.530> still<00:02:26.800> ended

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
was the same as this but I still ended

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.580 
was the same as this but I still ended
up<00:02:27.190> stretching<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:27.850> one<00:02:28.090> just<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:28.390> bit<00:02:28.660> so

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
up stretching this one just a bit so

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.140 
up stretching this one just a bit so
would<00:02:29.710> take<00:02:29.740> a<00:02:29.920> 20<00:02:30.250> foot<00:02:30.370> bed<00:02:30.670> which<00:02:30.700> is<00:02:31.000> what

stretching will take an 18 foot or 17 or

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.940 
stretching will take an 18 foot or 17 or
it<00:02:37.750> kind<00:02:37.960> of<00:02:38.020> depends<00:02:38.320> on<00:02:38.410> what<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.710> want
