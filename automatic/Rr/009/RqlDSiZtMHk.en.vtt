 turn well you fill rooms and your 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.250
 music it does not necessarily pass on 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.259
 long wave 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.880
 so how do you see him you see aubin 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.149
 until now as long as we have 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.940
 the opportunity to sing it is 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.560
 sung live with precisely with the 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.310
 group and do not change all that with 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.790
 the public 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.680
 for now I 'm fine with it 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.619
 this level I have not I have not I have not 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.460
 of frustration or anything if we 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.560
 commits the music is often 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.630
 since today we know 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.789
 evolution evolution of life everything 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.740
 just music and it makes it 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.190
 part of life so that has evolved with 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.720
 it's just the way of selling the 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.179
 music that changed the music in 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.670
 herself she rest remains to be done is 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.310
 there and the same what good yes then the 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.349
 projects finally for you it will be anything 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.289
 ben worked on new 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:57.200
 pieces to be able to continue to 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.539
 turn like this with the group 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.480
 it's really an adventure that is 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.470
 extraordinary painting 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.230
 conceivable differently what for 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.960
 the moment right now a word 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.490
 so your look on the news this 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.760
 is happening right now so 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.550
 politics in the world 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.500
 what would you have to say to yourself ben 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.450
 than what we've been saying since 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.470
 little moment that is to say that my level 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.840
 I am not I am not at all 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.690
 politicians think that they know them 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.220
 they learned to manipulate the verb so 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.970
 know how to make us hear what we 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.040
 want to hear 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.410
 in any case at the level of the actions there 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.170
 is not very good actually we at 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.590
 our little level we were already trying to 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.960
 talk about raising awareness in the mass 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.760
 to follow on different topics precisely 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.780
 of power to open your eyes 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.010
 at most but so if I have one if I have 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.330
 advice to give to anything 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.620
 it's to keep your eyes open from 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.980
 stay alert and not to let yourself 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.980
 destroy 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.459
 that's it but there is something you 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.740
 mean it was not asking who 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.140
 seems important is good simply 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.820
 I'm going to invite everyone to those 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.110
 who have not seen the show yet 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.690
 share this little moment with us 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.190
 may be able to give 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.980
 we need your opinion on it too 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.320
 it's important because for us we have 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.239
 taken here so we avoid all the 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.950
 world to come share this little moment 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.300

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.310

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.730

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:20.430
 seing to erode his gigantic desire 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.430
 that a game like ten years ago 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.169
 the rapper dropped to a corner by 20 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.169

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.800
