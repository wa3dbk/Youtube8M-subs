00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.160
 very nice cars, kids, welcome 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.630
 some more to my channel I'm clippers and 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.490
 we are back in the black ops 2 and os 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.829
 I bring a new nuclear in this case 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.329
 using it in 94 and well you'll see that 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:13.070
 it's a little bit longer game 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:15.320
 the normal thing took a little longer in 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.820
 get me nuclear and comes to me comes 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.650
 of luxury this extra time for 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.990
 tell you what good what I wanted 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.939
 say today not first of all tell you 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.289
 because it's a little bit longer than 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.749
 normal because it lasts a little longer the 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.400
 good nuclear as you will see on the map 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:30.050
 well I still do not have the bone but I 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.369
 nothing is left to get me out you will see how 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.350
 he entered the hot spot now he killed 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.940
 this and I get to kill then 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.710
 get the points needed for the 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.720
 kiss and you will see that on the map 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.640
 just three people appear as 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.410
 very much four and we are the whole game 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.300
 so not people leave the game in 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.130
 how much does your sat cloud do and it makes me 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.680
 grace when you leave in the comments 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:52.510
 what about clippers why do not you get one 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.329
 nuclear with dogs and swarm 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.949
 I can not throw a cloud behind without the 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.269
 People leave the game as it 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.370
 Land imagine a swarm 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.350
 if you have a swarm it 's fine because 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.210
 sure that people are going to go 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.799
 lately nobody is willing to eat one 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.470
 streak even if you have legally removed 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.869
 Though I have taken against them no 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.549
 is willing to eat that kind of 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.890
 gusts then people leave the 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.720
 game in this game for example already 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.399
 you see pulling uss to trish bm then the 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.470
 people would imagine dogs a 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.610
 man I have commented on this subject several 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.100
 times so I will not give him more 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.840
 just simply can not get a 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.979
 nuclear with those gusts because the 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.929
 enemies surrender 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.819
 literally the screen of the 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.259
 enemies surrender in 20 seconds and 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.509
 good when someone comes in 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.310
 they go back and so on and so all the 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.780
 Good time what I wanted to ask you 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.270
 today guys is the important issue 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.340
 I would like to know the people who are 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.500
 now on Xbox 360 and is in 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.390
 ps3 if you are going to change to the new one 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.250
 generation for example those that are in 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.930
 ps3 if you are going to switch to xbox and the 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.320
 that you are in xbox if you are going to change 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.740
 to ps 4 I do not know I've seen what I've 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.020
 I could see et cetera the ps4 I'm not very 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.420
 very informed but let's say something is 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.940
 it's worth what I've seen the ps4 is 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.259
 giving a few kicks to the xbox and 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.590
 apparently because people are going to opt 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.330
 more for the ps4 then my question is 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.370
 what consoles will you be with 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.870
 you who are going to buy and good 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.209
 if you can put the reasons in the 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.590
 comments so much better I do not have 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.300
 a question that is a question 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.890
 personal to me because I have not 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.640
 aware and I can not find it by any 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.350
 side and that is if the call of duty ghosts 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.959
 you will be able to use it in playstation 3 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.650
 and on xbox 360 if you do not have to buy 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.019
 of the new generation since I've heard 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.900
 that will be for acs 4 for xbox one 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.360
 for ps3 and for xbox and the platform 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.189
 pc wii etc but the question is yes 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.319
 I will have to buy necessarily 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:46.750
 the new generation to be able to play 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.459
 hot and two I can not wait a year to 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.930
 buy me the new generation already for the 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.609
 next call of duty that 's my 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.189
 question I hope it has been clear and 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.870
 Well, I can always respond with 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.730
 Certainty in the comments would be 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.489
 very grateful because now as 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.439
 I do not have the means available 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.120
 to buy me the new generation this 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:07.329
 year would have to wait until next year 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.209
 in mid -June and so on to go 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.980
 saving since I've seen that the ps4 is going 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.769
 to cost 400 euros and right now I have 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.569
 other expenses and I can not afford such 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.430
 spending not like that is the question 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.590
 leave me in the comments if you are going to 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.200
 go to xbox and you will go to 13-4 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.819
 the motives and good for here to me 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.200
 respond to what the new generation 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.060
 you need to buy the to play 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.769
 call of duty costing it would be 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.329
 very grateful and nothing about the 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.579
 nuclear and I have nothing left to get me 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.530
 the boys made a jealous attempt at 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.870
 how much do I take out the nuclear more than I think 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.069
 that to 5 to 6 and I committed suicide to try 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.319
 do the nuclear 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.329
 they killed me they killed me I do not know with what 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.040
 streak but I did not take it out so nothing 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.659
 guys I hope you liked us 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.700
 we see tomorrow in the daily video a 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:50.109
 I greet everyone and see you next time 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.700
 well now you are going to see the part of the 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.129
 medals here already have the nuclear 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.900
 the seven hits or three I do not see it 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.530
 well used to all and until next time 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.530
 goodbye
