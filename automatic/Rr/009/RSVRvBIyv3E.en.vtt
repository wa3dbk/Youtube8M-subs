galaxy<00:00:46.590> s5<00:00:46.890> or<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.760> HTC<00:00:48.180> One<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.559> was

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
galaxy s5 or the HTC One and I was

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.920 
galaxy s5 or the HTC One and I was
leaning<00:00:49.829> towards<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> HTC<00:00:50.610> One<00:00:50.760> m8<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.780> buy

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
leaning towards the HTC One m8 to buy

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.290 
leaning towards the HTC One m8 to buy
until<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.559> saw<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.129> price<00:00:53.520> which<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:53.940> that

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
until I saw the price which is that

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.229 
until I saw the price which is that
pretty<00:00:54.510> heavy<00:00:54.930> 529<00:00:55.920> pounds<00:00:56.280> which<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.489> above

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
pretty heavy 529 pounds which is above

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.630 
pretty heavy 529 pounds which is above
eight<00:00:57.510> hundred<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:57.960> thirty<00:00:58.230> dollars<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.129> think

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
eight hundred and thirty dollars I think

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.000 
eight hundred and thirty dollars I think
and<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.780> quite<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.050> heavy<00:01:01.350> price<00:01:01.710> I've

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
and that is quite a heavy price I've

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.709 
and that is quite a heavy price I've
been<00:01:02.160> saving<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.850> didn't<00:01:03.420> feel<00:01:03.539> that

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
been saving it and I didn't feel that

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.440 
been saving it and I didn't feel that
you<00:01:03.930> know<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.229> was<00:01:04.379> worth<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.189> then<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.420> I

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
you know it was worth it and then so I

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.270 
you know it was worth it and then so I
had<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.630> go<00:01:06.780> back<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.080> look<00:01:07.650> at<00:01:07.890> cheaper

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
had to go back and look at cheaper

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.130 
had to go back and look at cheaper
Android<00:01:08.640> solutions<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.360> could<00:01:09.510> get<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.960> I

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
Android solutions I could get and I

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.840 
Android solutions I could get and I
found<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.590> guy<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.070> guy<00:01:11.549> I've<00:01:11.820> been

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
found this guy and this guy I've been

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.270 
found this guy and this guy I've been
wanting<00:01:12.390> ever<00:01:13.020> since<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.500> came<00:01:13.530> out<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.100> now

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
wanting ever since it came out and now

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.320 
wanting ever since it came out and now
if<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.610> compare<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.869> an<00:01:16.110> HTC<00:01:16.740> One<00:01:16.920> m8

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
if you compare this with an HTC One m8

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.749 
if you compare this with an HTC One m8
specters<00:01:18.330> back<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:19.170> not<00:01:19.799> really<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.430> much

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
specters back it's not really that much

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.700 
specters back it's not really that much
of<00:01:20.939> difference<00:01:21.240> at<00:01:21.540> least<00:01:21.570> not<00:01:21.900> noticeably

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
of difference at least not noticeably

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.219 
of difference at least not noticeably
different<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:24.060> don't<00:01:24.299> really<00:01:24.420> need<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.990> my

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
different you don't really need in my

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.870 
different you don't really need in my
opinion<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.799> specs<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.430> get<00:01:26.610> with<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
opinion the specs you get with the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.490 
opinion the specs you get with the
latest<00:01:27.060> device<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> galaxy<00:01:27.930> s5<00:01:28.229> or

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
latest device like a galaxy s5 or

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.530 
latest device like a galaxy s5 or
galaxies<00:01:29.310> form<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.850> octa-core<00:01:30.240> you

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
galaxies form and you have octa-core you

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.940 
galaxies form and you have octa-core you
don't<00:01:30.750> really<00:01:30.960> need<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.290> right<00:01:31.619> now<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
don't really need that right now on a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.520 
don't really need that right now on a
phone<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.460> even<00:01:33.210> quad-core<00:01:33.689> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
phone and even quad-core the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.410 
phone and even quad-core the
capabilities<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.430> what<00:01:35.670> apps<00:01:35.909> are<00:01:36.060> built<00:01:36.270> for

capabilities and what apps are built for

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.870 
capabilities and what apps are built for
that<00:01:36.530> is<00:01:37.530> not<00:01:37.799> really<00:01:37.979> necessary<00:01:38.610> right<00:01:38.850> now

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
that is not really necessary right now

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
think this is an understated design

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.480 
think this is an understated design
which<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.200> but<00:02:01.710> since<00:02:01.950> there's<00:02:02.250> nothing

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
which it is but since there's nothing

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.249 
which it is but since there's nothing
wrong<00:02:02.850> understated<00:02:03.509> designs<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.110> there's

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
wrong understated designs and there's

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.840 
wrong understated designs and there's
nothing<00:02:04.380> wrong<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.740> simplicity<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.790> my

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
nothing wrong in simplicity and in my

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.359 
nothing wrong in simplicity and in my
opinion<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.530> really<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.920> look<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.220> this

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
opinion I really like the look of this

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.650 
opinion I really like the look of this

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.790 
phone especially the black and white
contrast<00:02:09.989> that's<00:02:10.170> why<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.289> went<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.679> white

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
contrast that's why I went for the white

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.880 
contrast that's why I went for the white
version<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.160> now<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.340> other
