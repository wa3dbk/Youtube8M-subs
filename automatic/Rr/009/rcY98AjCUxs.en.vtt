00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.060 
it didn't work with 1.7 point 5 which is

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.920 
it didn't work with 1.7 point 5 which is
what<00:07:07.479> the<00:07:07.600> server<00:07:07.870> is<00:07:08.250> so<00:07:09.330> so<00:07:10.330> if<00:07:10.510> you<00:07:10.630> want<00:07:10.810> to
