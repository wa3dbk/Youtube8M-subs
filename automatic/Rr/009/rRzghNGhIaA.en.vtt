00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.140
 I have already overlapped the type with two layers of color 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.270
 dried each blank for this 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.980
 gel lacquer design should be sufficient 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.410
 flexibility if residual stickiness and 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.899
 no color when we overlap top with 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.969
 sticky dry land in the lamp and already on currents 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.890
 perform our design in her among them 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.450
 enough flexibility so i stupid 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.789
 do not overlap for this design 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.100
 we will need such finely abrasives 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.739
 silver holographic glitter and 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.840
 these glitter we will combine here with 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.550
 same holographic sequins or 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.440
 hexagons this design can be 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.559
 perform both from cuticle to free 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.090
 edge or from the free edge of the cuticle I 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.369
 I will do here cuticle to free 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.920
 edge we start to arrange from the cuticle 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.650
 to the free edge so that 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.790
 near the cuticle was more and closer to 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.790
 free edge less 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.550
 So I placed the hexagons and now 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.650
 we will add our sparkles 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.920
 design in exactly the same way I took 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.940
 for convenience sheet and near the base 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.940
 I drive in our sparkles 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.759
 and then I just start these sparkles 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.759
 stretch 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.909
 yes we did attainable sparkles 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.890
 did stretching sequins and 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.840
 now we have to block our design i 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.729
 the world about our design top dried in 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.920
 lamp and see what a beautiful effect 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.990
 we got this design beautiful 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.970
 looks very pastel shades 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.340
 it can be done on all fingers 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.080
 can be done both on individual fingers and 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.420
 it will look very nice too 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.700
 also made for you by design first 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.980
 Fonyat also looks very nice 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.900
 gently in general I really like yes 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.790
