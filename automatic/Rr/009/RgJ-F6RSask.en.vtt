00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.890
 hello since the end of welcome not yet 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.170
 betting on fitness success the second 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.450
 video of this saga of videos that we are 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.279
 doing that is how to gain muscle step 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.039
 step by step this second video we are going to talk 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.110
 on the protein and not fundamental and 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.180
 important that is to gain mass 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.720
 muscle so I explain everything right now 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.720
 we started 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.219
 the proteins are based 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.960
 they will add muscle because it's going to 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.719
 accompany our body in new 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.739
 creation of muscle tissue hormones and 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.379
 enzymes 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.180
 the amounts that we must take to 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.190
 those who do a training of 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.070
 hypertrophy force as is our case 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.010
 but if we want to gain more muscle mass 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.970
 then I recommend you take between 1.5 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.770
 and 2 grams of protein per kilogram of 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.750
 weight that you have in this way 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.440
 example although ps for example 80 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.190
 kilos then it should take about 160 grams 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.409
 of proteins in your daily diet the 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.130
 best proteins that they should take are 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:25.759
 those that come for example from the chicken 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.039
 of the turkey from the egg whites that 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.720
 percent the proteins from the 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:35.680
 egg are those with the greatest biological contribution 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.570
 and then also for example salmon tuna 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.520
 nuts face all those 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.130
 proteins from these foods 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.280
 and many more are the best quality 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.590
 logically you have to take food 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.690
 that although they give you a quantity 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.860
 important protein give you a 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.960
 very small amount of fat and over 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.630
 all also of low carbohydrates 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.690
 glycemic index that way along with 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.030
 the amount of fat carbohydrates and 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.890
 of calories that you take daily 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.619
 conseguirÃ©is gain muscle mass 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.380
 cleaner way and not covering them less 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.570
 with the least possible fat another factor 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.580
 important to keep in mind at the time 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.209
 of taking daily proteins is that 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.580
 distribute them in quantities during 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.620
 all day does not make much sense because 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.860
 example that you take all the protein that 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.520
 you have to take in a day in one or two 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.510
 meals but it's better 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.100
 throughout all of this way and 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.490
 we will make the body maintain a state 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.020
 anabolic for longer 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.180
 truly fulfill their function and 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.010
 can be used for anabolism is 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.890
 necessary that the calories that we will take 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.890
 daily go in proportion to the expense 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.720
 caloric and that the proportion of 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.450
 carbohydrates and fats is suitable for 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.220
 that in this way proteins 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.470
 really help us at the time of 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.760
 build muscle non-tissue 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.670
 Well, you're here in the second 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.650
 Today's video of this video saga of 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.090
 how to gain muscle step by step 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.190
 I recommend that you do not miss the first 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.050
 Video of this saga in which he spoke 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.900
 about the calories needed to win 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.670
 muscle mass and that I'm very attentive to 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.010
 third video that we are going to do that is 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.690
 about carbohydrates so we 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.000
 we see in the following video subscribe 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.000
 share the video and until next time
