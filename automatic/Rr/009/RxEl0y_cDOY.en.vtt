Western folk like to add nutmeg and
stuff<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.949> but<00:00:58.949> that's<00:00:59.250> not<00:00:59.460> truly<00:00:59.789> chai

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
stuff to it but that's not truly chai

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.810 
stuff to it but that's not truly chai
and<00:01:00.449> which<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.620> really<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:02.070> means<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.760> just
