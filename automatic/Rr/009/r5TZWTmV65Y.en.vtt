00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 I would like to talk in this video 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.440
 a little about what you want 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.740
 principle how much money to earn on 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.049
 this type of business 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.680
 forcing green onions and what areas 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.590
 for this we need a small 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.390
 calculating a well around itself 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.810
 by myself 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:28.939
 that is, in our opinion in our opinion 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.009
 calculation for if you want to earn 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.039
 let's say we 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.719
 and has regular customers for your product 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:43.019
 then you need it to a minimum 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:45.420
 if a family of four people are people 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:50.420
 work and here are two wage workers at 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.799
 You need us at least 200 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.159
 230 square meters that is it like 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:55.159
 us now 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.160
 if a 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.390
 you want to have a little something there together 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.010
 like a man you want to have a good one 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.370
 income and 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.850
 you will need at least 100 squares 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.770
 this includes the usable area 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.820
 you will be racking system that is 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.820
 paper folded 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.050
 if you 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.510
 having some major work on you 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.540
 there is a small greenhouse let's say 50 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:50.380
 squares then this is also a good option 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.659
 but there is such a problem with 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.240
 sales, that is, if you go somewhere 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:02:00.220
 needless sciences hurt not go but 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.659
 earn not some money for your 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.520
 family extra money you 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.430
 you can but as you said 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.630
 There is a problem that you do not always 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:14.280
 will be able to provide on their 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:17.890
 buyers their point during the bow and 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.970
 will not be able to adjust the price as 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.540
 Still, the volume should be a little more 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.360
 that is, at least as many squares 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.810
 so you can let him together 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.430
 serve fully if we donâ€™t 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.670
 was where the greenhouses were if we had 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.530
 one greenhouse 100 squares there freely 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.790
 two people working in it 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:47.370
 completely on this work in principle 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.370
 there would be enough money for it 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:04.360
 on money about 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.980
 our two greenhouses give for the year in a million 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.670
 three hundred roughly income 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:14.860
 husband, I so averaged so based on 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:17.800
 This can be counted on your 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.620
 area well it just depends on 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.210
 region to what are your prices what is your 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.730
 competition and 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.160
 million three hundred rubles and if you 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:32.050
 is somewhere in another country of course 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:36.820
 recalculate this data for 2011 2010 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.040
 year about here are the prices for well more 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.890
 large areas 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.250
 talk to me and or there papa doesn't have 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.340
 meaning as we are these areas we 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.900
 do not occupy telling only personal 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:55.000
 experience but know that people rush 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.420
 huge income as we talked for us 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.540
 it 's still a family business and we 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.920
 We recommend everything from that side as 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:08.400
 positioning like this as a family business 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:11.910
 but we also know that in our experience 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.440
 what people wrote on our forum 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.620
 light up this idea and see great 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.739
 huge greenhouses build profitability 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.200
 but in the end they have a lot of work and 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.720
 become unprofitable for them why 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.650
 because all the same a large number 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.639
 hired workers 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.169
 also these people are trying to take their 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.680
 money turnover 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:39.680
 and thus they have to reduce prices 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.759
 to tons of green onions then 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:47.720
 there is if you want that is like somehow 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:50.030
 expand your business so we are not really 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.820
 no advice maybe you will succeed 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.610
 but I risk that big 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.419
 huge greenhouses whole farm if 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.750
 under this 100 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:02.360
 That is, such risks if everyone of course 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.720
 please get in touch with us 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.880
 fly to some of your your report 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.660
 work and if possible 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:15.110
 regret well and also with not regret and we 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.500
 tell others about it thanks for 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.500
 Attention
