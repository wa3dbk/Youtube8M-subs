00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.160
 the green campus micro offers the 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.500
 students of the first community school 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.209
 lichtenberg very special activities 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.860
 from the first to the eighth grade 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.349
 become the children for environmental protection 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.150
 and the animal care entertainment is trained 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.939
 Everyone has to get started here 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.470
 Of course, goal is usually what 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.160
 The children most like to do practical things 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.939
 to organize activities and the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.199
 theoretical story afterwards 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.059
 work up 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:36.010
 furthermore they are motivated so 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.860
 also to deal with the theory 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.350
 for this was 1991 the non-profit 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.239
 club michor grasshopper founded 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.690
 important ingredient is the snaps 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.030
 drive 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.110
 It started with two sharp and 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.690
 a few rabbits 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.030
 By now, around 160 animals live here 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.949
 in a species-appropriate environment for the 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.940
 school classes became the farm day 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.070
 set up 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.010
 the children come to us and take over 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.269
 Completely the tasks of the animal keeper 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.650
 The low-flying aircraft should be on this day 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:08.680
 Hands stuck in the bag with advice and 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.210
 did stand to the side and the children 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.430
 just say what needs to be done so 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.840
 clear up a bit 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.820
 in the feed kitchen for example what 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.980
 feed which animals get the students 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.990
 class 8b very diligent 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.300
 are the animal stables to clean and that 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.250
 to prepare feed have a lot of fun in 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.920
 the snap farm and something different 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.730
 So teach in the farm day 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.790
 we do it twice a year and there 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.920
 Let's help the animals get here 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.710
 I feel good and I always enjoy it 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.110
 because it's fun because that's something 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.700
 other than normal school life the 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.620
 I predicted cats 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.120
 and I have a good one too 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.490
 experiences i have no cat i 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.230
 I wanted to have some but now I know 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.900
 that it's pretty much work but 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.270
 also makes fun offered prefer I go 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.830
 stop in the cellar 15 schillers and then 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.530
 I make you magic in this wood totally 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.190
 formless and funny and j which makes the 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.770
 most fun 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.030
 the knicks colors and the farm days 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.729
 are not all yet 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.709
 innovations of the green campus my 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.479
 Environmental library and a knowledge lab 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.080
 are also available to the students 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.879
 disposal 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.560
 The primary story is natural 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.030
 that we want to achieve that 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.160
 Children first with literature 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.020
 So they are also introduced 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.810
 it's not going to be that way there 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.360
 only books to the environment 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.370
 protection have been written somewhere 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.620
 there are on the spot but that of course 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.370
 also the normal literature 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.650
 children are excited to borrow 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.480
 So there is that and children so too 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.090
 manage this environmental library yourself 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.580
 then of course we have our lab 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.769
 this lab that he is very complex 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.220
 Teaching is so structured here 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.810
 Two rooms have been opened to one 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.090
 in one area that becomes 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.000
 experimental carried out in the second 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.190
 then part of the work on the laptop 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.420
 so to speak, here again the 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.130
 Findings in the 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.459
 then experiment has won 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.860
 to take up and to tighten too 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.310
 There is also the teaching environment 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.170
 empty 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.970
 that is unique in Germany and for 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.290
 the students a great change 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.349
 they can learn a lot 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.549
 So we do not do it that way now 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.200
 it go out into the nature and waste 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.860
 but we also talk about topics 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.150
 what can we do about green energy 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.519
 produce and what can we do better 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.810
 and then we'll talk about it 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.239
 stories like for example 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.859
 nuclear power stations and so and then 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.350
 Let's discuss everything and on 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.359
 then we end up always yes and 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.340
 the result and that will be 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:38.100
 you usually have to be pretty cool 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.079
 just do the group work and no 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.760
 copy something now 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.310
 there must be a lot of posters 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.980
 Lectures work small presentation 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.630
 on hourly and such and learned one has 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.280
 while creeping over the various 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.560
 topics and we do a lot of group work 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.560
