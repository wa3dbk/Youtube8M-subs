00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
progression there so I have a bit of a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.660 
progression there so I have a bit of a
play<00:01:13.470> around<00:01:13.590> with<00:01:13.800> that<00:01:13.830> just<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.550> get

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.130 

when<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.310> get<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.640> sea<00:02:54.820> you're<00:02:55.750> holding

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240
