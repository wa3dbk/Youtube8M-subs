00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.580
 ps it is so compact 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.210
 electric bike that you can take 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.590
 with you anywhere literally and subway 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.340
 weight this model represents 12 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.380
 a kilo she is controlled enough 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.930
 just but requires little taxes 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.430
 learning give them tell you how to learn 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.960
 don't ride first you need it 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.960
 put the pedals upright 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.360
 turn on 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.940
 electric motor and built-in gyroscope 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:57.040
 which allows the wheel to not fall 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.580
 forward back here I turn part of a half 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.100
 seconds 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.680
 This gyro turns on and control this 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.430
 modelki very easy you accelerate 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.530
 or brake as well as all the nuts on wheels 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.710
 there is no front and back either side 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.260
 is leading so in order to 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.200
 quickly learn how to manage there are a couple 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.630
 simple exercises to start 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.729
 place the wheel between your legs and correctly 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.180
 position and foot foot need 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.070
 somewhere in the middle i have 5 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.229
 . barely hangs on the juice 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.750
 as I said it is managed by 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.880
 transferring body weight to the toes forward and 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.190
 Piglet that is, you put the right 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.020
 conveniently the wheel is located under 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.400
 a slight degree bow here as 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.050
 like you're sitting on a bike and 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.369
 stopped to rest 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.590
 door waiting for sid for a feeder 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.650
 many plans in the villa here the leg is bent 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.080
 at 15 degrees and is in this 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.729
 red zone special rubber 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.789
 soft to a little bit here 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.310
 some pose was set angle 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.270
 here is slightly tilted too and try 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.050
 how to manage it 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.050
 sock me sock sleep. since for 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.509
 you it will be a little bit unusual experience 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:14.939
 the kit comes with a training strap 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:19.140
 Here is such a free you open 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:23.110
 insert by the handle 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:26.129
 adjust the length of the identity calls 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.510
 small enjoys lima nikita 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:32.409
 adjusted the site as you like 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.870
 took in hand here and with this you can eat 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:37.920
 literally 1 day2 at the moment when you 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.390
 learn that is you jump if you 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.680
 picked up by him 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.859
 so we presented the belt correctly 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.569
 set foot extension number one 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:49.720
 tests back and forth we feel it 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.739
 movement exercise number two after 50 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.099
 minutes of such tests 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.590
 you need to take a step up principle as if 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.409
 I put the gitis on a scooter slightly 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.049
 put your body weight on the leg standing on 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:03.849
 ipad pedals steps because I can and 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.430
 after meters of mind from you are watching this 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:10.629
 sea ​​cruise on like this you cant 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:15.819
 and pull up and pull up 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:17.829
 that is, such a long step from rehearsing 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.169
 somewhere 10-15 minutes do not be lazy 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.480
 just draw your attention that I have 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.879
 behind is the right foot on the wheel captive and 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.449
 people standing left put the one that you 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:30.220
 conveniently further walked walked walked walked 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:30.910
 now you need to learn to fly 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.400
 use 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.180
 or your friend on the shoulder who 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.299
 can lean 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:42.010
 or use the walls in my case 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:44.680
 it will be comrade covenant friend 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.169
 lean on his shoulder like this 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.989
 hand and try to jump on the wheel 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:52.150
 stand in your hands I must say that 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.370
 stand on it a little uncomfortable 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.379
 because they need to put a ride it 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.540
 no varietal apparatus is enough for him 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.629
 You can quickly get used to it so comrades 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.579
 you say go ahead he goes and you 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.940
 Substitute leg and go 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:10.209
 here the main task to develop speed 5 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.190
 felt per hour then you won't 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.310
 get distracted by some side strengths 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.019
 fluctuations will learn to get used to 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.549
 this speed if you eat slower then 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.340
 you have enough wheel 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.550
 yuli prowler separately I want to note 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.599
 quite strong body which is very 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.210
 bear with all your 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.919
 falling experiment which principle 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.289
 there should not be much because the bases 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.840
 Science is acquired in 15 20 minutes 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.789
 it is very convenient to stay low from 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.130
 earth case what you jump off 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.139
 ran a couple of steps and enough 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.789
 safety strap on 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.830
 the second or third day you shoot 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.229
 There are models on which people there 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.300
 repeat jumped off with light abrasions then 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.600
 plastic no cracks to also ring 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.820
 charging from socket 220 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.270
 unscrews a small power supply 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.760
 plug in silently charging 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:03.370
 here drop dead bayonet is a light bulb 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.800
 the battery charge is honest green 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.490
 means fully built slaughtered when 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.240
 she flickers 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.830
 all six process when the paint flickers 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.990
 33 percent lights up red all 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.340
 charging left 10 percent charge 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.600
 battery i hope that when it gets warmer 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.610
 many of you will gain such 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.320
 drop dead gadgets together park 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.850
 bitter we will build you my 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.960
 flash mob with you was alexander 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:42.720
 join bye
