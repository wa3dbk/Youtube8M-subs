speculated<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.700> that's<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.180> main<00:00:45.629> reason

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
speculated that that's the main reason

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.720

the<00:00:46.260> teammate<00:00:46.649> has<00:00:46.860> not<00:00:47.070> been<00:00:47.250> doing<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.700> well

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
the teammate has not been doing so well

this<00:00:48.539> season<00:00:48.780> their<00:00:49.260> first<00:00:49.500> season<00:00:49.680> ever<00:00:49.980> is

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
this season their first season ever is

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.100 
this season their first season ever is
because<00:00:51.300> they<00:00:51.510> don't<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.870> lot<00:00:52.079> of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
because they don't have a lot of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.590 
because they don't have a lot of
diversity<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:53.129> far<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.550> practice<00:00:54.000> partners<00:00:54.360> go

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
diversity as far as practice partners go

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.959 
diversity as far as practice partners go
I<00:00:54.840> mean<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.199> only<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.590> three<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.430> each<00:00:56.579> race

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
I mean you only have three of each race

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.139 
I mean you only have three of each race
to<00:00:57.780> practice<00:00:58.230> against<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.890> that's<00:00:59.640> not<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.850> lot

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
to practice against and that's not a lot

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.060 
to practice against and that's not a lot
of<00:01:01.399> variety<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.430> play<00:01:02.850> styles<00:01:03.270> definitely

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
of variety of play styles definitely

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.050 
of variety of play styles definitely
although<00:01:05.070> I'm<00:01:05.309> not<00:01:05.369> sure<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.790> entirely

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
although I'm not sure if I entirely

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.840 
although I'm not sure if I entirely
agree<00:01:06.260> with<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.290> assessment<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:08.220> teammate

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
agree with that assessment that teammate

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.070 
agree with that assessment that teammate
is<00:01:08.970> not<00:01:09.119> doing<00:01:09.420> well<00:01:09.450> because<00:01:09.689> they<00:01:09.900> don't

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
is not doing well because they don't

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.770 
is not doing well because they don't
have<00:01:10.400> practice<00:01:11.400> partner<00:01:12.000> diversity<00:01:12.600> or

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
have practice partner diversity or

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.960 
have practice partner diversity or
whatever<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.409> think<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> main<00:01:14.310> reason<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.729> just

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
whatever I think the main reason is just

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.520 
whatever I think the main reason is just
a<00:01:15.090> psychological<00:01:15.900> thing<00:01:16.049> because<00:01:16.409> they've

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
a psychological thing because they've

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.289 
a psychological thing because they've
thrown<00:01:16.799> these<00:01:17.009> guys<00:01:17.640> together<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.270> team

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
thrown these guys together in a team

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.840 
thrown these guys together in a team
house<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.840> they've<00:01:18.930> been<00:01:19.080> told<00:01:19.400> okay<00:01:20.400> better

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
house and they've been told okay better

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.170 
house and they've been told okay better
do<00:01:21.150> well<00:01:22.009> gotta<00:01:23.009> earn<00:01:23.189> your<00:01:23.460> sponsor<00:01:23.970> no

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
do well gotta earn your sponsor no

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.899 
do well gotta earn your sponsor no
pressure<00:01:24.450> or<00:01:24.600> anything<00:01:25.310> yeah<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.460> think<00:01:26.549> that's

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
pressure or anything yeah I think that's

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.390 
pressure or anything yeah I think that's
the<00:01:27.210> main<00:01:27.930> reason<00:01:27.990> they<00:01:28.950> don't<00:01:29.070> know<00:01:29.250> each

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
the main reason they don't know each

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.160 
the main reason they don't know each
other<00:01:29.520> very<00:01:29.670> well<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.360> mean<00:01:30.509> they<00:01:30.600> know<00:01:31.049> each

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
other very well I mean they know each

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.410 
other very well I mean they know each
other<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.530> pairs<00:01:31.860> because<00:01:32.670> they<00:01:32.909> came<00:01:33.119> off<00:01:33.360> of

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
other in pairs because they came off of

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.530 
other in pairs because they came off of
the<00:01:33.720> disbanded<00:01:34.229> teams<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.939> pairs<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.030> two<00:01:36.150> or

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
against although I don't think they were

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.800 
against although I don't think they were
that<00:02:02.280> good<00:02:02.520> moving<00:02:03.299> on

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
that good moving on

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.770 
that good moving on
yeah<00:02:05.560> but<00:02:05.710> leeda<00:02:05.950> leeda<00:02:06.310> on<00:02:06.939> the<00:02:07.060> other<00:02:07.180> side<00:02:07.450> I

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
yeah but leeda leeda on the other side I

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.540 
yeah but leeda leeda on the other side I
think<00:02:08.110> a<00:02:08.140> couple<00:02:08.289> years<00:02:08.590> ago<00:02:08.649> people<00:02:09.250> would

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
think a couple years ago people would

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.670 
think a couple years ago people would
have<00:02:09.670> said<00:02:09.910> that<00:02:10.090> Lita<00:02:10.300> he's<00:02:11.140> on<00:02:11.319> his<00:02:11.440> way<00:02:11.500> to

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
have said that Lita he's on his way to

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.760 
have said that Lita he's on his way to
supplant<00:02:12.660> fantasy<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.780> flash<00:02:14.080> as<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:14.470> top

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
supplant fantasy and flash as the top

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.630 
supplant fantasy and flash as the top
Terran<00:02:15.370> player<00:02:16.080> these<00:02:17.080> days<00:02:17.349> and<00:02:17.980> maybe<00:02:18.370> not

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
Terran player these days and maybe not

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.760 
Terran player these days and maybe not
so<00:02:18.790> much<00:02:18.940> he's<00:02:19.540> still<00:02:19.780> good<00:02:20.050> but<00:02:20.380> he<00:02:20.590> never

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
so much he's still good but he never

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.220 
so much he's still good but he never
really<00:02:21.280> reached<00:02:22.090> his<00:02:22.269> full<00:02:22.450> potential<00:02:22.870> I

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
really reached his full potential I

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.220 
really reached his full potential I
think<00:02:23.760> probably<00:02:24.760> due<00:02:25.269> to<00:02:25.300> his<00:02:25.540> vs<00:02:25.870> protoss

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
think probably due to his vs protoss

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.990 
think probably due to his vs protoss
because<00:02:26.560> vs<00:02:27.040> protoss<00:02:27.340> has<00:02:27.550> always<00:02:27.849> been<00:02:28.060> his

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
because vs protoss has always been his

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.479 
because vs protoss has always been his
Achilles<00:02:31.000> heel<00:02:31.319> much<00:02:32.319> like<00:02:32.620> fire<00:02:32.920> bad<00:02:33.190> hero

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
Achilles heel much like fire bad hero

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.890 
Achilles heel much like fire bad hero
and<00:02:33.700> I<00:02:33.730> think<00:02:33.910> that's<00:02:34.060> what<00:02:34.269> kept<00:02:34.480> fire<00:02:34.720> bet

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
and I think that's what kept fire bet

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.509 
and I think that's what kept fire bet
hero<00:02:35.140> from<00:02:35.260> really<00:02:35.560> breaking<00:02:35.769> out<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.190> was<00:02:36.370> his

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
hero from really breaking out to was his

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.710 
hero from really breaking out to was his
damned<00:02:37.450> vs<00:02:38.110> protoss<00:02:38.530> always<00:02:39.040> hold<00:02:39.220> them<00:02:39.400> back

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
damned vs protoss always hold them back

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.240 
damned vs protoss always hold them back
you<00:02:40.720> have<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> two<00:02:41.019> gateways<00:02:41.290> coming<00:02:41.920> up<00:02:42.010> here

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
you have a two gateways coming up here

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.820 
you have a two gateways coming up here
for<00:02:42.660> Tyson<00:02:43.660> what<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.019> hell<00:02:44.170> is<00:02:44.260> Tyson<00:02:44.620> doing

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
for Tyson what the hell is Tyson doing

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.229 
for Tyson what the hell is Tyson doing
and<00:02:44.920> he<00:02:44.980> put<00:02:45.160> down<00:02:45.370> let's<00:02:45.970> yeah<00:02:46.150> the

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
and he put down let's yeah the

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.750 
and he put down let's yeah the
cybernetics<00:02:46.810> core<00:02:47.019> is<00:02:47.140> warping<00:02:47.560> in<00:02:47.830> at<00:02:48.310> the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
cybernetics core is warping in at the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.640 
cybernetics core is warping in at the
front<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.209> he<00:02:49.330> didn't<00:02:49.630> even<00:02:49.690> go<00:02:49.989> out<00:02:50.110> to<00:02:50.290> scout

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
front and he didn't even go out to scout

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.589 
front and he didn't even go out to scout
I<00:02:50.709> don't<00:02:51.069> think<00:02:51.400> got<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.120> take<00:02:52.239> a<00:02:52.269> look<00:02:52.390> at<00:02:52.510> the

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
I don't think got to take a look at the

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.120 
I don't think got to take a look at the
no<00:02:53.140> he's<00:02:53.440> not<00:02:53.709> even<00:02:54.010> scouted<00:02:55.200> interesting<00:02:56.200> so

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
no he's not even scouted interesting so

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.339 
no he's not even scouted interesting so
I<00:02:57.160> don't<00:02:57.610> I<00:02:57.790> don't<00:02:57.819> know<00:02:58.060> what<00:02:58.330> Tyson<00:02:58.900> is<00:02:59.019> up<00:02:59.140> to

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
I don't I don't know what Tyson is up to

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.940 
I don't I don't know what Tyson is up to
but<00:02:59.680> he<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.340> going<00:03:00.519> for<00:03:00.849> a<00:03:00.880> very<00:03:01.269> kind<00:03:01.599> of<00:03:01.950> rush

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
but he is going for a very kind of rush

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.309 
but he is going for a very kind of rush
e<00:03:02.980> strategy<00:03:03.910> not<00:03:04.060> complete<00:03:04.420> rush<00:03:04.690> i<00:03:04.900> guess<00:03:05.110> if

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
e strategy not complete rush i guess if

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.780 
e strategy not complete rush i guess if
he<00:03:05.410> is<00:03:05.530> going<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.799> be<00:03:05.860> very<00:03:06.130> aggressive<00:03:06.459> with

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
he is going to be very aggressive with

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.550 
he is going to be very aggressive with
these<00:03:06.910> grooves<00:03:07.209> he's<00:03:07.450> upgrading<00:03:08.319> his<00:03:08.380> jus

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
these grooves he's upgrading his jus

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.710 
these grooves he's upgrading his jus
goon<00:03:08.739> range<00:03:09.040> already<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:09.790> he<00:03:10.239> hasn't<00:03:10.630> even

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
goon range already and he hasn't even

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.680 
goon range already and he hasn't even
gone<00:03:10.930> out<00:03:11.109> to<00:03:11.290> scout<00:03:11.590> he<00:03:12.310> kept<00:03:12.609> the<00:03:12.850> scouting

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
gone out to scout he kept the scouting

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.479 
gone out to scout he kept the scouting
probe<00:03:13.959> at<00:03:14.109> home<00:03:14.350> to<00:03:14.620> get<00:03:14.739> himself<00:03:14.859> some<00:03:15.130> extra

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
probe at home to get himself some extra

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.270 
probe at home to get himself some extra
minerals<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:16.840> jumpstart<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.500> strategy<00:03:18.070> but<00:03:18.220> I

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
minerals to jumpstart the strategy but I

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.800 
minerals to jumpstart the strategy but I
think<00:03:18.459> he<00:03:18.519> might<00:03:18.640> have<00:03:18.760> been<00:03:18.820> anticipating<00:03:19.630> a

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
think he might have been anticipating a

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.340 
think he might have been anticipating a
14<00:03:20.560> cc<00:03:21.010> or<00:03:21.310> quick<00:03:22.060> expand<00:03:22.630> build<00:03:22.900> from<00:03:23.079> lido

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
templars soon so I guess it doesn't even

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.689 
templars soon so I guess it doesn't even
really<00:06:25.449> matter<00:06:25.569> that<00:06:25.840> much

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699
