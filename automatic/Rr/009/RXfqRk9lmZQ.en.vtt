isn't<00:03:18.110> it<00:03:18.530> was<00:03:18.680> not<00:03:18.890> wrong<00:03:19.070> so<00:03:19.489> now<00:03:20.150> I<00:03:20.180> have<00:03:20.300> to

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
isn't it was not wrong so now I have to

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.180 
isn't it was not wrong so now I have to
correct<00:03:20.800> so<00:03:21.800> I<00:03:22.220> would<00:03:23.180> rather<00:03:23.510> advise<00:03:24.019> you<00:03:24.320> to

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
correct so I would rather advise you to

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.030 
correct so I would rather advise you to
join<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.150> study<00:03:26.390> program<00:03:26.930> if<00:03:27.200> you<00:03:27.709> really

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
join the study program if you really

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.830 
join the study program if you really
want<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.400> learn<00:03:28.550> these<00:03:28.790> otherwise<00:03:29.420> you<00:03:29.660> can

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
want to learn these otherwise you can

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.880 
want to learn these otherwise you can
just<00:03:29.870> get<00:03:30.230> an<00:03:30.380> idea<00:03:30.830> about<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:32.239> topic

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
just get an idea about the topic

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.759 
just get an idea about the topic
probably<00:03:33.890> someone<00:03:34.400> can<00:03:35.360> get<00:03:35.690> an<00:03:35.840> idea<00:03:35.930> in<00:03:36.470> fact

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
probably someone can get an idea in fact

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.250 
probably someone can get an idea in fact
this<00:03:37.370> is<00:03:37.430> good<00:03:37.790> I<00:03:38.060> am<00:03:38.150> happy<00:03:38.750> that<00:03:39.019> this<00:03:39.200> is

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
happening

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.369 
happening
and<00:03:41.269> someone<00:03:41.720> get<00:03:41.870> something<00:03:42.140> here<00:03:42.349> about

certain topic with an email but you have

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.589 
certain topic with an email but you have
to<00:03:45.260> be<00:03:45.440> sure<00:03:46.310> first<00:03:46.700> that<00:03:46.940> this<00:03:47.209> video's

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
to be sure first that this video's

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:53.050 
to be sure first that this video's
suitable<00:03:48.170> for<00:03:48.379> your<00:03:48.530> letter<00:03:48.769> and<00:03:50.200> second<00:03:52.060> get

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
suitable for your letter and second get

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
suitable for your letter and second get
a<00:03:53.090> letter<00:03:53.709> to<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.739> previous<00:03:55.310> layers<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:55.970> that

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
a letter to the previous layers to that

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.350 
a letter to the previous layers to that
in<00:03:57.080> order<00:03:57.290> that<00:03:57.470> you<00:03:57.739> can<00:03:58.430> adjust<00:03:58.640> it<00:03:59.150> and

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
in order that you can adjust it and

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.069 
in order that you can adjust it and
plate<00:03:59.659> and<00:04:00.019> have<00:04:00.290> fun<00:04:00.560> understand<00:04:01.459> visit

plate and have fun understand visit

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.780 
plate and have fun understand visit
thinking<00:04:03.079> otherwise<00:04:03.280> there<00:04:04.280> is<00:04:04.400> no<00:04:04.549> way

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
thinking otherwise there is no way

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.839 
thinking otherwise there is no way
because<00:04:05.060> it<00:04:05.420> would<00:04:05.599> be<00:04:05.629> too<00:04:05.780> difficult<00:04:06.049> right

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
because it would be too difficult right

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.960 
because it would be too difficult right
