00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.670 
conflict of interest it brings to mind a
cartoon<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.759> saw<00:01:39.000> recently<00:01:39.530> surgeon<00:01:40.530> is

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
cartoon I saw recently surgeon is

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.140 
cartoon I saw recently surgeon is
sitting<00:01:40.979> there<00:01:41.100> talking<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.579> patient<00:01:42.000> who's

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
sitting there talking to a patient who's

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.120 
sitting there talking to a patient who's
on<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.420> exam<00:01:42.750> table<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.320> patient<00:01:43.740> neck<00:01:43.950> tie

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
on the exam table and patient neck tie

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.740 
on the exam table and patient neck tie
is<00:01:44.189> undone<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.030> surgeon<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.509> saying

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
is undone and the surgeon is saying

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.600 
is undone and the surgeon is saying
there's<00:01:46.320> really<00:01:46.560> nothing<00:01:47.040> wrong<00:01:47.070> with<00:01:47.460> you

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
there's really nothing wrong with you

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.760 
there's really nothing wrong with you
but<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.210> think<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.659> little<00:01:48.780> surgery<00:01:49.350> would<00:01:49.560> make

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
but I think a little surgery would make

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.429 
but I think a little surgery would make
both<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.070> us<00:01:50.399> feel<00:01:50.610> better<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
both of us feel better and that is the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.440 
both of us feel better and that is the
sort<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.829> conflict<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.549> interest<00:01:53.729> even<00:01:54.210> if

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
sort of conflict of interest even if
