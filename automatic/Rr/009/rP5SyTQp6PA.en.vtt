00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:08.029
 hello and welcome to the protected ebitda 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.590
 for a new test produced in this 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.559
 video I spoke to you about larouillies 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.480
 grinder nutrition gold then here one 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.939
 is on a concentrated protein we're going 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.199
 so say the basic whey protein what 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.789
 is interesting in this product this is 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.869
 we have two and 80% protein 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.009
 which is really a dosage 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.900
 important for rust and 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.640
 concentrate knowing that certainly and 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.829
 concentrate neutral so without any 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.810
 perfume are sometimes 2 and with this same 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.979
 dosage after me what I find 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.410
 interesting also about this product it's 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:34.280
 that he gives the dose of lactose 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.630
 unfortunately this dose is when 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.910
 even pretty important because it is 5 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.080
 46% for perhaps to avoid for those 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.330
 who are lactose intolerant 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.690
 finally in the flagship event in my opinion 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.580
 it's a wave without aspartame so I 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.020
 am here on a chocolate scent is going 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.490
 test what it gives in terms of 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.510
 mix and taste 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.420
 knowing that they scored a beautiful 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.550
 delicious on the box so we'll see 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.800
 if it's true I have about 300 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.370
 milliliters of water and about thirty 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.370
 grams of wade 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.270
 so those who do not know it better 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.590
 remains one of the oldest brands 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.759
 in the field of bodybuilding too 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.670
 well on the material than on the 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.170
 food supplements 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.079
 so we mix a little and pascal 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.799
 a few small dots on the on the 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:27.819
 shaker benches no funny moss 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.899
 because it's rather points that he 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:32.409
 must think of what can be found 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.829
 sometimes with birds there so we go 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.829
 see what it gives 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.430
 so the little bridges not leaving where that 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.799
 it's not lumps so we do not have 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.350
 we taste good chocolate light enough 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.810
 not very sweet but pleasant to drink 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.640
 so I remember for me the two big ones 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.710
 strengths of this product is a 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.929
 80% protein assay so a strong 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.280
 dosage to concentrate there and also the 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.579
 does that make it a 110 ear by 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.110
 karl 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.280
 now I give you appointment on 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.079
