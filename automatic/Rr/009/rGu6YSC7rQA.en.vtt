00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
board back in some of the things that

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.120 
board back in some of the things that
can<00:02:00.360> go<00:02:00.420> wrong<00:02:00.509> with<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.049> trick<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.619> can

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
can go wrong with this trick and can

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.490 
can go wrong with this trick and can
really<00:02:02.460> hurt<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.320> know<00:02:04.439> it

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
really hurt you is that you know it

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.889 
really hurt you is that you know it
could<00:02:04.649> be<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.670> could<00:02:05.700> think<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.329> your

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
could be you could think that your

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.300 
could be you could think that your
boards<00:02:07.140> coming<00:02:07.380> all<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.649> way<00:02:07.680> back<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.129> but

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
boards coming all the way back in but

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.100 
boards coming all the way back in but
it's<00:02:08.429> really<00:02:08.610> not<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.090> you're<00:02:09.959> actually

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
it's really not and you're actually

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.440 
it's really not and you're actually
coming<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.560> 90<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.790> commit<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.270> and

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
coming in 90 and you commit to that and

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.960 
coming in 90 and you commit to that and
then

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
then

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.310 
then
you<00:02:13.060> you're<00:02:13.570> just<00:02:13.600> going<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.900> fall<00:02:13.990> flat<00:02:14.260> on

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
you you're just going to fall flat on

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.290 
you you're just going to fall flat on
your<00:02:14.530> butt<00:02:14.800> that's<00:02:15.550> not<00:02:15.760> going<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:15.970> feel<00:02:16.060> too

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
your butt that's not going to feel too

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.160 
your butt that's not going to feel too
good<00:02:16.710> another<00:02:17.710> thing<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:17.950> can<00:02:18.160> go<00:02:18.280> wrong<00:02:18.310> is

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
good another thing that can go wrong is

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.720 
good another thing that can go wrong is
your<00:02:20.170> balance<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:20.860> get<00:02:21.010> thrown<00:02:21.340> off<00:02:21.430> weight

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
your balance and get thrown off weight

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.070 
your balance and get thrown off weight
coming<00:02:21.940> back<00:02:22.180> in<00:02:22.360> switch<00:02:22.660> because<00:02:22.840> maybe

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
coming back in switch because maybe

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.930 
coming back in switch because maybe
you're<00:02:23.200> not<00:02:23.260> used<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.650> doing<00:02:23.800> that<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.250> that

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
you're not used to doing that and that

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.690 
you're not used to doing that and that
you<00:02:25.120> can<00:02:25.150> maybe<00:02:26.110> be<00:02:26.290> leaning<00:02:26.530> too<00:02:26.680> far<00:02:26.710> far

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
you can maybe be leaning too far far

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.310 
you can maybe be leaning too far far
back<00:02:27.940> from<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.480> then<00:02:28.600> you<00:02:28.690> just<00:02:28.870> slide<00:02:29.110> you

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
back from it and then you just slide you

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.840 
back from it and then you just slide you
know<00:02:29.440> slip<00:02:29.740> out<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:29.950> hit<00:02:30.370> your<00:02:30.520> face<00:02:30.670> or

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
times that's how you do a switch front

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.970 
times that's how you do a switch front

you<00:03:00.640> do<00:03:01.380> throw<00:03:02.380> some<00:03:02.590> variations<00:03:03.130> we<00:03:03.280> have<00:03:03.430> fun

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
you do throw some variations we have fun

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.090 
you do throw some variations we have fun
with<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.850> trick
