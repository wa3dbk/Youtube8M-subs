00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.769 

so<00:00:05.400> this<00:00:05.520> is<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.759> tabletop<00:00:06.330> deathmatch

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
so this is the tabletop deathmatch

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.750 
so this is the tabletop deathmatch
ballot<00:00:07.290> that<00:00:07.470> we're<00:00:07.589> using<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:08.220> review<00:00:08.550> each

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
ballot that we're using to review each

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.580 
ballot that we're using to review each
game<00:00:09.059> we've<00:00:09.420> basically<00:00:09.630> divided<00:00:10.320> it<00:00:10.440> into

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
game we've basically divided it into

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.830 
game we've basically divided it into
four<00:00:10.860> categories<00:00:11.179> the<00:00:12.179> first<00:00:12.420> one<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.719> the

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
four categories the first one is the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.270 
four categories the first one is the
concept<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.559> game<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:14.009> what<00:00:14.160> we're

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
concept of the game so what we're

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.560 
concept of the game so what we're
looking<00:00:14.309> for<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:14.910> something<00:00:15.120> that's<00:00:15.299> an

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
looking for is something that's an

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.540 
looking for is something that's an
original<00:00:16.049> idea<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.560> has<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> good<00:00:16.980> clip<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.400> has

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
original idea it has a good clip it has

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.820 
original idea it has a good clip it has
something<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:18.600> get<00:00:18.779> people<00:00:19.050> excited<00:00:19.140> about<00:00:19.560> it

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
something to get people excited about it

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.859 
something to get people excited about it
before<00:00:20.160> they<00:00:20.279> even<00:00:20.400> know<00:00:20.609> how<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.820> play<00:00:21.029> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
before they even know how to play the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.300 
before they even know how to play the
next<00:00:22.020> one<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.410> mechanics<00:00:22.949> we<00:00:23.160> need

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
next one is the mechanics we need

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.609 
next one is the mechanics we need
something<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.480> easy<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.050> understand<00:00:25.529> and

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
something that is easy to understand and

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.439 
something that is easy to understand and
easy<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.070> learn<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.490> it's<00:00:26.670> also<00:00:26.820> mechanically

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
easy to learn and it's also mechanically

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.330 
easy to learn and it's also mechanically
sound<00:00:27.630> all<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.170> pieces<00:00:28.380> fit<00:00:28.680> together<00:00:28.800> and

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
sound all the pieces fit together and

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.339 
sound all the pieces fit together and
there's<00:00:29.789> no<00:00:29.939> obvious<00:00:30.150> problems<00:00:30.750> with<00:00:30.929> it

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
there's no obvious problems with it

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.319 
there's no obvious problems with it
next<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.160> appearance<00:00:32.669> we're<00:00:32.910> looking<00:00:33.120> for<00:00:33.300> a

next is appearance we're looking for a

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.850 
next is appearance we're looking for a
game<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.780> looks<00:00:33.930> beautiful<00:00:34.469> it's<00:00:34.680> well

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
game that looks beautiful it's well

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.590

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
of the Creator what we're looking here

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.680 
of the Creator what we're looking here
to<00:00:43.739> see<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.219> are<00:00:44.640> they<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> right<00:00:45.090> person<00:00:45.510> to

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
to see is are they the right person to

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.540 
to see is are they the right person to
execute<00:00:46.170> their<00:00:46.410> game<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.920> execute<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> idea

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
execute their game and execute the idea

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.479 
execute their game and execute the idea
they<00:00:47.940> presented<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:49.140> each<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.469> these<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:50.340> just

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
they presented so each of these we just

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.100 
they presented so each of these we just
have<00:00:50.700> kind<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.090> comments<00:00:51.570> from<00:00:51.690> all<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
have kind of comments from all the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.049 
have kind of comments from all the
judges<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.710> they're<00:00:52.860> also<00:00:53.010> graded<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> 1

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
judges and they're also graded on a 1

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.450 
judges and they're also graded on a 1
through<00:00:54.270> 5<00:00:54.480> scale<00:00:54.920> after<00:00:55.920> all<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.160> ballots

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
through 5 scale after all the ballots

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.069 
through 5 scale after all the ballots
are<00:00:56.610> turned<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.030> we're<00:00:57.180> gonna<00:00:57.270> average<00:00:57.570> all<00:00:58.020> of

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
are turned in we're gonna average all of

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.599 
are turned in we're gonna average all of
the<00:00:58.320> scores<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.800> all<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> games<00:00:59.370> and

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the scores for all of the games and

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.740 
the scores for all of the games and
that's<00:00:59.910> going<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.120> give<00:01:00.270> us<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.539> rough

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
that's going to give us a rough

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.540 
that's going to give us a rough
approximation<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.680> who's<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:02.010> top<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.250> who's

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
approximation of who's on top and who's

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.460 
approximation of who's on top and who's
on<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> bottom<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.539> we've<00:01:03.719> invited<00:01:03.960> about<00:01:04.439> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
on the bottom so we've invited about a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.230 
on the bottom so we've invited about a
dozen<00:01:04.710> judges<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.400> be<00:01:05.489> part<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.909> tabletop

this over every day of Gen Con people

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.080 
this over every day of Gen Con people
are<00:01:10.290> gonna<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.590> cycling<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.280> out<00:01:11.430> but<00:01:12.000> I'm
