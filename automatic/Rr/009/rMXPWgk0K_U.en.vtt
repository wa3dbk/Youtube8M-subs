it<00:02:14.000> was<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.150> lot<00:02:14.360> of<00:02:14.390> maker<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:14.840> think<00:02:15.160> with<00:02:16.160> Eve

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
it was a lot of maker I think with Eve

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.370 
it was a lot of maker I think with Eve
she<00:02:16.730> had<00:02:16.970> she<00:02:17.240> does<00:02:17.480> use<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.750> lot<00:02:17.990> more<00:02:18.140> makeup

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
she had she does use a lot more makeup

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.110 
she had she does use a lot more makeup
and<00:02:18.770> I<00:02:18.860> think<00:02:19.070> it's<00:02:19.160> maybe<00:02:19.460> to<00:02:19.790> make<00:02:19.910> that

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
and I think it's maybe to make that

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.880 
and I think it's maybe to make that
dramatic<00:02:20.600> appearance<00:02:20.720> if<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:21.350> have<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.470> great
