00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.500
 jPREX is a mobile program designed to make known and help the recitation of the Holy Rosary. 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.200
 Registration was carried out in the Basilica of Loreto. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.200
 Depending on the mobile phone, the appearance may change, in the video you can see a Nokia E71. 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.000
 At the start the date appears 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.000
 with the day of the week and its mystery. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 On the left menu we have the "Options" item. 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.000
 On the right menu we have the item "Pray". 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.000
 We activate "Pray". 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.000
 The recitation of the Holy Rosary begins. 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.000
 You can use the phone's joystick. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 The "Left" button lowers the volume. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 The "Right" button raises the volume. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 The "Up" and "Down" keys scroll through the tracks. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Let's move, for example, to the first mystery of the day. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 The program pauses until the beginning of the decade. 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.000
 To lock or unlock the pause, use the "Action" button on the joystick. 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.000
 On the left, there is the text of the mystery. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 On the right is the image relative to the text shown. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 At the center there is the flowing ten, following the prayer recitation. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Prayer goes on until the end of the Holy Rosary. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 With "Text" you can access the prayer texts. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 The "Action" button also works here. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Use the "Up" and "Down" keys to scroll through the prayer text. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 To move forward use "Next". 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 With "Back" you return to the images. 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.000
 Prayer ends with "End". 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 With the "Options" menu you access the other functions. 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 "Information" shows a presentation of prexcommunion, the jPREX website. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 The "Mysteries" item allows you to select a different mystery. 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.000
 In addition to the glorious, we can choose "Gaudiosi" 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.000
 "Painful" 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.000
 or "Bright". 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.000
 Listening to different mysteries on the same day. 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 Changing mystery, they change texts, images and reflections 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Now we go to the "Texts" item with various information. 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 In "Prayers", we find those recited in the Holy Rosary. 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 And other prayers, such as the "Litanies in Latin". 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 There is information on the meaning of prayer and ways of praying. 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 And historical information on the city of Loreto 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 or tourist. 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 jPREX can also connect to the network, to download intentions 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.000
 and allow the "reporting" of the prayer on the site prexcommunion.com. 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 The choice is completely optional, depending on the user's Internet traffic. 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.000
 In "Options" you can enter the user name and registration password 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:40.000
 for the site prexcommunion.com on which it is necessary to have previously registered. 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 By checking "Connection", you allow the phone to connect 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 to prexcommunion, based on phone settings and phone plan. 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.000
 By choosing "Intentions" and activating the network, the phone now connects to the network 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.300
 and download a list of intentions that are associated with prayer 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 the intentions are related to the user and his relationships on prexcommunion.com. 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 Prayer is signaled to the site that "counts" it by linking it to the collective intention. 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 During the prayer there are brief periodic connections. 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.000
 of little information, which indicates the time of prayer. 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 To avoid periodic connections you can check "Minimize Access" 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.000
 which limits these contacts to the beginning and end of the prayer itself. 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 "Loreto", allows you to hear the Holy Rosary of Loreto 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:54.000
 in complete form with Reflections and "Litanie Lauretane". 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 "Reduced", visualize the Holy Rosary in reduced mode 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:10.000
 for phones with small or vertical screens. 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 "Light" maintains active enlightenment during prayer. 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 On many phones this option does not work well 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:31.000
 and when it is active anyway, it reduces the battery life 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 for this reason it is normally disabled. Without the "Light" option the screen is disabled 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.000
 according to the settings of the phone, allowing however the listening in headphones or private. 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Finally the "Exit" item ends the program.
