going to introduce you to is a
protractor<00:00:14.849> important<00:00:15.780> thing<00:00:15.990> it's<00:00:16.440> not

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
protractor important thing it's not

actually<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> perfect<00:00:17.880> half<00:00:18.090> circle<00:00:18.510> let<00:00:18.779> me

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
actually a perfect half circle let me

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.870 
actually a perfect half circle let me
show<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.100> until<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.400> side<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.730> paper

show you until on this side of the paper

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.550 
show you until on this side of the paper
because<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.810> isn't<00:00:22.020> going<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.260> work<00:00:22.350> very

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
because this isn't going to work very

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.029 
because this isn't going to work very
well

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
well

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.429 
well
if<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.430> line<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.789> up<00:00:23.939> there<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.570> draw<00:00:25.109> around

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
if I line that up there and draw around

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.800 
if I line that up there and draw around
it<00:00:25.910> and<00:00:26.910> then<00:00:27.029> do<00:00:27.119> what<00:00:27.240> most<00:00:27.359> people<00:00:27.599> do<00:00:27.689> which

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
it and then do what most people do which

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.450 
it and then do what most people do which
is<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.019> flip<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.380> upside<00:00:28.439> down<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.010> kind<00:00:29.369> of

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
is to flip it upside down and kind of

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.380 
is to flip it upside down and kind of
join<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.090> bottom<00:00:32.180> okay<00:00:34.969> that<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.239> not

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
join it on the bottom okay that it's not

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.260 
join it on the bottom okay that it's not
a<00:00:36.420> perfect<00:00:36.870> circle<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.440> distance<00:00:37.860> here<00:00:38.270> from

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
a perfect circle this distance here from

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.020 
a perfect circle this distance here from
there<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.570> there<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:40.320> much<00:00:40.620> longer<00:00:41.100> mmm<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
there to there is much longer mmm the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.700 
there to there is much longer mmm the
distance<00:00:42.360> from<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.020> side<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.379> side<00:00:43.530> so

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
distance from that side to that side so

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.600 
distance from that side to that side so
that's<00:00:43.890> no<00:00:44.070> good

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
that's no good

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.630 
that's no good
okay<00:00:45.059> no<00:00:45.690> good<00:00:45.960> what<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.860> actually<00:00:46.980> need<00:00:47.280> is

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
okay no good what you actually need is

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.639 
okay no good what you actually need is
one<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.450> these<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.200> technically

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
one of these now this is technically

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.860 
one of these now this is technically
called<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.010> pair<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.550> compasses<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:51.329> compass

called a pair of compasses a compass
points<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.289> north<00:00:52.640> but<00:00:53.640> don't<00:00:53.820> worry<00:00:53.969> about

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
points to north but don't worry about

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.850 
points to north but don't worry about
that<00:00:54.300> too<00:00:54.449> much

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
that too much

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.020 
that too much
get<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> pencil<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.309> there<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.610> make<00:00:56.760> sure<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
get a pencil in there and make sure the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.799 
get a pencil in there and make sure the
pencil<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.809> point<00:00:58.109> are<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.070> same<00:00:59.340> length

pencil and the point are the same length

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.240 
pencil and the point are the same length
okay<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.050> know<00:01:01.320> my<00:01:01.500> pencils<00:01:01.829> not<00:01:01.949> very<00:01:02.070> sharp

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
okay I know my pencils not very sharp

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.850 
okay I know my pencils not very sharp
but<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.609> will<00:01:02.699> do<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> job<00:01:03.059> today<00:01:03.710> okay

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
but it will do the job today okay

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.149 
but it will do the job today okay
now<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.460> important<00:01:06.090> skill<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:06.710> is<00:01:07.710> first<00:01:07.920> of

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
now the important skill here is first of

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.060 
now the important skill here is first of
all<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.909> find<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> middle<00:01:09.380> notes<00:01:10.380> mark<00:01:11.010> a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
all to find the middle notes mark a

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.140 
all to find the middle notes mark a
little<00:01:11.159> cross<00:01:12.170> middle<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.229> my<00:01:13.320> circle

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
little cross middle of my circle

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.780 
little cross middle of my circle
okay<00:01:15.150> point<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:17.070> end<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.460> compass<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
okay point the end of the compass the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.060 
okay point the end of the compass the
sharp<00:01:18.119> end<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.420> compass<00:01:18.780> into<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.860> paper

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
sharp end of the compass into the paper

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.440 
sharp end of the compass into the paper
not<00:01:20.369> into<00:01:20.549> your<00:01:20.610> hand<00:01:20.880> because<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.270> would

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
not into your hand because that would

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.980 
not into your hand because that would
hurt<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:22.830> paper<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.700> there<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:23.939> go<00:01:23.970> now<00:01:24.299> I'm

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
hurt the paper so there we go now I'm

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.679 
hurt the paper so there we go now I'm
gonna<00:01:25.080> measure<00:01:25.320> one<00:01:26.009> two<00:01:26.340> three<00:01:26.850> four<00:01:27.299> five

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
gonna measure one two three four five

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.499 
gonna measure one two three four five
six<00:01:28.049> seven<00:01:28.320> eight<00:01:28.619> squares<00:01:29.070> but<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.180> could<00:01:30.360> do

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
six seven eight squares but you could do

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.170 
six seven eight squares but you could do
a<00:01:30.540> slightly<00:01:30.780> bigger<00:01:31.140> or<00:01:31.259> smaller<00:01:31.380> circle<00:01:32.180> okay

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
a slightly bigger or smaller circle okay

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.020 
a slightly bigger or smaller circle okay
and<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.659> know<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:34.020> will<00:01:34.140> fit<00:01:34.350> right<00:01:35.030> here's

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
and I know that will fit right here's

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.219 
and I know that will fit right here's
the<00:01:36.060> skill<00:01:36.450> okay

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
the skill okay

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.690 
the skill okay
now<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.409> can't<00:01:37.650> really<00:01:37.860> see<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.610> just

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
now you can't really see this I just

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.980 
now you can't really see this I just
have<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.030> tell<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.329> how<00:01:39.479> I'm<00:01:39.570> doing<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.869> I'm

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
have to tell you how I'm doing it I'm

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.469 
have to tell you how I'm doing it I'm
putting<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.380> lot<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.619> pressure<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:42.210> arm

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
putting a lot of pressure on the arm

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.050 
putting a lot of pressure on the arm
that's<00:01:42.810> sticking<00:01:43.320> into<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.799> paper<00:01:44.040> if<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.850> put

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
that's sticking into the paper if I put

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.510 
that's sticking into the paper if I put
all<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.270> pressure<00:01:45.450> on<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.350> pencil<00:01:46.530> end<00:01:46.890> then

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
all the pressure on the pencil end then

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.399 
all the pressure on the pencil end then
that's<00:01:47.759> gonna<00:01:47.909> fall<00:01:48.149> out<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.990> don't<00:01:49.049> want

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409

wrong with that tool as long as you keep
the<00:02:01.680> pressure<00:02:01.860> on<00:02:02.299> the<00:02:03.299> point<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.649> middle

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799

now<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.460> can't<00:02:05.670> really<00:02:05.729> see<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.390> am

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
now you can't really see it but I am

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.630 
now you can't really see it but I am
pushing<00:02:06.899> down<00:02:07.079> straight<00:02:08.069> through<00:02:08.280> there<00:02:08.429> and

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
pushing down straight through there and

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.400 
pushing down straight through there and
leaning<00:02:09.179> only<00:02:09.479> very<00:02:09.660> slightly<00:02:09.959> with<00:02:10.289> my

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
leaning only very slightly with my

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.619 
leaning only very slightly with my
compass<00:02:10.770> what<00:02:11.340> can<00:02:11.520> work<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:12.239> leaning<00:02:12.569> over

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
compass what can work is leaning over

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.460 
compass what can work is leaning over
slightly

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
slightly

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.600 
slightly
nothing<00:02:14.470> wrong<00:02:14.620> with<00:02:14.800> tilting<00:02:15.160> your<00:02:15.280> compass

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
nothing wrong with tilting your compass

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.980 
nothing wrong with tilting your compass
to<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.790> side<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:17.380> there<00:02:17.560> I<00:02:17.590> have<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.990> perfect

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
to the side and there I have a perfect

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.460 
to the side and there I have a perfect
circle<00:02:20.460> okay
