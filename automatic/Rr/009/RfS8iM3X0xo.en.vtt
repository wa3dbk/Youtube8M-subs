headed off with and had a lot of

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.709 
headed off with and had a lot of
chemistry<00:06:12.069> I<00:06:12.460> don't<00:06:12.940> think<00:06:13.120> it<00:06:13.210> would<00:06:13.330> stop<00:06:13.569> me

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:13.719 
chemistry I don't think it would stop me

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:15.180 
chemistry I don't think it would stop me
from<00:06:13.870> having<00:06:14.080> a<00:06:14.259> relationship<00:06:14.469> but<00:06:14.949> I'm<00:06:15.069> not

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
going to jump into to anything too

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.519 
going to jump into to anything too
quickly<00:06:17.740> or<00:06:17.979> too<00:06:18.190> quick<00:06:18.849> because<00:06:19.360> I<00:06:19.750> just<00:06:20.409> have

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:20.529 
quickly or too quick because I just have

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:22.529 
quickly or too quick because I just have
a<00:06:20.560> lot<00:06:20.770> of<00:06:20.889> anxiety<00:06:21.370> about<00:06:21.759> the<00:06:22.000> whole<00:06:22.150> thing
