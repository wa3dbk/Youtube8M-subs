using any of the mic if it's not working

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.350 
using any of the mic if it's not working
chances<00:03:31.799> are<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.070> mics<00:03:32.250> bad<00:03:32.610> if<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:33.180> know

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
chances are the mics bad if you know

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.270 
chances are the mics bad if you know
that<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.660> mic<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:34.019> working<00:03:34.049> in<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.890> different

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
that the mic is working in a different

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.660 
that the mic is working in a different
application<00:03:36.980> then<00:03:37.980> obviously<00:03:38.130> you<00:03:38.430> know<00:03:38.489> the

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
application then obviously you know the

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.610 
application then obviously you know the
mics<00:03:38.850> not<00:03:39.060> bad<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:39.630> it's<00:03:39.840> an<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.200> different

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
mics not bad and it it's an a different

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.340 
mics not bad and it it's an a different
issue<00:03:40.910> so<00:03:41.910> if<00:03:42.239> it<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.570> working<00:03:42.780> in<00:03:43.019> a<00:03:43.080> different

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
issue so if it is working in a different

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.009 
issue so if it is working in a different
application<00:03:44.060> then<00:03:45.060> that's<00:03:45.299> where<00:03:45.570> what<00:03:45.900> we

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
application then that's where what we

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.780 
application then that's where what we
want<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.320> do<00:03:46.470> is<00:03:49.130> look<00:03:50.130> at<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.459> different

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
mic input you're not using push-to-talk

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.970

or<00:04:23.970> you<00:04:24.150> are<00:04:24.450> using<00:04:24.810> push-to-talk<00:04:27.710> if<00:04:28.710> you

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
or you are using push-to-talk if you

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.380 
or you are using push-to-talk if you
need<00:04:29.160> a<00:04:29.190> little<00:04:29.400> more<00:04:29.490> explanation<00:04:29.700> on<00:04:30.180> that<00:04:30.240> I

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
need a little more explanation on that I

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.500 
need a little more explanation on that I
can<00:04:30.630> even<00:04:30.990> make<00:04:31.140> another<00:04:31.440> video<00:04:31.820> but<00:04:32.820> this

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
can even make another video but this

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.860 
can even make another video but this
stuff<00:04:33.810> should<00:04:34.020> be<00:04:34.050> pretty<00:04:34.410> pretty<00:04:35.100> simple<00:04:35.870> the

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
stuff should be pretty pretty simple the

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.050 
stuff should be pretty pretty simple the
next<00:04:37.200> thing<00:04:37.380> that<00:04:37.410> I<00:04:37.560> would<00:04:37.680> probably<00:04:38.520> do<00:04:38.730> if

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
next thing that I would probably do if

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.040 
next thing that I would probably do if
none<00:04:39.450> of<00:04:39.600> that<00:04:39.630> was<00:04:39.900> working<00:04:40.410> is<00:04:41.270> I<00:04:42.270> would<00:04:42.900> come

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
none of that was working is I would come

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.670 
none of that was working is I would come
down<00:04:43.110> here<00:04:43.710> and<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:45.030> would<00:04:45.180> open<00:04:45.360> well<00:04:46.290> you<00:04:46.530> can

want to do is you can go to update

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.570 
want to do is you can go to update
driver<00:05:12.300> software<00:05:12.390> here<00:05:13.169> most<00:05:14.040> likely<00:05:14.490> it

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
driver software here most likely it

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.320 
driver software here most likely it
won't<00:05:14.760> be<00:05:14.910> found<00:05:15.919> so<00:05:16.970> just<00:05:17.970> come<00:05:18.150> here<00:05:18.270> to

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
won't be found so just come here to

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.210 
won't be found so just come here to
properties<00:05:18.900> make<00:05:19.200> sure<00:05:19.380> you<00:05:19.500> get<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:19.830> exact

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
driver version and then do the same so

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.800 
driver version and then do the same so
that's<00:05:50.250> for<00:05:50.520> your<00:05:50.610> card<00:05:51.000> and<00:05:51.270> then<00:05:51.419> for<00:05:51.690> your

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
that's for your card and then for your

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.900 
that's for your card and then for your
mic<00:05:52.050> do<00:05:52.320> the<00:05:52.470> same<00:05:52.680> thing<00:05:53.039> so<00:05:53.490> you<00:05:53.520> want<00:05:53.850> to

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
mic do the same thing so you want to

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.860 
mic do the same thing so you want to
make<00:05:54.030> sure<00:05:54.060> you<00:05:54.270> have<00:05:54.419> the<00:05:54.539> most<00:05:54.720> recent

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
make sure you have the most recent

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.450 
make sure you have the most recent
driver<00:05:56.180> version<00:05:57.320> so<00:05:58.320> I<00:05:58.350> would<00:05:58.680> go<00:05:58.830> to<00:05:58.890> Google

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
driver version so I would go to Google

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.460 
driver version so I would go to Google
and<00:05:59.729> say<00:06:00.240> logitech<00:06:00.960> g930<00:06:01.770> headset<00:06:02.400> drivers

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
and say logitech g930 headset drivers

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.980 
and say logitech g930 headset drivers
and<00:06:04.470> then<00:06:04.770> make<00:06:05.010> sure<00:06:05.220> that<00:06:05.400> this<00:06:05.850> is<00:06:06.120> the<00:06:06.660> most

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
and then make sure that this is the most

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.140 
and then make sure that this is the most
recent<00:06:07.440> if<00:06:07.770> this<00:06:07.979> is<00:06:08.190> not<00:06:08.370> the<00:06:08.520> most<00:06:08.640> recent<00:06:09.060> if

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
recent if this is not the most recent if

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.180 
recent if this is not the most recent if
there's<00:06:09.300> a<00:06:09.360> higher<00:06:09.690> one<00:06:09.840> obviously<00:06:10.440> my<00:06:10.950> driver

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
there's a higher one obviously my driver

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.959 
there's a higher one obviously my driver
is<00:06:11.310> out<00:06:11.400> of<00:06:11.460> date<00:06:11.700> and<00:06:11.880> update

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:12.969 
is out of date and update

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:15.869 
is out of date and update
that<00:06:13.409> anyways<00:06:14.409> there's<00:06:15.249> a<00:06:15.339> few<00:06:15.579> things<00:06:15.759> for

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:15.879 
that anyways there's a few things for

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:18.329 
that anyways there's a few things for
you<00:06:15.969> guys<00:06:16.029> to<00:06:16.149> try<00:06:16.569> I<00:06:16.839> really<00:06:17.709> hope<00:06:18.159> that<00:06:18.189> that
