00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.389 
everyone has their own way of doing it
but<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.380> find<00:01:43.770> works<00:01:44.220> really

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
but this is what I find works really

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.490 
but this is what I find works really
well<00:01:44.759> for<00:01:44.820> me<00:01:45.149> my<00:01:45.180> concealer<00:01:45.750> doesn't<00:01:45.960> crease

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500

all day long and it just stays put

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.609 
all day long and it just stays put
