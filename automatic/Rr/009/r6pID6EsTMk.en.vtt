00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.640 
but no actually no my bet the case was
pumped<00:02:43.000> that<00:02:43.750> has<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.019> longest<00:02:44.170> range<00:02:44.500> so

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
pumped that has the longest range so

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.140 
pumped that has the longest range so
that<00:02:44.799> it<00:02:44.950> makes<00:02:45.159> Center<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.549> this<00:02:45.760> has<00:02:46.000> at

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
that it makes Center that this has at

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.479 
that it makes Center that this has at

attachment that I recommend I especially
recommend<00:06:12.490> laser<00:06:13.360> sight<00:06:13.659> because<00:06:14.440> it<00:06:14.530> brings

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
recommend laser sight because it brings

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.800 
recommend laser sight because it brings
in<00:06:14.919> the<00:06:15.009> spread<00:06:15.280> a<00:06:15.460> lot<00:06:15.699> closer<00:06:16.000> and<00:06:16.389> steady

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810
