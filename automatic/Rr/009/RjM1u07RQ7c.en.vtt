00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.260
 at the same time I am the plant of this tishkevich today 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.300
 come talk about the judging scores and 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.580
 let's look at new criteria and one of them 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.330
 will be the ferry is the most interesting Kostanay 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.670
 session to session actress dispute garden 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.209
 polar nobody really can 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.810
 say what is and because people have become 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.039
 jump challenging tricks 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.460
 about them probation demolish let's go a couple took 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.980
 criteria which adds and alas 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:24.670
 entertainment 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.790
 for throwing water it is open and very often 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.680
 changed that is, first they said that 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.490
 it's there high departure then someone said something 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.249
 what is there 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.140
 further Cyprus a la then steel 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.210
 old man and below and alas that the lower cattelan 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.800
 a guy and three is considered everything 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.960
 constantly arguing and and first of all you need 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.780
 general then from the leadership of all for 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.580
 I understand from myself what is 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.360
 and judges riders well what is polar yet 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.760
 early 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.729
 this is the first 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:49.639
 high speed on the tank introduced 

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:50.820
 landings 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.080
 second to rotan degree japanese 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.350
 below 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.830
 third stage 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.740
 horizontal flight at the expense of Too 7 O.Yava 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.080
 speed account 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.360
 and if all these criteria are met then 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.020
 its greater amplitude criteria which led 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.210
 just last year 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.180
 bye risk 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.870
 This is such a criterion which for example 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.430
 should give a simple trick to me 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.360
 what rump if you didn't leave 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.270
 this should be done this tribe at the limit 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.190
 for example as a rule so that you should 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.870
 about such content mastered 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.690
 worldly there 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.280
 that is, every citizen to which 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.829
 will want 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:23.090
 he must have stood in haiti with a fall then 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.310
 there is not that you are there 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.520
 accelerating this place and brought there later 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.109
 then like from there or landing 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:30.340
 that is, they should still take it clean 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.140
 but on the maximum stash that is 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.729
 make it taking 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.020
 like a cook just made so that 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.960
 highlight certain 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.079
 athletes who ride Irina Granik 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.600
 getting right for example 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.510
 on now on pig and steel arrival 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.259
 gas masks risk factor meaning you 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.000
 ride to the point of injury 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.730
 it's good 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.180
 since not interested in 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.690
 the arrival of the sowing mainly for 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.040
 to see how 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.500
 beautiful incident company 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.350
 and therefore to draw as much as possible 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.070
 more people attracting such from 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.760
 athletes who love it fit 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.850
 accelerating wear dear because flies 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.340
 somewhere 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.280
 style is very doubtful such 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.810
 factor 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.670
 touched to believe certain 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.000
 athletes who ride there 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.959
 individually difficult technical element 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.390
 it's almost impossible to do 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.979
 style 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.150
 and therefore certification for which to do there 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.830
 for example, such panels were not very nice 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.599
 just such acts are made up to special 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.150
 a factor that helps them there 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.920
 for example at competitions you too 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.569
 her it is unrealistic simpler greeks 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.469
 for example who believe Russia 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:26.389
 due to this on get points by 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:28.569
 fact grow now given definition of 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.499
 of this style that with the body is nobody 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:31.810
 recognition will fix 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.239
 there are some basic can be 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.949
 judgments 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:36.769
 the book was cathainen must 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.179
 select less clean and so with 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:41.529
 important casone on 107 business environment there 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:43.359
 what is the trouble of one 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:44.590
 judicial authority 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.239
 then the real politburo peru 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.020
 groupings 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.350
 another private Thai Cossack plants 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.410
 body fuel to do too Moldovan 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.910
 say the numbers 100th mole group is better 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.390
 but here it is provided by the body 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.950
 also so very hard for us 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.780
 getting close to like more like 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.629
 it is convenient to do the style of your child 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.290
 against the will of technical 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.129
 difficulties 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.019
 that is, this or one or the other demand for 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.319
 this time promising the race both 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.159
 He of course aerime and advantages another 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.169
 the thing is that he started to evaluate it in short and 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:14.199
 must be president honor anniversary 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:15.510
 Canada land 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.269
 on the palm of your hand 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.709
 no ass foot 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.389
 that is, clearly defining 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.400
 their departure so bah czech this too 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:25.349
 landings 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.040
 but the landings are not entirely clean ie 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.640
 you use some third point there 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.079
 eg 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.089
 Bachate is pleased to become complex Vitalievich 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:34.739
 it came to what they were trying to blame 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.609
 second to three seconds leading away 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.309
 it is believed that something has landed more 

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:40.040
 three seconds for example you usually do not sink 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.559
 attacks now as they think any jump 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:44.529
 and landing on your back 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:46.269
 Irina belly believe it if you 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.659
 you land 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.730
 board siren stays on water 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.489
 preparing ass for what it is 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.919
 boychak important to me there 10 meters and drove 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.120
 two meters when the board stays on 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.230
 the surface of the fruit and 3 on her eternal 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:02.109
 filmed while still using your back 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.129
 tunnel ass who reads this 2 h 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.419
 loss of control 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.559
 loss of control is when 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:12.099
 any interception 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.279
 Kaya case transferred in April to the blue 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:15.019
 landings 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:16.310
 even if you are carping on 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.400
 high speeds 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.530
 clear terminator or all involved 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.279
 equal is considered loss of control 

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.979
 i.e. purely intercepting 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.330
 this is when you do the interception 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.159
 and these sensors are expected 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:28.020
 kite had no treatment 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.949
 but to what really 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.199
 Today I think what they do for example with 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:32.590
 by him 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.340
 steamer especially hands front a gallup 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.270
 And I think that back 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.520
 did it specifically the judges 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.520
 consider it a loss of control then 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.380
 I will do some sort of interception 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.290
 I must go I expected that 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.660
 today's competition judges 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.320
 Poland is judged and quality than 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.539
 chariots best land 5 interceptions 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.089
 all very good suit than for example 

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:53.169
 15th low quality quantity 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.449
 right now is not the most important innovation is true 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:56.490
 has not been defined on 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.199
 competitions 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.490
 if the rider for the first time there lands on 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.580
 oi their mundane element of the race gives 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.529
 big fall advantage of course not 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:05.529
 counted depends that is it fell 10 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:06.020
 time 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.080
 and how to be and did not call it will not be put 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.680
 but 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.840
 they greatly affect the overall 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.620
 impression 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.520
 that is, for example environments and falling 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.000
 beginning of arrival and end of arrival and it does not matter 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.900
 what that is everywhere locomotive middle 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.460
 season 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.919
 common food and water are lower because mined 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.979
 I started the race fall I will finish with the fall then 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:23.330
 there is 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.490
 these three boats are more memorable 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.430
 I think Arabia should be loyal 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.400
 relate 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.919
 to the center of the judge i.e. the judge is already that person 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:31.940
 may actually 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.650
 miss that fierce because if 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.120
 troops issued before the year Anapa you understand 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.229
 different parts 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:38.400
 zone for example 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.949
 you must count on 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:40.570
 what 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.410
 only it will help you not to notice that is, if 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.260
 income to complain riga credited 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.960
 check right before the judge 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.719
 it is necessary when from Estonia 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:50.879
 first of all but because there for 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.139
 if you want your third to notice 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:54.419
 and well condemned 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:55.749
 three dose skate 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:57.860
 so that the judge saw them 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.069
 discipline is also very important 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:00.330
 competition 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.369
 each of 

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:02.770
 i.e. athlete analysis 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.590
 must behave properly 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.309
 there are different 

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:07.429
 What kind of decency framework has happened? 

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:09.249
 domains so any athlete 

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:11.389
 if competitions first impose 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:12.689
 continued and 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:13.360
 sponsors 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.280
 and and sponsors of the competition 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.300
 put the summer to treat as 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.129
 it certainly is strong they don't care 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:19.840
