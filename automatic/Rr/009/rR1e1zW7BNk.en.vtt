00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
the pago pago Harbor we removed all the

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.929 
the pago pago Harbor we removed all the
oil<00:00:26.050> and<00:00:26.200> hazmat<00:00:26.350> as<00:00:26.740> per<00:00:27.070> the<00:00:27.189> picture<00:00:27.460> from

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.810 

if<00:00:35.320> we<00:00:35.440> don't<00:00:35.620> know<00:00:35.740> exactly<00:00:35.770> how<00:00:36.490> many<00:00:36.550> we

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
if we don't know exactly how many we

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.270 
if we don't know exactly how many we
have<00:00:36.850> but<00:00:37.330> we<00:00:37.360> suspect<00:00:38.320> that<00:00:38.620> there's<00:00:38.920> a<00:00:39.040> few

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
have but we suspect that there's a few

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.500 
have but we suspect that there's a few
in<00:00:39.430> there<00:00:39.520> so<00:00:39.700> it's<00:00:39.820> going<00:00:39.940> to<00:00:40.000> take<00:00:40.090> a<00:00:40.270> few

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
in there so it's going to take a few

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.229 
in there so it's going to take a few
days<00:00:40.570> of<00:00:40.990> diving<00:00:41.290> evolutions<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.850> number<00:00:43.090> one

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
days of diving evolutions the number one

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.000 
days of diving evolutions the number one
identify<00:00:43.810> and<00:00:44.020> send<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.350> divers<00:00:44.680> there<00:00:44.860> and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
identify and send the divers there and

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.140 
identify and send the divers there and
identify<00:00:45.520> the<00:00:45.580> vehicle

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
identify the vehicle

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.640 
identify the vehicle
as<00:00:47.240> my<00:00:47.540> that's<00:00:47.750> below<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:48.050> surface<00:00:48.320> of<00:00:48.560> the

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
as my that's below the surface of the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.950 
as my that's below the surface of the
water<00:00:48.890> and<00:00:49.490> then<00:00:49.820> develop<00:00:50.090> a<00:00:50.300> plan<00:00:50.540> to<00:00:50.720> try<00:00:50.900> to

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
water and then develop a plan to try to

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.350 
water and then develop a plan to try to
recover<00:00:51.560> it<00:00:51.860> we<00:00:52.130> better<00:00:52.310> stop<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:53.060> oil<00:00:53.090> from

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
recover it we better stop the oil from

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.080 
recover it we better stop the oil from
buckling<00:00:53.750> up<00:00:53.990> and<00:00:54.410> remove<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:55.580> vehicles<00:00:56.000> from

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
buckling up and remove the vehicles from

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.120 
buckling up and remove the vehicles from
under<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:56.480> water<00:00:56.920> from<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.010> coastline

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
under the water from the coastline

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.090 
under the water from the coastline
the<00:01:00.340> floor<00:01:00.610> bottom<00:01:00.970> sinks<00:01:01.300> even<00:01:01.540> further<00:01:01.750> down

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the floor bottom sinks even further down

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.520 
the floor bottom sinks even further down
so<00:01:03.100> it<00:01:03.220> makes<00:01:03.430> it<00:01:03.610> tricky<00:01:04.270> to<00:01:04.600> try<00:01:05.199> to<00:01:05.260> dive

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
so it makes it tricky to try to dive

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.590 
so it makes it tricky to try to dive
around<00:01:05.800> these<00:01:06.130> fishing<00:01:06.520> vessels<00:01:06.940> these<00:01:07.390> fish

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
around these fishing vessels these fish

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.020 
around these fishing vessels these fish
and<00:01:07.810> vessels<00:01:08.110> aren't<00:01:08.260> going<00:01:08.470> away<00:01:08.970> they<00:01:09.970> were

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
and vessels aren't going away they were

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.160 
and vessels aren't going away they were
doing<00:01:10.390> a<00:01:11.130> grid<00:01:12.130> search<00:01:12.400> for<00:01:12.850> debris<00:01:13.570> hazardous

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
doing a grid search for debris hazardous

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.350 
doing a grid search for debris hazardous
material<00:01:14.680> that<00:01:14.830> was

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.880 

we're<00:01:17.660> fortunate<00:01:17.900> enough<00:01:18.110> to<00:01:18.260> have<00:01:18.410> some<00:01:18.680> beer

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
we're fortunate enough to have some beer

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.390 
we're fortunate enough to have some beer
to<00:01:19.070> get<00:01:19.220> visibility<00:01:19.670> 15<00:01:20.360> 20

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
to get visibility 15 20

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.390 
to get visibility 15 20
that's<00:01:21.910> a<00:01:22.000> big<00:01:22.210> plus<00:01:23.040> basically<00:01:24.040> what<00:01:24.130> we<00:01:24.220> do

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
that's a big plus basically what we do

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.030 
that's a big plus basically what we do
is<00:01:24.430> we<00:01:24.640> swim<00:01:24.910> a<00:01:24.940> grid<00:01:25.300> the<00:01:26.230> first<00:01:26.500> diver<00:01:26.740> this

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
is we swim a grid the first diver this

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.130 
is we swim a grid the first diver this
morning<00:01:27.460> recovered<00:01:28.420> some<00:01:28.570> items<00:01:28.900> that<00:01:29.050> we

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
morning recovered some items that we
