00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.099
 practically no different from 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.219
 showcases in the usual butcher shop sausage 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.590
 minced meatballs the only difference and neither 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.390
 one product does not contain meat it 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.830
 institution in Zurich is called

 vegetarian butcher shop i'm always here 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.820
 I ask why the sausage should 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.010
 contain meat sausage should be 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.840
 delicious barbecue to bring 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.880
 pleasure she can be the same 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.149
 good and vegetarian meat soy 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.129

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.350
 Breast made from popular in Europe 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.600
 products vorne it is made from 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.469
 its protein is low in fat

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.720
 to meat 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.240
 I was pleasantly surprised by critics 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.490
 vegetarians are surprised to say they first 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.880
 refuse meat and then starts 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.290
 imitate him but it's all a matter of habit 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.299
 or oh people get used to certain 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.979
 things in india for example locals 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.500

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.180
 becoming adults we still her 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.890
 love to give up meat is fashionable now 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.689
 among vegetarians such famous 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.829
 Hollywood actresses like natalie portman 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.990

 brad pitt often for many 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.960
 celebrities giving up meat become 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.270
 part of their image or fare on 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.909
 vegetarianism is now enjoyed wide 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.560
 recognition though true vegetarians 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.320
 still a little but the fact remains 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.229
 people constantly say myself i eat very 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.689
 little meat i'm partially vegetarian it's 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.500
 means that in a society vegetarianism is everything 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.450
 same taken fan 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.710
 the number of vegetarians in germany for 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.020
 last 8 years 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.070
 doubled them now in the country about 7 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.350
 million people 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.509
 Switzerland for example 40 percent 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.820
 population admitted that they consciously 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.290
 reduced meat consumption and what 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.470
 more interesting than a person 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.600
 earnings the less he eat meat yet 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.070
 pork and poultry beef consumption 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.770
 recent years remained relatively 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.230
 at a high level, many consider 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.340
 it is better to eat less meat but higher 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.709
 qualities but similar can offer 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.810
 very few shops in supermarkets 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.780
 still dominated by the Nuremberg 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.940
 99 cents sausages for 10 pieces and 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.060
 meat industry never nothing 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.970
 could do with falling alpha alpha prices 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.950
 besides the vegetarian butcher shop the role 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.930
 hilda does his family own yet 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.390
 restaurants which is located in 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.489
 the fashionable district of Zurich I founded that 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.480
 institution grandfather rolfe ambrosius held a 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.430
 flying in 1898 she even got into the book 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.610
 Guinness World Records as the oldest 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.350
 the world's best vegetarian restaurant for me 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.780
 of course it's amazing how time flows 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.239
 earlier the restaurant was called potato 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.820
 cellars and he had a bad reputation 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.500
 the guests said they chewed on the grass they came in 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.880
 through the back door so others don't 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.269
 saw where they eat 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.489
 and today is the trend now in this 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.500
 never in a vegetarian shelter so his 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.110
 called earlier from morning till evening always 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.250
 a lot of people come here and the whole family 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.870
 also tourists and of course businessman and 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.030
 because it is useful because after 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.400
 such a dinner I can work normally 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.470
 if I eat meat for lunch then quickly 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.530
 at the station 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.660
 I'm not a vegetarian and not one of those 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.730
 trying to rarely eat meat just me 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.950
 always feel good if dinner 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.320
 here either mih with and here i get 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.740
 special pleasure from the taste of food as not 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.780
 messenger after hearty Christmas and 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.830
 Christmas holidays many usually 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.530
 go on a diet 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.330
 eat more vegetables and less meat and if 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.250
 suddenly wanted something fatter 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.270
 can always be replaced in pork schnitzel 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.270
 on soy
