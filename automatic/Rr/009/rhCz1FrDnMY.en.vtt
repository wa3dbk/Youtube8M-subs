00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
in that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.300 
in that
it<00:01:05.150> was<00:01:05.239> top-level<00:01:05.810> Pacquiao's<00:01:06.590> a<00:01:06.619> brilliant

it was top-level Pacquiao's a brilliant
father<00:01:07.810> and<00:01:08.810> I<00:01:08.870> think<00:01:09.140> he<00:01:09.320> you<00:01:09.980> know<00:01:10.070> he<00:01:10.280> should

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
father and I think he you know he should

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.040 
father and I think he you know he should
retire<00:01:10.670> on<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:10.880> back<00:01:11.000> of<00:01:11.120> that<00:01:11.150> Ricky<00:01:11.720> Hatton

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
retire on the back of that Ricky Hatton

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.940 
retire on the back of that Ricky Hatton
should<00:01:12.740> he<00:01:12.830> quit<00:01:13.070> no<00:01:13.880> I<00:01:14.180> think<00:01:14.960> he's<00:01:15.320> I<00:01:15.590> don't

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
should he quit no I think he's I don't

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.460 
should he quit no I think he's I don't
think<00:01:16.190> a<00:01:16.370> guy<00:01:16.640> like<00:01:17.030> Matt<00:01:17.750> who's<00:01:17.990> had<00:01:18.200> such<00:01:18.440> a

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
think a guy like Matt who's had such a

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.710 
think a guy like Matt who's had such a
successful<00:01:18.740> career<00:01:19.310> should<00:01:20.000> finish<00:01:20.420> on<00:01:20.660> a

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
successful career should finish on a

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.690 
successful career should finish on a
second-round<00:01:21.590> knockout<00:01:21.710> I<00:01:22.040> think<00:01:22.340> you<00:01:22.430> should

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
second-round knockout I think you should

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.910
