00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.110 
and wrestling had to change with it to
that<00:03:23.650> extent<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.040> I<00:03:24.130> think<00:03:24.400> probably<00:03:24.820> the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
that extent and I think probably the

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.640 
that extent and I think probably the
middle<00:03:25.630> ground<00:03:25.870> is<00:03:25.959> probably<00:03:26.260> where<00:03:26.470> that

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
middle ground is probably where that

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.340 
middle ground is probably where that
lies<00:03:26.890> but<00:03:27.250> it's<00:03:27.580> excellent<00:03:28.090> stuff<00:03:28.390> stuff<00:03:29.230> to
