Destin here with your fix for Friday September
9th. Naomi's out for the day being awesome

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.150
so I’m hosting... deal with it.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.150
After 4 years of hearing PC owners brag about
how their rigs can run the original Crysis,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.460
console owners are going to be let in on the
action. Next month aka October 2011, Crysis

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.690
will be made available as a downloadable title
for the 360 and PS3 for only 20 bucks. So

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.291
we can all enjoy throwing someone through
a wall. Now console gamers, when PC gamers

00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:43.540
are bragging about Crysis, you can pop the
game in your favorite platform… and in a

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.140
few months they’ll show you their PC version
of Battlefield 3 that’ll melt your brain.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.559
Speaking of Battlefield 3 and brain melting
a new trailer was released today and it is

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.760
freaking intense. A mortar goes off, things
are blowing up, a man gets stabbed and I’m

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.950
just going to stop talking about it. Go watch
it right now on IGN.com

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.180
Minecraft fans I hope you’re not too attached
to your game saves. In order to see the 1.8

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.030
update to the game you’ll have to create
an entirely new world. But you’ll also get

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.490
a ton of new stuff like a new enemy type,
a revamped combat system, and a new creative

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.860
mode. For full details check the article on
the site, but in the meantime get ready to

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.530
say goodbye to the giant breast mansion you
spent a week constructing.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.700
Oh and don't worry, just because I’m new
here doesn't mean I'm going to forget about

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.590
the giveaway. This week we have three X-Men
prize packs provided by Twentieth Century

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.229
Fox.. Each pack contains all four X-Men movies
on blu-ray including the new X-Men: First

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.500
Class, and one of three movie props from First
Class that I’ve been trying to steal since

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.420
they arrived in the office. To win, simply

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.340

say Wolverine. Oh, and for those entering,
CHECK YOUR EMAIL NEXT WEEK! We haven’t been

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.140
announcing winners because people haven’t
