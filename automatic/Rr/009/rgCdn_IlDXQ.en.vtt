00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.359
 a year ago cesare prandelli and his 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.789
 new mate explained to us 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.980
 why they stopped smoking what or 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:12.570
 better to try to on the telecom art 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.549
 now we have come to check if they have 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.670
 kept the commitment in this year how many 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.089
 cigarettes you smoked 10 never had 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.759
 never even want and caesar sama angel 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:27.449
 asked wish there is 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:29.849
 occasionally it really comes however with the 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.400
 strength to think that only lasts one 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.399
 minute so it's not worth it 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.860
 no absolutely no advantages advantages in 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.100
 many in the morning you wake up you do not have the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.980
 cough the beautiful energy much more 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.399
 my reference on the stairs was not but 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.460
 especially because they are no longer 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.969
 dependent on nothing of the great gr 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.550
 success 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.300
 finally free this is the year of 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.559
 world you will want to smoke 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.390
 from the interview where issuers of 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.089
 absolutely not starting over 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.370
 you will also do because we have already lived 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.620
 let's say the stress of the European I think 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.540
 will not want to smoke when 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.980
 we have to handle the pressure in 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.800
 general walking 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:17.160
 me and him to fight stress you have to 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.550
 work with much more concentration 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.350
 on the detail think about what you are 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.450
 done but above all focus 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.530
 view situations 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.330
 we walk a lot 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.820
 I don't know who will win the World Cup 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.820
 will win the World Cup we will have to arrive 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.350
 ready to try to win 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.920
 will help give up time 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.049
 We can beat a child more questions 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.450
 when Italy the Italians come 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.490
 in the lead to get results a 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.530
 sometimes make you quit smoking is 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.409
 however, this test is a good test 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.380
 a big test can be a test 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.420
 because it is not so simple and it strengthens 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.330
 I will take the character with my mind 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.850
 with me as an example to my players 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.350
