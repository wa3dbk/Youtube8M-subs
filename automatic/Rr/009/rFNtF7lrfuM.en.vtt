00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
started on this piece going around

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.259 
started on this piece going around
probably<00:00:50.510> from<00:00:50.899> here<00:00:51.109> to<00:00:51.230> here<00:00:51.440> for<00:00:51.769> the<00:00:52.269> front

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
probably from here to here for the front

probably from here to here for the front
hatch<00:00:53.719> hinge<00:00:54.079> and<00:00:54.969> then<00:00:55.969> I<00:00:56.390> might<00:00:57.050> run<00:00:57.199> a<00:00:57.260> piece

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
hatch hinge and then I might run a piece

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.639 
hatch hinge and then I might run a piece
underneath<00:00:57.859> it<00:00:58.359> all<00:00:59.359> the<00:00:59.750> way<00:00:59.870> over<00:01:00.079> to<00:01:00.530> the

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
underneath it all the way over to the

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.439 
underneath it all the way over to the
other<00:01:00.769> end<00:01:00.890> over<00:01:01.339> there<00:01:01.550> to<00:01:01.730> support<00:01:02.089> it<00:01:02.269> and

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
other end over there to support it and

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:03.970 
other end over there to support it and
then<00:01:02.600> I<00:01:02.690> can<00:01:02.839> lay<00:01:02.989> one<00:01:03.199> maybe<00:01:03.410> in<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.739> middle

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
then I can lay one maybe in the middle

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.880 
then I can lay one maybe in the middle
and<00:01:04.670> then<00:01:05.449> run<00:01:05.630> one<00:01:05.840> on<00:01:05.960> top<00:01:06.170> of<00:01:06.230> it<00:01:06.470> over<00:01:06.650> here

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
boatful I got them screws underneath

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.390 
boatful I got them screws underneath
around<00:02:49.380> even<00:02:50.380> on<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.620> sides<00:02:50.890> of<00:02:51.160> them<00:02:51.310> the

out you know water treating all that

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.670 
out you know water treating all that
this<00:03:51.340> is<00:03:51.549> done<00:03:51.790> here<00:03:52.090> we<00:03:52.269> need<00:03:52.419> to<00:03:52.560> cut<00:03:53.560> the

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
this is done here we need to cut the

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.470 
this is done here we need to cut the
plywood<00:03:53.889> forward<00:03:54.639> and<00:03:54.819> then<00:03:54.940> I<00:03:55.030> can<00:03:55.180> take<00:03:55.359> it

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
plywood forward and then I can take it

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.800 
plywood forward and then I can take it
back<00:03:55.599> out<00:03:55.840> fairly<00:03:56.440> easy<00:03:56.739> and<00:03:56.980> we<00:03:57.579> can<00:03:57.810> be

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
back out fairly easy and we can be

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.300 
back out fairly easy and we can be
letting<00:03:59.139> all<00:03:59.470> of<00:03:59.530> these<00:03:59.859> get<00:04:00.099> their

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
letting all of these get their

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.550 
letting all of these get their
polyurethane<00:04:01.150> coat<00:04:01.480> crap<00:04:01.810> while<00:04:02.109> at<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.349> same

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
polyurethane coat crap while at the same

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.780 
polyurethane coat crap while at the same
time<00:04:03.930> let's<00:04:04.930> see<00:04:05.169> I<00:04:05.470> guess<00:04:06.220> that's<00:04:06.459> about<00:04:06.549> the

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
time let's see I guess that's about the

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.430 
time let's see I guess that's about the
next<00:04:07.000> step<00:04:07.180> here<00:04:07.389> is<00:04:07.510> cutting<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:07.930> plywood

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
next step here is cutting the plywood

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.490 
next step here is cutting the plywood
for<00:04:08.739> it

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.740 

all<00:04:12.500> right<00:04:12.680> we<00:04:12.830> decided<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.400> do<00:04:13.610> this<00:04:14.180> divider

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
all right we decided to do this divider

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.840 
all right we decided to do this divider
piece<00:04:15.140> in<00:04:15.380> the<00:04:15.470> middle<00:04:15.710> first<00:04:15.890> we<00:04:16.220> cut<00:04:16.430> two

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
piece in the middle first we cut two

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.400 
piece in the middle first we cut two
pieces<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:17.420> 11<00:04:17.720> inches<00:04:17.959> that's<00:04:18.200> what<00:04:18.320> we

there and that's in case we want to
carpet<00:05:47.330> it<00:05:47.450> or<00:05:47.770> you<00:05:48.770> just<00:05:48.800> don't<00:05:49.160> want<00:05:49.400> it<00:05:49.430> to

be super freakin tight going in there

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.150 
be super freakin tight going in there
either<00:05:52.280> way<00:05:53.260> if<00:05:54.260> you're<00:05:54.410> gonna<00:05:54.530> carpet<00:05:54.979> it<00:05:55.070> you

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
either way if you're gonna carpet it you

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.710 
either way if you're gonna carpet it you
got<00:05:55.280> to<00:05:55.370> account<00:05:55.640> for<00:05:55.729> that<00:05:55.970> normal<00:05:56.419> carpet

goes<00:05:56.840> on<00:05:57.050> both<00:05:57.229> sides<00:05:57.560> over<00:05:57.979> there<00:05:58.160> so<00:05:58.430> it

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
goes on both sides over there so it

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.409 
goes on both sides over there so it
would<00:05:58.700> be<00:05:58.850> a<00:05:58.880> whole<00:05:59.180> lot<00:05:59.210> tighter<00:05:59.510> fit<00:06:01.419> this

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
would be a whole lot tighter fit this

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:03.520 
would be a whole lot tighter fit this
will<00:06:02.570> be<00:06:02.660> dry<00:06:02.840> here<00:06:03.020> in<00:06:03.080> a<00:06:03.140> minute<00:06:03.260> and<00:06:03.440> we're
