 and we want to hear them 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:32.180
 if I walk away from you it's because I've 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:36.829
 understood that today is the gray cloud that 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:40.310
 cloud your path of re- letting 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:44.300
 change your destiny and be very happy 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:47.060
 while I look for the noise 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.150
 if I walk away from you it's because I've 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.860
 understood to find that I am the gray cloud 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:58.079
 that lula your way 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:02.390

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:07.290
 that you are my dog while I forget 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:11.159

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.240
 value that I like about love 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.630
 of a woman who lost the one that only 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.469
 should the church return the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.469
 desolation 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:30.610
 God is returning to be the wanderer 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:37.210
 troubadour should seek the love of love 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.210
 that was lost in blue silk where he deals 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.320

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.659
 but fernando unprepared weapons and 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.370
 ready to listen to the opinion of 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.730
 our producers we start with 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.860
 handy for who did not raise just because 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.560
 I wanted to taste my beloved and beloved 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.989
 Cecilia and I told myself to stop if it's so 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.329
 silly not to advance I'm going to stay 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:33.510
 here since I saw the swing that 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.519
 dress the swing of the one who touches 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.640
 the day drawer here is knitting 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.829
 something good and obviously I liked it 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.010
 a lot because you should not be a little 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:46.260
 difficult to play the guitar and sing 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:51.020
 have to do the first guitar and 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:54.980
 sing and so I loved it very much 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.950
 as always this rhythm is fine for 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.230
 the evenness in quality and feeling in 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.390
 beauty and professionalism and I feel 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.360

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.250
 I really liked the proposal I think 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.890
 that Cecilia has greatly improved her 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.900

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.600
 much the sharpness of singing and the law and 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.900
 the cleanliness of the whole musical performance 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.460
 I think they are a great team and they have 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.370

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.230

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.440

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.920
 cecilia bracamonte we hear 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:55.880

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:59.150
 original creole net music as it is 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.910
 without any additions or anything and the good 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.430
 what's going to happen with this program is that 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.740
