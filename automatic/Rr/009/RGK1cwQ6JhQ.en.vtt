00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
different sizes my all means I mean look

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.880 
different sizes my all means I mean look
at<00:02:08.789> they're<00:02:09.090> all<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.330> same<00:02:09.390> size<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:10.770> one

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
at they're all the same size the one

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.880 
at they're all the same size the one
difference<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:12.000> paint<00:02:12.209> job<00:02:12.360> basically

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
difference is the paint job basically

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.160 
difference is the paint job basically
oh<00:02:13.950> you're<00:02:14.520> buying<00:02:14.700> differently<00:02:15.120> now<00:02:15.780> there's

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
oh you're buying differently now there's

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.670 
oh you're buying differently now there's
three<00:02:16.440> things<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:17.040> can<00:02:17.220> buy<00:02:17.340> from<00:02:17.580> there's

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
three things you can buy from there's

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.330 
three things you can buy from there's
normal<00:02:19.850> sniper<00:02:21.230> one<00:02:22.230> shooting<00:02:22.830> down<00:02:23.069> from

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
normal sniper one shooting down from

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.730 
normal sniper one shooting down from
earth<00:02:23.520> or<00:02:23.880> in<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.900> orbit<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.410> guess<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.680> could

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
earth or in the orbit I guess you could

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.790 
earth or in the orbit I guess you could
say<00:02:25.980> kind<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.490> going<00:02:26.640> down<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:27.120> their<00:02:27.780> full<00:02:28.680> of

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
say kind of going down to their full of

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.760 
say kind of going down to their full of
fire<00:02:29.010> or<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.819> a<00:02:30.000> close-quarters<00:02:30.450> one<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:31.410> is

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
fire or just a close-quarters one it is

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.940 
fire or just a close-quarters one it is
all<00:02:32.040> green<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.400> kind<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:32.970> dirty<00:02:33.350> so<00:02:34.350> there<00:02:34.740> are

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
all green and kind of dirty so there are

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.900 
all green and kind of dirty so there are
some<00:02:35.220> poisons<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:36.030> play<00:02:36.240> with<00:02:36.570> uh<00:02:37.190> now<00:02:38.190> that's

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
some poisons to play with uh now that's

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.810 
some poisons to play with uh now that's
just<00:02:39.000> getting<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.690> why<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.380> like<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.520> why

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
just getting to why I like this and why

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.180 
just getting to why I like this and why
I<00:02:41.850> don't<00:02:42.360> reason<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:43.410> like<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:43.800> is<00:02:43.950> because

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
I don't reason I like this is because

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.100 
I don't reason I like this is because
it's<00:02:45.030> nice-looking<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:46.410> has<00:02:46.800> vernis<00:02:47.220> detail

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
it's nice-looking it has vernis detail

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.870 
it's nice-looking it has vernis detail
you<00:02:49.110> know<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.380> flames<00:02:49.709> look<00:02:49.950> somewhat<00:02:50.610> nice

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
you know the flames look somewhat nice

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.710 
you know the flames look somewhat nice
but<00:02:51.660> at<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.840> same<00:02:52.200> time<00:02:52.500> they<00:02:52.769> look<00:02:52.980> like<00:02:53.190> crap

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
but at the same time they look like crap

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.820 
but at the same time they look like crap
now<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.780> reason<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.050> say<00:02:55.230> they<00:02:55.350> look<00:02:55.500> like<00:02:55.590> crap

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
now the reason I say they look like crap

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.380 
now the reason I say they look like crap
is<00:02:56.070> because<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.489> looks<00:02:56.610> like<00:02:56.730> someone<00:02:57.239> took<00:02:57.330> a

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
is because it looks like someone took a

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
is because it looks like someone took a
crane<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.050> started<00:02:59.040> going<00:02:59.190> like<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.989> now<00:03:00.989> it

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
crane and started going like this now it

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.680 
crane and started going like this now it
may<00:03:02.070> just<00:03:02.100> be<00:03:02.280> me<00:03:02.550> but<00:03:02.760> that's<00:03:03.360> what<00:03:03.450> it's<00:03:03.630> like

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
may just be me but that's what it's like

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.820 
may just be me but that's what it's like
I<00:03:03.959> could've<00:03:04.950> done<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.100> ton<00:03:05.489> better<00:03:05.730> job<00:03:06.150> at<00:03:06.830> the

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
I could've done a ton better job at the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.490 
I could've done a ton better job at the
flames<00:03:08.190> on<00:03:08.459> this<00:03:08.670> now<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.750> may<00:03:10.050> sound<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.470> little

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
flames on this now I may sound a little

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.560 
flames on this now I may sound a little
harsh<00:03:10.980> but<00:03:11.100> really<00:03:11.700> if<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.910> look<00:03:11.940> at<00:03:12.300> them<00:03:12.360> I

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
harsh but really if you look at them I

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.530 
harsh but really if you look at them I
mean<00:03:12.810> look<00:03:12.930> at<00:03:13.019> these<00:03:13.140> come<00:03:13.739> on<00:03:13.800> guys<00:03:14.540> they

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
mean look at these come on guys they

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.150 
mean look at these come on guys they
could<00:03:15.690> have<00:03:15.720> done<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.290> much<00:03:16.500> better<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:17.100> just

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
could have done so much better it just

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.880 
could have done so much better it just
looks<00:03:17.459> like<00:03:17.519> they<00:03:17.730> colored<00:03:18.420> on<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.890> could

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
looks like they colored on it I could

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:20.870 
looks like they colored on it I could
have<00:03:19.980> done<00:03:20.040> this<00:03:20.100> I<00:03:20.310> could<00:03:20.459> have<00:03:20.549> taken<00:03:20.670> this

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
have done this I could have taken this

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.039 
have done this I could have taken this
right<00:03:21.780> here<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.549> put<00:03:23.549> some<00:03:23.760> orange<00:03:24.390> here<00:03:24.660> put

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
right here and put some orange here put

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.069 
right here and put some orange here put
it<00:03:25.140> you<00:03:25.290> little<00:03:25.470> yellow<00:03:25.829> on<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.160> side<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:27.079> I

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
it you little yellow on the side and I

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.920 
it you little yellow on the side and I
didn't<00:03:28.470> buy<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:28.739> for<00:03:29.160> that<00:03:29.400> now<00:03:30.360> there<00:03:30.780> are

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
didn't buy this for that now there are

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.240 
didn't buy this for that now there are
some<00:03:31.200> good<00:03:31.230> things<00:03:31.410> about<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.920> drop<00:03:32.070> off<00:03:32.190> go

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
some good things about the drop off go

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.170 
some good things about the drop off go
is<00:03:32.610> if<00:03:33.450> function<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:33.900> really<00:03:34.110> well<00:03:35.090> you<00:03:36.090> know

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
is if function is really well you know

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.110 
is if function is really well you know
it's<00:03:36.329> it's<00:03:36.540> it's<00:03:36.989> really<00:03:37.140> nice<00:03:37.380> drop<00:03:37.980> pod<00:03:38.190> it

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
it's it's it's really nice drop pod it

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.880 
it's it's it's really nice drop pod it
has<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.900> same<00:03:40.049> functions<00:03:40.410> there's<00:03:40.560> as

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
has the same functions there's as

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.289 
has the same functions there's as
everything<00:03:41.370> else<00:03:41.489> but<00:03:42.239> for<00:03:42.510> some<00:03:42.840> odd<00:03:43.140> reason

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
everything else but for some odd reason

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.000 
everything else but for some odd reason
it<00:03:45.299> has<00:03:45.570> a<00:03:45.600> hard<00:03:45.900> time<00:03:45.959> fitting<00:03:46.500> on<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:46.829> I

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
it has a hard time fitting on this I

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.090 
it has a hard time fitting on this I
mean<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.820> takes<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.150> little<00:03:48.299> while<00:03:48.510> for<00:03:48.780> me<00:03:49.100> of

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
mean it takes a little while for me of

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.330 
mean it takes a little while for me of
course<00:03:50.310> not<00:03:50.430> works<00:03:50.760> but<00:03:51.510> it's<00:03:52.079> a<00:03:52.320> lot<00:03:52.560> harder

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
course not works but it's a lot harder

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.479 
course not works but it's a lot harder
at<00:03:53.850> times<00:03:54.150> for<00:03:54.600> me<00:03:54.750> at<00:03:54.900> least<00:03:55.220> then<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:56.340> does

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
at times for me at least then it does

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.699 
at times for me at least then it does
for<00:03:56.940> this<00:03:57.090> I<00:03:57.299> mean<00:03:57.480> this<00:03:57.540> comes<00:03:57.900> off<00:03:58.049> it's

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
for this I mean this comes off it's

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.699 
for this I mean this comes off it's
simply<00:03:58.920> back<00:03:59.130> on<00:03:59.280> okay<00:03:59.730> simple<00:04:00.440> this<00:04:01.440> on<00:04:01.620> the

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
simply back on okay simple this on the

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.640 
simply back on okay simple this on the
other<00:04:01.860> hand<00:04:02.040> right<00:04:02.489> here<00:04:02.700> does<00:04:03.450> it<00:04:03.650> but

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
other hand right here does it but

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.680 
other hand right here does it but
overall<00:04:05.400> you're<00:04:05.579> looking<00:04:05.790> at<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.090> same<00:04:06.390> oh
