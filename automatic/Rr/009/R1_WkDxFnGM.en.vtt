00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
don't really think that it's necessary

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.180 
don't really think that it's necessary
to<00:02:17.330> transfer<00:02:17.780> over<00:02:18.050> into<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.470> next<00:02:18.590> three

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190

years of the call of duty cycles simply

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.990 
years of the call of duty cycles simply
because<00:02:21.319> one<00:02:21.709> game<00:02:21.950> had<00:02:22.220> them<00:02:22.430> I<00:02:22.550> think<00:02:22.819> it

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
because one game had them I think it

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000 
because one game had them I think it
could<00:02:23.150> work<00:02:23.420> very<00:02:23.750> well<00:02:23.840> as<00:02:24.170> sledgehammers

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
could work very well as sledgehammers

it's<00:02:28.490> going<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.760> happen<00:02:28.970> but<00:02:29.480> regardless
