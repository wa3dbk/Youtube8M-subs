00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:04.369
 we are going to do 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.669
 the third position yesterday 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:09.839
 I have here 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.929
 and the same here you will notice how it costs you a little more in this feeling 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.500
 in which the guerrillas are going inwards to flat Paris towers - but what 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.179
 important is that you maintain and while the posture 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.179
 your shoulders down 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.460
 double capped to hold the double chin that's 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.759
 ale there 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.920
 the weight in the afa in the tips of the feet and the pirate anchors 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.820
 speak well 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.770
 and loose 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.930
 I speak is why all the air and yesterday 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.380
 I speak well 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.770
 and it does not seem that far away in that the variation inwards is worth 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.850
 istÃºriz tightening the inner most abdominal area 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.160
 and I hope so 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.840
 reflected in furnaces is not consciously and the entire pelvic floor 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.050
 ok and you'll be stretching the diaphragm 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.460
 the more inspiring the diaphragm the more capacity the new DT will have 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.780
 both control 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.720
 like air expulsion or that its fruits will go perfect and you know 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.470
 that the diaphragm is the main muscle of respiration 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.610
 the formation 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.610
 vega preparations 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.450
 I will try to give you the minimum order it is possible to be your data sheet subsist 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.760
 remember the men well down 10 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.330
 the double chin 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
 i although I got excited separating each vertebra well 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.070
 according to two a little pressured 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.550
 no no your back always a little corvallan 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.510
 vega here will also be a little easier 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.510
 eye aires 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.940
 and one more
