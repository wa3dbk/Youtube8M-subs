00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.700 

first<00:00:47.150> that

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
first that

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.709 
first that
conversion<00:00:48.160> dice<00:00:48.309> is<00:00:48.670> measuring<00:00:49.210> out<00:00:49.360> the

right amount of rice that you want to
code<00:00:51.870> each<00:00:52.870> person<00:00:53.320> typically<00:00:53.770> it's<00:00:54.190> about

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
code each person typically it's about

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.630 
code each person typically it's about
3/4<00:00:55.600> a<00:00:55.660> cup<00:00:55.690> of<00:00:55.960> rice<00:00:56.110> and<00:00:56.440> so<00:00:57.190> I'm<00:00:57.340> going<00:00:57.579> to

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
3/4 a cup of rice and so I'm going to

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.360 
3/4 a cup of rice and so I'm going to
make<00:00:57.820> a<00:00:58.180> cup<00:00:58.870> and<00:00:58.989> a<00:00:59.050> half<00:00:59.079> because<00:00:59.890> I'm<00:01:00.100> making

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
make a cup and a half because I'm making

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.969 
make a cup and a half because I'm making
this<00:01:00.460> too

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.410 

in<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.580> back<00:01:05.700> up<00:01:06.530> pour<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.560> into<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.950> pot

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.310 

here's<00:01:13.409> half<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> cup

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.109 

that's<00:01:18.980> how<00:01:19.130> you<00:01:19.190> measure<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.610> rice

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.330 

and<00:01:23.659> making<00:01:23.899> the<00:01:23.990> rice<00:01:24.170> is<00:01:24.500> rinsing<00:01:25.189> the<00:01:25.310> rice

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
and making the rice is rinsing the rice

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.370 
and making the rice is rinsing the rice
and<00:01:25.640> this<00:01:25.729> is<00:01:25.880> very<00:01:26.090> important<00:01:26.689> because<00:01:26.869> the

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
and this is very important because the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.370 
and this is very important because the
rice<00:01:27.590> is<00:01:28.009> originally<00:01:28.579> very<00:01:28.700> starchy<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:29.600> very

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
rice is originally very starchy and very

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.840 
rice is originally very starchy and very
unhealthy<00:01:30.649> so<00:01:31.100> we're<00:01:31.250> going<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.399> try<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:31.579> rinse

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
unhealthy so we're going to try to rinse

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.520 
unhealthy so we're going to try to rinse
it<00:01:31.909> as<00:01:32.000> much<00:01:32.149> of<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.359> starch<00:01:32.659> off<00:01:32.929> of<00:01:33.109> there<00:01:33.319> as

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
it as much of the starch off of there as

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.889 
it as much of the starch off of there as
we<00:01:33.859> can<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:34.369> to<00:01:34.969> do<00:01:35.119> this<00:01:35.270> we<00:01:35.479> need<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.659> rinse

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
we can and to do this we need to rinse

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:37.719 
we can and to do this we need to rinse
it<00:01:35.990> about<00:01:36.229> seven<00:01:36.590> or<00:01:36.679> eight<00:01:36.740> times<00:01:36.799> until<00:01:37.609> the

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
it about seven or eight times until the

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.990 
it about seven or eight times until the
water<00:01:37.969> is<00:01:38.090> becomes<00:01:38.600> really<00:01:38.840> clear<00:01:39.049> and<00:01:40.000> here

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
water is becomes really clear and here

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.699 
water is becomes really clear and here
you<00:01:41.149> go<00:01:41.240> I'm<00:01:41.360> just<00:01:41.539> going<00:01:41.719> to<00:01:41.780> pour<00:01:42.319> water<00:01:42.560> from

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709

just<00:01:51.020> simply<00:01:51.679> stir<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:52.399> rice<00:01:52.549> with<00:01:53.119> my<00:01:53.270> finger

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
just simply stir the rice with my finger

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:03.149 
just simply stir the rice with my finger

and<00:02:22.780> now<00:02:23.050> we're<00:02:23.200> going<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.380> repeat<00:02:23.620> this<00:02:23.770> step

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
and now we're going to repeat this step

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.250 
and now we're going to repeat this step
about<00:02:24.460> six<00:02:24.970> or<00:02:25.120> seven<00:02:25.360> more<00:02:25.510> times<00:02:25.780> until<00:02:26.020> the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
about six or seven more times until the

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.590 
about six or seven more times until the
water<00:02:26.290> becomes<00:02:26.800> completely<00:02:27.280> clear

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.060 

once<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.750> finish<00:02:32.050> rinsing<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.500> rice<00:02:32.530> to

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
once you finish rinsing the rice to

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.250 
once you finish rinsing the rice to
where<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.550> water<00:02:33.700> is<00:02:34.090> relatively<00:02:34.480> clear<00:02:34.870> not

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.050 
where the water is relatively clear not
too<00:02:35.380> murky<00:02:35.770> you're<00:02:36.430> going<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.670> want<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:36.940> move

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
too murky you're going to want to move

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.640 
too murky you're going to want to move
on<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.360> third<00:02:37.570> step<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:38.170> just<00:02:38.320> involves

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
on the third step and that just involves

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.740 
on the third step and that just involves
filling<00:02:39.100> up<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.430> pot<00:02:39.640> with<00:02:39.790> water<00:02:39.820> up<00:02:40.690> to

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
filling up the pot with water up to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.660 
filling up the pot with water up to
about<00:02:40.930> an<00:02:41.230> inch<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.620> half<00:02:41.650> above<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.460> rice

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
about an inch and a half above the rice

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.180 
about an inch and a half above the rice
level<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.270> we're<00:02:43.930> just<00:02:43.990> going<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.230> use<00:02:44.560> the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
level and we're just going to use the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.000 
level and we're just going to use the
also<00:02:45.880> again<00:02:47.550> fill<00:02:48.550> it<00:02:48.700> up<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.770> right<00:02:50.770> now

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
also again fill it up and right now

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.670 
also again fill it up and right now
about<00:02:51.430> an<00:02:51.490> inch<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.820> half<00:02:51.850> go<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.180> rifle<00:02:52.690> and

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
about an inch and a half go to rifle and

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.200 
about an inch and a half go to rifle and
now<00:02:53.830> we're<00:02:54.010> ready<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.220> move<00:02:54.430> on<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.940> fourth

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
now we're ready to move on to the fourth

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.630 
now we're ready to move on to the fourth
step

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.460 

all<00:02:58.390> right<00:02:58.480> now<00:02:58.720> we're<00:02:58.900> going<00:02:58.990> to<00:02:59.050> move<00:02:59.200> on<00:02:59.380> to

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
all right now we're going to move on to

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.010 
all right now we're going to move on to
the<00:02:59.650> fourth<00:02:59.920> step<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.610> this<00:03:01.150> involves<00:03:01.630> just

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
the fourth step and this involves just

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.190 
the fourth step and this involves just
adding<00:03:02.350> olive<00:03:02.740> oil<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:03.280> salt<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.930> give<00:03:05.050> it<00:03:05.140> a

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
adding olive oil and salt you give it a

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.030 
adding olive oil and salt you give it a
little<00:03:05.230> bit<00:03:05.410> of<00:03:05.500> flavor

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
little bit of flavor

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.950 
little bit of flavor
now<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.640> olive<00:03:07.060> oil<00:03:07.210> we<00:03:07.390> just<00:03:07.600> want<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.840> add

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
now the olive oil we just want to add

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.930 
now the olive oil we just want to add
just<00:03:08.470> enough<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:09.190> keep<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.610> rice<00:03:09.760> from

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
just enough to keep the rice from

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.550 
just enough to keep the rice from
sticking<00:03:10.000> but<00:03:10.660> not<00:03:10.840> too<00:03:11.050> much<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.350> where<00:03:11.470> it

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
sticking but not too much to where it

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.050 
sticking but not too much to where it
makes<00:03:11.650> it<00:03:11.770> really<00:03:12.010> greasy<00:03:12.220> so<00:03:12.880> we're<00:03:13.030> just

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
makes it really greasy so we're just

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.180 
makes it really greasy so we're just
going<00:03:13.270> to<00:03:13.330> make<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.540> little<00:03:13.750> s<00:03:14.020> in<00:03:14.320> the<00:03:14.620> pot<00:03:14.890> with

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
going to make a little s in the pot with

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:23.370 
going to make a little s in the pot with
olive<00:03:15.490> oil<00:03:15.670> like<00:03:16.180> so<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:22.600> now<00:03:22.780> we're<00:03:23.200> going<00:03:23.320> to

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
olive oil like so and now we're going to

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.350 
olive oil like so and now we're going to
add<00:03:23.500> some<00:03:23.680> salt<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:24.580> basically<00:03:24.910> just<00:03:25.180> hold

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
add some salt and basically just hold

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.510 
add some salt and basically just hold
your<00:03:25.480> hand<00:03:25.630> out<00:03:25.780> like<00:03:25.840> this<00:03:28.080> you<00:03:29.080> sure<00:03:29.430> it's<00:03:30.430> a

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
your hand out like this you sure it's a

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
your hand out like this you sure it's a
good<00:03:30.550> amount<00:03:30.910> of<00:03:30.940> salt<00:03:31.150> right<00:03:31.420> there<00:03:33.300> and<00:03:34.300> just

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
good amount of salt right there and just

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.570 
good amount of salt right there and just
pour<00:03:34.840> it<00:03:35.020> in<00:03:36.510> now<00:03:37.510> it's<00:03:37.690> ready<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:37.959> go<00:03:38.050> on<00:03:38.230> step

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.610 

now<00:03:42.580> it's<00:03:42.760> time<00:03:42.940> to<00:03:43.330> cook<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.840> rice<00:03:43.960> and<00:03:44.350> we're

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
now it's time to cook the rice and we're

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.230 
now it's time to cook the rice and we're
just<00:03:44.680> going<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:44.950> put<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:45.340> on<00:03:45.490> the<00:03:45.700> stove<00:03:45.970> and

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
just going to put it on the stove and

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.960 
just going to put it on the stove and
back<00:03:46.690> burner<00:03:46.960> and<00:03:47.800> we're<00:03:48.280> going<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.430> turn<00:03:48.640> the

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
back burner and we're going to turn the

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.040 
back burner and we're going to turn the
stove<00:03:49.210> on<00:03:49.600> high<00:03:51.540> now<00:03:52.540> we're<00:03:52.690> going<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.840> wait

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
stove on high now we're going to wait

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.400 
stove on high now we're going to wait
about<00:03:53.620> seven<00:03:54.340> eight<00:03:54.730> minutes<00:03:54.940> and<00:03:55.390> water<00:03:55.990> into

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
about seven eight minutes and water into

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.530 
about seven eight minutes and water into
the<00:03:56.500> water<00:03:56.680> start<00:03:57.160> to<00:03:57.250> boil<00:03:57.520> and<00:03:57.940> we<00:03:58.240> want<00:03:58.420> to

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
the water start to boil and we want to

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.830 
the water start to boil and we want to
wait<00:03:58.720> for<00:03:58.990> that<00:03:59.020> water<00:03:59.380> to<00:04:00.540> evaporate<00:04:01.540> and

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
wait for that water to evaporate and

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.570 
wait for that water to evaporate and
then<00:04:02.650> we're<00:04:02.800> going<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:02.980> move<00:04:03.100> on<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.459> next

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
then we're going to move on to the next

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.430 
then we're going to move on to the next
step<00:04:03.820> now<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.240> water<00:04:04.540> is<00:04:04.750> pretty<00:04:04.870> much<00:04:05.050> boiled

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
step now the water is pretty much boiled

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.900 
step now the water is pretty much boiled
down<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.890> water<00:04:06.070> is<00:04:06.250> pretty<00:04:06.580> much<00:04:06.670> all

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
down and water is pretty much all

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.699 
down and water is pretty much all
evaporated<00:04:07.240> we're<00:04:08.110> going<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.320> go<00:04:08.410> ahead<00:04:08.500> and

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
evaporated we're going to go ahead and

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.560 
evaporated we're going to go ahead and
place<00:04:08.890> paper<00:04:09.100> towel<00:04:09.340> over<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:09.910> pot<00:04:10.120> but

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
place paper towel over the pot but

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.970 
place paper towel over the pot but
before<00:04:10.810> we<00:04:10.870> do<00:04:10.959> that<00:04:10.990> we<00:04:11.200> want<00:04:11.320> to<00:04:11.440> fold<00:04:11.740> the

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
before we do that we want to fold the

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.620 
before we do that we want to fold the
paper<00:04:12.190> towel<00:04:12.490> so<00:04:12.970> that<00:04:13.000> it<00:04:13.180> doesn't<00:04:13.420> drape

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
paper towel so that it doesn't drape

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.520 
paper towel so that it doesn't drape
over<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.050> pot<00:04:14.230> and<00:04:14.560> cause<00:04:15.489> fine<00:04:16.230> place<00:04:17.230> it<00:04:17.410> on

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
over the pot and cause fine place it on

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.200 
over the pot and cause fine place it on
top<00:04:19.049> like<00:04:20.049> that<00:04:20.079> I'm<00:04:21.040> never<00:04:21.190> going<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.430> put<00:04:21.609> the

top like that I'm never going to put the
top<00:04:22.419> top<00:04:23.370> of<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.490> pot<00:04:24.700> and<00:04:25.510> we're<00:04:25.630> going<00:04:25.750> to

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
top top of the pot and we're going to

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.070 
top top of the pot and we're going to
turn<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.650> burner<00:04:26.680> down<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.850> about<00:04:28.270> medium<00:04:28.810> and

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
turn the burner down to about medium and

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.159 
turn the burner down to about medium and
now<00:04:29.830> we're<00:04:29.980> going<00:04:30.070> to<00:04:30.160> wait<00:04:30.400> about<00:04:31.030> 45<00:04:31.840> minutes

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
now we're going to wait about 45 minutes

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.830 
now we're going to wait about 45 minutes
before<00:04:32.950> we<00:04:33.310> can<00:04:33.460> flip<00:04:33.640> the<00:04:33.820> rice
