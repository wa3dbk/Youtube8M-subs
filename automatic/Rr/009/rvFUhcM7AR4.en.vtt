we can see the autonomous vehicles that

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.610 
we can see the autonomous vehicles that
are<00:00:08.059> supposed<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.240> take<00:00:09.360> care<00:00:09.840> about<00:00:10.139> security

practically speaking what will this

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.830 
practically speaking what will this
vehicle<00:00:34.110> be<00:00:34.230> doing<00:00:34.730> the<00:00:35.730> problem<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.540> security
