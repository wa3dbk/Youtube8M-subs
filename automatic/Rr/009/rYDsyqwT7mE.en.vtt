the<00:00:51.149> forums<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.899> there's<00:00:52.199> meant<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.590> be<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
the forums that there's meant to be a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.939 
the forums that there's meant to be a
map<00:00:53.010> conversion<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.960> normally<00:00:55.410> means<00:00:55.440> a

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
map conversion and that normally means a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.819 
map conversion and that normally means a
night<00:00:56.489> version<00:00:56.969> or<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.750> winter<00:00:58.289> version<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
night version or a winter version of a

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.840 
night version or a winter version of a
map<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.449> already<00:01:00.449> exists<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.800> not<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> new<00:01:02.550> map

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
map that already exists so not a new map

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.050 
map that already exists so not a new map
but<00:01:03.359> most<00:01:03.960> likely<00:01:04.170> an<00:01:04.769> existing<00:01:05.309> map<00:01:05.519> having

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
but most likely an existing map having

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.300 
but most likely an existing map having
something<00:01:06.900> added<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.560> which<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.890> Halloween

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
something added to it which is Halloween

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.910 
something added to it which is Halloween
related<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.689> could<00:01:09.960> mean<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.530> mean

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
related so it could mean I mean

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.179 
related so it could mean I mean
hopefully<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.520> think<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.060> means<00:01:12.830> we<00:01:13.830> get<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.010> new

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
hopefully I think it means we get a new

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.880 
hopefully I think it means we get a new
night<00:01:14.400> version<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.030> map<00:01:15.799> preferably<00:01:16.799> I'd

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
night version of a map preferably I'd

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.950

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
yeah that would completely defeat the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.969 
yeah that would completely defeat the
point<00:01:33.890> but<00:01:34.890> yeah<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.530> was<00:01:37.710> all<00:01:37.799> i<00:01:37.860> could
