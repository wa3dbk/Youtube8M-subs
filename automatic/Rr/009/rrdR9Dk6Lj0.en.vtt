00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.870
 now you will be built up now you will 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.269
 always ice cold so plan accordingly 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.250
 proceeded according to plan 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:15.540
 For the first time tips and tricks give that 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.550
 Would you comment on your technical 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.550
 challenge that is vivid 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.279
 I just hold the left mouse button 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.289
 pressed and collects like a go 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:35.790
 champion 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:39.660
 that we have another two bedrooms 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.120
 through the landscape and somehow proud 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.120
 because wood is important and wood is great 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.700
 so happened here once the 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.680
 Map ran with it died 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.070
 That did not start well 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.780
 so without comic promotion in 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.570
 which funny people over and over again 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.680
 completely one with nature 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.640
 but somewhere the change so as a 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.500
 At least everything is old again 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.460
 minecraft somehow just kind of stops 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.920
 green and a bit brown and that 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.060
 would they look quite exciting 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:26.780
 Maybe someday we'll cover it 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:33.920
 The old minecraft tricks 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.920
 turn left over group bums noodle 360 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:47.970
 so I did not say what is it 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:52.220
 is always nice that's what that is 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.220
 I like it 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.160
 but already 20 episodes full knows yes 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.160
 Not 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:11.990
 to what extent the connection exists 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:15.630
 between the episodes but that 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.260
 Worst thing I do now 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.360
 Wood 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.350
 I'm actually here this guy 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.710
 I'm not that great anymore 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.020
 turquoise booms on but here's one 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:31.230
 weird red that's the one here 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:37.970
 difference between wood and wood there 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:39.709
 You can make it great then then 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.709
 that is to say 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.300
 I'm not at the game 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:49.740
 but you do not have to be able to do it all 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:53.520
 live working bank wgz bank that went 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.230
 even very nice is the basic knowledge 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.320
 that gives me a lot - and that 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.140
 is not enough for me , although I do not always like that 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:06.000
 a house in the house or oils or somehow 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:11.269
 something like black sheep holds I think 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.269
 but there was this running 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:21.730
 All right then the cellars are running 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.730
 to build 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:33.609
 but maybe somewhere 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.609
 somehow opel service games pumpkin soup 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.349
 say I have it very nice 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.599
 I had heard that no 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:57.650
 Halloween is a bit too 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:58.669
 but good then I want to say 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.230
 now just something here and 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:05.450
 furniture good was realistic 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:15.099
 I would have thought correctly 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:18.560
 how we look how she is ok 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.909
 Not so far, but I do not want to go now 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.010
 to be eaten by similar spiders 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:25.060
 because of the coal that is not manager at 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.060
 me this job market 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.900
 how did that which even went so very 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.900
 beautiful 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:47.640
 the braunstein and coal have been learned 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:05:01.090
 that we stand a bit of water 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:05:02.620

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.670

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.470

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:16.510

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:20.850
 a little bit die and need it now 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.850
 I even believe a shovel 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:51.000
 then you just make say something which 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:51.000
 Absolutely not the furnishing 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:02.160
 no matter how many facilities there are 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.160
 Deck yourself sometime 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:10.630

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:16.240
