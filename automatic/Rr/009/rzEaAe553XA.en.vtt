grop a very wonderful family from fuelly

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.560 
grop a very wonderful family from fuelly
but<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> first<00:01:42.330> to<00:01:42.740> take<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.570> grappa

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
but one of the first to take the grappa

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.800 
but one of the first to take the grappa
and<00:01:45.689> make<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.650> from<00:01:46.830> one<00:01:46.890> grape<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.580> I<00:01:48.180> think

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
and make it from one grape and I think

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.390 
and make it from one grape and I think
that<00:01:48.930> was<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.320> pickle<00:01:49.740> leagrave<00:01:50.009> was<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
that was the a pickle leagrave was the

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.190 
that was the a pickle leagrave was the
first<00:01:50.610> ones<00:01:50.880> here<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.150> first<00:01:51.390> one<00:01:51.570> really<00:01:51.869> to

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
first ones here the first one really to

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.260 
first ones here the first one really to
make<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.560> from<00:01:52.740> one<00:01:52.830> grape<00:01:53.310> other<00:01:53.700> people<00:01:54.030> made

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
make it from one grape other people made

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.880 
make it from one grape other people made
up<00:01:54.420> but<00:01:54.540> they<00:01:54.659> made<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.869> from<00:01:55.140> whatever<00:01:55.350> was

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
up but they made it from whatever was

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.530 
up but they made it from whatever was
like<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.400> was<00:01:56.490> an<00:01:56.579> exponential<00:01:57.180> increase<00:01:57.509> in

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
like that was an exponential increase in

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.810 
like that was an exponential increase in
quality<00:01:57.780> or<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.350> believe<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:59.130> no<00:01:59.400> ninos<00:01:59.700> were

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
quality or I believe so no ninos were

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.850 
quality or I believe so no ninos were
really<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:00.270> first<00:02:00.450> ones<00:02:00.840> one<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:01.740> first

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
really the first ones one of the first

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.100 
really the first ones one of the first
if<00:02:02.070> not<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.220> first<00:02:02.400> to<00:02:02.790> really<00:02:02.939> improve<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
if not the first to really improve the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.850 
if not the first to really improve the
quality<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.619> Rufford<00:02:05.430> also<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.689> market<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.259> in

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
quality of Rufford also to market it in

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.460 
quality of Rufford also to market it in
a<00:02:08.429> way<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:09.179> would<00:02:09.360> make<00:02:09.570> it<00:02:09.780> dapat<00:02:10.200> herbal

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
a way that it would make it dapat herbal

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.979 
a way that it would make it dapat herbal
and<00:02:10.649> desirable<00:02:11.250> for<00:02:11.970> more<00:02:12.150> people<00:02:12.510> it's

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
and desirable for more people it's
