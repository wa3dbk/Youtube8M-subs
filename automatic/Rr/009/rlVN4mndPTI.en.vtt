00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
default lock screen that Samsung

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.149 
default lock screen that Samsung
provides<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.840> although<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.530> beautiful<00:01:05.070> I

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
provides is although it is beautiful I

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.270 
provides is although it is beautiful I
like<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.489> font<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:06.450> need<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.869> pull<00:01:07.260> down<00:01:07.560> to

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
like the font you need to pull down to

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.859 
like the font you need to pull down to
see<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.640> weather<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.210> thought<00:01:09.390> that's<00:01:09.630> a

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
see the weather and I thought that's a

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.170 
see the weather and I thought that's a
necessary<00:01:10.350> gesture<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.850> see<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
necessary gesture just to see the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.359 
necessary gesture just to see the
weather<00:01:12.330> now<00:01:13.140> most<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.740> probably<00:01:14.040> already

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
weather now most of you probably already

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.490 
weather now most of you probably already
have<00:01:14.939> done<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.630> could<00:01:15.900> swipe<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
have done this you could swipe to the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.840 
have done this you could swipe to the
left<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.009> then<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.340> could<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.490> add<00:01:17.820> a

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
left and then you could just add a

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.820 
left and then you could just add a
widget<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.630> example<00:01:19.110> let's<00:01:19.320> add<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.680> music

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
widget for example let's add the music

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.539 
widget for example let's add the music
widget<00:01:20.220> here<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.710> in<00:01:22.710> order<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.189> move<00:01:23.369> this

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
widget here and in order to move this

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.490 
widget here and in order to move this
around<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.000> need<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.180> first<00:01:24.720> have<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:24.990> expand

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
around you need to first have it expand

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.130 
around you need to first have it expand
it<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:25.830> first<00:01:26.220> expand<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.150> by<00:01:27.689> dragging<00:01:27.960> from

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
it so first expand it by dragging from

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.530 
it so first expand it by dragging from
the<00:01:28.320> middle<00:01:28.680> downwards<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.790> then<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.299> could

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
the middle downwards and then you could

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.149 
the middle downwards and then you could
long<00:01:30.840> tap<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.740> would<00:01:31.829> do<00:01:31.950> any

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
long tap on it like you would do any

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.740 
long tap on it like you would do any
widget<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.090> move<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.479> place

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
widget and you can move it in place

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.499 
widget and you can move it in place
could<00:01:34.320> even<00:01:34.470> make<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.100> your<00:01:35.670> new<00:01:35.909> home<00:01:36.270> screen

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
could even make it your new home screen

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.499 
could even make it your new home screen
widget<00:01:37.140> for<00:01:37.320> example<00:01:37.799> if<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:38.970> power<00:01:39.299> on

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
widget for example if you just power on

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.749 
widget for example if you just power on
the<00:01:39.659> device<00:01:39.960> now<00:01:40.259> your<00:01:40.470> home<00:01:40.680> screen<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.280> that

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the device now your home screen is that

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.719 
the device now your home screen is that
music<00:01:42.180> widget<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.979> once<00:01:44.220> again<00:01:44.340> what<00:01:44.700> I

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
music widget and once again what I

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.429 
music widget and once again what I
really<00:01:45.149> don't<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.479> about<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.930> widget<00:01:46.140> is

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
really don't like about this widget is

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.770 
really don't like about this widget is
that<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.619> cannot<00:01:47.070> see<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.909> weather<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.509> there

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
that I cannot see the weather on there

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.929 
that I cannot see the weather on there
maybe<00:01:49.590> if<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.950> live<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.369> city<00:01:50.549> where<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
maybe if you live in a city where the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.910 
maybe if you live in a city where the
weather<00:01:51.149> system<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.840> pretty<00:01:52.140> consistent<00:01:52.530> and

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
weather system is pretty consistent and

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.010 
weather system is pretty consistent and
predictable<00:01:53.119> maybe<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.329> wouldn't<00:01:54.659> be<00:01:54.780> much<00:01:54.960> of

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
predictable maybe it wouldn't be much of

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.440 
predictable maybe it wouldn't be much of
an<00:01:55.229> issue<00:01:55.350> for<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.829> but<00:01:56.130> for<00:01:56.670> me<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.149> always

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450

additional<00:03:19.860> two<00:03:20.190> widgets<00:03:20.490> so<00:03:21.330> I<00:03:21.360> like<00:03:21.600> this

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
additional two widgets so I like this

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.870 
additional two widgets so I like this
one<00:03:22.110> because<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.650> very<00:03:23.010> stylish<00:03:23.370> has<00:03:23.850> a

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
one because it is very stylish has a

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.600 
one because it is very stylish has a
nice<00:03:24.150> graphic<00:03:24.600> in<00:03:24.720> there<00:03:24.900> however<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:26.340> one

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
nice graphic in there however this one

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.270 
nice graphic in there however this one
has<00:03:26.640> more<00:03:27.330> features<00:03:27.630> in<00:03:28.110> there<00:03:28.290> has<00:03:28.620> the

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
has more features in there has the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.030 
has more features in there has the
temperature<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.990> could<00:03:31.170> add<00:03:31.350> stuff<00:03:31.830> like

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
temperature and you could add stuff like

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.090 
temperature and you could add stuff like
your<00:03:32.250> Gmail<00:03:32.850> in<00:03:33.030> there<00:03:33.590> so<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.650> think<00:03:34.740> that<00:03:34.950> is

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
your Gmail in there so I think that is

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.040 
your Gmail in there so I think that is
nice<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.610> if<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:35.970> like<00:03:36.300> one<00:03:36.510> of<00:03:36.630> these<00:03:36.750> on<00:03:36.930> you

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
nice and if you like one of these on you

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.980 
nice and if you like one of these on you
would<00:03:37.230> rather<00:03:37.530> have<00:03:37.710> one<00:03:38.130> of<00:03:38.250> these<00:03:38.400> as<00:03:38.990> your

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
would rather have one of these as your

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.160 
would rather have one of these as your
homescreen<00:03:40.560> just<00:03:40.860> do<00:03:41.100> a<00:03:41.130> long<00:03:41.400> tab<00:03:41.900> when<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:43.020> is

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
homescreen just do a long tab when it is

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.710 
homescreen just do a long tab when it is
expanded<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:44.180> just<00:03:45.180> set<00:03:45.360> that<00:03:45.540> as<00:03:45.690> your

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
expanded and just set that as your

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.520 
expanded and just set that as your
homescreen

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
homescreen

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.670 
homescreen
so<00:03:46.740> now<00:03:48.050> could<00:03:49.050> have<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.820> and<00:03:51.110> obviously<00:03:52.110> it

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
so now could have that and obviously it

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.560 
so now could have that and obviously it
doesn't<00:03:52.890> really<00:03:53.130> have<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.520> be<00:03:53.670> about<00:03:53.970> time<00:03:54.330> and

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
doesn't really have to be about time and

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.290
