 Hi, I'm like that, and today we're going to 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.850
 prepare a quick easy snack and very 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.730
 original I will use as you see a 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.219
 slice of cheese a carrot a piece 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.869
 of sliced ​​bread and some salad 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.270
 the first thing is to cut the mold bread 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.340
 this one they sell for sandwiches 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.170
 we removed the bark and now with a 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.180
 scissors that is the easiest thing we are going to 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.690
 cut what would be the shell of the 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.100
 chick the bottom oval and 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.840
 Now we are going to make some piquitos or 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.609
 little triangles on top like 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.769
 if the shell had been broken so that 

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:38.420
 come out our chick I'm 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.399
 using a seed bread you can 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.739
 perfectly use a mold bread 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.470

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.250
 Now in a little dish I will place a 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.230
 little bit of salad or any leaf 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.090

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.680
