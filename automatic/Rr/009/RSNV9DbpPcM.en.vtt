00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:07.405
He is one actor whose
mere smile will make you laugh.

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:14.270
And when he becomes silent,
you'll roll with laughter.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.703
Tell me what my name is.
Tell me, tell me.

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:19.757
He is, legendary, Rajendra Nath.

00:00:19.837 --> 00:00:22.554
Note down my name in your diary.
- Shut up.

00:00:23.703 --> 00:00:29.109
"I'll take everybody's problems."

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.623
"I'll give blessings to everyone."

00:00:33.703 --> 00:00:39.447
Rajendra Nath was born on 8th June,
1931 in Tikamgarh state.

00:00:39.527 --> 00:00:42.894
This was the time when
kings ruled Hindustan.

00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:48.057
After India got independence..

00:00:48.137 --> 00:00:50.976
..Tikamgarh became
a part of Madhya Pradesh.

00:00:51.056 --> 00:00:53.543
After all I am the groom's family,
not an undergarment seller.

00:00:53.623 --> 00:00:55.759
If you are groom's family,
then they are royalty.

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:57.989
They'll come to this place?
A place where we sell funeral stuff?

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:00.421
And people roam around half naked.
They'll never come.

00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:02.678
Don't come. I'll go there.

00:01:02.758 --> 00:01:04.394
I don't care for my honor.

00:01:04.474 --> 00:01:09.597
Rajendra Nath's father Kartar Nath
was an IG of police for Rewa sate.

00:01:09.677 --> 00:01:11.597
He had a huge family.

00:01:11.677 --> 00:01:14.043
Eight brothers and four sisters.

00:01:14.123 --> 00:01:16.475
Prem Nath was his eldest brother.

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:19.124
And Rajendra Nath was second.

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:20.421
Uncle is standing on the bench.

00:01:20.501 --> 00:01:22.993
Your father also stood
on this same bench. Come on, go.

00:01:23.073 --> 00:01:26.333
Rajendra Nath completed
his education in Rewa.

00:01:26.413 --> 00:01:28.278
He studied till F.sc over there.

00:01:28.358 --> 00:01:30.917
He intended to become a doctor.

00:01:30.997 --> 00:01:32.766
This business can never die.

00:01:32.846 --> 00:01:35.285
And this business
will flourish in death.

00:01:35.365 --> 00:01:38.898
Lord Krishna said to
Arjun in Ramayan about life.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.707
Life is a beautiful journey. 
No one knows what lies ahead.

00:01:43.787 --> 00:01:47.331
Rajendra Nath was quite close
to his elder brother Prem Nath.

00:01:47.411 --> 00:01:51.396
Prem Nath used to be quite
strict with him when they were kids.

00:01:51.476 --> 00:01:53.726
I heard you're not keeping well?

00:01:54.244 --> 00:01:55.390
No, there's nothing of that sort.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.536
Still, we can never
be sure about life.

00:01:58.022 --> 00:02:00.822
Here's my card.
My rates are reasonable.

00:02:00.902 --> 00:02:03.946
When both these brothers
were studying in St. Jones school..

00:02:04.026 --> 00:02:07.816
..their father used to give
them an Anna for their expenses.

00:02:07.896 --> 00:02:12.529
In those times,
an aana was a big amount for a child.

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:16.788
His elder brother used to fight
with him and take away half his money.

00:02:16.868 --> 00:02:17.762
Don't say anything.

00:02:17.842 --> 00:02:20.476
Or else you'll curse and
I'll be the one to get beatings.

00:02:20.556 --> 00:02:22.357
This went on for some days.

00:02:22.437 --> 00:02:25.773
After that Rajendra Nath
complained to his father..

00:02:25.853 --> 00:02:27.148
..and everything became all right.

00:02:27.228 --> 00:02:31.678
"Big cola, big cola, big cola."

00:02:31.758 --> 00:02:33.429
"Big cola."

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:36.143
His family shifted
to Jabalpur from Rewa.

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:39.040
Elder brother Prem Nath was
not getting along with his father..

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.753
..and he came to Mumbai to
make himself a part of Hindi films.

00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:45.483
Be it jail or hell.

00:02:45.817 --> 00:02:49.169
No power in the world can save
me from empathizing with poor, father.

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.131
On the one hand, Prem Nath
became a part of Prithvi theatre.

00:02:52.211 --> 00:02:54.304
On the other, younger brother
Rajendra Nath also found..

00:02:54.384 --> 00:02:59.234
..Mumbai and thought of
taking admission in a big college.

00:02:59.314 --> 00:03:00.931
But what was destined, happened.

00:03:01.011 --> 00:03:03.429
He became more interested
towards acting..

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:05.883
..and became part of a theatre group.

00:03:05.963 --> 00:03:09.407
He went on to become
a member of Prithvi theatre.

00:03:09.487 --> 00:03:11.422
Can you see how grand my entry is?

00:03:11.502 --> 00:03:14.460
This bag, this procession of mine.
This music band.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.725
Come on, play.

00:03:16.644 --> 00:03:18.168
Mother hasn't come?

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.260
Who would've looked after
the house if mother came?

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.897
Hey!

00:03:21.977 --> 00:03:25.832
This was also the time when he worked
in radio plays for  All India Radio..

00:03:25.912 --> 00:03:28.038
..and Radio Ceylon.

00:03:28.118 --> 00:03:32.006
Cheater! Get out! Get out of here!
- Yes, Mr. Ramdas.

00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:35.411
I am your servant. Ramdas.

00:03:36.417 --> 00:03:40.892
When Rajendra Nath began his
struggle in films, his elder brother..

00:03:40.972 --> 00:03:45.076
..Prem Nath and his wife Veena Rai,
both helped him a lot.

00:03:45.156 --> 00:03:47.336
They gave him a house to stay. Food.

00:03:47.416 --> 00:03:50.266
And most important.
They gave him lots of love.

00:03:50.346 --> 00:03:52.417
Where have you come from?
Where are you staying?

00:03:52.497 --> 00:03:53.973
In a houseboat or a motor boat?

00:03:54.053 --> 00:03:56.178
For how long will you stay here?
Who else is with you?

00:03:56.258 --> 00:03:58.340
Are you alone or you've
brought along your maid as well?

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.151
When will you return?

00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:01.573
What's the hurry? Take a breath.

00:04:01.653 --> 00:04:03.779
I thought I'll ask you in one breath.

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.217
His elder brother also kept trying
to find work for him in big films.

00:04:07.297 --> 00:04:09.400
But success evaded him.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.189
This was also the time when his father
wanted him to return to Jabalpur.

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.244
Whenever anybody from
Jabalpur came to Mumbai..

00:04:16.324 --> 00:04:18.784
..he used to bring his
father's message and say.

00:04:18.864 --> 00:04:22.102
Rajendra Nath,
let's go back to Jabalpur.

00:04:22.182 --> 00:04:23.323
What's in here?

00:04:23.403 --> 00:04:26.566
But Rajendra Nath was adamant.

00:04:26.646 --> 00:04:29.268
I love you. I love you.

00:04:29.571 --> 00:04:32.738
I love you. I love you.

00:04:32.818 --> 00:04:34.955
I love you.

00:04:35.035 --> 00:04:37.453
King Jhootlingam.
- Late of Birmingham.

00:04:37.533 --> 00:04:39.204
Say, love is... 
- Great.

00:04:39.284 --> 00:04:40.847
You will reach the shore.
- Shore?

00:04:40.927 --> 00:04:42.101
You will succeed.
- Oh!

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:46.642
He gradually left his elder brother's 
house and shifted to a small guest house.

00:04:46.722 --> 00:04:49.107
I don't understand what's
happening in this hotel.

00:04:49.572 --> 00:04:51.172
First the way got blocked.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.859
Then the telephone connection was cut.

00:04:53.377 --> 00:04:54.847
And now there's a power cut.

00:04:55.138 --> 00:04:56.598
Hope I don't go next.

00:04:56.678 --> 00:04:59.344
He used to ride a
scooter in those times.

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:03.441
When he achieved success,
he bought a sports car.

00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:06.609
What will you do? Shoot me?
I don't care.

00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:09.149
The God of death had told Savitri.

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.825
Live here, die here.
Where else will you go from here?

00:05:12.905 --> 00:05:15.733
He kept doing small and
big roles in small and big films.

00:05:15.813 --> 00:05:18.662
Like Shararat,
Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja..

00:05:18.742 --> 00:05:20.986
..Miss India, Hum Sab Chor hain.

00:05:21.066 --> 00:05:23.418
But wasn't getting any strong roles.

00:05:23.498 --> 00:05:27.613
Then his elder brother
Prem Nath decided to make a film.

00:05:27.693 --> 00:05:30.316
He named it Prisoner of Golconda.

00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:34.144
Prem Nath was the hero of this
film and Rajendra Nath, a side hero.

00:05:34.224 --> 00:05:36.695
Aga played the role of a comedian.

00:05:36.775 --> 00:05:40.079
There were a lot of expectations from 
this film, but this film didn't work.

00:05:41.961 --> 00:05:44.447
What is this?
- Your death.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.150
Come later. I don't have time.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.367
Then came a film which
changed Rajendra Nath's destiny.

00:05:51.447 --> 00:05:55.896
This film was Dil Deke Dekho, 
which was made by Naseer Hussain.

00:05:55.976 --> 00:05:58.794
Then came Jab Pyar Kisise Hota Hai.

00:05:58.874 --> 00:06:01.367
This film was also
made by Naseer Hussain.

00:06:01.447 --> 00:06:04.297
In 35 mm.
How does this nose look?

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.951
In 35 mm.
How do these eyes look?

00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:10.330
From there I pull back and I go down.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.671
What a lovely figure?

00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:14.059
He played the role of Popatlal
and this character became..

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.865
..so famous that this
name remained with him.

00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:21.895
Whenever he went abroad,
people used to call him Popatlal.

00:06:21.975 --> 00:06:25.289
My child. My baby.

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:26.857
Help!

00:06:26.937 --> 00:06:28.716
Leave me!

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.369
It's a matter of my dignity.

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:33.580
Rajendra Nath was a very
good friend of Shammi Kapoor.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.672
He also became his relative,
because Raj Kapoor..

00:06:36.752 --> 00:06:39.050
..got married to his sister, Krishna.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.321
In this way, Rajendra Nath is the
maternal uncle of Randheer Kapoor..

00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:45.926
..Rishi Kapoor and Rajeev Kapoor.

00:06:46.006 --> 00:06:47.752
Wow! Wow!

00:06:48.066 --> 00:06:51.147
God has spent a lot
of time sculpting this face.

00:06:51.227 --> 00:06:55.147
Be it colored films or black
and white, he always made us laugh.

00:06:55.227 --> 00:06:58.207
But one accident put
him in a worse condition.

00:06:58.401 --> 00:07:00.423
He was once driving his car.

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:03.180
He was accompanied with
his comedian friend Birbal..

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.585
..and his manager.

00:07:04.665 --> 00:07:09.331
Both of them fell asleep,
and Rajendra Nath also fell asleep.

00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:12.618
The car banged into a truck.

00:07:14.672 --> 00:07:16.888
It was good fortune that
the three of them were saved.

00:07:16.968 --> 00:07:20.217
He showed such great timing
in comedy that no actor..

00:07:20.297 --> 00:07:22.087
..even reached anywhere near him.

00:07:22.167 --> 00:07:24.304
One can surely say that..

00:07:24.384 --> 00:07:28.964
..Rajendra Nath's mere entry
into the scene made you laugh.

00:07:29.044 --> 00:07:31.958
Wow! Wow!
You look awesome.

00:07:32.272 --> 00:07:35.753
It seems as if the moon is
applying makeup in the makeup room.

00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:37.667
I am mad?
- Yes, you're mad.

00:07:38.002 --> 00:07:38.910
Your father's mad.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.422
I have two more bottles.

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:42.455
Let's both gulp them down
and pass out. Then we'll be safe.

00:07:42.535 --> 00:07:47.525
But 13th February 2008 
came as a different day.

00:07:47.605 --> 00:07:50.780
An artist who made everyone laugh,
Rajendra Nath..

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.780
..left for the eternal
abode due to a heart attack.

00:07:55.051 --> 00:07:58.856
Rajendra Nath's name will
always be taken with pride in..

00:07:58.936 --> 00:08:01.332
..the history of Indian cinema.
