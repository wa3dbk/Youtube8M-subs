harvesting batwing now there's a bunch
of<00:00:21.840> bats<00:00:22.100> basically<00:00:23.100> on<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.580> north<00:00:24.029> end<00:00:24.180> i'm

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
of bats basically on the north end i'm

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.779 
of bats basically on the north end i'm
sorry<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:25.070> south-southeast<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
sorry the south-southeast of the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.370 
sorry the south-southeast of the
lumbridge<00:00:27.119> catacombs<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.109> want<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.320> go

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
lumbridge catacombs so you want to go

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.570 
lumbridge catacombs so you want to go
all<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.560> way<00:00:28.650> through<00:00:29.010> till<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.279> reach<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
all the way through till you reach the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.310 
all the way through till you reach the
bat<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:30.029> not<00:00:30.240> too<00:00:30.420> far<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.840> distance<00:00:31.199> and

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
bat it's not too far of a distance and

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.560 
bat it's not too far of a distance and
the<00:00:32.070> trips<00:00:32.460> are<00:00:32.610> relatively<00:00:32.969> quickly<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.480> can

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
the trips are relatively quickly you can

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.380 
the trips are relatively quickly you can
normally<00:00:33.750> get<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.380> pretty<00:00:34.890> full<00:00:35.070> inventory

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
normally get a pretty full inventory

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.280 
normally get a pretty full inventory
depending<00:00:36.390> on<00:00:36.390> how<00:00:36.540> fast<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.960> are<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.200> your

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
depending on how fast you are in your

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.319 
depending on how fast you are in your
levels<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.620> course<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.670> matter<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.180> want

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
levels of course in a matter of I want

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.720 
levels of course in a matter of I want
to<00:00:39.390> say<00:00:39.510> six<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.110> 15<00:00:40.559> minutes<00:00:40.739> 15<00:00:41.250> being<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
to say six to 15 minutes 15 being on the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.400 
to say six to 15 minutes 15 being on the
very<00:00:41.940> very<00:00:42.149> slow<00:00:42.390> side<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.870> also<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.290> you're

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
very very slow side and also if you're

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.529 
very very slow side and also if you're
probably<00:00:43.680> not<00:00:43.920> maxed<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.850> also<00:00:45.000> can't<00:00:45.360> bring

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
probably not maxed you also can't bring

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.060 
probably not maxed you also can't bring
a<00:00:45.629> cannon<00:00:45.989> down<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.379> catacombs<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.039> I

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
a cannon down to the catacombs so I

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.639 
a cannon down to the catacombs so I
wouldn't<00:00:47.520> recommend<00:00:47.760> doing<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.719> yet

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
wouldn't recommend doing that and yet

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.860 
wouldn't recommend doing that and yet
we're<00:00:49.770> almost<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.550> there<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.539> go<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:51.809> now

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
we're almost here and there we go so now

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.240 
we're almost here and there we go so now
you<00:00:51.989> see<00:00:52.110> there<00:00:52.289> only<00:00:52.440> level<00:00:52.649> 24<00:00:53.100> they're

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
you see there only level 24 they're

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.799 
you see there only level 24 they're
called<00:00:53.399> warp<00:00:53.670> bats<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.149> they're<00:00:54.539> really<00:00:54.780> easy

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
called warp bats and they're really easy

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.360 
called warp bats and they're really easy
to<00:00:55.079> kill<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.350> see<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.530> get<00:00:55.739> most<00:00:55.920> them<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.250> one

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
to kill you see I get most them in one

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.910 
to kill you see I get most them in one
hit<00:00:56.579> or<00:00:56.789> relatively<00:00:57.510> quickly<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.680> want<00:00:58.829> to

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
hit or relatively quickly and we want to

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.260 
hit or relatively quickly and we want to
pick<00:00:59.010> up<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.219> purple<00:00:59.609> drafts<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.059> see<00:01:00.180> on

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
pick up the purple drafts that we see on

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.880 
pick up the purple drafts that we see on
the<00:01:00.359> floor<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:00.989> see<00:01:01.199> pretty<00:01:01.469> much<00:01:01.590> one

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
the floor so you can see pretty much one

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:02.990 
the floor so you can see pretty much one
hitting<00:01:02.129> these<00:01:02.250> things<00:01:02.460> for<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.670> most<00:01:02.820> part

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
hitting these things for the most part

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.700 
hitting these things for the most part
you<00:01:03.570> don't<00:01:03.719> even<00:01:03.809> need<00:01:03.960> momentum<00:01:04.229> by<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.559> way

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
you don't even need momentum by the way

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.850 
you don't even need momentum by the way
so<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:05.220> pretty<00:01:05.880> fast<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:07.170> three<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.439> mean<00:01:07.650> it's

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
so it's pretty fast so three I mean it's

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.460 
so it's pretty fast so three I mean it's
also<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.159> common<00:01:08.610> drop<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.030> not<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.630> not

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
also a common drop it's not a it's not

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.310 
also a common drop it's not a it's not
an<00:01:10.710> every<00:01:11.189> time<00:01:11.369> drop<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:12.720> let's<00:01:12.930> go<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.170> got<00:01:13.290> a

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
an every time drop so let's go we got a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.580 
an every time drop so let's go we got a
couple<00:01:13.530> more<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.600> also<00:01:15.600> you'll<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.439> saw

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
couple more and also you'll just saw

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.230 
couple more and also you'll just saw
just<00:01:16.979> as<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.130> reminder<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.460> want<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.030> pick<00:01:18.210> up

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
just as a reminder you want to pick up

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.870 
just as a reminder you want to pick up
the<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.140> water<00:01:19.979> talismans<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.520> are<00:01:20.670> drop

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
the the water talismans that are drop

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.630 
the the water talismans that are drop
those<00:01:21.570> are<00:01:21.720> also<00:01:21.840> worth<00:01:22.110> around<00:01:22.430> 4,000<00:01:23.430> or<00:01:23.490> so

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
those are also worth around 4,000 or so

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.660 
those are also worth around 4,000 or so
and<00:01:23.850> for<00:01:24.720> some<00:01:24.900> reason<00:01:24.930> I'm<00:01:25.229> going<00:01:25.490> dry<00:01:26.490> right

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and for some reason I'm going dry right

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.569 
and for some reason I'm going dry right
now<00:01:26.700> but<00:01:27.060> you'll<00:01:27.299> see<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.630> second<00:01:28.400> all<00:01:29.400> right

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
now but you'll see in a second all right

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.910 
now but you'll see in a second all right
one<00:01:29.820> more<00:01:29.850> kill<00:01:30.270> there<00:01:31.049> we<00:01:31.140> go<00:01:31.290> all<00:01:31.680> right<00:01:31.770> so

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
one more kill there we go all right so

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.090 
one more kill there we go all right so
you<00:01:31.979> got<00:01:32.130> bat<00:01:32.340> annoying<00:01:32.610> right<00:01:32.759> there<00:01:33.439> now<00:01:34.439> let

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
you got bat annoying right there now let

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.880 
you got bat annoying right there now let
me<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.280> do<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.400> quick<00:01:35.640> price<00:01:35.939> check<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.150> this

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
me just do a quick price check on this

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.569 
me just do a quick price check on this
now<00:01:37.890> you're<00:01:37.979> going<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.159> see<00:01:38.220> it's<00:01:38.310> going<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.460> be

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
now you're going to see it's going to be

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.069 
now you're going to see it's going to be
actually<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.850> lot<00:01:39.030> lower<00:01:39.270> than<00:01:39.570> what<00:01:39.990> it

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
actually a lot lower than what it

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.240 
actually a lot lower than what it
actually<00:01:40.110> sells<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.619> stuff<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:40.950> here<00:01:41.130> it's

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
actually sells for stuff in here it's

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.130 
actually sells for stuff in here it's
for<00:01:41.430> 1100<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.479> actually<00:01:42.600> sells<00:01:42.899> for<00:01:43.079> a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
for 1100 but it actually sells for a

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.630 
for 1100 but it actually sells for a
little<00:01:43.380> over<00:01:43.530> seven<00:01:43.890> thousand<00:01:44.220> at<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.399> moment

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
little over seven thousand at the moment

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.499 
little over seven thousand at the moment
i'm<00:01:44.700> going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.909> show<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.030> guys<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.329> end<00:01:45.450> of

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
i'm going to show you guys the end of

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.609 
i'm going to show you guys the end of
the<00:01:45.570> video<00:01:45.659> when<00:01:45.930> i<00:01:45.960> gather<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.320> little<00:01:46.530> bit

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the video when i gather a little bit

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.319 
the video when i gather a little bit
more<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.920> i'm<00:01:47.640> going<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.790> quickly<00:01:47.880> get<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.180> full

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
more and i'm going to quickly get a full

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.569 
more and i'm going to quickly get a full
inventory<00:01:48.540> then<00:01:48.899> i'll<00:01:48.990> continue<00:01:49.200> recording

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
inventory then i'll continue recording

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.740 
inventory then i'll continue recording
now<00:01:50.579> again<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.970> don't<00:01:51.149> have<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.479> use<00:01:51.600> momentum

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
now again you don't have to use momentum

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.389 
now again you don't have to use momentum
or<00:01:52.170> pot<00:01:52.409> up<00:01:52.560> because<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.979> will<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:53.250> one

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
or pot up because you will be one

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.800 
or pot up because you will be one
hitting<00:01:53.610> most<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.909> these<00:01:53.970> things<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.659> does

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
hitting most of these things but it does

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.539 
hitting most of these things but it does
help<00:01:54.960> for<00:01:55.200> lower<00:01:55.320> levels<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.799> also<00:01:56.250> if<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.430> do

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
help for lower levels and also if you do

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.459 
help for lower levels and also if you do
have<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> full<00:01:56.880> ability<00:01:57.270> bar<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:58.020> little<00:01:58.350> bit

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
have a full ability bar that little bit

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.929 
have a full ability bar that little bit
of<00:01:58.500> extra<00:01:58.619> effort<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.100> use<00:01:59.310> momentum<00:01:59.520> will

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
of extra effort to use momentum will

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.639 
of extra effort to use momentum will
help<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.240> get<00:02:00.390> maybe<00:02:00.570> 10<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.079> 20<00:02:01.320> second

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
help you get maybe 10 to 20 second

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.499 
help you get maybe 10 to 20 second
faster<00:02:01.920> trips<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.820> worth<00:02:02.969> using<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.479> a

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
faster trips so it is worth using to a

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.600 
faster trips so it is worth using to a
small<00:02:03.780> extent<00:02:04.049> also<00:02:04.320> this<00:02:05.100> was<00:02:05.219> relatively

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
small extent also this was relatively

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.340 
small extent also this was relatively
ass<00:02:05.790> little<00:02:06.000> trip<00:02:06.180> for<00:02:06.329> me<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.869> took<00:02:07.020> me<00:02:07.170> about

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
ass little trip for me it took me about

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.139 
ass little trip for me it took me about
eight<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.190> half<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.520> nine<00:02:08.550> minutes<00:02:09.000> for<00:02:09.090> me

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
eight and a half to nine minutes for me

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.609 
eight and a half to nine minutes for me
to<00:02:09.179> get<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.390> full<00:02:09.539> inventory<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:10.020> normally<00:02:10.440> do<00:02:10.530> it

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
to get a full inventory I normally do it

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.110 
to get a full inventory I normally do it
a<00:02:10.649> little<00:02:10.860> bit<00:02:11.009> faster<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.400> normally<00:02:11.760> do<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:11.970> I

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
a little bit faster I normally do it I

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.760 
a little bit faster I normally do it I
want<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.540> say<00:02:12.629> around<00:02:12.810> five<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.200> seven<00:02:13.470> minutes

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
want to say around five to seven minutes

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.710 
want to say around five to seven minutes
but<00:02:14.130> again<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> big<00:02:14.970> range<00:02:15.210> they<00:02:15.420> do<00:02:15.480> have

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
but again it is a big range they do have

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.270 
but again it is a big range they do have
a<00:02:15.750> once<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.110> fort<00:02:16.350> so<00:02:16.440> once<00:02:16.620> five<00:02:16.800> drop<00:02:17.070> rate

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
a once a fort so once five drop rate

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.340 
a once a fort so once five drop rate
also<00:02:17.460> there<00:02:18.240> are<00:02:18.270> other<00:02:18.660> videos<00:02:19.020> with<00:02:19.230> the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
also there are other videos with the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.110 
also there are other videos with the
same<00:02:19.560> method<00:02:19.920> however<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.310> haven't<00:02:20.820> seen<00:02:20.970> any

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
same method however I haven't seen any

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.480 
same method however I haven't seen any
of<00:02:21.270> this<00:02:21.450> location<00:02:21.750> just<00:02:22.050> yet<00:02:22.350> so<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.980> think

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
of this location just yet so I think

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.040 
of this location just yet so I think
this<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.850> fastest<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.330> my<00:02:24.450> knowledge<00:02:24.660> and

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
this is the fastest to my knowledge and

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.180 
this is the fastest to my knowledge and
we're<00:02:25.380> going<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.560> get<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.740> dilute<00:02:25.950> right<00:02:26.070> now

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
we're going to get to dilute right now

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.010 
we're going to get to dilute right now
I'm<00:02:26.850> at<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.120> grand<00:02:27.330> exchange<00:02:27.510> now<00:02:27.810> with<00:02:27.990> a

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
I'm at the grand exchange now with a

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.660 
I'm at the grand exchange now with a
full<00:02:28.230> inventory<00:02:28.470> minus<00:02:28.950> my<00:02:29.070> teles<00:02:29.370> over<00:02:29.520> here

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
full inventory minus my teles over here

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.650 
full inventory minus my teles over here
so<00:02:29.760> I'm<00:02:29.820> just<00:02:29.910> going<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.090> quickly<00:02:30.240> add<00:02:30.480> them

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
so I'm just going to quickly add them

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.810 
so I'm just going to quickly add them
all<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.130> we're<00:02:32.130> going<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.280> see<00:02:32.460> that<00:02:32.580> they<00:02:32.670> out

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
all and we're going to see that they out

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.850 
all and we're going to see that they out
again<00:02:33.120> they<00:02:33.360> come<00:02:33.540> out<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.780> 1100<00:02:34.440> which<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.740> the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
again they come out to 1100 which is the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.070 
again they come out to 1100 which is the
mid<00:02:35.010> but<00:02:35.250> it's<00:02:35.400> not<00:02:35.550> accurate<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.420> all<00:02:36.600> you

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
mid but it's not accurate so so all you

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.970 
mid but it's not accurate so so all you
don't<00:02:37.170> need<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.380> really<00:02:37.560> raise<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.710> price

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
don't need to really raise the price

now right here and you can see wait

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.650 
now right here and you can see wait
where<00:03:32.730> is<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:32.850> let<00:03:33.030> me<00:03:33.120> just<00:03:33.270> go<00:03:33.390> to<00:03:33.480> all<00:03:33.630> right

where is it let me just go to all right

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.690 
where is it let me just go to all right
here<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.110> you<00:03:34.650> can<00:03:34.740> see<00:03:34.860> I<00:03:34.890> just<00:03:35.160> gained<00:03:35.340> 60

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
here and you can see I just gained 60

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.250 
here and you can see I just gained 60
thousand<00:03:36.030> coins<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:36.360> if<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:36.630> buy<00:03:36.840> them<00:03:37.080> for

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
thousand coins so if you buy them for

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.990 
thousand coins so if you buy them for
much<00:03:37.320> less<00:03:37.770> you<00:03:38.400> can<00:03:38.550> actually<00:03:38.670> make<00:03:38.880> some

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
much less you can actually make some

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.640 
much less you can actually make some
pretty<00:03:39.090> good<00:03:39.300> profit<00:03:39.480> i<00:03:39.720> think<00:03:39.990> the<00:03:40.140> limit<00:03:40.470> is

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
pretty good profit i think the limit is

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.390 
pretty good profit i think the limit is
100<00:03:41.280> per<00:03:42.180> hours<00:03:42.510> for<00:03:43.170> four<00:03:43.350> hours<00:03:43.380> or<00:03:43.709> so<00:03:43.830> so

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
100 per hours for four hours or so so

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
100 per hours for four hours or so so
you<00:03:44.490> can<00:03:44.610> actually<00:03:44.640> make<00:03:44.910> a<00:03:44.940> decent<00:03:45.090> amount<00:03:45.270> of

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
you can actually make a decent amount of

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.650 
you can actually make a decent amount of
money<00:03:46.550> the<00:03:47.550> next<00:03:47.670> money-making<00:03:48.240> method<00:03:48.510> is

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
money the next money-making method is

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.970 
money the next money-making method is
going<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:48.959> be<00:03:49.080> producing<00:03:49.440> swamp<00:03:49.709> seitan

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
going to be producing swamp seitan

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.680 
going to be producing swamp seitan

just<00:04:04.440> takes<00:04:04.770> one<00:04:04.980> now<00:04:05.580> the<00:04:05.640> only<00:04:05.850> thing<00:04:05.940> you

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
just takes one now the only thing you

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.090 
just takes one now the only thing you
need<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.270> do<00:04:06.450> this<00:04:06.570> is<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:06.900> have<00:04:07.050> more<00:04:07.350> than<00:04:07.470> 150

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
need to do this is to have more than 150

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.830 
need to do this is to have more than 150
shards<00:04:08.400> in<00:04:08.550> your<00:04:08.610> inventory<00:04:09.480> so<00:04:09.630> I<00:04:09.660> have<00:04:09.810> a

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
shards in your inventory so I have a

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.960 
shards in your inventory so I have a
thousand<00:04:10.170> right<00:04:10.290> here<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:10.620> i<00:04:11.100> have<00:04:11.130> my<00:04:11.489> swamp

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
thousand right here and i have my swamp

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.490 
thousand right here and i have my swamp
lizards<00:04:12.180> over<00:04:12.390> here<00:04:12.510> now<00:04:12.870> these<00:04:13.020> costs<00:04:13.290> around

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
lizards over here now these costs around

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.500 
lizards over here now these costs around
1300<00:04:14.190> and<00:04:14.340> when<00:04:14.580> you<00:04:14.670> infuse<00:04:15.000> them<00:04:15.120> into<00:04:15.300> swamp

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
1300 and when you infuse them into swamp

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.729 
1300 and when you infuse them into swamp
titan<00:04:15.780> pouches<00:04:16.049> you<00:04:16.140> will<00:04:16.230> be<00:04:16.290> making<00:04:16.380> about<00:04:16.680> a

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
titan pouches you will be making about a

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.440 
titan pouches you will be making about a
thousand<00:04:17.160> profit<00:04:17.430> each<00:04:17.520> so<00:04:18.150> i'm<00:04:18.270> going<00:04:18.390> to

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
thousand profit each so i'm going to

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.490 
thousand profit each so i'm going to
quickly<00:04:18.570> infuse<00:04:18.959> them<00:04:19.080> over<00:04:19.200> here<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.410> you

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
quickly infuse them over here and you

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.599 
quickly infuse them over here and you
can<00:04:19.620> see<00:04:19.770> that<00:04:19.890> it<00:04:19.980> would<00:04:20.070> take<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.250> lot<00:04:20.549> more

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
can see that it would take a lot more

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.430 
can see that it would take a lot more
than<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.000> thousand<00:04:21.419> to<00:04:21.750> infuse<00:04:22.049> all<00:04:22.169> of<00:04:22.290> these

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
than a thousand to infuse all of these

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.200 
than a thousand to infuse all of these
so<00:04:23.280> scurrier<00:04:24.030> select<00:04:24.419> infuse

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
so scurrier select infuse

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.290 
so scurrier select infuse
and<00:04:26.860> there<00:04:27.860> you<00:04:27.949> have<00:04:27.979> it<00:04:28.100> well<00:04:28.940> he's<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.120> only

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
and there you have it well he's the only

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.490 
and there you have it well he's the only
six<00:04:29.600> were<00:04:29.690> taken<00:04:29.930> out<00:04:30.020> but<00:04:30.139> let<00:04:30.229> me<00:04:30.259> do<00:04:30.380> that

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
six were taken out but let me do that

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.820 
six were taken out but let me do that
again<00:04:30.530> I<00:04:30.830> didn't<00:04:31.160> press<00:04:31.759> infuse<00:04:32.150> all<00:04:32.650> one<00:04:33.650> more

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
again I didn't press infuse all one more

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.469 
again I didn't press infuse all one more
time<00:04:34.069> I<00:04:35.740> think<00:04:36.740> that<00:04:36.860> should<00:04:37.009> work<00:04:37.330> for<00:04:38.330> some

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
time I think that should work for some

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:39.430 
time I think that should work for some
reasons<00:04:38.720> only<00:04:38.810> doing<00:04:39.050> five<00:04:39.199> at<00:04:39.349> a<00:04:39.380> time

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
reasons only doing five at a time

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.890 
reasons only doing five at a time
because<00:04:40.310> i'm<00:04:40.729> kind<00:04:41.030> of<00:04:41.090> a<00:04:41.180> new<00:04:41.330> but<00:04:41.509> the<00:04:41.599> system

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
because i'm kind of a new but the system

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.870 
because i'm kind of a new but the system
i<00:04:41.960> guess<00:04:42.169> but<00:04:42.919> yeah<00:04:43.310> there<00:04:43.550> you<00:04:43.610> have<00:04:43.759> it<00:04:43.789> i

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
i guess but yeah there you have it i

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.800 
i guess but yeah there you have it i
think<00:04:46.880> that<00:04:47.000> might<00:04:47.090> be<00:04:47.150> another<00:04:47.419> good<00:04:47.569> because

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
think that might be another good because

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.499 
think that might be another good because
it<00:04:47.900> did<00:04:48.169> say<00:04:48.380> that<00:04:48.560> it<00:04:48.710> was<00:04:48.889> it<00:04:49.280> did<00:04:49.970> say<00:04:50.120> seven

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509 
it did say that it was it did say seven

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:53.439 
it did say that it was it did say seven
like<00:04:50.630> it<00:04:50.720> says<00:04:50.900> seven<00:04:51.199> over<00:04:51.349> here<00:04:52.300> but<00:04:53.300> it's

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
like it says seven over here but it's

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.719 
like it says seven over here but it's
only<00:04:53.599> doing<00:04:53.900> six<00:04:54.139> at<00:04:54.259> a<00:04:54.289> time<00:04:54.349> anyway<00:04:54.889> with

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
only doing six at a time anyway with

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.480 
only doing six at a time anyway with
this<00:04:55.849> method<00:04:56.090> you<00:04:56.449> can<00:04:56.599> do<00:04:56.750> roughly<00:04:57.110> I<00:04:57.470> want<00:04:58.400> to

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
this method you can do roughly I want to

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.189 
this method you can do roughly I want to
say<00:04:58.610> six<00:04:58.970> thousand<00:04:59.389> charms<00:04:59.509> per<00:04:59.780> hour<00:04:59.900> it

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
say six thousand charms per hour it

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.689 
say six thousand charms per hour it
might<00:05:00.560> change<00:05:00.800> with<00:05:01.039> the<00:05:01.099> in<00:05:01.220> with<00:05:01.580> the

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
might change with the in with the

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.730 
might change with the in with the
interface<00:05:02.180> over<00:05:02.389> here<00:05:02.570> before<00:05:03.169> I<00:05:03.199> was<00:05:03.440> doing

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
interface over here before I was doing

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.439 
interface over here before I was doing
around<00:05:03.949> i<00:05:04.190> want<00:05:04.430> to<00:05:04.490> say<00:05:04.580> 10,000<00:05:05.240> per<00:05:05.330> hour

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
around i want to say 10,000 per hour

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.240 
around i want to say 10,000 per hour
it's<00:05:05.750> another<00:05:05.900> method<00:05:06.229> i<00:05:06.289> saw<00:05:06.500> al<00:05:06.650> can<00:05:06.830> use<00:05:06.979> and

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
it's another method i saw al can use and

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.670 
it's another method i saw al can use and
yeah<00:05:08.210> if<00:05:08.360> it's<00:05:08.539> 10,000<00:05:09.080> per<00:05:09.169> hour<00:05:09.289> this<00:05:09.500> is<00:05:09.650> a

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
yeah if it's 10,000 per hour this is a

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.770 
yeah if it's 10,000 per hour this is a
10<00:05:10.039> million<00:05:10.280> per<00:05:10.729> hour<00:05:10.880> method<00:05:11.180> assuming<00:05:11.720> you

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
10 million per hour method assuming you

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.210 
10 million per hour method assuming you
have<00:05:11.900> enough<00:05:12.110> crimson<00:05:12.440> charms<00:05:12.650> to<00:05:12.770> do<00:05:12.860> it<00:05:12.979> if

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
have enough crimson charms to do it if

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.570 
have enough crimson charms to do it if
it<00:05:13.940> is<00:05:14.090> less<00:05:14.360> than<00:05:14.389> if<00:05:14.720> it<00:05:14.840> basically<00:05:15.169> it's<00:05:15.349> a

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
it is less than if it basically it's a

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.620 
it is less than if it basically it's a
i'd<00:05:16.580> say<00:05:16.729> realistically<00:05:17.060> you'll<00:05:17.389> probably

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
i'd say realistically you'll probably

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.140 
i'd say realistically you'll probably
get<00:05:17.810> around<00:05:18.020> five<00:05:18.229> to<00:05:18.409> six<00:05:18.650> but<00:05:19.520> oh<00:05:19.550> yeah<00:05:19.669> it's

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
get around five to six but oh yeah it's

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.580 
get around five to six but oh yeah it's
a<00:05:20.210> pretty<00:05:20.330> phenomenal<00:05:20.599> method<00:05:21.110> it's<00:05:21.259> probably

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
a pretty phenomenal method it's probably

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.200 
a pretty phenomenal method it's probably
going<00:05:21.710> to<00:05:21.800> get<00:05:21.860> patched<00:05:22.099> soon<00:05:22.340> as<00:05:22.520> for<00:05:23.120> the

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
going to get patched soon as for the

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.520 
going to get patched soon as for the
other<00:05:23.419> money<00:05:23.630> making<00:05:23.930> methods<00:05:24.020> these<00:05:24.380> are<00:05:24.500> all

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
other money making methods these are all

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.379 
other money making methods these are all
probably<00:05:24.860> going<00:05:25.130> to<00:05:25.190> be<00:05:25.310> a<00:05:25.340> little<00:05:25.880> bit<00:05:26.060> well<00:05:26.360> a

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
probably going to be a little bit well a

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:28.420 
probably going to be a little bit well a
lot<00:05:26.599> lower<00:05:26.840> because<00:05:27.680> these<00:05:27.830> are<00:05:27.949> all<00:05:28.099> new<00:05:28.130> to

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
lot lower because these are all new to

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.339 
lot lower because these are all new to
the<00:05:28.490> game<00:05:28.699> and<00:05:28.880> it's<00:05:29.539> not<00:05:29.720> necessarily<00:05:29.870> as<00:05:30.289> a

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
the game and it's not necessarily as a

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:31.870 
the game and it's not necessarily as a
result<00:05:30.650> of<00:05:30.710> this<00:05:30.830> money<00:05:31.070> making<00:05:31.370> guide<00:05:31.400> being
