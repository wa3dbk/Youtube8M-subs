00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
since I only have two so let's do this

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.490 
since I only have two so let's do this
this<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.970> tag<00:01:27.420> team<00:01:28.220> so<00:01:29.450> let's<00:01:30.450> use<00:01:30.869> my<00:01:31.200> gold

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
this is a tag team so let's use my gold

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.590 
this is a tag team so let's use my gold
dust<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.130> my<00:01:32.280> fully<00:01:32.610> trained<00:01:33.000> edge<00:01:33.680> and<00:01:35.600> we

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
dust and my fully trained edge and we

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.190 
dust and my fully trained edge and we
don't<00:01:37.020> do<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.970> what's<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.180> called<00:01:39.240> alignment

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
don't do the what's it called alignment

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.060 
don't do the what's it called alignment
thing<00:01:41.189> correctly<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:43.290> lose<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.829> Matt

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
thing correctly but so we lose to Matt

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.660 
thing correctly but so we lose to Matt
that<00:01:44.430> match<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:45.689> we<00:01:45.840> win<00:01:46.079> mr.<00:01:46.799> McCracken

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
that match can we win mr. McCracken

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.390 
that match can we win mr. McCracken
and<00:01:48.210> now<00:01:48.659> we<00:01:48.720> can't<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.650> we're<00:01:49.860> going<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.250> lose

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
and now we can't so we're going to lose

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.499 
and now we can't so we're going to lose
this<00:01:50.640> game<00:01:51.229> but<00:01:52.229> we<00:01:52.740> do<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:54.119> dummies

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
this game but we do have the dummies

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.969 
this game but we do have the dummies
that<00:01:54.720> we<00:01:54.869> will<00:01:55.140> have<00:01:55.170> exactly<00:01:55.790> 25<00:01:56.790> draft<00:01:57.240> picks

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
that we will have exactly 25 draft picks

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.920 
that we will have exactly 25 draft picks
so<00:01:58.979> we<00:01:59.130> could<00:01:59.340> do<00:01:59.490> our<00:01:59.520> draft<00:02:00.060> pick<00:02:00.360> opening

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
so we could do our draft pick opening

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.639 
so we could do our draft pick opening
and<00:02:01.200> also<00:02:02.130> I'm<00:02:02.340> not<00:02:02.520> going<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.759> put<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.690> game

same<00:02:25.230> player<00:02:25.560> in<00:02:25.769> a<00:02:25.860> row<00:02:26.040> okay<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:29.250> I'm<00:02:29.730> going

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
same player in a row okay so I'm going

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.030 
same player in a row okay so I'm going
to<00:02:29.910> take<00:02:30.480> this<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.750> little<00:02:30.930> slowly<00:02:31.470> because

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
to take this a little slowly because

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.280 
to take this a little slowly because
there's<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:32.970> higher<00:02:33.209> chance<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.720> getting<00:02:34.049> rares

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
there's a higher chance of getting rares

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:41.900 
there's a higher chance of getting rares
in<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:34.769> game<00:02:35.130> than<00:02:35.370> my<00:02:35.730> NBA<00:02:36.060> 2k14<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:41.370> we<00:02:41.670> get

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
in this game than my NBA 2k14 and we get

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.479 
in this game than my NBA 2k14 and we get
an<00:02:42.120> energy<00:02:42.360> but<00:02:43.110> in<00:02:43.319> this<00:02:43.530> game<00:02:43.739> once<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.310> get

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
an energy but in this game once you get

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.220 
an energy but in this game once you get
an<00:02:44.580> energy<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:45.150> doesn't<00:02:45.569> clear<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.870> board<00:02:46.049> it

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
an energy it doesn't clear the board it

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.120 
an energy it doesn't clear the board it

Erick Rowan 92 power 92 toughness 82

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.190 
Erick Rowan 92 power 92 toughness 82
speed<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.859> I<00:02:59.010> realized<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.579> the<00:03:00.269> CH<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.989> does

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
speed and I realized that the CH a does

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.289 
speed and I realized that the CH a does
not<00:03:01.410> mean<00:03:01.650> challenge<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.280> means<00:03:02.459> charisma<00:03:03.030> so

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
not mean challenge it means charisma so

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.220 
not mean challenge it means charisma so
98<00:03:04.019> parisa<00:03:04.760> so<00:03:05.760> we<00:03:05.970> still<00:03:06.180> have<00:03:06.239> 17<00:03:06.780> draft

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
98 parisa so we still have 17 draft

picks<00:03:07.500> left<00:03:07.769> hopefully<00:03:08.269> we<00:03:09.269> can<00:03:09.480> get<00:03:09.600> an<00:03:09.720> offer

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
picks left hopefully we can get an offer

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.130 
picks left hopefully we can get an offer
bare<00:03:10.230> not<00:03:10.950> expecting<00:03:11.519> another<00:03:11.670> one<00:03:12.180> but<00:03:12.989> I'll

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
bare not expecting another one but I'll

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.900 
bare not expecting another one but I'll
be<00:03:13.290> cool<00:03:13.530> if<00:03:13.620> we<00:03:13.709> can<00:03:14.010> hear<00:03:14.370> we<00:03:14.519> getting<00:03:14.790> our

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.050 
be cool if we can hear we getting our
energy<00:03:15.560> but<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.680> do<00:03:16.799> think<00:03:17.250> that's<00:03:17.459> a<00:03:17.730> bad<00:03:17.850> idea

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
energy but I do think that's a bad idea

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.490 
energy but I do think that's a bad idea
for<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.600> game<00:03:18.870> where<00:03:19.680> unlike<00:03:20.630> my<00:03:21.630> NBA<00:03:21.930> 2k14

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
for this game where unlike my NBA 2k14

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.130 
for this game where unlike my NBA 2k14
if<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.220> don't<00:03:23.400> have<00:03:23.549> enough<00:03:23.670> energies<00:03:24.420> after

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
if you don't have enough energies after

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.870 
if you don't have enough energies after
each<00:03:25.350> quick<00:03:25.620> game<00:03:25.859> you<00:03:25.980> get<00:03:26.160> one<00:03:26.430> they<00:03:26.670> should

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
each quick game you get one they should

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.150 
each quick game you get one they should
do<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.269> here<00:03:27.660> too<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.230> here<00:03:28.620> we<00:03:28.799> get<00:03:28.980> an
