tricks so the first tip or trick is that

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.429 
tricks so the first tip or trick is that
if<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.099> shoot<00:00:26.399> an<00:00:26.579> arrow<00:00:26.820> through<00:00:27.300> wafaa<00:00:27.689> it

if you shoot an arrow through wafaa it

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.830 
if you shoot an arrow through wafaa it
will<00:00:28.919> give<00:00:29.129> you<00:00:29.309> a<00:00:29.340> flame<00:00:30.000> arrow<00:00:30.270> most<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
will give you a flame arrow most of the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.740 
will give you a flame arrow most of the
time<00:00:31.020> now<00:00:31.169> sometimes<00:00:31.739> it<00:00:31.919> will<00:00:32.099> not<00:00:32.369> work<00:00:32.750> as

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
time now sometimes it will not work as

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.630 
time now sometimes it will not work as
you<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:33.989> see<00:00:34.170> there<00:00:34.379> it<00:00:34.500> did<00:00:34.739> indeed<00:00:34.920> work<00:00:35.160> no

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
you can see there it did indeed work no

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.220 
you can see there it did indeed work no
one<00:00:35.820> else<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.300> server<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.930> they<00:00:37.050> did

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
one else is on the server so they did

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.760 
one else is on the server so they did
not<00:00:37.379> say<00:00:37.590> anything<00:00:37.770> on<00:00:37.980> fire<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:39.480> next<00:00:39.989> one<00:00:40.199> so

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
not say anything on fire and next one so

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.610 
not say anything on fire and next one so
the<00:00:40.890> next<00:00:40.920> one<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.699> if<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.090> say<00:00:42.930> your<00:00:43.170> say

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the next one is that if you say your say

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.900 
the next one is that if you say your say
this<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.190> underground<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.239> run<00:00:45.510> into

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
this is underground and you run into

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.080 
this is underground and you run into
gravel<00:00:47.910> if<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.980> break<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.250> bottom<00:00:50.610> block<00:00:50.880> of

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
gravel if you break the bottom block of

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.790 
gravel if you break the bottom block of
the<00:00:51.210> gravel<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:51.930> quickly<00:00:52.260> place<00:00:52.770> a

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
the gravel and then quickly place a

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.490 
the gravel and then quickly place a
torch<00:00:53.100> under<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:54.120> blocks<00:00:54.540> all<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:55.200> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
torch under it it blocks all of the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.229 
torch under it it blocks all of the
gravel<00:00:55.890> off<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.309> breaks<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.640> all<00:00:56.850> very

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
gravel off and breaks it all very

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.150 
gravel off and breaks it all very
quickly<00:00:57.540> so<00:00:58.470> I<00:00:58.500> think<00:00:58.649> that's<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.070> little

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
quickly so I think that's a little

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.500 
quickly so I think that's a little
culture<00:00:59.489> and<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:01.079> next<00:01:01.290> one<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:02.640> if<00:01:02.850> you

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
culture and the next one is that if you

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.950 
culture and the next one is that if you
have<00:01:03.540> to<00:01:03.989> tout<00:01:04.259> if<00:01:04.829> you<00:01:05.189> are<00:01:05.460> flying<00:01:05.719> you<00:01:06.719> break

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
have to tout if you are flying you break

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.260 
have to tout if you are flying you break
flop<00:01:07.320> blocks<00:01:07.890> faster<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.670> for<00:01:08.880> creative

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
flop blocks faster this is for creative

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.330 
flop blocks faster this is for creative
mode<00:01:09.479> only<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:10.350> if<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.530> are<00:01:10.560> flying<00:01:10.890> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
mode only but if you are flying and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.139 
mode only but if you are flying and
falling<00:01:12.140> in<00:01:13.140> creative<00:01:13.770> mode<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.159> break<00:01:14.819> box

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
falling in creative mode the break box

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.959 
falling in creative mode the break box
faster<00:01:15.749> so<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.799> first<00:01:17.069> tower<00:01:17.459> I'm<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:17.880> to

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
faster so the first tower I'm going to

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:22.580 
faster so the first tower I'm going to
break<00:01:18.209> without<00:01:18.689> flying<00:01:19.259> or<00:01:20.100> falling<00:01:21.499> so<00:01:22.499> you

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
break without flying or falling so you

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.919 
break without flying or falling so you
can<00:01:22.859> see<00:01:23.039> here<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.819> still<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.149> very<00:01:24.509> fast

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
can see here it's still a very fast

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:28.669 
can see here it's still a very fast
speed<00:01:25.319> but<00:01:26.039> definitely<00:01:26.579> not<00:01:26.819> as<00:01:26.880> fast<00:01:27.359> as<00:01:27.779> um

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
speed but definitely not as fast as um

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:31.849 
speed but definitely not as fast as um
is<00:01:29.329> what<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.479> tap<00:01:30.719> is<00:01:30.959> with<00:01:31.380> when<00:01:31.679> you're

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:31.859 
is what the tap is with when you're

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.969 
is what the tap is with when you're
flying<00:01:32.670> or<00:01:32.969> falling<00:01:33.289> so<00:01:34.289> you<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.560> see<00:01:34.770> they're

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
flying or falling so you can see they're

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.519 
flying or falling so you can see they're
pretty<00:01:35.279> fast<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:35.759> not<00:01:36.029> as<00:01:36.090> fast<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.929> what<00:01:37.319> I<00:01:37.350> am

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:37.529 
pretty fast but not as fast is what I am

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:39.260 
pretty fast but not as fast is what I am
about<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.069> show<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.369> here<00:01:38.819> if<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.209> ever

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
about to show you here if we can ever

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.089 
about to show you here if we can ever
get<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.719> top<00:01:39.929> any<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.069> um<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:42.950> hold<00:01:43.950> down

00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:44.099 
get to the top any and um just hold down

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:47.929

what<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.789> like<00:01:44.999> to<00:01:45.149> do<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.450> hold<00:01:45.689> down<00:01:45.779> and<00:01:46.939> then

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
what I like to do is hold down and then

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.699 
what I like to do is hold down and then
start<00:01:48.810> flying<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.619> then<00:01:50.520> as<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.789> can<00:01:50.880> see<00:01:51.359> I

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:51.709 
start flying and then as you can see I

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:55.099 
start flying and then as you can see I
stop<00:01:52.709> I<00:01:52.950> stop<00:01:53.369> doing<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.789> sometimes<00:01:54.749> it<00:01:54.959> will

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109
