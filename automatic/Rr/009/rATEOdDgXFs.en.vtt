00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello this is a lion and this is my first 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.970
 custom 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.639
 video programming in pan language 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.590
 in this 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.590
 we will learn how to create dialogues 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.109
 let's start 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.559
 4s type of dialogs first this setinbox 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:28.960
 dialogue containing textual information 

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:30.969
 the second is yn pat dialogs lying 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.869
 text information and input box 

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:35.350
 text 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:38.710
 the third type is a dialogue sheet containing 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.589
 yourself list the fourth type is the last 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.280
 password dialog containing text 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:47.710
 information and text box in 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.809
 Basically the same as the Institute stalemate but 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.710
 this type of dialogue text is encrypted 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.710
 circle 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.500
 Now we analyze the process of creation 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.600
 dialogue 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.980
 example of use when typing a command 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.340
 a dialog box appears with 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.360
 cumulative information for example 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.360
 rule of some process 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.490
 creating a simple dialogue and there are two 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.189
 steps 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.920
 the first step in our case is the creation 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:23.189
 command with the conclusion of the dialogue and the second step 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.560
 from building the very basis of the dialogue function 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:30.149
 so step 1 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.149
 you player commands text and 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:46.040
 mandu and in 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:54.430
 anda let's center text 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.710
 and happen 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:15.620
 i walked 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:19.680
 player dialogue where it 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.740
 dialogue and so in the second dialogue from and 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.660
 dialogue we can do it absolutely any 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.050
 use but the main thing that he was not 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.940
 busy with other dialogue let's then 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.110
 unit 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.470
 the second is wipe this dialogue style i 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.740
 already listed above 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:44.020
 let's use um si ji box 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:47.020
 for this we write the dialogue style um si ji 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.020
 box 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:54.540
 next we give the name of the dialogue information 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:07.660
 the fifth 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:13.940
 walking information itself so 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:21.320
 next 6 we also write 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:25.900
 your quotes and button for example so what 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.900
 the same dispute button for example agrees 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.830
 and here 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:43.540
 than the tank 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:46.220
 and write disagree let's say 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.099
 you can use one button dialogs 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.989
 or two we used 2 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.910
 but if you want to use one then 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.020
 no need to delete quotes just 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.020
 need to delete content 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:08.109
 so now I will close one 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:11.709
 brackets now 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:16.090
 parse step 2 we need to go in he 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:18.000
 dialogue response and as I spoke with 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.430
 him the very basis 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.830
 dialogue 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.259
 three public to write conditional construction 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.639
 in other words, what kind of test 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:33.819
 the dialogue was called out 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.819
 and dialogue for this we write and 

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:43.080
 dialogue it 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:45.389
 and here we write 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.979
 and and dialogue we used we 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.250
 used dialogue 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:52.580
 one 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.580
 close the brackets 

00:04:54.839 --> 00:05:06.879
 now we write inside this this condition 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:15.479
 we write one more condition check on such 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:15.479
 the button is pressed the player is write their response 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:29.300
 so keys 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:33.150
 I agree, and then what action 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:39.110
 there will be action for us if the player clicks on 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:39.110
 agree key we will display the message 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.490

00:05:50.520 --> 00:06:00.500
 thank you all actions after clicking 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:04.050
 consent button we wrote 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:10.620
 now if he pressed the button not 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:17.340
 agree also provided r and let's run 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:27.410
 to them and leave a message 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:33.710
