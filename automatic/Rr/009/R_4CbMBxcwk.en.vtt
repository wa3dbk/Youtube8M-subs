00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
some extra mascara and just I don't

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.160 
some extra mascara and just I don't
really<00:02:38.790> want<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.120> say<00:02:39.299> chunk<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.780> up<00:02:39.870> because

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
really want to say chunk it up because

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.559 
really want to say chunk it up because
that<00:02:40.349> sounds<00:02:40.769> nasty<00:02:41.190> but<00:02:41.489> I<00:02:41.760> guess<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.420> could

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
that sounds nasty but I guess you could

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.539 
that sounds nasty but I guess you could
say<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.870> build<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.379> more<00:02:43.560> mascara<00:02:44.010> up<00:02:44.250> at<00:02:44.400> the

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
say I build the more mascara up at the

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.819 
say I build the more mascara up at the
roots<00:02:44.849> than<00:02:45.269> at<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.629> ends<00:02:45.989> this<00:02:46.319> just<00:02:46.650> gives

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
roots than at the ends this just gives

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.500 
roots than at the ends this just gives
the<00:02:47.040> appearance<00:02:47.459> that<00:02:47.849> you<00:02:47.940> have<00:02:48.150> longer

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
the appearance that you have longer

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.539 
the appearance that you have longer
eyelashes<00:02:49.079> and<00:02:49.290> also<00:02:49.920> may<00:02:50.099> look<00:02:50.250> like<00:02:50.370> you're
