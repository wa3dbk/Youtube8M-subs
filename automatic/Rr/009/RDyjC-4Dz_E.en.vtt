a little buggy you know it's like a

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.959 
a little buggy you know it's like a
giant<00:02:03.570> moving<00:02:03.960> chunk<00:02:04.259> if<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.070> get<00:02:05.310> too<00:02:05.430> close<00:02:05.460> it

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
giant moving chunk if I get too close it

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.490 
giant moving chunk if I get too close it
stops<00:02:06.600> though<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.020> doesn't<00:02:07.259> break<00:02:07.799> up<00:02:09.500> that's

this<00:02:53.070> behind<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.540> be<00:02:55.540> all<00:02:55.720> like<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:55.900> ninja<00:02:56.550> go<00:02:57.550> a

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
this behind it be all like a ninja go a

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.910 
this behind it be all like a ninja go a
little<00:02:57.880> boat<00:02:58.090> go<00:02:58.620> go

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
little boat go go

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.620 
little boat go go
so<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.430> actually<00:03:00.580> runs<00:03:00.820> pretty<00:03:01.030> smooth<00:03:01.330> like<00:03:01.540> I

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
so it actually runs pretty smooth like I

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.120 
so it actually runs pretty smooth like I
think<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:01.900> travels<00:03:02.770> through<00:03:02.800> the<00:03:02.920> water

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
think it travels through the water

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.480 
think it travels through the water
pretty<00:03:03.310> well<00:03:03.580> when<00:03:03.760> it<00:03:03.880> hits<00:03:04.060> land<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.590> uh<00:03:05.920> it

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
pretty well when it hits land and uh it

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.330 
pretty well when it hits land and uh it
reacts<00:03:06.970> well<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:08.590> only<00:03:08.800> problem<00:03:09.070> that<00:03:09.100> I<00:03:09.220> have

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
reacts well the only problem that I have

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.000 
reacts well the only problem that I have
occured<00:03:09.670> that<00:03:09.910> I've<00:03:10.240> seen<00:03:10.480> happen<00:03:10.810> is<00:03:10.959> uh<00:03:11.010> when

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
occured that I've seen happen is uh when

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.270 
occured that I've seen happen is uh when
you<00:03:12.100> press<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.670> think<00:03:13.030> shift<00:03:13.330> it<00:03:14.110> tops<00:03:14.470> tops<00:03:15.070> you

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
you press I think shift it tops tops you

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.270

off<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.610> boat<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:17.230> turns<00:03:17.530> it<00:03:17.709> back<00:03:17.890> into<00:03:18.130> a

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
off the boat and it turns it back into a

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.530 
off the boat and it turns it back into a
solid<00:03:19.209> block<00:03:19.480> like<00:03:20.200> this<00:03:21.150> see<00:03:22.150> it's<00:03:22.420> not

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
moving anymore as you can see before it

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.850 
moving anymore as you can see before it
was<00:03:24.430> like<00:03:24.519> bobbing<00:03:24.940> now<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:26.019> is<00:03:26.140> not<00:03:26.590> moving

but<00:05:46.610> like<00:05:47.330> this<00:05:47.539> boat<00:05:47.779> floats<00:05:48.529> without

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
but like this boat floats without

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.320 
but like this boat floats without
floaters<00:05:49.569> I<00:05:51.339> think<00:05:52.339> you<00:05:52.430> are<00:05:52.639> supposed<00:05:53.150> to<00:05:53.210> be

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
floaters I think you are supposed to be

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.969 
floaters I think you are supposed to be
able<00:05:53.389> to<00:05:53.539> make<00:05:53.659> an<00:05:53.779> air<00:05:54.020> balloon<00:05:54.199> ship<00:05:54.710> type

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
able to make an air balloon ship type

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.929 
able to make an air balloon ship type
thing<00:05:55.189> like<00:05:55.219> a<00:05:55.370> a<00:05:55.699> flying<00:05:56.449> plane<00:05:56.870> that

00:05:57.929 --> 00:05:57.939 
thing like a a flying plane that

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:01.119 
thing like a a flying plane that
operates<00:05:58.939> as<00:05:59.089> a<00:05:59.120> as<00:05:59.539> a<00:05:59.599> plane<00:05:59.930> I<00:06:00.080> guess<00:06:00.289> but<00:06:00.979> um

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:01.129 
operates as a as a plane I guess but um

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:03.939 
operates as a as a plane I guess but um
I<00:06:01.460> don't<00:06:02.449> really<00:06:02.599> think<00:06:02.689> they've<00:06:03.110> updated<00:06:03.469> it

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
that much let me see if this will just

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.589 
that much let me see if this will just
take<00:06:07.189> off<00:06:07.699> I<00:06:08.110> highly<00:06:09.110> doubt<00:06:09.259> it<00:06:09.319> but<00:06:09.589> um<00:06:10.419> yeah<00:06:11.419> I

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599

can't really go anywhere and these

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.890 
can't really go anywhere and these
gauges<00:06:12.919> they<00:06:13.310> just<00:06:13.520> like<00:06:13.639> tell<00:06:13.789> you<00:06:13.909> north<00:06:14.599> and
