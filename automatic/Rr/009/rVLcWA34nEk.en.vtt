00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.319
 hi everyone we find ourselves on 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.550
 Pulte / SIPA 13c and ethics 360 and 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.460
 is found for a new video 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.009
 it's to talk to you about a small subject 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.880
 so I took the example of these risks 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.660
 so is the central defender of 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.619
 barcelona north east pagnol at 85 is strong 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.050
 102 face of the world sa de loire valley these 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.980
 stuff that repairs in defense for a 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.680
 defensive midfielder it's a pity so 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.629
 offered months that I speak and we offer 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.360
 current our current is at five places 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.730
 you will tell me five nights her breasts 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.719
 2485 was not much 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.600
 if you have looked a little bit 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.680
 price that may have some welcomed 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.289
 1000 quests you can track to 3500 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.770
 looking a lot but at 5000 it's 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.250
 huge 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.619
 take another example we will learn 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.360
 that's him daniel 6600 he put 1 4500 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:12.390
 there he is there 4000 and he is he 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.299
 left at 4500 he good he went to 5000 he 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.659
 left for 4005 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.659
 he left at 4000 he left at 5000 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.780
 so me today 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.130
 if you are looking for a player already you 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.140
 look for the player to keep these 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.810
 price there for example it was selling 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.869
 mostly at 4900 we agree to 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.180
 5000 pretty much by tf1 look good I 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.670
 maybe I'll bluff you badly bcm at this 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.490
 it should be as ridiculous the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.110
 look we're going to do we'll get the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.810
 player so we put his features 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.680
 so we already put in his hobby it's 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.420
 important one puts its meaning that the sound 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.090
 club and his nationality control 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.469
 directly and me cowardly had to be 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.299
 three nights i'll start at 3500 there 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:12.080
 is not prime this meaning it is not 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:14.489
 in 1710 the upa here is it 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:20.099
 it's a shame normally I find it at 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:22.590
 kathleen here is his slight example but that 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.930
 wants to look good the player finds it at 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:31.730
 4500 and we find it in the lobby or 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:35.250
 reasonable policies 3-4-2-1 4 2 2 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:40.410
 it may not be the best m to 4 2 3 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.390
 1 ap 4 2 3 1 not too much what can be said 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.239
 a small dish that starts towards night 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.190
 and we find about 1500 why 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.930
 to piss to search and bid for 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.290
 offers is at this price is and departure 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.569
 chosen one saves between 1000 to 3000 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.090
 per player like this so in this 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.159
 technical 1000 to 3000 it can serve 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.250
 to buy the contracts a lot of 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:04.230
 contracts and many other things from 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.000
 the shape of the beginning which is already like that 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.489
 so what he techniques you 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.260
 share that I have been using since 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.090
 I like and I really saw by 2 or 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.470
 share 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.930
 so that's the technique to have your 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.180
 players so it works only to see him 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.319
 what you are looking for, that is to say 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.930
 you can do it for all to see 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.459
 and if you search name for yourself 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.739
 were the characteristics of neymar 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.769
 you are looking for and its prices go up 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.370
 from 500 to 500 and you look at the price the 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.599
 cheaper is the device the better 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.260
 so the best devices starts 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:40.920
 by four all the time the best 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.989
 attacks ends either by 3 2 1 and 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.450
 the best backgrounds are are 3 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.269
 so that's how you are based 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.800
 and after look at these contracts by 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:55.550
 example this case of 2.2 4500 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:58.790
 kind morals and ten contracts but the sq 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:05.180
 at 2 3 1 he has a good morale he has the form 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:06.950
 at 99 and 7 against me we will try 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.730
 now to look for cheaper 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:14.180
 you see I did not do anything I did 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.150
 than watch 3400 sergio busquets 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.700
 look at the number at the lake in economics and 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.860
 Besides, I buy it because 3400 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.910
 it's the lowest price for 2004 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.230
 in total for me each day including 3400 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.980
 we are at the moment we went up to 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.470
 4005 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.080
 and then we went down to 3400 so 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.090
 also do not hurry - sometimes 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.070
 charles and loire and I wait several 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.410
 hours before finding because there is 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.940
 periods where there are periods in 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.520
 does where it will last it is going to be more 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.270
 expensive for example if you take it late 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.650
 in the evening it will be cheap I talk to 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.740
 from 8 pm it will not be very 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.420
 expensive you take between noon and 14 do not 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.520
 will be cheap and you take it in full 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.820
 course the people who see there in 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.130
 course or m expensive and ska and there makes you 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.750
 fuck so wait wait I watched the 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.830
 periods 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.850
 wait before you buy me it's 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.430
 discusses it's been three years since I 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.880
 wait for him and I found the minimum to 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.160
 3400 you see yet manage the dir 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.780
 So you're looking like that this 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.660
 technique there is a wonderful but 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.370
 the waters between asi that carried to 5000 and 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.620
 there we buy direct it is necessary to use 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.780
 the direct purchase of times is sometimes 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.620
 it's very con very constraining but 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.760
 look there we saved 2500 on on 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.690
 the art players 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.190
 so frankly nothing to say really I 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.240
 am really this part there I have you 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.760
 shown the perfect example 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.010
 so now you all have a good 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.390
 month it's my trick to win more 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.770
 money so there is that she 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.780
 could raise because I buy the 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.520
 block to see you 're going to see grandma's 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.840
 exchange 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.139
 not bad to see good a lot of good 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.629
 choice 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:57.520
 I dreamed skate boat 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:06:02.169
 you see players buying and 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:04.349
 the day in the wind here is the granny in 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:07.000
 the little girl of the exchanges 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:08.949
 it's not enough of the room I 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.860
 do not worry me for example if you 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:14.470
 want your wise 2004 not if you 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.699
 bought it 3 me never have to put 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.460
 less than 1000 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:21.909
 so I'm going to put it at 3000 thrill 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:25.300
 departure and I'm going to be buying media at 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:29.979
 5 minutes and normally which is the 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:31.990
 sell to 5000 pretty much so here 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:34.750
 listen I hope this quest there you 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.969
 will have more I tell you ciao of world and to 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.310
 the next video go with all the 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:40.990
 world and then put me a little lay 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.400
 that a little blue thumb if you have 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.169
 liked this technique and share the 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:48.240
 video to make it known to others 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:48.240
 people here she is shocked
