00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
here it is the full recommended size is

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.330 
here it is the full recommended size is
21<00:01:43.680> 20<00:01:44.040> by<00:01:44.369> 1192<00:01:45.360> now<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.409> for<00:01:46.590> TV<00:01:47.100> so

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
21 20 by 1192 now this is for TV so

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.460 
21 20 by 1192 now this is for TV so
apparently<00:01:47.850> they're<00:01:48.060> going<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.479> have<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:49.229> TV

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
apparently they're going to have the TV

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.160 
apparently they're going to have the TV
channels<00:01:50.040> show<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:51.030> entire<00:01:51.479> picture

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
channels show this entire picture

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.780 
channels show this entire picture
whatever<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.770> upload<00:01:53.130> here<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.729> to

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
whatever you upload here it's going to

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.289 
whatever you upload here it's going to
show<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.720> entire<00:01:55.500> size<00:01:55.890> now<00:01:56.610> we're<00:01:57.000> not<00:01:57.180> able

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
show this entire size now we're not able

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.969 
show this entire size now we're not able
to<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.750> yet<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.320> believe<00:01:58.649> they'll<00:01:58.799> have<00:01:58.920> to

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
to see it yet I believe they'll have to

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.130 
to see it yet I believe they'll have to
update<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.460> in<00:02:00.149> order<00:02:00.299> for<00:02:00.420> us<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.659> see<00:02:00.960> but

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
update that in order for us to see but

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.350 
update that in order for us to see but
what<00:02:01.290> we<00:02:01.439> can<00:02:01.619> see<00:02:01.770> now<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.610> desktop<00:02:03.149> view

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
what we can see now is the desktop view

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.060 
what we can see now is the desktop view
all<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:04.049> way<00:02:04.140> down<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.530> these<00:02:04.649> are<00:02:04.799> here<00:02:04.950> to

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
all the way down so these are here to

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.069 
all the way down so these are here to
kind<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.280> guide<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.759> with<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.719> different

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
kind of guide you with the different

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.520 
kind of guide you with the different
sizes<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:08.009> desktop<00:02:08.520> size<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.970> 21<00:02:09.360> 20<00:02:09.599> x<00:02:09.720> 350

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
sizes the desktop size is 21 20 x 350

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.080 
sizes the desktop size is 21 20 x 350
you<00:02:10.649> can<00:02:10.800> see<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.039> takes<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.340> entire<00:02:11.700> width

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
you can see it takes the entire width

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.850 
you can see it takes the entire width
here<00:02:12.390> then<00:02:12.930> we<00:02:13.020> have<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.290> tablets

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
here then we have the tablets

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.010 
here then we have the tablets
and<00:02:14.220> then<00:02:14.520> we<00:02:14.640> have<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.910> mobile<00:02:15.240> size<00:02:15.450> now

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
and then we have the mobile size now

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.630 
and then we have the mobile size now
this<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.320> minimum<00:02:16.800> size<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:17.490> is

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
this is the minimum size so this is

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.990 
this is the minimum size so this is
going<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:17.910> display<00:02:18.360> on<00:02:18.600> all<00:02:18.950> devices<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.820> it's

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
going to display on all devices so it's

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.610 
going to display on all devices so it's
going<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.270> be<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> safe<00:02:21.750> area<00:02:22.140> where<00:02:22.560> you

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
going to be the safe area where you

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.440 
going to be the safe area where you
should<00:02:22.770> put<00:02:22.800> your<00:02:22.980> logo<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.760> whatever<00:02:24.360> else

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
should put your logo and whatever else

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.210 
should put your logo and whatever else
you<00:02:24.720> want<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.620> make<00:02:25.740> sure<00:02:25.770> that

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
you want just to make sure that

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.690 
you want just to make sure that
everything<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:27.380> going<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.440> be<00:02:28.530> visible<00:02:29.040> on<00:02:29.220> all

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
everything is going to be visible on all

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.000 
everything is going to be visible on all
devices<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.540> all<00:02:30.870> sizes<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.770> it's<00:02:31.890> very

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
devices and all sizes so it's very

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.310 
devices and all sizes so it's very
straightforward<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:33.240> have<00:02:33.420> two<00:02:33.690> layers<00:02:33.930> here

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
straightforward you have two layers here

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.600 
straightforward you have two layers here
I've<00:02:34.500> added<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.920> one<00:02:34.980> because<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:35.460> is

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
I've added this one because this is

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.460 
I've added this one because this is
stuff<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.210> imported<00:02:36.750> but<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.230> will<00:02:37.380> not

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
stuff that I imported but you will not

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.350 
stuff that I imported but you will not
have<00:02:37.710> this<00:02:37.890> we<00:02:38.280> have<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.490> text<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.000> extras

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
have this we have the text and extras

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.060 
have this we have the text and extras
which<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.660> can<00:02:39.780> shut<00:02:40.020> off<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.410> then<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:40.920> can

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
which you can shut off and then you can

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.400 
which you can shut off and then you can
import<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.610> background<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.360> then<00:02:42.870> your<00:02:43.050> logo

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
import a background and then your logo

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.870 
import a background and then your logo
so<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:43.860> looks<00:02:43.920> like<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.250> local<00:02:44.430> will<00:02:44.640> be<00:02:44.730> fine

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
so it looks like the local will be fine

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.360 
so it looks like the local will be fine
right<00:02:45.180> there<00:02:45.410> it's<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.620> safe<00:02:46.830> zone<00:02:46.860> and

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
right there it's in the safe zone and

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.160 
right there it's in the safe zone and
then<00:02:47.880> we<00:02:47.940> can<00:02:48.090> just<00:02:48.120> turn<00:02:48.450> off<00:02:48.510> all<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.870> guides

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
then we can just turn off all the guides

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.590 
then we can just turn off all the guides
and<00:02:49.470> extras<00:02:49.950> save<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:50.940> upload<00:02:51.420> this<00:02:51.540> to

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
and extras save this upload this to

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.420 
and extras save this upload this to
youtube<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.260> everything<00:02:52.920> should<00:02:53.130> be<00:02:53.160> good<00:02:53.250> to

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
youtube and everything should be good to
