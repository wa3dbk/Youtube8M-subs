00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
you basically because they can get

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.530 
you basically because they can get
overrun<00:03:19.440> at<00:03:19.560> times<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:20.040> then<00:03:20.730> obviously<00:03:20.880> if

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
overrun at times and then obviously if

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.789 
overrun at times and then obviously if
you're<00:03:21.750> playing<00:03:22.079> against<00:03:22.380> people<00:03:22.530> that

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
you're playing against people that

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.319 
you're playing against people that
aren't<00:03:23.340> good<00:03:23.579> at<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.760> game<00:03:23.940> like<00:03:24.180> these

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
aren't good at the game like these

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.759 
aren't good at the game like these
people<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:24.810> makes<00:03:24.959> things<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.260> lot<00:03:25.380> easier

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
people it makes things a lot easier

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.530 
people it makes things a lot easier
because<00:03:26.280> even<00:03:26.579> if<00:03:26.670> they<00:03:26.760> do<00:03:26.820> keep<00:03:27.090> coming<00:03:27.359> for

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
because even if they do keep coming for

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.640 
because even if they do keep coming for
you<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:27.660> could<00:03:27.870> pull<00:03:28.019> off<00:03:28.079> some<00:03:28.290> pretty<00:03:28.440> crazy

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
you I could pull off some pretty crazy

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.289 
you I could pull off some pretty crazy
shit<00:03:28.829> and<00:03:29.040> hit<00:03:29.220> some<00:03:29.370> crazy<00:03:29.579> shots<00:03:29.910> on<00:03:30.150> them

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
shit and hit some crazy shots on them

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.030 
shit and hit some crazy shots on them
before<00:03:30.870> they<00:03:30.959> can<00:03:31.109> even<00:03:31.290> hit<00:03:31.380> standard<00:03:31.799> shots

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
before they can even hit standard shots

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.340 
before they can even hit standard shots
on<00:03:32.250> me<00:03:32.459> so<00:03:33.209> that's<00:03:33.269> basically<00:03:33.720> that's

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
on me so that's basically that's

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.259 
on me so that's basically that's
basically<00:03:34.680> all<00:03:34.920> I<00:03:35.040> did<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.549> pretty<00:03:35.850> much<00:03:35.940> got
