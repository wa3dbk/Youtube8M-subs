00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
going to be much of a difference unless

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.570 
going to be much of a difference unless
you<00:04:35.200> really<00:04:35.410> really<00:04:35.560> think<00:04:35.890> you<00:04:36.040> need<00:04:36.220> to<00:04:36.250> rely

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
you really really think you need to rely

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.280

on<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.730> touch<00:04:36.970> screen<00:04:37.000> but<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:38.050> main

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
on the touch screen but the main

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.560 
on the touch screen but the main
difference<00:04:38.320> was<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.430> test<00:04:39.730> screen<00:04:39.940> and<00:04:40.150> then

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
difference was the test screen and then

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.560 
difference was the test screen and then
the<00:04:40.780> automatic<00:04:41.560> continuous<00:04:42.310> autofocus<00:04:42.570> but

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
the automatic continuous autofocus but

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.870 
the automatic continuous autofocus but
unless<00:04:44.050> you<00:04:44.260> get<00:04:44.410> like<00:04:44.680> a<00:04:44.710> pancake<00:04:45.070> lens<00:04:45.520> it's

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
unless you get like a pancake lens it's

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.390 
unless you get like a pancake lens it's
really<00:04:46.300> not<00:04:46.450> that<00:04:46.510> useful<00:04:46.919> I'm<00:04:47.919> going<00:04:48.160> to<00:04:48.220> turn

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
really not that useful I'm going to turn

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.770 
really not that useful I'm going to turn
it<00:04:48.550> on<00:04:48.610> right<00:04:48.760> now<00:04:48.850> so<00:04:48.970> you<00:04:49.150> guys<00:04:49.210> can<00:04:49.480> see

it on right now so you guys can see
you're<00:04:50.200> going<00:04:50.290> to<00:04:50.380> be<00:04:50.500> able<00:04:50.530> to<00:04:50.710> hear<00:04:51.070> it<00:04:51.220> focus

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
you're going to be able to hear it focus

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.850 
you're going to be able to hear it focus
like<00:04:51.820> crazy<00:04:52.150> and<00:04:52.450> the<00:04:52.930> slightest<00:04:53.320> movement<00:04:53.710> is

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
like crazy and the slightest movement is

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.170 
like crazy and the slightest movement is
going<00:04:54.040> to<00:04:54.100> make<00:04:54.280> it<00:04:54.310> focus<00:04:54.850> on<00:04:54.970> all<00:04:55.090> these

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
going to make it focus on all these

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.750 
going to make it focus on all these
different<00:04:55.390> areas<00:04:55.600> and<00:04:56.020> if<00:04:56.770> you<00:04:56.980> stand<00:04:57.310> far

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
different areas and if you stand far

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.550 
different areas and if you stand far
away<00:04:57.880> enough<00:04:58.090> from<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.480> camera<00:04:58.960> it's<00:04:59.169> not

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
away enough from the camera it's not

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.830 
away enough from the camera it's not
very<00:04:59.620> good<00:05:00.040> tracking<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.850> subjects<00:05:01.419> so<00:05:01.600> if

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
very good tracking the subjects so if

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.340 
very good tracking the subjects so if
you<00:05:02.380> are<00:05:02.650> further<00:05:03.160> than<00:05:03.430> what<00:05:03.700> I<00:05:03.730> am<00:05:03.910> right<00:05:04.060> now

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
you are further than what I am right now

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.870 
you are further than what I am right now
it's<00:05:05.350> probably<00:05:05.980> not<00:05:06.370> going<00:05:06.490> to<00:05:06.550> focus<00:05:06.700> very

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
it's probably not going to focus very

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.659 
it's probably not going to focus very
well<00:05:07.090> so<00:05:07.390> if<00:05:07.750> that's<00:05:08.620> important<00:05:09.100> to<00:05:09.190> you<00:05:09.310> if

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
well so if that's important to you if

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.070 
well so if that's important to you if
you<00:05:09.820> like<00:05:10.000> shooting<00:05:10.330> sports<00:05:10.630> or<00:05:10.840> something

you like shooting sports or something

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.480 
you like shooting sports or something
like<00:05:11.169> that<00:05:11.230> this<00:05:11.530> might<00:05:11.740> not<00:05:11.860> be<00:05:11.919> the<00:05:12.070> best

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
like that this might not be the best

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.909 
like that this might not be the best
camera<00:05:13.000> after<00:05:13.180> all<00:05:13.510> but<00:05:14.200> I'm<00:05:14.380> turning<00:05:14.740> on<00:05:14.860> now

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
walking as I'm moving in side to side

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.790 
walking as I'm moving in side to side
but<00:05:31.150> then<00:05:31.390> I'm<00:05:31.660> going<00:05:32.080> to<00:05:32.110> try<00:05:32.260> to<00:05:32.290> focus<00:05:32.530> on

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
but then I'm going to try to focus on

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:41.390 
but then I'm going to try to focus on
something<00:05:36.690> see<00:05:37.690> it's<00:05:37.840> really<00:05:37.960> struggling

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.909 

it's<00:05:42.400> not<00:05:42.550> too<00:05:42.790> too<00:05:43.000> bad<00:05:43.470> but<00:05:44.470> it<00:05:44.590> does<00:05:44.740> make

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
it's not too too bad but it does make

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.260 
it's not too too bad but it does make
quite<00:05:45.130> a<00:05:45.190> bit<00:05:45.370> of<00:05:45.460> noise<00:05:45.580> so<00:05:45.640> unless<00:05:46.030> you<00:05:46.180> get

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
quite a bit of noise so unless you get

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.710 
quite a bit of noise so unless you get
an<00:05:46.390> STM<00:05:46.810> or<00:05:46.960> a<00:05:46.990> pancake<00:05:47.620> lens<00:05:48.240> it<00:05:49.240> will<00:05:49.510> be

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
an STM or a pancake lens it will be

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.990 
an STM or a pancake lens it will be
doing<00:05:49.960> this<00:05:50.110> quite<00:05:50.800> often<00:05:51.010> but<00:05:51.669> it's<00:05:51.790> still

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
doing this quite often but it's still

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.330 
doing this quite often but it's still
pretty<00:05:52.210> cool<00:05:52.479> it's<00:05:52.780> an<00:05:52.870> amazing<00:05:53.410> camera<00:05:53.680> and

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
there's just a tiny little picture i'm

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.440 
there's just a tiny little picture i'm
sure<00:06:45.200> you<00:06:45.350> all<00:06:45.470> i'd<00:06:45.650> seen<00:06:45.920> it<00:06:45.950> already<00:06:46.450> but

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.450 
sure you all i'd seen it already but

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.620 
sure you all i'd seen it already but
that's<00:06:47.630> it<00:06:47.810> right<00:06:48.020> there<00:06:48.460> and<00:06:49.460> it<00:06:50.270> does<00:06:50.450> have

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
that's it right there and it does have

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.980 
that's it right there and it does have
the<00:06:51.110> viewfinder<00:06:51.890> that<00:06:52.160> pops<00:06:52.670> out<00:06:52.880> just<00:06:53.660> like<00:06:53.780> a

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
the viewfinder that pops out just like a

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.440 
the viewfinder that pops out just like a
camcorder<00:06:54.980> does<00:06:55.490> where<00:06:55.850> it<00:06:55.910> just<00:06:56.030> flips<00:06:56.300> out

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:56.450 
camcorder does where it just flips out

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.870 
camcorder does where it just flips out
and<00:06:57.290> so<00:06:57.680> that<00:06:57.830> was<00:06:57.920> a<00:06:57.980> really<00:06:58.070> cool<00:06:58.460> feature<00:06:58.640> of

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:58.880 
and so that was a really cool feature of

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.580 
and so that was a really cool feature of
it<00:06:59.000> as<00:06:59.090> well<00:06:59.300> i<00:06:59.450> think<00:06:59.510> the<00:06:59.780> t3<00:07:00.260> is<00:07:00.290> the<00:07:00.440> only

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:00.590 
it as well i think the t3 is the only

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.260 
it as well i think the t3 is the only
