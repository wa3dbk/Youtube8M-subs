00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
of us is it too predictable if WWE books

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.420 
of us is it too predictable if WWE books
this<00:01:30.509> properly<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.259> could<00:01:31.470> end<00:01:31.590> up<00:01:31.740> being<00:01:31.799> one

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
this properly it could end up being one

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.460 
this properly it could end up being one
of<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.790> better<00:01:33.060> night<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.450> champions<00:01:33.659> but

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
of the better night of champions but

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.340 
of the better night of champions but
that's<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.799> big<00:01:35.040> big<00:01:35.610> if<00:01:35.939> but<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.170> just

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
that's a big big if but this it just

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.260 
that's a big big if but this it just
seems<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.829> has<00:01:37.950> too<00:01:38.159> much<00:01:38.250> going<00:01:38.700> against

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
seems like it has too much going against

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.490 
seems like it has too much going against
it<00:01:39.360> instead<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.689> for<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.500> uh<00:01:41.180> has<00:01:42.180> WWE<00:01:43.110> done

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
it instead of for it uh has WWE done

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.160 
it instead of for it uh has WWE done
enough<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.340> last<00:01:44.579> few<00:01:44.850> weeks<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:45.960> you
