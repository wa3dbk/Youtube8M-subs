00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.649
 this part and I finished 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.330
 so now this part can 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.120
 explain how it's going to be done first I'll 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.340
 to put a first eye that always I 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.550
 I use it so that I'm going to start putting 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.130
 well on the whole eyelid and like this 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.200
 makeup that is for for there was no 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.349
 then rather here what I want 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.830
 to do is that the outlined highlight 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.380
 plus 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.930
 since I have put it now I am going to 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.910
 start with a pencil in fact good to me 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.990
 I quite like to use this pencil of 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.300
 italy east because it is very creamy 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:45.550
 from the middle I'm going to give you a 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.550
 little bit more up like this 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.570
 and if I start doing this effect what 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.610
 will do is that the eye is more 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.610
 raised opens the eye 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.900
 if the eye 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:17.140
 already when I have delineated 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.140
 good now with the black shadow 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.210
 what I'm going to start is what I already 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.540
 I had painted 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:30.090
 with link 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.090
 same with this I can do up 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.220
 so now I'm going to raise a little 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.190
 the bridge eye down and I'm going to 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.480
 delineate this part to make them look more 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.480
 deep all this 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:00.079
 now I'm going to the bottom 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.079
 flip it up and so 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.979
 A) Yes 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.280
 and then from this part because to 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:16.200
 up I'm going to put this together this is with 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.200
 the here like this 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.920
 with the same black shadow I will seal 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.610
 this in the pencil so you do not 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.610
 run like this 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.040
 of this brush from coscos sense 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.290
 but I insist 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:47.000
 even as that medium and reach chatita 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:49.519
 a little bit of the dark shadow like that and what 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.030
 what I'm going to do is this part for 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.490
 blur it a bit like that 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.590
 I like to do it whenever it is 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.350
 makeup so it goes strong in the eyes 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.840
 I like to make eyes first and then 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.030
 after cleaning all this part and put 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.180
 the base so that as you can see here 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.130
 it looks much better because sometimes it 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.500
 spot made here looks a little 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.239
 spotted but he's going to take it 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.239
 with make-up remover 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.250
 on this side I'm going to join this delineated 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.040
 with this other 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.620
 to give a little bit of light to the 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.010
 eyelid this color is that it is a 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.010
 Golden 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:39.140
 It was a little nothing be 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.140
 and I'll put it to the little tocadita 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.760
 we blur it like this 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:52.860
 in china the eyelashes this up 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.860
 down so a little bit nothing more 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.600
 well now what is going to be handsome with 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.010
 the false eyelashes these lashes 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.800
 you use it I like it 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.380
 quite because in this part they have 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.300
 as they give a longer and more 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.250
 you are going to lengthen the eye with the 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.720
 false eyelashes with this glue that 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.060
 it is dark tone duo 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.460
 in fact I like to use the tone more 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.820
 dark because it is lost at birth 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:22.840
 of the tabs and what I'm going to do is 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:26.050
 this I'm going to put a little bit like that and to 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.670
 reinforce it in the parties in the last 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.960
 part of the first part I'm going to put a 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.960
 little bit more 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:40.630
 we can let it dry a few seconds 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:43.410
 and then if we are going to put the bs 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.410
 here 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.100
 in fact what they can do before 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.979
 put the eyelashes measure them if they are left 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.979
 a little long paste and cut them 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.320
 I'm going to do everything that came my way 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.830
 eyeliner with a little makeup remover 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.830
 I will remove it 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:10.480
 in this pons 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.470
 It has already lasted for a long time and what I am going to 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.470
 to do is drink tea up 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:20.229
 I'm going to remove this area clean 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.320
 the base in fact good I'm going to use 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.970
 this is a means of fact this 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.590
 Makeup as I had told you is 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.420
 of lauder institute de salave and always 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.700
 the makeup whenever they put it 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.590
 always have to go outside because 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.840
 what happens is that if we do it for 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.460
 in there are times that good we have 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.840
 hair and what he is going to do is that he 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.960
 raise more this is what we want 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.960
 since the base is the most 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:59.000
 couple then let's do it from 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.000
 inside out like this 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.360
 in fact it is very important that always 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:06.849
 that they put a base always follow 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:11.870
 with translucent powder remember the 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:14.090
 so neck the ears too 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.900
 a translucent powder that is a powder 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:20.660
 bronze in fact good I like more the 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:23.690
 Trasdos dusts those that compact them 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.280
 since these come loose 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.760
 you can put the amount you want 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.760
 A) Yes 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:36.069
 I'm going to put the bar 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:39.069
 I like to put the color to me always 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:41.680
 of lips with some brochita because 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:44.219
 can be more precise and what are we going to 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.219
 do is this 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:50.460
 we get a heart shape to the bride 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.460
 A) Yes 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.760
 even this makeup can be daytime 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.760
 at night
