what's up you guys tape here bringing
you<00:00:01.949> guys<00:00:02.190> a<00:00:02.580> video<00:00:03.300> and<00:00:03.720> today<00:00:04.560> I'm<00:00:04.740> going<00:00:04.799> to

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
you guys a video and today I'm going to

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.099 
you guys a video and today I'm going to
be<00:00:05.009> showing<00:00:05.250> you<00:00:05.490> how<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:06.150> three<00:00:06.779> side<00:00:06.990> the

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
be showing you how to three side the

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.680 
be showing you how to three side the
journals<00:00:07.470> so<00:00:07.649> basically<00:00:08.240> this<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.300> probably

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
journals so basically this is probably

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.879 
journals so basically this is probably
the<00:00:09.900> most<00:00:10.200> popular<00:00:10.969> clan<00:00:11.969> war<00:00:12.240> base<00:00:13.230> layout<00:00:13.530> in

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
the most popular clan war base layout in

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.490 
the most popular clan war base layout in
existence<00:00:14.639> I've<00:00:15.000> seen<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.750> almost<00:00:15.960> every

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
existence I've seen it and almost every

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.269 
existence I've seen it and almost every
single<00:00:16.680> war<00:00:16.980> benin<00:00:17.400> um<00:00:18.920> yeah<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.130> basically

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
single war benin um yeah so basically

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.370 
single war benin um yeah so basically
the<00:00:20.910> rundown<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.539> space<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.109> you've

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
the rundown of the space is you've

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.560 
the rundown of the space is you've
probably<00:00:22.710> already<00:00:22.980> detected<00:00:23.519> before<00:00:23.850> most

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
probably already detected before most

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.480 
probably already detected before most
likely<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:25.019> failed<00:00:25.289> because<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> tricky

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
likely it failed because it is a tricky

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.910 
likely it failed because it is a tricky
base<00:00:26.730> but<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.320> extremely<00:00:28.320> easy<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.619> three

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
base but it's extremely easy to three

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.950 
base but it's extremely easy to three
star<00:00:29.220> if<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.519> know<00:00:29.640> what<00:00:29.730> you're<00:00:29.849> doing<00:00:30.119> I'm

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
star if you know what you're doing I'm

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.650 
star if you know what you're doing I'm
double<00:00:31.410> giant<00:00:31.679> bombs<00:00:31.769> right<00:00:32.189> here<00:00:32.910> double

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
double giant bombs right here double

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.319 
double giant bombs right here double
giant<00:00:33.840> bombs<00:00:33.989> right<00:00:34.350> here<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.190> those<00:00:36.000> giant

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
giant bombs right here and those giant

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.910 
giant bombs right here and those giant
bombs<00:00:36.480> are<00:00:36.690> really<00:00:36.899> hard<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.200> get<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.739> it's

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
bombs are really hard to get to so it's

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.220 
bombs are really hard to get to so it's
uh<00:00:38.129> it's<00:00:38.489> hard<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.420> do<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> heart<00:00:39.780> attacks<00:00:40.110> in

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
uh it's hard to do a heart attacks in

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.840 
uh it's hard to do a heart attacks in
the<00:00:40.320> space<00:00:40.559> unless<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.129> really<00:00:41.340> break<00:00:41.670> in

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
the space unless you really break in

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.520 
the space unless you really break in
there<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.180> explode<00:00:42.870> those<00:00:43.050> bombs<00:00:43.290> but

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
there and explode those bombs but

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.990 
there and explode those bombs but
anyways<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.160> I'm<00:00:44.399> gonna<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:44.640> showing<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.910> guys

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
anyways so I'm gonna be showing you guys

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.819 
anyways so I'm gonna be showing you guys
how<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.210> defeat<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.750> base<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.110> lava<00:00:46.320> hounds

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
how to defeat this base with lava hounds

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.740 
how to defeat this base with lava hounds
and<00:00:47.129> uh<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.710> mean<00:00:50.120> anyway<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.180> attack<00:00:51.600> this

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
and uh I mean anyway you attack this

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.660 
and uh I mean anyway you attack this
base<00:00:51.989> with<00:00:52.559> lava<00:00:52.770> hounds<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:53.309> easily

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
base with lava hounds you can easily

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.340 
base with lava hounds you can easily
three-star<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.600> because<00:00:54.870> how<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.079> defense

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
three-star just because how the defense

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.369 
three-star just because how the defense
is<00:00:55.649> flow<00:00:55.980> around<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> base<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:58.170> path

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
is flow around the base on the path

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.540 
is flow around the base on the path
thing<00:00:58.590> they're<00:00:58.739> not<00:00:58.859> going<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.100> get<00:00:59.250> split<00:00:59.520> up

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
thing they're not going to get split up

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.810 
thing they're not going to get split up
very<00:01:00.000> easily<00:01:00.090> you're<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:00.960> going<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.260> slowly

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
very easily you're just going to slowly

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.310 
very easily you're just going to slowly
make<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.969> make<00:01:03.539> their<00:01:03.690> way<00:01:03.809> around<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.110> base

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
make the make their way around the base

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.550 
make the make their way around the base
and<00:01:04.530> kind<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.070> line<00:01:05.309> or<00:01:06.240> clockwise<00:01:07.229> or

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
and kind of like a line or clockwise or

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.109 
and kind of like a line or clockwise or
counterclockwise<00:01:07.830> line<00:01:08.490> depending<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:08.970> how

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
counterclockwise line depending on how

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.080 
counterclockwise line depending on how
you<00:01:09.180> deploy<00:01:09.450> them<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.369> bingle

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
you deploy them but here we have bingle

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.820 
you deploy them but here we have bingle
I<00:01:12.290> attacking<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:14.580> uh<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:15.210> mean<00:01:16.170> personally

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
I attacking it and uh I mean personally

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.950 
I attacking it and uh I mean personally
I'm<00:01:17.310> not<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> big<00:01:17.700> fan<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:18.000> doing<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.570> what<00:01:18.840> he

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
I'm not a big fan of doing this what he

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.160 
I'm not a big fan of doing this what he
did<00:01:19.549> he<00:01:20.549> uh<00:01:20.580> basically<00:01:21.360> dropped<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.720> lava<00:01:21.900> hound

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
did he uh basically dropped a lava hound

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.080 
did he uh basically dropped a lava hound
and<00:01:22.500> some<00:01:22.770> balloons<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.400> take<00:01:23.610> out<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.909> air

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
and some balloons to take out this air

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.320 
and some balloons to take out this air
defense<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.869> Tesla<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.619> cannon<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:27.090> get

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
defense this Tesla this cannon and get

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.660 
defense this Tesla this cannon and get
the<00:01:27.450> clan<00:01:27.689> castle<00:01:27.720> air<00:01:28.229> but<00:01:29.070> I'm<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.490> not<00:01:29.610> a

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the clan castle air but I'm just not a

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.640 
the clan castle air but I'm just not a
big<00:01:29.729> fan<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.030> doing<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.810> because<00:01:31.200> I

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
big fan of doing that just because I

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.399 
big fan of doing that just because I
think<00:01:32.520> he<00:01:32.820> might<00:01:32.970> have<00:01:33.030> wasted<00:01:33.299> too<00:01:34.259> much

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
think he might have wasted too much

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.410 
think he might have wasted too much
troop<00:01:34.890> space<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.549> didn't<00:01:35.850> get<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.150> much<00:01:36.270> of

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
troop space and didn't get that much of

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.999 
troop space and didn't get that much of
the<00:01:36.450> benefit<00:01:36.840> out<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.530> because<00:01:37.740> he

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
the benefit out of it just because he

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.230 
the benefit out of it just because he
didn't<00:01:38.189> kill<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.430> Queen<00:01:38.670> or<00:01:38.880> anything<00:01:39.210> like

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
didn't kill the Queen or anything like

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.870 
didn't kill the Queen or anything like
that<00:01:39.650> but<00:01:40.650> he<00:01:40.799> did<00:01:41.009> do<00:01:41.159> what<00:01:41.280> he<00:01:41.340> wanted<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.670> do

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
that but he did do what he wanted to do

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.330 
that but he did do what he wanted to do
he<00:01:42.060> got<00:01:42.210> basically<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.500> entire<00:01:43.590> clan<00:01:44.100> castle

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
he got basically the entire clan castle

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.580 
he got basically the entire clan castle
killed<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.030> he<00:01:45.450> took<00:01:45.659> out<00:01:45.840> an<00:01:46.020> air<00:01:46.140> defense<00:01:46.439> in

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
killed and he took out an air defense in

you know the rage spells a few balloons
on<00:02:27.790> huge<00:02:27.940> defense<00:02:28.360> so<00:02:28.540> they<00:02:28.630> don't<00:02:28.780> get<00:02:28.870> too

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050

right here so if you're gonna attack

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.030 
right here so if you're gonna attack
this<00:02:43.209> base<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:44.260> with<00:02:44.440> lava<00:02:44.650> hounds

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
this base it with lava hounds

this base it with lava hounds
essentially<00:02:45.940> you're<00:02:46.060> going<00:02:46.239> to<00:02:46.299> defeat<00:02:46.750> the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
essentially you're going to defeat the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.770 
essentially you're going to defeat the
entire<00:02:47.049> base<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.790> you'll<00:02:48.970> probably<00:02:49.180> sell<00:02:49.480> one

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
entire base and you'll probably sell one

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.360 
entire base and you'll probably sell one
or<00:02:49.810> two<00:02:50.019> lava<00:02:50.230> hounds<00:02:50.590> up<00:02:50.769> and<00:02:51.010> they'll<00:02:51.160> end<00:02:51.310> up

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
or two lava hounds up and they'll end up

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.800 
or two lava hounds up and they'll end up
traveling<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.030> last<00:02:52.299> air<00:02:52.510> defense<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.170> uh

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
on the right side of the base and

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.020 
on the right side of the base and
basically<00:05:25.190> I'm<00:05:25.490> going<00:05:25.729> to<00:05:25.790> be<00:05:25.880> working<00:05:26.090> in<00:05:26.630> a

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
basically I'm going to be working in a

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.900 
basically I'm going to be working in a
clockwise<00:05:29.030> motion<00:05:29.570> so<00:05:30.020> I'm<00:05:30.080> going<00:05:30.530> to

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
clockwise motion so I'm going to

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.159 
clockwise motion so I'm going to
basically<00:05:31.910> try<00:05:32.210> to<00:05:32.300> take<00:05:32.539> out<00:05:32.690> this<00:05:32.810> portion

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
basically try to take out this portion

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.380 
basically try to take out this portion
of<00:05:33.229> the<00:05:33.289> base<00:05:33.470> and<00:05:33.830> from<00:05:34.580> there<00:05:34.760> my<00:05:34.970> balloons

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
of the base and from there my balloons

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.969 
of the base and from there my balloons
and<00:05:35.780> hounds<00:05:36.080> will<00:05:36.200> path<00:05:36.410> towards<00:05:36.830> this

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
and hounds will path towards this

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:38.500 
and hounds will path towards this
portion<00:05:37.340> of<00:05:37.370> the<00:05:37.430> base<00:05:37.580> were<00:05:37.880> sending<00:05:38.330> more

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
portion of the base were sending more

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.540 
portion of the base were sending more
balloons<00:05:38.780> and<00:05:38.960> hounds<00:05:39.260> and<00:05:39.410> they'll<00:05:40.280> end<00:05:40.460> up

balloons and hounds and they'll end up

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.040 
balloons and hounds and they'll end up
passing<00:05:40.850> to<00:05:41.240> the<00:05:41.270> last<00:05:41.539> part<00:05:41.720> of<00:05:41.840> the<00:05:41.930> base

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
passing to the last part of the base

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.740 
passing to the last part of the base
will<00:05:42.320> have<00:05:42.440> a<00:05:42.470> huge<00:05:42.680> balloon<00:05:43.190> Sibeko<00:05:43.750> just

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
just because I knew this one was going

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.029 
just because I knew this one was going
to<00:06:10.160> go<00:06:10.280> down<00:06:10.490> and<00:06:10.729> once<00:06:11.300> that<00:06:11.360> goes<00:06:12.080> down<00:06:12.289> this

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 
to go down and once that goes down this

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.650 
to go down and once that goes down this
air<00:06:13.190> defense<00:06:13.460> is<00:06:13.639> going<00:06:13.760> to<00:06:13.820> wreak<00:06:14.030> havoc<00:06:14.450> all

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
air defense is going to wreak havoc all

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.080 
air defense is going to wreak havoc all
over<00:06:14.690> my<00:06:15.080> balloons<00:06:15.580> so<00:06:16.580> it's<00:06:16.729> always<00:06:16.910> good

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
over my balloons so it's always good

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.600 
over my balloons so it's always good
just<00:06:17.560> sometimes<00:06:18.560> if<00:06:18.740> you<00:06:18.830> need<00:06:19.010> to<00:06:19.190> you<00:06:19.460> don't

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
just sometimes if you need to you don't

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.310 
just sometimes if you need to you don't
always<00:06:19.729> need<00:06:19.940> to<00:06:20.090> do<00:06:20.210> it<00:06:20.389> but<00:06:20.630> sometimes<00:06:21.020> if

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.320 
always need to do it but sometimes if

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.770 
always need to do it but sometimes if
you<00:06:21.470> the<00:06:22.280> opportunity<00:06:23.030> arises<00:06:23.300> you<00:06:23.630> can

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
you the opportunity arises you can

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.100 
you the opportunity arises you can
always<00:06:24.340> use<00:06:25.340> your<00:06:25.520> to<00:06:26.360> lava<00:06:26.660> hounds<00:06:26.900> on<00:06:26.990> one

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
always use your to lava hounds on one

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.379 
always use your to lava hounds on one
air<00:06:27.260> defense<00:06:27.530> and<00:06:27.910> and<00:06:28.910> then<00:06:29.120> that<00:06:29.270> well

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:29.389 
air defense and and then that well

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.270 
air defense and and then that well
behind<00:06:29.630> will<00:06:29.810> continue<00:06:30.169> to<00:06:30.289> path<00:06:30.470> and<00:06:30.800> protect

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
behind will continue to path and protect

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.610 
behind will continue to path and protect
for<00:06:31.520> your<00:06:31.610> balloons<00:06:32.080> so<00:06:33.080> you<00:06:33.139> see<00:06:33.380> a<00:06:33.410> lot<00:06:33.590> of

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
for your balloons so you see a lot of

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.260 
for your balloons so you see a lot of
people<00:06:33.860> they<00:06:34.070> like<00:06:34.280> to<00:06:34.400> just<00:06:34.550> do<00:06:34.729> one<00:06:34.940> end<00:06:35.090> on

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
people they like to just do one end on

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.000 
people they like to just do one end on
each<00:06:35.630> air<00:06:35.840> defense<00:06:36.110> but<00:06:36.349> sometimes<00:06:36.770> it's

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 
each air defense but sometimes it's

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.159 
each air defense but sometimes it's
better<00:06:37.130> if<00:06:37.310> you<00:06:37.370> just<00:06:37.430> if<00:06:37.849> you<00:06:38.479> do<00:06:38.630> too<00:06:38.900> and

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
better if you just if you do too and

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:40.570 
better if you just if you do too and
they'll<00:06:39.620> end<00:06:39.740> up<00:06:39.830> pathing

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
they'll end up pathing

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.429 
they'll end up pathing
towards<00:06:40.759> the<00:06:40.819> next<00:06:41.030> year<00:06:41.120> defense<00:06:41.389> anyway<00:06:41.659> and

00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:42.439 
towards the next year defense anyway and

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:44.740 
towards the next year defense anyway and
I<00:06:42.530> thinking<00:06:42.919> along<00:06:43.099> the<00:06:43.280> way<00:06:43.400> and<00:06:43.610> that<00:06:44.569> also

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:44.750 
I thinking along the way and that also

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.360 
I thinking along the way and that also
helps<00:06:45.110> them<00:06:45.259> bust<00:06:45.500> because<00:06:45.830> once<00:06:46.039> they<00:06:46.159> bust

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
helps them bust because once they bust

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.240 
helps them bust because once they bust
their<00:06:46.490> really<00:06:47.120> effective<00:06:47.539> cleanup<00:06:47.870> tubes<00:06:48.250> so

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
their really effective cleanup tubes so

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.520 
their really effective cleanup tubes so
yeah<00:06:49.370> basically<00:06:49.610> that's<00:06:50.090> that's<00:06:50.810> the<00:06:50.960> rundown

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.330 

starting<00:06:54.530> my<00:06:54.650> extra<00:06:54.889> hand<00:06:55.069> right<00:06:55.219> here

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
starting my extra hand right here

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.980 
starting my extra hand right here
because<00:06:55.580> I<00:06:55.699> know<00:06:55.819> that<00:06:56.389> hounds<00:06:56.629> going<00:06:56.780> to<00:06:56.840> meet

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:56.990 
because I know that hounds going to meet
