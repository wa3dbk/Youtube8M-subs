00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.520
 at home 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.260
 I do not know if it was if they see us 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.630
 again here with the achievements this 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.060
 we are in extinction and mayday the truth 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.640
 is that I do not know if they have already uploaded it 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.349
 matter I'm not interested I got up and what 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.660
 when I got up I fucked well and is 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.000
 late enough hundred already knew me to ya 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.500
 came out and I started the truth is fine 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.579
 click lost with carlos dibÃ³s 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.200
 the truth is that strong price and so 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.120
 easy but hey let's start with 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.290
 this achievement that is the achievement where you have 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.760
 that get the four eggs 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.100
 around the new four maps 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.739
 multiplayer that in the end is called the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.329
 achievement a devastating egg has been 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.039
 good and chasm good is the only creative thing 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.489
 that you're infinity ward because the 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:55.500
 achievements are similar to night falls seeks 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.780
 the intense ones get the eggs pass 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.280
 so much time to this good mom but 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.690
 well I do not know fast this achievement the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.949
 truth is very short we only see 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.539
 that the four locations in the 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.949
 first map is in ruins of the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.630
 side of the federation all in fact 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.130
 all on the side of the federation but 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.320
 as soon as we appear we will find it 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.090
 just to our right I climbed up to 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.789
 that you see it better is 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.829
 below this takes the next 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:18.780
 location to find in next map is 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.340
 the remastering fingers stained in a 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.869
 art here we will find it 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.069
 again on the side of the federation 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.619
 remember all on the side of the 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.810
 federation as soon as we appear is in the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.360
 mere center where it was basically the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.600
 new dome and right now is where is the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.490
 meteorite are going to literally approach 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.709
 it's like it's like a pit type and in this 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.689
 well is in the eggs to 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:41.969
 kilometers better and ready here we are the 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.069
 second egg the third location is 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.780
 find collision 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.610
 remember that it is also going to be the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.709
 federation of agreement we just put them 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.929
 on the side of the federation the nearby 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.789
 This is because the car is basically 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.619
 so they do not get lost but good is 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.780
 from the bridge they have to see what 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.280
 far in the distance through what 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.879
 It's been the bridge railings 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.469
 is in that corner on the wall and the 

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:07.110
 last the new decisions are in the 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.060
 we come here in the bulldozer I do not know 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.459
 that is good the excavator is giant 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.530
 side of the operation again appear 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.750
 and with it they will find it almost 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.950
 almost immediately that they appear and 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.390
 good to get the achievement what 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.530
 only thing we have to do is destroy 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.209
 and in this mayday map I remember that 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.670
 that proceed to put in game mode 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.069
 those who have been during the game 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.640
 if everyone had done that then they're going 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.220
 to get 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.790
 and with this obviously they are going to get their 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.099
 achievement 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:41.019
 a new one I hope you liked the 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.150
 guide if you liked remember to share 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.069
 I liked him, I made him super short 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.989
 Do not miss the essentials of this 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.519
 achievement already or if you want more achievements ask 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.870
 the x were the comments I 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.230
 dismissal this write 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.230
 see you later
