00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
when opening of the jar when I got home

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.990 
when opening of the jar when I got home
was<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.319> it<00:02:22.470> was<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.650> very<00:02:23.430> very<00:02:23.730> creamy

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
was that it was a very very creamy

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.760 
was that it was a very very creamy
texture<00:02:24.420> which<00:02:24.569> is<00:02:24.599> what<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.840> expected<00:02:25.470> for

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
texture which is what I expected for
