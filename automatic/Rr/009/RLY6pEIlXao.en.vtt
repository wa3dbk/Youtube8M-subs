allows me to help her paint color
segments<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.859> can<00:00:29.660> have<00:00:30.660> parallel<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:32.300> it<00:00:33.300> will

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
segments I can have parallel I it will

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.889 
segments I can have parallel I it will
give<00:00:34.800> me<00:00:34.829> great<00:00:35.040> accuracy<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.329> placing<00:00:36.780> a

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
give me great accuracy in placing a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.410 
give me great accuracy in placing a
million<00:00:37.230> side<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.950> right<00:00:38.190> now<00:00:38.399> i<00:00:38.670> will<00:00:39.210> try

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
million side on the right now i will try

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.350 
million side on the right now i will try
to<00:00:39.480> create<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.110> parallel<00:00:40.620> ok<00:00:41.219> i<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:41.730> an

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
to create a parallel ok i have an

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.750 
to create a parallel ok i have an
intersection<00:00:43.110> point<00:00:43.379> here<00:00:43.739> i<00:00:43.950> have<00:00:44.730> a

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
intersection point here i have a

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.760 
intersection point here i have a
parallel<00:00:46.309> mullions<00:00:47.309> here<00:00:48.379> what<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.530> also

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
parallel mullions here what is also

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.970 
parallel mullions here what is also
interesting<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.940> Mullen<00:00:51.449> alignment<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.289> can

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
interesting is Mullen alignment I can

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.389 
interesting is Mullen alignment I can
select<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.270> mullion<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.230> be<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> line<00:00:55.980> with

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
select this mullion and be a line with

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.020 
select this mullion and be a line with
this<00:00:57.260> frame<00:00:58.260> here<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.160> first<00:00:59.399> element<00:00:59.609> is

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
this frame here so the first element is

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.369 
this frame here so the first element is
to<00:01:00.329> select<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.020> frame<00:01:01.649> side<00:01:01.980> select<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
to select the frame side select the

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.719 
to select the frame side select the
mauryan<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:05.580> i<00:01:05.939> click<00:01:06.710> alignment<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:08.400> will

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
mauryan and if i click alignment it will

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.390 
mauryan and if i click alignment it will
make<00:01:09.299> an<00:01:09.450> alignment<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:10.080> me<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.130> more

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
make an alignment for me what is more

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.700 
make an alignment for me what is more
interesting<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.689> can<00:01:13.260> make

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
interesting is that I can make

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.789 
interesting is that I can make
alignments<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.400> different<00:01:14.790> types<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.799> let's

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
alignments in different types of let's

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.510 
alignments in different types of let's
do<00:01:17.189> something<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.360> place<00:01:19.369> here

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
do something like this and place here

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.770 
do something like this and place here
let's<00:01:22.520> do<00:01:22.670> a<00:01:22.700> custom<00:01:23.000> splitting<00:01:23.630> like<00:01:24.350> this

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
let's do a custom splitting like this

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.170 
let's do a custom splitting like this
sorry<00:01:26.780> I<00:01:26.930> have<00:01:27.320> to<00:01:27.350> select<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.860> inner<00:01:28.760> shade

line is I have some splitters here and

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.420 
line is I have some splitters here and
here<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:04.700> I<00:02:05.600> want<00:02:05.870> if<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.500> select<00:02:06.740> this<00:02:06.950> first

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
here and I want if I select this first

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:14.170 
here and I want if I select this first

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.970 

ok<00:02:15.180> use<00:02:15.390> ctrl<00:02:15.840> key<00:02:16.019> to<00:02:16.049> make<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.469> selection

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
ok use ctrl key to make the selection

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.790 
ok use ctrl key to make the selection
and<00:02:17.489> if<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.819> say<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.239> alignment

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
and if I say the alignment

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.100 
and if I say the alignment
okay<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:20.760> moves<00:02:21.120> based<00:02:21.510> on<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.870> first

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
okay it moves based on the first

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.590 
okay it moves based on the first
election<00:02:22.440> but<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:22.950> can<00:02:23.310> reverse<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.060> selection

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
election but I can reverse the selection

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.400 
election but I can reverse the selection
like<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:30.240> alignment<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.780> done<00:02:31.080> it's

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
like this and the alignment is done it's

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.990 
like this and the alignment is done it's
done<00:02:31.800> in<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.660> different<00:02:33.660> direction<00:02:35.000> one

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
done in the different direction one

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.800 
done in the different direction one
difficult<00:02:36.660> task<00:02:36.930> is<00:02:37.410> if<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.280> have<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.810> window

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
difficult task is if you have a window

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.400 
difficult task is if you have a window
with<00:02:40.020> arch<00:02:40.290> up<00:02:40.950> on<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.030> upside<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:43.200> have

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
with arch up on the upside and you have

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.730 
with arch up on the upside and you have
to<00:02:43.650> place<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.270> horizontal<00:02:45.270> merlion<00:02:45.930> where<00:02:46.530> to

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
to place a horizontal merlion where to

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.420 
to place a horizontal merlion where to
place<00:02:46.980> this<00:02:47.220> million<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.940> order<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.540> have

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
place this million in order to have

new and as you can see here I have all

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.120 
new and as you can see here I have all
the<00:03:11.910> points<00:03:12.300> on<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.480> frame<00:03:14.690> chambers<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:16.130> inner

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
the points on the frame chambers a inner

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.880

mask<00:03:17.580> and<00:03:18.000> all<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.660> points<00:03:19.110> on<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.530> Mullen

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
mask and all the points on the Mullen

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.760 
mask and all the points on the Mullen
and<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.460> can<00:03:20.670> align<00:03:21.180> each<00:03:21.810> point<00:03:22.080> on<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.500> frame

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
and I can align each point on the frame

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.699 
and I can align each point on the frame
like<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.190> with<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.800> point<00:03:25.800> to<00:03:26.720> okay<00:03:27.720> point

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
like a with the point to okay point

like a with the point to okay point
three<00:03:30.230> generally<00:03:31.230> I<00:03:31.260> want<00:03:31.560> something<00:03:31.890> like

three generally I want something like
this<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.700> suppose<00:03:33.120> but<00:03:33.750> I<00:03:33.989> can<00:03:34.350> also<00:03:34.500> control

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
this I suppose but I can also control

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.410 
this I suppose but I can also control
point<00:03:35.340> B<00:03:35.810> midpoint<00:03:37.310> this<00:03:38.310> will<00:03:38.520> allow<00:03:38.910> me<00:03:39.150> to

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
point B midpoint this will allow me to

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.550 
point B midpoint this will allow me to
place<00:03:39.750> my<00:03:40.550> mullion<00:03:41.550> with<00:03:41.850> great<00:03:42.239> accuracy<00:03:42.959> on

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.770 
place my mullion with great accuracy on
the<00:03:44.040> window<00:03:44.910> something<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:46.230> this<00:03:47.150> and<00:03:48.150> now<00:03:48.510> I

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
the window something like this and now I

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.220 
the window something like this and now I
cannot

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
cannot

to show in this presentation is that I
can<00:04:05.379> have<00:04:05.730> let's<00:04:06.730> say<00:04:07.319> 150<00:04:09.900> ok<00:04:10.900> I<00:04:11.080> can<00:04:11.379> select

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
can have let's say 150 ok I can select

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:19.680 
can have let's say 150 ok I can select
this<00:04:11.950> and<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:12.879> can<00:04:17.190> pretty<00:04:18.190> cool<00:04:18.579> here<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.150> I

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
this and I can pretty cool here and I

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.330 
this and I can pretty cool here and I
can<00:04:19.900> go<00:04:20.079> with<00:04:20.489> this<00:04:21.489> one<00:04:21.549> I<00:04:22.620> do<00:04:23.620> something<00:04:24.190> like

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
can go with this one I do something like

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.590 
can go with this one I do something like
this<00:04:24.660> it<00:04:25.660> is<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.139> middle<00:04:26.260> of<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.560> segment<00:04:27.160> I

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
this it is the middle of the segment I

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.710 
this it is the middle of the segment I
also<00:04:28.600> get<00:04:29.530> will<00:04:30.070> be<00:04:30.280> able<00:04:30.460> to<00:04:30.820> do<00:04:31.000> it<00:04:31.030> on<00:04:31.389> one

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
also get will be able to do it on one

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.760 
also get will be able to do it on one
side<00:04:31.780> only<00:04:32.080> like<00:04:33.010> this

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
side only like this

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.290 
side only like this
okay<00:04:35.610> or<00:04:36.569> even<00:04:37.560> more<00:04:38.190> complicated<00:04:38.639> if<00:04:39.150> I

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
okay or even more complicated if I

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.490 
okay or even more complicated if I
wanted<00:04:39.720> to<00:04:40.940> it's<00:04:41.940> pretty<00:04:42.449> stupid<00:04:42.750> but<00:04:42.960> it's

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
wanted to it's pretty stupid but it's

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.740 
wanted to it's pretty stupid but it's
it's<00:04:46.500> difficult<00:04:47.460> to<00:04:47.610> compute<00:04:47.970> it<00:04:48.180> just<00:04:48.629> a

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
it's difficult to compute it just a
