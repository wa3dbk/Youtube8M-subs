Billy Klein his fishing partner says

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.209 
Billy Klein his fishing partner says
sensabaugh<00:01:56.780> is<00:01:56.840> good<00:01:57.140> at<00:01:57.289> both<00:01:57.409> fishing<00:01:57.920> and

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
sensabaugh is good at both fishing and

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.340 
sensabaugh is good at both fishing and
football<00:01:58.850> he's<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.689> pretty<00:01:59.929> good<00:02:00.109> fisherman

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
football he's a pretty good fisherman

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.989 
football he's a pretty good fisherman
and<00:02:00.710> I<00:02:00.770> know<00:02:00.829> if<00:02:01.100> he<00:02:01.549> wasn't<00:02:01.789> a<00:02:01.820> very<00:02:01.909> good

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:01.999 
and I know if he wasn't a very good

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:03.219 
and I know if he wasn't a very good
football<00:02:02.359> player<00:02:02.570> he<00:02:02.719> probably<00:02:02.899> wouldn't<00:02:03.140> be

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
football player he probably wouldn't be

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.690 
football player he probably wouldn't be
playing<00:02:03.380> for<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.649> team<00:02:03.770> like<00:02:03.829> the<00:02:04.100> Cowboys

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
playing for a team like the Cowboys

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.580 
playing for a team like the Cowboys
so<00:02:04.880> I'd<00:02:05.479> say<00:02:05.659> he's<00:02:05.810> up<00:02:05.990> there<00:02:06.109> on<00:02:06.170> both<00:02:06.350> levels

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
so I'd say he's up there on both levels

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.740 
so I'd say he's up there on both levels
we're<00:02:07.159> here<00:02:07.460> tonight<00:02:07.579> with<00:02:07.969> our<00:02:08.119> a<00:02:08.149> game<00:02:08.450> and

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
we're here tonight with our a game and

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.240 
we're here tonight with our a game and
see<00:02:08.869> what<00:02:08.960> we<00:02:09.050> can<00:02:09.170> do<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.740> last<00:02:09.950> few<00:02:10.220> weeks

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
see what we can do the last few weeks

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.880 
see what we can do the last few weeks
had<00:02:10.520> a<00:02:10.550> fourth<00:02:10.850> place<00:02:11.090> in<00:02:11.300> two<00:02:11.450> third<00:02:11.660> places

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.170 

comparing<00:02:14.890> football<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.519> fishing<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:16.150> like

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
comparing football to fishing is like

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.839 
comparing football to fishing is like
comparing<00:02:16.840> apples<00:02:16.989> to<00:02:17.260> oranges<00:02:17.700> fishing<00:02:18.700> is<00:02:18.819> a

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
comparing apples to oranges fishing is a

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.240 
comparing apples to oranges fishing is a
lot<00:02:19.090> less<00:02:19.330> physical<00:02:19.870> both<00:02:20.440> sports<00:02:20.860> have<00:02:21.220> their

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
lot less physical both sports have their

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.110 
lot less physical both sports have their
ups<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.819> downs<00:02:23.250> there<00:02:24.250> we<00:02:24.400> go<00:02:24.580> that's<00:02:24.849> what<00:02:24.940> we

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
ups and downs there we go that's what we

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.970 
ups and downs there we go that's what we
need<00:02:25.299> right<00:02:25.330> there<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.930> think<00:02:26.200> that's<00:02:26.379> 18<00:02:26.709> in<00:02:26.860> it

need right there I think that's 18 in it
losing<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.640> big<00:02:27.819> fish<00:02:28.030> is<00:02:28.150> probably<00:02:28.299> the

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
losing the big fish is probably the

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.539 
losing the big fish is probably the
