a4<00:01:37.829> chip<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.130> what<00:01:38.250> they<00:01:38.340> mainly<00:01:38.579> base<00:01:38.880> it

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
a4 chip is what they mainly base it

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.780 
a4 chip is what they mainly base it
around<00:01:39.470> all<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.950> different<00:01:41.189> processors<00:01:41.610> and

around all the different processors and

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.160 
around all the different processors and
a4<00:01:42.150> chip<00:01:42.180> combined<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.780> could<00:01:42.899> be<00:01:42.960> able<00:01:43.110> to

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
a4 chip combined I could be able to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.560 
a4 chip combined I could be able to
handle<00:01:43.439> all<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> high-definition<00:01:43.979> graphics

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
handle all the high-definition graphics

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.179 
handle all the high-definition graphics
on<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.750> iphone<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.320> be<00:01:46.439> able<00:01:46.500> handle<00:01:46.890> games

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
on the iphone to be able handle games

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.770 
on the iphone to be able handle games
and<00:01:47.549> blow<00:01:47.759> everything<00:01:48.060> faster<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.689> better

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
and blow everything faster and better

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.020 
and blow everything faster and better
than<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.530> previous<00:01:49.740> iphone<00:01:50.189> could<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.909> lot

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
than the previous iphone could and a lot

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.100 
than the previous iphone could and a lot
of<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.180> guys<00:01:51.240> are<00:01:51.479> worried<00:01:51.659> about<00:01:51.720> battery

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
of you guys are worried about battery

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.630 
of you guys are worried about battery
life<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.439> guys<00:01:52.590> know<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.009> battery<00:01:53.340> life<00:01:53.460> on

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
life you guys know the battery life on

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.819 
life you guys know the battery life on
the<00:01:53.850> iphone<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.390> not<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.780> greatest<00:01:54.990> well<00:01:55.590> now

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the iphone is not the greatest well now

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.310 
the iphone is not the greatest well now
with<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> new<00:01:56.399> iphone<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.509> battery<00:01:57.899> life<00:01:57.960> is

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
with the new iphone the battery life is

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.679 
with the new iphone the battery life is
the<00:01:59.219> battery<00:01:59.460> itself<00:01:59.579> which<00:01:59.909> means<00:02:00.240> sixteen

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
the battery itself which means sixteen

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.480 
the battery itself which means sixteen
percent<00:02:00.930> bigger<00:02:01.200> than<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.500> current<00:02:01.710> one<00:02:01.829> so

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
percent bigger than the current one so

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.620 
percent bigger than the current one so
that's<00:02:02.640> obviously<00:02:02.880> going<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.329> give<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.509> more

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
that's obviously going to give you more

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.630 
that's obviously going to give you more

of normal the pixel ratio is 960 to 640
pixels<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:44.330> basically<00:02:45.330> gives<00:02:45.690> much<00:02:46.680> more

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
pixels that basically gives much more

to the screen itself can make everything
crisper<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:51.900> clearer<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.769> more<00:02:52.920> pictures

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
crisper and clearer the more pictures

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.190 
crisper and clearer the more pictures
you<00:02:53.370> have<00:02:53.400> are<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:54.269> more<00:02:54.450> detail<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:55.019> the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
you have are the more detail that the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.990 
you have are the more detail that the
device<00:02:55.410> is<00:02:55.590> able<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.920> give<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.790> that

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
device is able to give to you that that

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.090 
device is able to give to you that that
it's<00:02:57.540> able<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.110> spit<00:02:58.380> back<00:02:58.530> out<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.860> your<00:02:58.980> eyes

and what you're able to see so the more

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.210 
and what you're able to see so the more
picture<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.380> better<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.830> in<00:03:01.920> this<00:03:02.010> case

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
picture is the better and in this case

iphone you have much better cameras
that's<00:03:13.320> right<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.590> said<00:03:13.620> cameras<00:03:14.220> with<00:03:14.370> an<00:03:14.489> S

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
that's right I said cameras with an S

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.610 
that's right I said cameras with an S
the<00:03:15.150> main<00:03:15.360> camera<00:03:15.690> on<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.959> device<00:03:16.200> is<00:03:16.380> still

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
the main camera on the device is still

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.890 
the main camera on the device is still
five<00:03:16.950> megapixels<00:03:17.670> nothing<00:03:17.970> changed<00:03:18.299> a<00:03:18.510> lot

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
five megapixels nothing changed a lot

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.440 
five megapixels nothing changed a lot
with<00:03:19.079> that<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:20.280> it<00:03:20.489> also<00:03:20.610> has<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.820> higher<00:03:21.000> ISO

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
with that and it also has a higher ISO

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.910 
with that and it also has a higher ISO
so<00:03:21.720> that's<00:03:21.900> basically<00:03:22.110> going<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.650> allow<00:03:22.860> you

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
on the prototype like I said not much

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.330 
on the prototype like I said not much
has<00:04:04.049> changed<00:04:04.079> with<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.530> prototype<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.160> this

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
has changed with a prototype to this

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.180 
has changed with a prototype to this
legitimate<00:04:05.820> now<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:06.390> feel<00:04:06.870> device<00:04:07.140> there<00:04:08.040> is<00:04:08.160> a
