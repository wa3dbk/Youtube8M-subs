limited<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.299> bayview<00:04:06.900> free<00:04:07.769> fall<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.250> strike

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
limited the bayview free fall and strike

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.580 
limited the bayview free fall and strike
zone<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.390> that<00:04:09.540> is<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:09.930> those<00:04:10.200> are<00:04:10.230> really<00:04:10.470> the

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
zone and that is it those are really the

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.670 
zone and that is it those are really the
only<00:04:10.680> small<00:04:11.310> maps<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:11.880> kind<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.500> tremor<00:04:13.500> is

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
only small maps and kind of tremor is

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.920 
only small maps and kind of tremor is
pretty<00:04:13.950> good<00:04:14.070> I<00:04:14.220> guess<00:04:14.250> but<00:04:15.090> we<00:04:15.690> need<00:04:15.840> those

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
pretty good I guess but we need those

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.900 
pretty good I guess but we need those
smaller<00:04:16.290> maps<00:04:16.530> that<00:04:16.680> makes<00:04:17.040> call<00:04:17.310> of<00:04:17.400> duty<00:04:17.640> fun

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
smaller maps that makes call of duty fun

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.490 
smaller maps that makes call of duty fun

especially without ground war you got to

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.339 
especially without ground war you got to
have<00:04:19.620> that<00:04:19.650> fast<00:04:20.100> action<00:04:20.370> paced<00:04:20.970> game<00:04:21.150> play<00:04:21.570> to

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
using SMGs and constantly rushing and

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.909 
using SMGs and constantly rushing and
stuff<00:04:26.150> like<00:04:26.270> that<00:04:26.330> maps<00:04:27.080> like<00:04:27.259> Stonehaven<00:04:27.830> you

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
stuff like that maps like Stonehaven you

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:28.929 
stuff like that maps like Stonehaven you
can't<00:04:28.129> do<00:04:28.280> that<00:04:28.460> it's<00:04:28.639> kind<00:04:28.789> of<00:04:28.819> more

00:04:28.929 --> 00:04:28.939 
can't do that it's kind of more

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:31.210 
can't do that it's kind of more
slow-paced<00:04:29.509> so<00:04:30.259> I'm<00:04:30.530> really<00:04:30.680> excited<00:04:31.009> about

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
slow-paced so I'm really excited about

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.610 
slow-paced so I'm really excited about
that<00:04:31.520> the<00:04:31.759> map<00:04:31.939> hat<00:04:32.150> for<00:04:32.479> those<00:04:32.629> reasons<00:04:32.870> so

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
that the map hat for those reasons so

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.909 
that the map hat for those reasons so
we're<00:04:33.740> gonna<00:04:33.830> get<00:04:34.219> four<00:04:34.849> new<00:04:35.060> maps<00:04:35.449> called

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
we're gonna get four new maps called

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.459 
we're gonna get four new maps called
behemoth<00:04:36.919> ruins<00:04:37.729> unearthed<00:04:38.389> and<00:04:38.689> collision

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:39.469 
behemoth ruins unearthed and collision

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:42.279 
behemoth ruins unearthed and collision
so<00:04:40.009> behemoth<00:04:40.639> is<00:04:40.759> kind<00:04:41.300> of<00:04:41.360> like<00:04:41.449> an<00:04:41.599> oil<00:04:41.840> rig

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
so behemoth is kind of like an oil rig

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:43.600 
so behemoth is kind of like an oil rig
I'm<00:04:42.560> not<00:04:42.680> on<00:04:42.830> a<00:04:42.919> percent<00:04:43.189> sure<00:04:43.340> but<00:04:43.520> I<00:04:43.550> know

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
I'm not on a percent sure but I know

I'm not on a percent sure but I know
it's<00:04:43.879> kind<00:04:44.090> of<00:04:44.120> like<00:04:44.210> in<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.449> water<00:04:44.810> i<00:04:44.930> guess<00:04:45.259> i

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
it's kind of like in the water i guess i

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.080 
it's kind of like in the water i guess i
think<00:04:45.949> my<00:04:46.250> Omri<00:04:46.460> percent<00:04:46.699> sure<00:04:46.789> but<00:04:46.969> i<00:04:47.000> know

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
think my Omri percent sure but i know

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.809 
think my Omri percent sure but i know
it's<00:04:47.509> very<00:04:47.689> narrow<00:04:48.110> it's<00:04:48.289> very<00:04:48.469> small<00:04:48.860> and<00:04:49.099> it

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:49.819 
it's very narrow it's very small and it

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.149 
it's very narrow it's very small and it
looks<00:04:49.969> very<00:04:50.030> interesting<00:04:50.509> I<00:04:51.050> guess<00:04:51.159> then

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:52.159 
looks very interesting I guess then

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:54.189 
looks very interesting I guess then
ruins<00:04:52.610> is<00:04:52.849> based<00:04:53.120> in<00:04:53.300> Mexico<00:04:53.840> is<00:04:53.960> gonna<00:04:54.110> be

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
ruins is based in Mexico is gonna be

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.830 
ruins is based in Mexico is gonna be
probably<00:04:54.439> a<00:04:54.590> small<00:04:54.949> it<00:04:55.490> reminds<00:04:56.120> me<00:04:56.300> of<00:04:56.419> a<00:04:56.509> 2d

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
probably a small it reminds me of a 2d

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.020 
probably a small it reminds me of a 2d
to<00:04:57.080> face<00:04:57.530> off<00:04:57.800> Matt<00:04:58.009> from<00:04:58.159> modern<00:04:58.400> warfare<00:04:58.550> 3<00:04:58.729> i

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
to face off Matt from modern warfare 3 i

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.300 
to face off Matt from modern warfare 3 i
think<00:04:59.539> i'm<00:05:00.110> not<00:05:00.259> sure<00:05:00.440> what<00:05:00.710> it's<00:05:00.860> called<00:05:01.129> but

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
think i'm not sure what it's called but

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.249 
think i'm not sure what it's called but
it<00:05:01.520> reminds<00:05:02.030> me<00:05:02.180> kind<00:05:02.539> of<00:05:02.569> like<00:05:02.750> that<00:05:02.930> you<00:05:03.110> guys

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
it reminds me kind of like that you guys

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:05.469 
it reminds me kind of like that you guys
probably<00:05:03.379> know<00:05:03.590> what<00:05:03.680> I'm<00:05:03.770> talking<00:05:04.129> about<00:05:04.479> but

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
probably know what I'm talking about but

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.300 
probably know what I'm talking about but
yeah<00:05:05.750> that<00:05:05.900> map<00:05:06.050> looks<00:05:06.259> pretty<00:05:06.440> good<00:05:06.620> then<00:05:07.190> we

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
yeah that map looks pretty good then we

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.969 
yeah that map looks pretty good then we
have<00:05:07.490> unearthed<00:05:08.360> which<00:05:08.870> is<00:05:09.169> kind<00:05:09.379> of<00:05:09.409> like<00:05:09.500> a<00:05:09.560> i

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
have unearthed which is kind of like a i

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.369 
have unearthed which is kind of like a i
guess<00:05:10.159> a<00:05:10.310> construction<00:05:11.210> site<00:05:11.539> of<00:05:11.780> you<00:05:12.259> know

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379 
guess a construction site of you know

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:14.469 
guess a construction site of you know
they're<00:05:12.500> like<00:05:12.789> excavating<00:05:13.789> something<00:05:14.240> it's<00:05:14.389> a

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
they're like excavating something it's a

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.629 
they're like excavating something it's a
dome<00:05:14.690> remake<00:05:15.199> which<00:05:15.379> is<00:05:15.500> very<00:05:15.680> good<00:05:15.770> and<00:05:16.129> then

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
dome remake which is very good and then

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.939 
dome remake which is very good and then
we<00:05:16.759> got<00:05:16.879> collision<00:05:17.539> which<00:05:18.080> is<00:05:18.289> a<00:05:18.650> bridge<00:05:19.159> and<00:05:19.490> a

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
we got collision which is a bridge and a

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.519 
we got collision which is a bridge and a
boat<00:05:21.949> that<00:05:22.729> crashed<00:05:23.150> together<00:05:23.389> and<00:05:23.840> it<00:05:24.199> formed

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:24.529 
boat that crashed together and it formed

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:25.330 
boat that crashed together and it formed
a<00:05:24.560> map<00:05:24.770> so<00:05:24.800> that's<00:05:25.039> gonna<00:05:25.159> be<00:05:25.219> very

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
a map so that's gonna be very

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.100 
a map so that's gonna be very
interesting<00:05:26.090> i<00:05:26.180> guess<00:05:26.210> that's<00:05:26.569> the<00:05:26.779> only

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
interesting i guess that's the only

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.689 
interesting i guess that's the only
problem<00:05:27.500> I<00:05:27.529> see<00:05:27.560> on<00:05:27.770> that<00:05:27.889> map<00:05:28.099> is<00:05:28.129> it<00:05:28.430> looks<00:05:28.639> a

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
problem I see on that map is it looks a

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:30.040 
problem I see on that map is it looks a
little<00:05:28.789> cluttered<00:05:29.180> but<00:05:29.360> that's<00:05:29.779> pretty<00:05:29.900> much

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
little cluttered but that's pretty much

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.600 
little cluttered but that's pretty much
it<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:30.379> then<00:05:30.469> of<00:05:30.560> course<00:05:30.590> we<00:05:30.860> got<00:05:31.009> extinction

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
it and then of course we got extinction

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.209 
it and then of course we got extinction
and<00:05:31.729> the<00:05:32.599> Ripper<00:05:32.930> DLC<00:05:33.560> gun<00:05:33.740> so<00:05:33.860> anyways<00:05:34.099> guys

hopefully<00:05:34.699> did<00:05:35.000> enjoy<00:05:35.240> if<00:05:35.360> we<00:05:35.449> could<00:05:35.569> hit<00:05:35.629> 400

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:36.469 
hopefully did enjoy if we could hit 400
