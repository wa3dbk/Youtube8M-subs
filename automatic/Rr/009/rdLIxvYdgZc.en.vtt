00:00:04.962 --> 00:00:07.698
Ahly Club, Gezira, Cairo 
15 March 2012 

00:00:06.925 --> 00:00:10.806
Wait for us at Heavenâ€™s gates

00:00:10.806 --> 00:00:13.600
O, martyr sleep fast and be happy

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.728
Ultras Ahlawy demand retribution

00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:23.811
You're in heaven now, martyr 

00:00:48.217 --> 00:00:50.217
Mahmoud Mukhtar

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:53.400
The demands have been known 
from the very first day

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.788
We demand fair investigations

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:57.061
We haven't seen fair investigations

00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:59.432
All they did was arrest a few people

00:00:59.432 --> 00:01:02.081
There are very powerful people 
behind this incident..

00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:03.694
..that must be brought to justice,

00:01:03.694 --> 00:01:06.462
..even if they were state officials

00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:08.515
The revolution erupted so that the people..

00:01:08.515 --> 00:01:11.850
..who corrupted our political and social life..

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.795
..would be brought to justice

00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:17.051
These were the demands of the revolution

00:01:17.051 --> 00:01:19.075
These demands have not been realized

00:01:19.075 --> 00:01:23.296
We are demanding speedy retribution 
and fair investigations

00:01:23.296 --> 00:01:28.104
Retribution, justice

00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:29.190
Ahmed, Ultras Ahlawy

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.315
We put out the call over the internet 
the day before yesterday..

00:01:32.315 --> 00:01:34.820
..but we hadn't determined 
where we would be heading

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.220
Today, we decided to head 
to the Supreme Court

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.618
We came to relay a message:

00:01:38.618 --> 00:01:40.819
..we will not abandon the martyrs' rights,

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.826
..and that all responsibility lies on..

00:01:42.826 --> 00:01:45.611
..the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces(SCAF)..

00:01:45.611 --> 00:01:47.086
..as it is ruling the country

00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:49.894
If they successfully secured the elections 
for 85 million people,

00:01:49.894 --> 00:01:52.643
..how are they not able to secure 
a football match for 20,000 people

00:01:52.643 --> 00:01:54.010
Field Marshal Tantawi and the SCAF..

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.216
..are fully responsible 
for the Port Said massacre

00:01:59.186 --> 00:02:05.560
You're in heaven now, martyr

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.527
Ahmed Eid, Executive Office member 
Revolution Youth Coalition

00:02:12.527 --> 00:02:14.955
I participated today as the Ultras youth..

00:02:14.955 --> 00:02:16.895
..who were attacked in Port Said..

00:02:16.895 --> 00:02:19.449
..are the ones being summoned for trial

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:22.636
Ahmed Idrees and a number of youth..

00:02:22.636 --> 00:02:25.931
..were giving their testimonies 
to the People's Assembly..

00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:29.667
..and the investigative committees 
to help them find the perpetrators

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:32.718
Suddenly, we found the prosecution 
arresting the youth..

00:02:32.718 --> 00:02:35.591
..that were attacked and whose colleagues..

00:02:35.591 --> 00:02:37.199
..were killed in Port Said

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:39.799
The message has reached the SCAF..

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.578
..that the Ultras youth did not become afraid..

00:02:42.578 --> 00:02:44.369
..after what happened in Port Said..

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:47.233
..and that they are willing 
to continue their sacrifices..

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.794
..until they achieve retribution 
for the Port Said martyrs

00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:52.234
They killed my brother in the stadium..

00:02:52.234 --> 00:02:57.625
..and the Ministry of Interior 
just stood there watching
