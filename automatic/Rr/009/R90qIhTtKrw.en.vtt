00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.349
 how about friends how are i am ryder 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.509
 here again bringing them the map of the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.100
 today and this time a map that I think 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.039
 that they from Australia that is a map that 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.539
 is what many of you already know 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.279
 that the lord here you put a series of 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.320
 playing on this map but for minecraft 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:32.340
 of pc but the velocity friends and their 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.350
 assistant digger 135 have made us a 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.200
 map and we have made the world of 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.719
 watermelons to be clearer for our 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.579
 360 team minecraft and I hope so 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.340
 that you like because the truth has 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.559
 it's been great, it's taken a lot 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.660
 work have used more than 100 thousand 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.829
 blocks on this map because it's not 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.180
 only in the remaining part of the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.980
 center there are watermelons for other long and 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.600
 because the truth takes a lot of work to 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.980
 Although it has no buildings or 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.010
 nothing 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.300
 just thinking about putting as many blocks as 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.620
 the truth is a lot of work and 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.190
 a lot of time that they have taken 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.110
 I think and it's not only in the part of 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.400
 up because the watermelons are up 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.070
 down they 're going to see that, well, it's good 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.680
 challenges I'll leave it in the description are 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.340
 how to find hidden things to be a 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.050
 house bed one of the rules that I think 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.380
 which is the only thing that is not to eat watermelons 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.570
 but that's optional I think 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.670
 well because well well here is 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.090
 watermelons everywhere that makes the 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.950
 I play a little bit more hardcore then 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.400
 they should not eat watermelons but it is not 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.070
 as a mandatory good friends I hope that 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.480
 like the map a greeting for speed and 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.570
 that have guided me the subject for yesterday and 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.910
 that you liked it a lot and then 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.800
 I hope that you also already know that 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.930
 the download link in the description 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.700
 like that video that costs nothing to me 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.700
 I'm ryder and until next time 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.110
 but 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.650
 no no 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.879
