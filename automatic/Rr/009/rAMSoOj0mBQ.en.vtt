00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
of on the various airplane what kind of

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.319 
of on the various airplane what kind of
changes<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.609> make<00:00:59.789> with<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
changes that you have to make with the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.090 
changes that you have to make with the
various<00:01:00.660> airframe<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.559> make<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.859> training

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
various airframe to make it a training

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.689 
various airframe to make it a training

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
airplane

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.340 
airplane
well<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.120> identical<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.809> virus<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.290> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
well it's identical to the virus and the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.990 
well it's identical to the virus and the
exception<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.159> got<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.610> stronger

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
exception that it's got a stronger

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.789 
exception that it's got a stronger
undercarriage<00:01:06.720> for<00:01:06.750> training<00:01:07.229> environment

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
undercarriage for training environment

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.890 
undercarriage for training environment
it's<00:01:08.159> got<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> slightly<00:01:08.670> shorter<00:01:08.790> wing<00:01:09.330> with

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
it's got a slightly shorter wing with

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.929 
it's got a slightly shorter wing with
different<00:01:10.260> wing<00:01:10.470> tips<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.280> reduces<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
different wing tips it reduces the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.149 
different wing tips it reduces the
performance<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.229> standard<00:01:13.619> virus<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.130> it

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
performance of the standard virus so it

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.730 
performance of the standard virus so it
really<00:01:14.640> fits<00:01:14.850> into<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.210> LSA<00:01:15.630> category<00:01:16.200> we've

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
really fits into the LSA category we've

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.890 
really fits into the LSA category we've
got<00:01:17.040> rid<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.460> spoilers<00:01:18.180> or<00:01:18.330> air<00:01:18.450> brakes<00:01:18.689> in

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
got rid of the spoilers or air brakes in

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.679 
got rid of the spoilers or air brakes in
the<00:01:18.930> wing<00:01:19.170> we've<00:01:19.830> removed<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.400> fuel<00:01:20.820> location

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the wing we've removed the fuel location

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.810 
the wing we've removed the fuel location
to<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.869> spot<00:01:22.500> which<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.830> easy<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.310> fill<00:01:23.490> out<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.759> a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
to a spot which is easy to fill out of a

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.210 
to a spot which is easy to fill out of a
navigator<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.840> we've<00:01:25.830> just<00:01:25.860> sort<00:01:26.159> of

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
navigator and we've just sort of

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.310 
navigator and we've just sort of
toughened<00:01:26.670> up<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.970> package<00:01:27.360> because<00:01:28.140> most

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
toughened up the package because most

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.749 
toughened up the package because most
people<00:01:28.560> sterile<00:01:28.770> aircraft<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.340> past<00:01:29.549> have

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
people sterile aircraft in the past have

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.340 
people sterile aircraft in the past have
been<00:01:29.880> designed<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:30.450> private<00:01:30.840> owners<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
been designed for private owners and

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.590 
been designed for private owners and
we've<00:01:32.310> toughened<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.820> one<00:01:33.000> up<00:01:33.180> for<00:01:33.329> flying

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
we've toughened this one up for flying

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.050 
we've toughened this one up for flying
schools<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:35.250> managed<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.579> get<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> price

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
schools and we managed to get the price

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.200 
schools and we managed to get the price
really<00:01:36.509> competitive<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.700> has<00:01:38.909> been<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
really competitive so it has been the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.789 
really competitive so it has been the
same<00:01:39.390> engine<00:01:39.780> as<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.079> virus<00:01:40.229> yeah<00:01:40.619> 80

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
same engine as the virus yeah 80
