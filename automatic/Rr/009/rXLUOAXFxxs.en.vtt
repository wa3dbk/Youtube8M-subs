for<00:00:19.250> steelhead<00:00:20.740> but<00:00:21.740> I<00:00:21.770> have<00:00:22.700> a<00:00:22.730> feeling<00:00:23.180> that

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
for steelhead but I have a feeling that

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.820 
for steelhead but I have a feeling that
this<00:00:23.480> would<00:00:23.660> be<00:00:23.779> a<00:00:23.810> very<00:00:24.050> good<00:00:24.260> fly<00:00:26.619> tying<00:00:27.619> it

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
this would be a very good fly tying it

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.380 
this would be a very good fly tying it
on<00:00:27.950> a<00:00:28.270> pro<00:00:29.270> sport<00:00:30.110> fish<00:00:30.650> your<00:00:31.240> micro<00:00:32.240> tube<00:00:32.570> I

on a pro sport fish your micro tube I

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.240 
on a pro sport fish your micro tube I
know<00:00:35.390> you<00:00:35.570> can<00:00:35.840> hardly<00:00:36.110> stand<00:00:36.500> it<00:00:36.770> I<00:00:36.950> think

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
know you can hardly stand it I think

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.780 
know you can hardly stand it I think
it's<00:00:37.370> gonna<00:00:37.520> be<00:00:37.610> a<00:00:37.640> great<00:00:37.970> fly<00:00:39.430> for<00:00:40.430> smallmouth

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
fire tiger holographic flash abou the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.969 
fire tiger holographic flash abou the
idea<00:01:08.299> is<00:01:08.390> you<00:01:08.509> can<00:01:08.689> you<00:01:08.900> can<00:01:09.080> adapt<00:01:09.439> this<00:01:09.740> to

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
idea is you can you can adapt this to

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.550 
idea is you can you can adapt this to
all<00:01:10.159> sorts<00:01:10.729> of<00:01:11.439> colored<00:01:12.439> phases<00:01:14.079> and<00:01:15.079> put<00:01:15.409> on<00:01:15.530> a

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
all sorts of colored phases and put on a

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:23.520 
all sorts of colored phases and put on a
little<00:01:16.310> just<00:01:16.579> a<00:01:16.729> pinch<00:01:17.210> of<00:01:17.600> marabou<00:01:21.969> this<00:01:22.969> is<00:01:23.240> a

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
little just a pinch of marabou this is a

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:35.110 
little just a pinch of marabou this is a
very<00:01:24.530> nice<00:01:25.490> fly<00:01:26.329> that's<00:01:27.049> easy<00:01:27.499> to<00:01:28.009> tie

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.280 

but<00:01:36.120> it's<00:01:36.240> very<00:01:36.360> fishy<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.900> allow<00:01:40.260> it

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
but it's very fishy and it allow it

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.890 
but it's very fishy and it allow it
gives<00:01:40.830> you<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> opportunity<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.880> try<00:01:42.390> some<00:01:42.810> of

gives you the opportunity to try some of

gives you the opportunity to try some of
your<00:01:43.050> techniques<00:01:43.350> like<00:01:44.480> winding<00:01:45.480> a<00:01:45.660> hackle

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
your techniques like winding a hackle

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.080 
your techniques like winding a hackle

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
it by the butt of the hackle so now

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.760 
it by the butt of the hackle so now
we're<00:01:59.070> going<00:01:59.190> to<00:01:59.250> use<00:01:59.460> I'm<00:02:00.360> gonna<00:02:00.600> what<00:02:01.530> that

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
we're going to use I'm gonna what that

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.560 
we're going to use I'm gonna what that
marabou<00:02:02.250> wouldn't<00:02:02.700> do<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:02.970> it<00:02:03.060> was<00:02:03.180> purple

you<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.210> do<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.450> with<00:02:15.630> one<00:02:15.870> hand<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.380> can<00:02:16.530> do

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
you can do it with one hand you can do

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.710 
you can do it with one hand you can do
with<00:02:16.800> two<00:02:17.010> hands<00:02:17.520> just<00:02:19.100> kind<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.330> lash<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.600> on

there<00:02:25.160> this<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.220> kind<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.390> way<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.600> would

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
there this is kind of the way you would

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.960 
there this is kind of the way you would
do<00:02:28.020> if<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.290> were<00:02:28.410> spinning<00:02:28.680> deer<00:02:29.130> here<00:02:29.490> I

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.900 

could<00:02:32.970> put<00:02:33.240> more<00:02:33.660> on<00:02:33.690> if<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.470> wanted<00:02:35.040> or<00:02:35.280> unless

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
could put more on if I wanted or unless

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.290 
could put more on if I wanted or unless
entire<00:02:38.910> whip<00:02:39.180> finish<00:02:39.510> there<00:02:41.120> sometimes<00:02:42.120> I'll

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
entire whip finish there sometimes I'll

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.979 
entire whip finish there sometimes I'll
tie<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.600> whip<00:02:43.080> finishes<00:02:44.450> so<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.570> looks<00:02:45.750> kind

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
tie to whip finishes so that looks kind

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.890 
tie to whip finishes so that looks kind
of<00:02:46.020> awkward<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:46.940> I'm<00:02:47.940> going<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.540> brush<00:02:48.840> that

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
of awkward but I'm going to brush that

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.170 
of awkward but I'm going to brush that
back<00:02:51.860> yeah<00:02:52.860> just<00:02:53.160> have<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.550> steal<00:02:53.880> yourself

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
lasered up in that brush you could reuse

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.910 
lasered up in that brush you could reuse
it<00:03:03.739> but<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.920> strands<00:03:05.250> will<00:03:05.489> be<00:03:05.640> short

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
it but the strands will be short

the<00:03:07.920> slays<00:03:08.220> are<00:03:08.400> dubbed<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.760> more<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.000> use<00:03:09.330> it

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
the slays are dubbed the more I use it

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.180 
the slays are dubbed the more I use it
the<00:03:09.600> more<00:03:09.870> impressed<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.440> am<00:03:10.470> with<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:13.190> it

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
the more impressed I am with it it

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.000 
the more impressed I am with it it
doesn't<00:03:14.459> hold<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.970> lot<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.180> water<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:16.350> really

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
doesn't hold a lot of water so it really

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.590 
doesn't hold a lot of water so it really
