00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
think in the Blitz game mode so it would

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.139 
think in the Blitz game mode so it would
not<00:01:15.710> find<00:01:15.920> any<00:01:16.130> matches<00:01:16.310> for<00:01:16.460> me<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:16.880> I<00:01:16.909> had<00:01:17.119> a

not find any matches for me so I had a

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.179 
not find any matches for me so I had a

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
hop on over to domination to do this but

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.340 
hop on over to domination to do this but
i'm<00:01:19.310> using<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.609> same<00:01:19.789> exact<00:01:20.090> gun<00:01:20.270> same<00:01:21.079> exact

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
one on the right is clearly better that

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.679 
one on the right is clearly better that
was<00:01:31.219> just<00:01:31.399> a<00:01:31.490> no-brainer<00:01:31.700> I<00:01:32.090> know<00:01:32.179> everyone

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
was just a no-brainer I know everyone

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.929 
was just a no-brainer I know everyone
knows<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.530> everyone<00:01:33.619> didn't<00:01:34.369> know<00:01:34.490> that<00:01:34.759> the

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.330 
knows and everyone didn't know that the
xbox<00:01:35.240> one<00:01:35.479> or<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.719> next<00:01:35.869> generation<00:01:36.380> would

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
xbox one or the next generation would

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.590 
xbox one or the next generation would
look<00:01:37.520> better<00:01:37.909> than<00:01:38.149> the<00:01:38.240> previous<00:01:38.570> generation

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
look better than the previous generation

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.719 
look better than the previous generation
and<00:01:39.140> it's<00:01:39.259> just<00:01:39.439> that's<00:01:39.530> a<00:01:39.649> no-brainer<00:01:39.799> but<00:01:40.609> if

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
and it's just that's a no-brainer but if

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.130 
and it's just that's a no-brainer but if
a<00:01:40.850> lot<00:01:40.999> of<00:01:41.090> people<00:01:41.210> you're<00:01:41.390> curious<00:01:41.659> on<00:01:41.899> how

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
a lot of people you're curious on how

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.310 
a lot of people you're curious on how
big<00:01:42.679> the<00:01:42.710> step<00:01:43.100> up<00:01:43.280> is<00:01:43.490> to<00:01:43.850> next-gen<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.450> what

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
big the step up is to next-gen and what

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.289 
big the step up is to next-gen and what
actually<00:01:45.619> difference<00:01:46.520> is<00:01:46.670> in<00:01:46.820> like<00:01:47.030> what<00:01:47.210> the

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
actually difference is in like what the

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:48.880 
actually difference is in like what the
quality<00:01:47.630> comparisons<00:01:48.229> are<00:01:48.319> actually<00:01:48.649> like

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
quality comparisons are actually like

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.980 
quality comparisons are actually like
and<00:01:49.340> honestly<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:49.819> me<00:01:49.850> I<00:01:50.030> feel<00:01:50.179> it's<00:01:50.509> not<00:01:50.689> that

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
and honestly to me I feel it's not that

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.440 
and honestly to me I feel it's not that
different<00:01:51.229> but<00:01:52.159> one<00:01:52.369> on<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.609> right<00:01:52.789> the<00:01:53.119> xbox

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
different but one on the right the xbox

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.999 
different but one on the right the xbox
one<00:01:53.659> if<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:53.869> look<00:01:54.020> closely<00:01:54.229> at<00:01:54.409> my<00:01:54.499> camo<00:01:54.770> and

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
stuff you can see a little bit clearer

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.630

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
little bit more defined not only that if

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.340 
little bit more defined not only that if
you<00:02:02.329> guys<00:02:02.420> have<00:02:02.600> ever<00:02:02.719> messed<00:02:02.990> around<00:02:03.109> in

you're<00:02:05.509> familiar<00:02:05.659> with<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.020> sharpen<00:02:06.590> tool

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
you're familiar with the sharpen tool

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.230 
you're familiar with the sharpen tool
that's<00:02:07.219> pretty<00:02:07.399> much<00:02:07.520> all<00:02:07.700> it<00:02:07.850> looks<00:02:07.939> like<00:02:08.090> it

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
that's pretty much all it looks like it

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.609 
that's pretty much all it looks like it
looks<00:02:08.300> like<00:02:08.539> they<00:02:08.660> have<00:02:08.780> a<00:02:08.810> built-in<00:02:09.200> sharpen

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
looks like they have a built-in sharpen

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.290 
looks like they have a built-in sharpen
tool<00:02:09.800> on<00:02:09.890> this<00:02:10.069> game<00:02:10.310> or<00:02:10.550> in<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:10.940> system

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
tool on this game or in the system

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.970 
tool on this game or in the system
itself<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:11.900> that's<00:02:12.290> just<00:02:12.470> my<00:02:12.650> personal

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
itself and that's just my personal

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.890 
itself and that's just my personal
opinion<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.819> of<00:02:14.299> course<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.629> looks<00:02:14.780> better

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
opinion and of course it looks better

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.899 
opinion and of course it looks better
but<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:15.680> berries<00:02:15.950> with<00:02:16.099> every<00:02:16.760> game

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
but this berries with every game

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:17.890 
but this berries with every game
differently<00:02:17.330> because<00:02:17.569> like<00:02:17.780> with

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
differently because like with

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.340 
differently because like with
battlefield

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
battlefield

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.910 
battlefield
it<00:02:18.620> looks<00:02:18.860> god-awful<00:02:19.280> on<00:02:19.900> 316<00:02:20.900> ps3<00:02:21.410> but<00:02:21.830> it

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
it looks god-awful on 316 ps3 but it

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.370 
it looks god-awful on 316 ps3 but it
looks<00:02:22.070> phenomenal<00:02:22.490> and<00:02:22.850> xbox<00:02:23.150> one<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:23.330> ps4<00:02:23.510> so

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
looks phenomenal and xbox one and ps4 so

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.140 
looks phenomenal and xbox one and ps4 so
it's<00:02:24.560> just<00:02:24.680> like<00:02:24.830> certain<00:02:25.280> games<00:02:25.460> aren't<00:02:25.790> they

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
it's just like certain games aren't they

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.370 
it's just like certain games aren't they
don't<00:02:26.330> really<00:02:26.450> design<00:02:26.810> them<00:02:26.990> or<00:02:27.110> care<00:02:27.350> to

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
don't really design them or care to

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.680 
don't really design them or care to
design<00:02:27.770> them<00:02:27.980> on<00:02:28.160> previous<00:02:29.030> generations<00:02:29.570> of

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
design them on previous generations of

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.690 
design them on previous generations of
course<00:02:29.900> but<00:02:30.140> why<00:02:30.620> give<00:02:30.830> quality<00:02:30.980> props<00:02:31.490> for

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
course but why give quality props for

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.130 
course but why give quality props for
actually<00:02:32.000> sticking<00:02:32.210> to<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:32.720> making<00:02:32.900> their

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
actually sticking to it and making their

also just keep in mind that this is my

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.350 
also just keep in mind that this is my

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.850 
looks way different than the 360 version
but<00:02:44.720> it's<00:02:44.900> just<00:02:45.050> with<00:02:45.140> call<00:02:45.320> of<00:02:45.410> duty<00:02:45.590> i<00:02:45.620> don't

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
but there's a huge difference in those

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.420 
but there's a huge difference in those
so<00:03:10.550> it's<00:03:10.700> like<00:03:10.880> I<00:03:11.120> was<00:03:12.050> almost<00:03:12.230> like<00:03:12.770> expecting

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
so it's like I was almost like expecting
