sort of yeasty savoury touch to it

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.329 
sort of yeasty savoury touch to it

time<00:00:27.859> probably<00:00:28.359> at<00:00:29.359> least<00:00:30.019> a<00:00:30.259> year<00:00:30.849> and<00:00:31.849> so<00:00:32.599> I

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
time probably at least a year and so I

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.450 
time probably at least a year and so I
look<00:00:32.930> for<00:00:33.079> that<00:00:33.170> slight<00:00:33.590> sort<00:00:33.860> of<00:00:33.950> increase<00:00:34.250> in

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090

freshened and relatively fruity I quite

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.890 
freshened and relatively fruity I quite
like<00:01:17.870> them<00:01:18.170> if<00:01:18.860> possible<00:01:18.920> if<00:01:19.760> to<00:01:20.210> have<00:01:20.660> some

more<00:01:26.420> savory<00:01:27.170> characters<00:01:28.120> because<00:01:29.120> champagne

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
more savory characters because champagne

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.470 
more savory characters because champagne
has<00:01:30.410> an<00:01:30.800> atmosphere<00:01:30.980> between<00:01:31.550> the<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.210> level

has an atmosphere between the the level
of<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:32.690> liquid<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:33.200> cork<00:01:33.410> which<00:01:33.590> is

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
of the liquid and the cork which is

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.000 
of the liquid and the cork which is
mostly<00:01:34.340> co2<00:01:34.690> and<00:01:35.690> it<00:01:35.900> doesn't<00:01:36.410> have<00:01:36.590> so<00:01:36.860> much

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
mostly co2 and it doesn't have so much

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.670 
mostly co2 and it doesn't have so much
oxygen<00:01:37.250> which<00:01:38.210> is<00:01:38.390> what<00:01:38.570> makes<00:01:39.110> a<00:01:39.230> wine<00:01:39.380> aged

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
oxygen which is what makes a wine aged

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.970 
oxygen which is what makes a wine aged
and<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:40.310> just<00:01:40.520> go<00:01:40.700> less<00:01:41.030> interesting<00:01:41.830> you<00:01:42.830> can

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
and and just go less interesting you can

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.560 
and and just go less interesting you can
actually<00:01:43.160> keep<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:43.610> for<00:01:43.790> quite<00:01:43.940> a<00:01:44.000> while<00:01:44.270> I

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
actually keep it for quite a while I

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.960 
actually keep it for quite a while I
mean<00:01:44.780> when<00:01:44.960> I<00:01:44.990> buy<00:01:45.320> a<00:01:45.620> case<00:01:46.070> of<00:01:46.220> champagne<00:01:46.400> I<00:01:46.850> I

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
mean when I buy a case of champagne I I

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.570 
mean when I buy a case of champagne I I
leave<00:01:47.780> it<00:01:47.990> for<00:01:48.470> at<00:01:48.530> least<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:48.860> year<00:01:48.890> because<00:01:49.220> I

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
leave it for at least a year because I

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.420 
leave it for at least a year because I
find<00:01:50.210> that<00:01:50.510> for<00:01:50.690> my<00:01:50.870> taste<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:51.530> that's<00:01:52.190> not

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
find that for my taste and that's not

it will it will age faster if you if you

it will it will age faster if you if you
can't<00:02:17.490> give<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.990> there's<00:02:19.230> cool

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
can't give it that so that there's cool

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
necessarily ruin it but it will get much

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
older much faster the interesting thing

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.920 
older much faster the interesting thing
about<00:02:28.380> how<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:28.980> should<00:02:29.430> actually<00:02:30.180> place<00:02:30.900> it

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
about how you should actually place it

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.960 
about how you should actually place it
is<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:32.100> there<00:02:32.220> was<00:02:32.280> research<00:02:32.670> done<00:02:32.700> in

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
is that there was research done in

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.360 
is that there was research done in
Champaign<00:02:33.450> about<00:02:33.690> ten<00:02:33.930> years<00:02:34.170> ago<00:02:34.320> which<00:02:35.160> said

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
Champaign about ten years ago which said

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.630 
Champaign about ten years ago which said
that<00:02:35.400> actually<00:02:35.790> it's<00:02:36.750> better<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.640> store

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
that actually it's better to store

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.540 
that actually it's better to store
Champaign<00:02:39.210> standing<00:02:40.110> up<00:02:40.290> than<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.400> is

vertically on its side the most

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.550 
vertically on its side the most
important<00:02:48.390> thing<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.630> do<00:02:48.750> before<00:02:48.900> opening<00:02:49.470> a

important thing to do before opening a

important thing to do before opening a
bottle<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.890> sparkling<00:02:50.220> wine<00:02:50.490> is<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:51.480> make<00:02:51.600> sure

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
bottle of sparkling wine is to make sure

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.810 
bottle of sparkling wine is to make sure
it's<00:02:51.840> well<00:02:52.020> chilled<00:02:52.380> because<00:02:53.070> if<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.460> wine<00:02:53.640> is

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
it's well chilled because if a wine is

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.750 
it's well chilled because if a wine is
warm<00:02:54.060> if<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.540> fizzy<00:02:54.810> wine<00:02:54.960> is<00:02:55.140> warm<00:02:55.490> it<00:02:56.490> will<00:02:56.610> be

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
warm if a fizzy wine is warm it will be

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.030 
warm if a fizzy wine is warm it will be
much<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.120> cork<00:02:57.960> will<00:02:58.110> come<00:02:58.260> out<00:02:58.380> faster<00:02:58.860> and

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
much the cork will come out faster and

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.670 
much the cork will come out faster and
there<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.280> risk<00:02:59.520> that<00:02:59.850> you<00:03:00.390> may<00:03:00.540> get<00:03:00.720> fizzy

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
there is a risk that you may get fizzy

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.380 
there is a risk that you may get fizzy
wine<00:03:01.830> spilling<00:03:02.220> all<00:03:02.340> over<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.580> place<00:03:02.670> if<00:03:03.300> you

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
wine spilling all over the place if you

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.630 
wine spilling all over the place if you
cool<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.840> down<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.650> wine<00:03:04.800> is<00:03:04.980> less<00:03:05.160> risky<00:03:05.610> and

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
cool it down the wine is less risky and

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.230 
cool it down the wine is less risky and
it's<00:03:06.060> much<00:03:06.240> easier<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.810> cope<00:03:07.020> with<00:03:07.280> so<00:03:08.280> taking

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
it's much easier to cope with so taking

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.560 
it's much easier to cope with so taking
a<00:03:09.330> bottle<00:03:09.690> out<00:03:09.870> of<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.440> bucket<00:03:11.480> wiping<00:03:12.480> off

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
a bottle out of the bucket wiping off

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.120 
a bottle out of the bucket wiping off
the<00:03:12.600> drips<00:03:12.990> they're<00:03:13.920> almost<00:03:14.070> all<00:03:14.550> bottles<00:03:15.330> of

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
the drips they're almost all bottles of

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.830 
the drips they're almost all bottles of
sparkling<00:03:17.130> wine<00:03:17.310> have<00:03:17.670> either<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:18.120> little<00:03:18.360> tag

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
sparkling wine have either a little tag

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.470 
sparkling wine have either a little tag
like<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:19.580> or<00:03:20.580> else<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.000> thing<00:03:21.030> on<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.330> side

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
like that or else the thing on the side

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.860 
like that or else the thing on the side
to<00:03:22.230> show<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.470> how<00:03:22.740> you<00:03:22.800> can<00:03:23.160> take<00:03:23.430> it<00:03:23.610> off

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
to show you how you can take it off

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.930 
to show you how you can take it off
without<00:03:25.190> ripping<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.280> whole<00:03:26.430> thing<00:03:26.700> bit<00:03:26.910> a

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
without ripping the whole thing bit a

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.930 
without ripping the whole thing bit a
bit<00:03:27.330> and<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:27.959> here<00:03:28.230> I'm<00:03:28.380> pulling<00:03:29.250> this<00:03:29.550> round

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
bit and so here I'm pulling this round

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.680 
bit and so here I'm pulling this round
and<00:03:30.330> that<00:03:31.290> will<00:03:31.500> mean<00:03:31.709> that<00:03:31.740> I<00:03:31.950> can<00:03:32.250> just<00:03:32.690> take

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
and that will mean that I can just take

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.350 
and that will mean that I can just take
this<00:03:33.900> off<00:03:34.140> easily<00:03:34.650> okay<00:03:35.520> now<00:03:35.790> I'm<00:03:36.030> going<00:03:36.240> to

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
this off easily okay now I'm going to

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.240 
this off easily okay now I'm going to
unscrew<00:03:37.370> this<00:03:38.370> little<00:03:38.730> restrainer<00:03:39.360> here

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
unscrew this little restrainer here

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.540 
unscrew this little restrainer here
let's<00:03:41.250> just<00:03:41.459> move<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:42.140> and<00:03:43.340> as<00:03:44.340> it's

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
let's just move that and as it's

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.420 
let's just move that and as it's
saluting<00:03:45.000> I'm<00:03:45.180> keeping<00:03:45.750> my<00:03:45.900> thumb<00:03:46.260> over<00:03:46.560> the

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
saluting I'm keeping my thumb over the

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.080 
saluting I'm keeping my thumb over the
cork<00:03:48.180> so<00:03:48.870> there's<00:03:49.080> no<00:03:49.410> possibility<00:03:49.980> that<00:03:50.459> the

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
cork so there's no possibility that the

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.020 
cork so there's no possibility that the
cork<00:03:51.360> can<00:03:51.750> escape<00:03:52.110> and<00:03:52.320> then<00:03:52.680> I'm<00:03:52.950> just<00:03:53.730> going

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
cork can escape and then I'm just going

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.530 
cork can escape and then I'm just going
to<00:03:54.260> slip<00:03:55.260> this<00:03:55.440> off<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:56.640> now<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.880> cork<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.360> free

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
to slip this off so now the cork is free

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.790 
to slip this off so now the cork is free
to<00:03:57.660> come<00:03:57.840> out<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:01.050> next<00:04:01.260> thing<00:04:01.380> I'm<00:04:01.590> going<00:04:01.620> to

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
to come out the next thing I'm going to

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.620 
to come out the next thing I'm going to
do<00:04:02.010> is<00:04:02.810> hold<00:04:03.810> that<00:04:04.290> cork<00:04:04.940> with<00:04:05.940> one<00:04:06.150> hand<00:04:06.420> and

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
do is hold that cork with one hand and

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.500 
do is hold that cork with one hand and
actually<00:04:06.990> turn<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:08.250> bottle<00:04:08.730> with<00:04:09.240> the<00:04:09.360> other

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
actually turn the bottle with the other

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.370 
actually turn the bottle with the other
and<00:04:09.860> the<00:04:10.860> cork<00:04:11.070> is<00:04:11.220> already<00:04:11.520> coming<00:04:11.760> out

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
and the cork is already coming out
