awesome way to get multi kills I've been

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.260 
awesome way to get multi kills I've been
in<00:02:00.990> games<00:02:01.229> where<00:02:02.009> people<00:02:02.340> shoot<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.790> will<00:02:02.939> kill

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
in games where people shoot it will kill

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
cool and as a pretty big kill radius too

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.120 
cool and as a pretty big kill radius too
it's<00:02:20.580> surprisingly<00:02:21.240> big<00:02:21.569> but<00:02:21.900> it's<00:02:22.350> also<00:02:22.680> the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
it's surprisingly big but it's also the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.400 
it's surprisingly big but it's also the
worst<00:02:23.370> thing<00:02:23.760> ever<00:02:23.940> when<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.600> die<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:25.260> on<00:02:25.380> a

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
worst thing ever when you die to it on a

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.480 
worst thing ever when you die to it on a
killstreak<00:02:25.830> because<00:02:26.220> they're<00:02:26.370> all

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
killstreak because they're all

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.130 
killstreak because they're all

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
three of these bad boys so that is

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.860 
three of these bad boys so that is
extremely<00:02:35.760> annoying<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.390> it's<00:02:36.510> extremely

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
extremely annoying and it's extremely

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.690 
extremely annoying and it's extremely
challenging<00:02:37.530> navigate<00:02:38.010> map<00:02:38.190> tremely

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
challenging navigate map tremely

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.820 
challenging navigate map tremely
challenging<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.330> get<00:02:39.420> anything<00:02:39.660> done<00:02:39.840> you

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
challenging to get anything done you

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.530 
challenging to get anything done you
have<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.010> be<00:02:41.100> extremely<00:02:41.190> lucky<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:41.910> time<00:02:42.360> it

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
have to be extremely lucky and time it

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.050 
have to be extremely lucky and time it
perfectly<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:43.830> get<00:02:44.040> kills<00:02:44.310> with<00:02:44.489> it<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:44.790> not

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
perfectly to get kills with it and not

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.110 
perfectly to get kills with it and not
to<00:02:45.360> get<00:02:45.570> killed<00:02:45.870> by<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:46.850> that's<00:02:47.850> pretty

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
to get killed by it so that's pretty

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.640 
to get killed by it so that's pretty
annoying<00:02:48.420> but<00:02:48.810> like<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:48.989> said<00:02:49.110> it's<00:02:49.320> only<00:02:49.380> for

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
annoying but like I said it's only for

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.320 
annoying but like I said it's only for
half<00:02:49.800> of<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.100> game<00:02:50.280> it's<00:02:50.670> only<00:02:50.820> half<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.269> the

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
half of the game it's only half of the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.880 
half of the game it's only half of the
maps<00:02:51.570> annoying<00:02:51.959> i<00:02:52.110> guess<00:02:52.290> since<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:52.709> only

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
maps annoying i guess since it is only

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.790 
maps annoying i guess since it is only
for<00:02:53.550> half<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:53.940> game<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.470> it's<00:02:55.470> definitely

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
for half of the game so it's definitely

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.259 
for half of the game so it's definitely
pretty<00:02:56.010> interesting<00:02:56.519> it's<00:02:56.670> unlike<00:02:56.970> anything

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
pretty interesting it's unlike anything

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.670 
pretty interesting it's unlike anything
we've<00:02:57.480> seen<00:02:57.510> really<00:02:57.780> before<00:02:58.140> it's<00:02:58.590> probably

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
we've seen really before it's probably

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.780 
the most annoying dynamic map change
we've<00:03:00.750> had<00:03:00.959> but<00:03:01.830> it's<00:03:01.950> also<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.280> most<00:03:02.310> fun

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
we've had but it's also the most fun

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.670

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
on the other team raging and screaming

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.250

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
electricity post so it's definitely a

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.640 
electricity post so it's definitely a
lot<00:03:11.819> of<00:03:11.970> fun<00:03:12.150> but<00:03:12.180> like<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:12.930> said<00:03:12.989> it<00:03:13.230> can<00:03:13.410> get<00:03:13.530> on

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
lot of fun but like I said it can get on

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.809 
lot of fun but like I said it can get on
your<00:03:13.800> nerves<00:03:13.980> if<00:03:14.160> you're<00:03:14.310> on<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.430> kill<00:03:14.670> streak

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
your nerves if you're on a kill streak

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.640 
your nerves if you're on a kill streak
you<00:03:15.030> know<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.209> die<00:03:15.450> at<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.720> killstreak<00:03:16.110> just

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
you know you die at the killstreak just

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.289 
you know you die at the killstreak just
because<00:03:16.890> someone<00:03:17.130> randomly<00:03:17.579> put<00:03:17.820> one<00:03:18.030> bullet

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
because someone randomly put one bullet

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:19.759 
because someone randomly put one bullet
into<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.690> post<00:03:18.989> on<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.260> other<00:03:19.350> side<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.620> map

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
into a post on the other side of the map

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.530 
into a post on the other side of the map
and<00:03:19.980> then<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.549> electrocuted<00:03:21.120> your<00:03:21.239> whole<00:03:21.360> team

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
and then it electrocuted your whole team

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.030 
and then it electrocuted your whole team
but<00:03:21.840> then<00:03:22.049> again<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:22.350> know<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.590> works<00:03:22.769> both

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
but then again you know it works both

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.680 
but then again you know it works both
ways<00:03:23.370> so<00:03:23.400> it's<00:03:23.670> annoying<00:03:24.000> but<00:03:24.120> it's<00:03:24.269> awesome

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690
