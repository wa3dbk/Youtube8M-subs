00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.799
 in the organizational part and obviously in sports 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:40.180
 this last one because of them has allowed to grow a very high and yes 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.679
 It is true that specialists are specialists in the modality 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:48.369
 so much so that the first three at the end of the race 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:53.659
 that increased in fully recognized by their torrid of skill for this 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:55.829

 take the game 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:13.839
 nor with his 

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:17.829
 until another big chronometer would arrive like quique gutiérrez the 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.249
 Spanish gubernatorial corridor 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:24.349
 what of antioquia in sports i did not beat him 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:27.459
 everything seemed to indicate in Abidjan that they were coming 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.250
 that there would not be many left with the ability to subdue the runner 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.669
 Spanish who had also won the chronometer stage of the return of 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:36.650
 santander 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.170
 they arrived at two summits of enormous power like rafael infantino 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.009
 I also do 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:44.199
 the foal occurs 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:50.060
 how to deliver cia also arrived Juan Pablo Suarez percent the Venezuelan or 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:53.030
 what is one of the points of attraction

 josé rujano 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:55.409
 and none of 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:59.619
 could fold percent to the Spanish runner until it appeared 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.850
 the sea never and thus improve and specialist but not law promoted 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.159
 for Spain 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:06.039
 for the above 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.729

 Five stages of classic rcn 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.440
 Nobody is in a position to say if this year will repeat that figure but 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.349
 has started differently in the leader 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:20.749
 At the end of these eight kilometers he has negotiated an excellent average 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:24.870
 of 51 kilometers and 610 meters in the hour 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.610
 so that 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.589
 11 seconds 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:40.789

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.789
 perhaps 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:50.080
 all this saves thousands in an excellent field with a champion twice of 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.139
 classic rcn 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.419

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.689

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:01.279
 in fact juan diego ramírez heads the list of favorites to the final title 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:04.279
 followed by others or the president by another surprising 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.159

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:03.089
 a nervousness all the runners a key point to beat 

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:05.189

 came with a new point of reference quite good given the remoteness by a 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:14.189
