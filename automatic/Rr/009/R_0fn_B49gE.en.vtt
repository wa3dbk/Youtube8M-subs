 can see more and more 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:54.939
 Definitely good for surfing so this device this Zuzana is 30 Euros 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.439
 a cheap bargain to use mobile Internet 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:04.659

 So many settings you can inform 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:56.389
 unfortunately, the device is a bit slow but otherwise it may work 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.399
 but look good on this device 

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:00.509
 relatively fluid 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:02.689
