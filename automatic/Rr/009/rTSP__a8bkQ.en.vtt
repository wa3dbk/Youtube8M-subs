00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.400 
for a couple of for a week or so now so
let's<00:00:44.730> see<00:00:44.820> if<00:00:44.879> i<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.059> remember<00:00:45.239> i<00:00:45.390> believe<00:00:46.230> it

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
let's see if i can remember i believe it

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.090 
let's see if i can remember i believe it
was<00:00:46.559> power<00:00:47.870> power<00:00:48.870> plus<00:00:49.170> volume<00:00:49.559> down<00:00:49.800> let's

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
was power power plus volume down let's

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.430 
was power power plus volume down let's
see<00:00:50.250> if<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.550> works<00:00:51.020> just<00:00:52.020> double<00:00:52.289> check

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
see if that works just double check

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.439 
see if that works just double check
there<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:53.039> worked<00:00:53.280> out<00:00:53.460> well<00:00:53.520> ok<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.180> then

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
there that worked out well ok so then

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.850 
there that worked out well ok so then
we're<00:00:54.539> going<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.780> using<00:00:54.840> our<00:00:55.260> volume<00:00:55.680> down

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
we're going to be using our volume down

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.709 
we're going to be using our volume down
rocket<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.340> navigate<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.850> recovery<00:00:57.390> mode<00:00:57.600> and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
have no realm to flash to so what I'm

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.499 
have no realm to flash to so what I'm
gonna<00:01:30.960> do<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.290> double<00:01:32.220> check<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.700> actually<00:01:33.210> use

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
gonna do is double check I actually use

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.890 
gonna do is double check I actually use
my<00:01:33.689> little<00:01:33.930> USB<00:01:34.229> OTG<00:01:34.520> here<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:36.390> if<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.750> can

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
my little USB OTG here so if I can

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.270 
my little USB OTG here so if I can
figure<00:01:37.079> out<00:01:37.170> which<00:01:37.350> way<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.710> actually<00:01:37.799> went<00:01:38.100> in

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
figure out which way it actually went in

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.940 
figure out which way it actually went in
whoops<00:01:38.610> wrong<00:01:39.180> way<00:01:39.479> there<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:39.900> go<00:01:40.020> oh<00:01:40.200> boy<00:01:40.740> I'm

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
whoops wrong way there we go oh boy I'm

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.130 
whoops wrong way there we go oh boy I'm
pressing<00:01:41.369> buttons<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.700> probably<00:01:41.909> shouldn't<00:01:42.390> so

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
pressing buttons I probably shouldn't so

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.120 
pressing buttons I probably shouldn't so
like<00:01:43.350> i<00:01:43.439> said<00:01:43.470> before<00:01:43.649> i'm<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> be

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
like i said before i'm going to be

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.010 
like i said before i'm going to be
double-checking<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.790> make<00:01:44.909> sure<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.840> is

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
double-checking to make sure that it is

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.520

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.770 
I'm going to go ahead and swipe to flash
and<00:02:50.070> again<00:02:50.850> this<00:02:51.000> will<00:02:51.150> take<00:02:51.270> just<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.570> moment

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
and again this will take just a moment
