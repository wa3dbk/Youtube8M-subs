before world-class performance is pretty

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.459 
before world-class performance is pretty
much<00:00:38.489> nearly<00:00:38.790> every<00:00:39.090> game<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:40.170> anyone

much nearly every game so anyone

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.290

already<00:00:46.920> got<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> upgraded<00:00:47.910> mid<00:00:48.239> 88<00:00:48.899> card

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
already got the upgraded mid 88 card

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.979 
already got the upgraded mid 88 card
midway<00:00:50.100> through<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.640> season<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.210> well<00:00:51.809> to

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
midway through this season and well to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.660 
midway through this season and well to
me<00:00:52.050> that's<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.260> by<00:00:52.469> my<00:00:52.649> opinio<00:00:53.039> mean<00:00:53.219> even

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
me that's just by my opinio mean even

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.970 
me that's just by my opinio mean even
though<00:00:53.789> he<00:00:54.149> has<00:00:54.329> had<00:00:54.510> an<00:00:54.629> upgrade<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.140> do<00:00:55.649> think

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
though he has had an upgrade I do think

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.200 
though he has had an upgrade I do think
that<00:00:56.039> he's<00:00:56.190> playing<00:00:56.430> well<00:00:56.610> enough<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.030> warrant

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
that he's playing well enough to warrant

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.049 
that he's playing well enough to warrant
another<00:00:57.539> small<00:00:58.140> upgrade<00:00:58.350> anyway<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.520> mean<00:00:59.910> it

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
another small upgrade anyway I mean it

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.090 
another small upgrade anyway I mean it
was<00:01:00.300> hard<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.570> decide<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> stats<00:01:01.739> as<00:01:02.010> he

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
was hard to decide on to the stats as he

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.799 
was hard to decide on to the stats as he
already<00:01:02.250> had<00:01:02.430> three<00:01:03.090> informs<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.690> can

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
already had three informs as you can

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.200 
already had three informs as you can
chop<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> screen<00:01:04.409> as<00:01:04.589> well<00:01:05.400> there's<00:01:05.939> three

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
chop the screen as well there's three

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.240 
chop the screen as well there's three
informs<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.930> was<00:01:07.020> hard<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.260> sell<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:07.950> stats

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
informs and it was hard to sell on stats

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.280 
informs and it was hard to sell on stats
just<00:01:08.369> because<00:01:08.909> there's<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.330> many<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.810> kind<00:01:10.200> of

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290

got<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> mix<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.920> all<00:01:11.159> three<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.430> them<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.360> also

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
got a mix of all three of them and also

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.080 
got a mix of all three of them and also
just<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.990> disclaimer<00:01:13.350> i<00:01:13.650> am<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.830> chelsea<00:01:14.189> fan<00:01:14.220> so

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
his pace by 2 and his dribbling by one

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.560 
his pace by 2 and his dribbling by one
and<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.520> because<00:01:44.790> he<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:44.970> ridiculously

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
and this is because he is ridiculously

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.120 
and this is because he is ridiculously
fast<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.049> he<00:01:46.110> could<00:01:46.229> easily<00:01:46.409> beat<00:01:46.710> defenders

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
fast and he could easily beat defenders

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.310 
fast and he could easily beat defenders
when<00:01:47.700> he<00:01:47.759> stays<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.090> his<00:01:48.180> feet<00:01:48.210> days<00:01:48.509> because

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
when he stays on his feet days because

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.010 
when he stays on his feet days because
his<00:01:49.500> ball<00:01:49.710> control<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.220> phenomenal<00:01:50.909> however<00:01:51.090> I

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
his ball control is phenomenal however I

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.499 
his ball control is phenomenal however I
only<00:01:52.500> gave<00:01:53.040> him<00:01:53.100> marginal<00:01:53.880> upgrades<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.360> those

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
only gave him marginal upgrades in those

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.969 
only gave him marginal upgrades in those
stats<00:01:54.750> as<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.229> not<00:01:55.380> he's<00:01:55.619> not<00:01:55.649> really<00:01:55.829> going

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
a small guy so that's pretty much it for

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
a small guy so that's pretty much it for
his<00:03:21.780> work<00:03:22.290> rates<00:03:22.620> i<00:03:22.950> kept<00:03:23.519> his<00:03:23.730> high<00:03:24.359> attacking

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760

want<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.430> really<00:03:29.670> see<00:03:29.850> this<00:03:30.000> next<00:03:30.180> year<00:03:30.480> i<00:03:30.690> do

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
want to really see this next year i do

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.539 
want to really see this next year i do
think<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:31.500> may<00:03:31.590> happen<00:03:31.799> because<00:03:32.070> like<00:03:32.400> i<00:03:32.519> said

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
think it may happen because like i said

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.849 
think it may happen because like i said
before<00:03:32.790> me<00:03:33.630> now<00:03:33.780> is<00:03:33.989> making<00:03:34.200> his<00:03:34.380> players<00:03:34.620> trap

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
before me now is making his players trap

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.410 
before me now is making his players trap
back<00:03:35.040> into<00:03:35.250> fem<00:03:35.400> more<00:03:35.579> and<00:03:35.820> hazard<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.209> doing

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
back into fem more and hazard is doing

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.289 
back into fem more and hazard is doing
that<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.570> bit<00:03:36.750> more<00:03:36.930> so<00:03:37.709> i<00:03:38.250> do<00:03:38.820> think<00:03:38.910> that<00:03:39.090> could

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
that a bit more so i do think that could

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.509 
that a bit more so i do think that could
possibly<00:03:39.660> happen<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.170> also<00:03:41.010> i<00:03:41.040> kept<00:03:41.400> his

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
possibly happen and also i kept his

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.160 
possibly happen and also i kept his
four-star<00:03:41.940> skills<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.359> weak<00:03:42.510> foot<00:03:42.780> because

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
four-star skills and weak foot because

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.380 
four-star skills and weak foot because
the<00:03:43.890> mini<00:03:44.250> take<00:03:44.459> shots<00:03:44.730> on<00:03:44.910> both<00:03:45.060> feet<00:03:45.239> and

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
the mini take shots on both feet and

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.699 
the mini take shots on both feet and
he's<00:03:45.510> capable<00:03:45.720> of<00:03:45.900> pulling<00:03:46.140> off<00:03:46.350> loader

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
he's capable of pulling off loader

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.380 
he's capable of pulling off loader
skills<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:47.220> he<00:03:47.280> does<00:03:47.459> robo<00:03:47.760> knees<00:03:48.000> mid-game

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
skills and he does robo knees mid-game

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.890 
skills and he does robo knees mid-game
crosses<00:03:49.049> and<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.590> it<00:03:49.709> looks<00:03:49.859> fantastic<00:03:50.480> so<00:03:51.480> in

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
crosses and and it looks fantastic so in

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.440 
crosses and and it looks fantastic so in
the<00:03:52.380> end<00:03:52.500> I<00:03:52.799> do<00:03:53.220> think<00:03:53.700> he'll<00:03:53.940> keep<00:03:54.120> playing

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
the end I do think he'll keep playing

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.150 
the end I do think he'll keep playing
well<00:03:54.660> enough<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:55.019> get<00:03:55.200> another<00:03:55.500> marginal

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
well enough to get another marginal

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.819 
well enough to get another marginal
upgrade<00:03:56.519> but<00:03:57.359> nothing<00:03:58.140> on<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.440> level<00:03:58.620> of

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
upgrade but nothing on the level of

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.949 
upgrade but nothing on the level of
Ronaldo<00:03:59.400> as<00:03:59.670> somewhere<00:04:00.180> that<00:04:00.329> he's<00:04:00.630> not<00:04:00.750> quite

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
Ronaldo as somewhere that he's not quite

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.569 
Ronaldo as somewhere that he's not quite
that<00:04:01.170> yeah<00:04:01.410> there<00:04:01.709> yet<00:04:01.920> because<00:04:02.100> like<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.519> said

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
that yeah there yet because like I said

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.930 
that yeah there yet because like I said
before<00:04:02.790> he's<00:04:03.359> only<00:04:03.480> about<00:04:03.600> 23<00:04:04.140> I<00:04:04.170> think<00:04:04.579> so<00:04:05.579> but

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
before he's only about 23 I think so but
