00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:08.749
 Boogy 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.749
 Minutes 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:20.140
 Kon'nichiwaza is Hiroshige of pocket today is used in jazz well as 162 No. 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:24.489
 It is walking line base to backing in chord progression 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.119
 I would like to do a pattern with a bass, so first of all listen to the performance 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:27.119
 Please give me 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.450
 mood 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.450
 Yup 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.300
 Hmm 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.420
 Yun does 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.379
 Hmm 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.379
 Hm 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:59.010
 Then I would like to go into 8 commentary, but firstly from the link below 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.039
 Please go to the homepage of Zappy pet and ask for an unknown download. 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.730
 I will 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:07.509
 Then, 8 explanations for the rest of your life c Major 7 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:12.659
 It is 5 cases form It is the first to have you suppress this 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.659
 It is a root zone No. matter and I draw here in big 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:23.979
 Then use the middle and ring fingers to make two and three strings 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.009
 I will play at the same time and combine this 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.009
 Hmm 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:34.210
 It is up to here Kedomo the next following are you not become a base line 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.130
 6 decrease of 03 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.219
 Four 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.500
 You can turn it on and connect it 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.560
 Hmm 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.560
 Four 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:52.540
 It is a show described the next will be in something like this 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:54.490
 It becomes a code of a 7, but I would like to explain a bit here a 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:00.430
 Though it is form of 7 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.000
 8 a component that everyone is suppressed probably usually is pulled out little finger from the 6-string goods from the form of that f 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.770
 this 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.170
 Hmm 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:10.880
 It is operation 7 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:13.260
 I think that this is probably suppressed usually, but in the middle finger in jazz, first of all, Luton 6 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:18.000
 Hold the 5th fret of the string 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:23.629
 Index finger Hold the 4th string 5th fret with your index finger 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.629
 Rest is 3 6 fret with the ring finger and to 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.480
 Such a day-to-day I wonder why I change the form and say that at the time of the previous a 7 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.900
 If it was time to hold back 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.730
 The 7th fret reduced after this with ring finger 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.409
 A little theoretical, this is 5 degrees 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.150
 This sound but it's such that 5 degrees as seen from a is actually less so among the advanced 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:50.959
 Not an important sound 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:52.670
 Yes, I use it to hold down the power cord well with rock and pop music 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.959
 Maa's 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.440
 Yes, it adds power or emphasizes a sense of lock 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:04.120
 Since the adult Zatsude dare saves you unplug this 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.260
 Because of that and the 5th fret of 6 strings with the middle finger 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.880
 4 strings 5 ​​frets with index finger 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:15.840
 3 cases hold 6 frets with ring finger 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.080
 The capacity is the same as before and the route is 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.530
 And 3 cases 4 cases with the middle finger and the ring finger 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.840
 Hmm 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.600
 And after that, 4 by 5 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.940
 Seven 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.940
 To combine this 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:41.070
 The next thing that looks like this is the third chapter explanation 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:48.960
 Reference explanation d minor 7 This is also a little special form though 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:51.730
 5 strings 5 ​​frets are middle finger and 4 strings 3 frets are index finger 3 strings 5 ​​frets are ring finger 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.760
 And the 6th fret between the two is the little finger 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.760
 Hmm 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:04.040
 Maybe everyone is such a form which is also usually I'd become such a day-to-day care 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:05.900
 I think it is a pattern that has been brought to here and here, the ring finger to the sound of 5 times this again 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.140
 I will omit it 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.520
 And this will be the form 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.520
 Also the capacity is together 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.459
 Yup 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.699
 The next governor 7 that looks like this 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:27.389
 g 7 is the form of a 7 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:27.389
 Well just shift the fret and do exactly the same thing 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.200
 voodoo 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:48.260
 The Boo Boo Looking to Boo Boo 24 seat 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:58.890
 It will look like this, and it will be the last part, but it will be part of the third sheet. 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:01.310
 Well I think that I have heard about you surely at this ending of jazz 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.310
 But 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.400
 Boo Boo 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:15.930
 It is a part of what I want to explain here is a single sound part 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:18.470
 Though there is I think it's okay I referred to as the end of this code c Sixty Nine 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.470
 Even though I 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:30.710
 5 hotels san and 2 fret 4 of 3 cases in middle finger conquered with the index finger in the last ring finger 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.710
 To reduces the production cuts 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:40.610
 This is called a tension cord 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:43.820
 9th and is called a tension to Kano that this code is better than Toka jazz this 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:47.660
 I put a high tension cord 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:50.920
 Even though this is I point to the so-called Well jersey so-called Oshareru 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.920
 This code at the end 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:58.510
 This is because it can end up being pretty fashionable if you give it to the end of the ending 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:03.920
 Please try the form 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:06.640
 The explanation is the end of the above, I thought that the pocket of the pocket 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.640
 Boo 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.230
 Boo Boo 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.230
 Hmm 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.370
 Hmm
