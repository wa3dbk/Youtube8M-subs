ketchup flavor but they only sell them
in<00:02:17.860> Canada<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.310> think<00:02:18.550> that's<00:02:18.970> what<00:02:19.180> I've<00:02:19.300> heard

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
in Canada I think that's what I've heard

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.610 
in Canada I think that's what I've heard
so<00:02:19.600> I<00:02:19.660> can't<00:02:19.870> find<00:02:19.989> them<00:02:20.110> in<00:02:20.140> stores<00:02:20.290> or

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
so I can't find them in stores or

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.220 
so I can't find them in stores or
anywhere<00:02:20.950> only<00:02:21.670> online<00:02:21.790> but<00:02:22.180> yeah<00:02:22.989> these<00:02:23.080> are

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
anywhere only online but yeah these are

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.190 
anywhere only online but yeah these are
just<00:02:23.260> Luther<00:02:23.950> ketchup<00:02:24.340> flavored<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:25.200> they

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
just Luther ketchup flavored and they

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.420 
just Luther ketchup flavored and they
smell<00:02:26.440> like<00:02:26.530> ketchup<00:02:26.830> I<00:02:26.950> don't<00:02:27.010> really<00:02:27.280> like

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
smell like ketchup I don't really like

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.370 
smell like ketchup I don't really like
it<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.760> much<00:02:27.880> but<00:02:28.239> I'm<00:02:28.690> kind<00:02:28.930> of<00:02:28.959> excited<00:02:29.200> to

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
it that much but I'm kind of excited to

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.430 
it that much but I'm kind of excited to
taste<00:02:29.620> these<00:02:29.799> and<00:02:30.900> they're<00:02:31.900> kind<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.140> like<00:02:32.290> the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
taste these and they're kind of like the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.990 
taste these and they're kind of like the
same<00:02:32.650> they<00:02:32.830> look<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.010> same<00:02:33.130> except<00:02:33.760> for<00:02:33.880> they

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
same they look the same except for they

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.140 
same they look the same except for they
have<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.150> little<00:02:34.269> bit<00:02:34.420> of<00:02:35.280> red<00:02:36.280> dust<00:02:36.640> on<00:02:36.940> them

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
have a little bit of red dust on them

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.699 
have a little bit of red dust on them
that<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.540> guess<00:02:37.780> is<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.049> ketchup<00:02:38.320> flavoring

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
that I guess is the ketchup flavoring

that I guess is the ketchup flavoring
okay
