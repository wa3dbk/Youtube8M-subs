00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello everyone guys here you are back 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.580
 with a new recipe 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.950
 this is the hand cream I made a pound 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.230
 of cream is really a jar either 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.870
 gigantic this is the one I have 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.760
 packaged in the video and yes already 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.980
 compared to before 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.130
 then I'll tell you anyway during the video 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.560
 has changed the consistency a lot and 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.630
 much more mushy just as I wanted it 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.300
 and it is a cream that you can make 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.120
 with very easy oils 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.370
 I will be able to use many, however 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.600
 emulsifiers that serve to give this 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.600
 look pasty but you can also 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.910
 only use even less 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.820
 emulsifiers or just one car 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.899
 emulsifier to look like this 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.660
 very creamy 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.230
 so I immediately leave you with the recipe e 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.230
 to the proceeding 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.130
 yes we all start weighing ours 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.070
 phase has therefore we think of ours 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.590
 demineralized water and then how 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.690
 thickener we use expensive rubber 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.270
 jeanine knows that he is a thickener who 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.220
 we have already used previously 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.680
 for the primer for the face that has a 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.800
 silicone aspect and let's go to 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.920
 disperse within our phase 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.960
 watery and let rest in the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.250
 Meanwhile we take care of the blip and 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.320
 we are the oils 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.619
 first of all it is not sweet almond a 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.710
 moisturizing oil and in the citing axis 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.450
 very suitable for our skin then 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.490
 we also add them not divided 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.290
 rich in vitamin E and very much a customer 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.350
 which you can find at the supermarket 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.750
 therefore of excellent availability given the 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.640
 large quantity that came serves because 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.030
 certainly in the network of more than 100 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.369
 grams 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.440
 then use the olive praise it is 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.930
 the classic one we all have in 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.740
 cuisine that is very nutritious and suitable 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.740
 for dry skin 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.940
 I also use coconut oil 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.620
 coconut that I warmed in a bain-marie 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.290
 to make it melt because it was 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.210
 hardened it is very suitable for ours 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.850
 I'm the man especially in summer 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.120
 which as you see I do not use only on 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.060
 we also use tocopherol 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.700
 pure vitamin E that a great one 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.080
 antioxidant but also excellent 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:36.670
 nourishing that excellent shea butter 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.670
 repairer for dry skin 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.420
 make the time to add the 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.820
 exciting first of all 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.710
 I add the meeting the coses ses here 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.510
 deployed as someone made me 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:55.090
 notice or always put the second s 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.750
 then I add the other commissioned that is 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.750
 ethyl alcohol 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.189
 and then I also add the palmate ct that 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.040
 this other emulsifying factor 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:11.739
 consistency that is more flaky a little 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.540
 more polished than the other two like 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.840
 you can see even if you don't notice 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.659
 very well and finally I also add the 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.989
 beeswax that will still have an effect 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:25.739
 more repairer to our emulsion 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.750
 as you can see there are so many 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.989
 emulsifiers within the phase b is 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:36.099
 very very rich and now we go to 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.950
 take care of our issue so 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:41.769
 first of all we complete phase a 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.900
 We frulliamo our carra genina gel 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:49.870
 for a few seconds with the blender 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:53.379
 when everything is homogeneous we go to 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.170
 heat phase a and phase b mi 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:59.620
 I recommend not to heat phase a too much 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.019
 to avoid it evaporates when the phase 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.620
 b has melted and phase a is hot 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:08.410
 let's go to make our emotion 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.480
 then first half of phase a of 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.459
 phase b excused and within the phase 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.579
 to and then the rest of the phase be 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:19.470
 we whine and then wait for ours 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.470
 motion cool down 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:33.099
 while the cream cools we weigh the 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:35.430
 phase there is glycerol, the gel of 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.430
 aloe vera 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:55.570
 it is the preservative now that our cream 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.670
 it has cooled as you can see it is 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.780
 thickened a lot but it is not this 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:05.700
 still the final consistency we can 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.700
 go to add phase c 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:21.839
 after mixing for a few minutes 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:24.599
 consistency is continuing to 

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:27.029
 changing as you see is even more 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.559
 creamy than before but will become one again 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:31.229
 more 

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:34.789
 so I measured the ph eventually 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:37.169
 if it does not correspond, arrange it e 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:39.959
 confessions I love the cream so in a 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.379
 jar in a sheath from somebody else 

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:42.749
 part 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:47.519
 I'm using this pack of 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:50.039
 I let it be recycled and very dense and 

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:52.649
 very nutritious and truly one 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:55.139
 beautiful cream suitable for the skin 

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:56.819
 dry for the skin it needs 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.369
 so much hydration 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:00.629
 so this is all I hope the 

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:04.879
 tutorial you enjoyed 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:04.879
 a kiss and the next hello
