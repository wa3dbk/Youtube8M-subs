looks<00:00:57.960> pretty<00:00:58.289> good<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:58.680> anything<00:00:59.070> there's<00:00:59.219> a

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
looks pretty good if anything there's a

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.010 
looks pretty good if anything there's a
bit<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.460> flickering<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.270> i<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.480> notice<00:01:00.809> but

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
bit of flickering that i can notice but

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.810 
bit of flickering that i can notice but
than<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.920> pretty<00:01:02.340> much<00:01:02.430> what<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
than that this is pretty much what the

than that this is pretty much what the
xbox<00:01:03.180> one<00:01:03.449> looks<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.860> lot<00:01:05.489> that's

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
xbox one looks like and a lot that's

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.850 
without our seeing the world but it's
still<00:01:12.119> unnatural<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.110> reminds<00:01:13.500> me<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.650> back

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
still unnatural it reminds me of back

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.100 
still unnatural it reminds me of back
when<00:01:14.070> i<00:01:14.130> played<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.580> playstation<00:01:15.090> 3<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.540> am

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
when i played the playstation 3 I am

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.080 
when i played the playstation 3 I am
that<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.590> about<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.770> week<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.759> could<00:01:17.970> do

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
that for about a week and I could do

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.910 
that for about a week and I could do
well<00:01:18.330> yeah<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.439> playing<00:01:19.590> call<00:01:19.890> of

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
well yeah I just like playing call of

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.310 
well yeah I just like playing call of
duty<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.520> usually<00:01:20.670> do<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.960> had<00:01:22.200> to

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
duty like I usually do and I had to

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.899 
duty like I usually do and I had to
think<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.680> little<00:01:22.830> bit<00:01:23.009> more<00:01:23.220> about<00:01:23.549> what<00:01:23.610> I'm

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
think a little bit more about what I'm

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.999 
think a little bit more about what I'm
doing<00:01:24.299> everything<00:01:24.420> wasn't<00:01:24.810> as<00:01:25.049> natural<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:25.830> it

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
doing everything wasn't as natural as it

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.920 
doing everything wasn't as natural as it
was<00:01:26.159> with<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> 360<00:01:26.970> controller<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.689> was

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
was with the 360 controller I was

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.630 
was with the 360 controller I was
playing<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.229> ps3<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.860> fell<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> bit

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
playing on the ps3 it fell a bit

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.039 
playing on the ps3 it fell a bit
different<00:01:30.060> using<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.329> different<00:01:30.689> controller

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
different using a different controller

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.539 
different using a different controller
side<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.470> think<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.829> little<00:01:31.979> bit<00:01:32.159> about<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:32.520> I

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
side to think a little bit about what I

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.920 
side to think a little bit about what I
was<00:01:32.640> doing<00:01:32.700> instead<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.420> doing<00:01:33.509> it

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
was doing instead of just doing it

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.140 
was doing instead of just doing it
naturally<00:01:34.049> I'm<00:01:34.680> having<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.369> same<00:01:35.700> kind<00:01:36.090> of

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
naturally I'm having that same kind of

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.410 
naturally I'm having that same kind of
progression<00:01:36.720> ille<00:01:36.869> dad<00:01:37.759> problems<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.970> guess<00:01:39.210> be

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
progression ille dad problems I guess be

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.780 
progression ille dad problems I guess be
the<00:01:39.509> phrase<00:01:39.750> with<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.680> xbox<00:01:41.009> one<00:01:41.250> year<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:41.759> I

I went on hopefully you guys were able
to<00:05:05.050> get<00:05:05.919> an<00:05:06.010> idea<00:05:06.100> or<00:05:06.490> gig<00:05:06.639> have<00:05:06.880> a

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
to get an idea or gig have a

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.940 
to get an idea or gig have a
representation<00:05:07.389> of<00:05:07.960> what<00:05:08.229> the<00:05:08.380> graphics<00:05:08.770> look

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950

like<00:05:09.690> play<00:05:10.690> I<00:05:10.750> said<00:05:11.050> recording<00:05:11.470> the<00:05:11.590> wrong

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
like play I said recording the wrong

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.800 
like play I said recording the wrong
format<00:05:12.220> this<00:05:12.550> was<00:05:12.729> roughly<00:05:13.120> i<00:05:13.210> believe<00:05:13.540> it<00:05:13.720> was

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
format this was roughly i believe it was

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.440 
format this was roughly i believe it was
either<00:05:13.960> a<00:05:14.410> pretty<00:05:14.830> shot<00:05:14.979> record<00:05:15.130> at<00:05:15.460> a<00:05:15.970> twenty

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
either a pretty shot record at a twenty

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.870 
either a pretty shot record at a twenty
bit<00:05:16.630> rate<00:05:16.870> which<00:05:17.470> is<00:05:17.500> a<00:05:17.740> rather<00:05:18.340> high<00:05:18.580> bitrate

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
bit rate which is a rather high bitrate

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.310 
bit rate which is a rather high bitrate
especially<00:05:19.810> if<00:05:19.870> you<00:05:19.930> don't<00:05:20.080> have<00:05:20.169> like<00:05:20.290> a
