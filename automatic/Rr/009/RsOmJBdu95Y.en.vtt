00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 well let's do the super gray of 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.210
 fly not the first thing we have to 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.059
 to do is to come here to a train does not matter 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.400
 Where is any location 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.440
 effectively and wait for you with much 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.210
 careful because the four planets is 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.390
 only once squared to ride 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.160
 if they had a wagon of these 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.180
 here it was once and saved as I have 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.849
 uploaded has gone up not now yes okay 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.680
 perfect then for sale here and now 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:35.430
 bull runs down 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.430
 born trunk rivas 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.400
 and me 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.010
 now more 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.929
 the balance 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.460
 so a judge of a theoretical car arrived 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:50.460
 so no longer 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.280
 it's super good we're going to explain a 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.840
 what little we have to do 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.140
 we have to put one of the four and 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.580
 we have to put on if in a corner 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.070
 and now what we have to do until 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.560
 stay once we are lying here 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.350
 we give you to read e 1 or good the button that 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.630
 be xbox let's activate the passive mode 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.399
 section the passive mode and once 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.060
 we are in passive mode we try it 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.060
 we wait for another 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.580
 let's go to the three we give you wait one 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:31.330
 two and three and it gave him to disable the 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.330
 more equal mode 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:44.030
 and now we know what has see and time 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.030
 this turtle came out shotgun and came out 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.810
 sitting there and not only the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.850
 right joystick which is to move the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.250
 camera 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.049
 if the right we're going to go right to the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:04.229
 mountain and you're going to mate 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.090
 I'm going up I'm going up so I do not 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.489
 you can touch the buttons a bit or not 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.619
 I did not touch him because of the half rubber in 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.560
 the stone and I also detoured to the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.959
 stone a little bit is going up on me 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.299
 of the oti dale yours are going pretty bad 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.980
 ankles yes but I'm asking 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:24.110
 the mountain of glancing now now now 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.110
 now it's worth his voice 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.920
 Yes Yes Yes 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.540
 this is the trick so to fly if 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.880
 we had more mountains we could climb 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.459
 much higher clear and if this country with 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.170
 a tree may have the bug removed if 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.730
 you can do it in any area of ​​the 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.260
 map to us has touched us here almost 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.150
 to the shore now we go to the sea and 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.500
 you see how we will face but if you get 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.390
 put to the mountain full your see 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.739
 beat twitter or try 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.720
 do it on mountain sites 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.430
 preferably that is, do not do it in the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.019
 train that goes through the saints because you 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.410
 you are going to eat a building to remove the 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.410
 culture 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.490
 a tree 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.320
 of miracles that I return to the mountain that 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:14.570
 turn the character so you can twist 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.570
 uncle keko more crooked 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:25.709
 very well as left analog I was going 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.590
 twisting the left I'm giving the 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.000
 good camera director good 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.670
 to remember the steps a little 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.409
 you just have to look for a train in 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.689
 whatever location you put on a 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.269
 wagon do not lose with the r1 good as the 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:41.730
 that is in whatever it is for let's say 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.349
 adapt in xbox this I think only 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.599
 will work in a new generation because of this 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:49.489
 that makes you invisible and the gray hey 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.489
 but hey hey today is that I'm standing 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:57.110
 aboul aish that is because the train opens 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:00.250
 for somewhere and also runs like this 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.250
 It's where I am, I'm standing 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.540
 I see you I see you but like it does not move 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.050
 we are seeing what I am here over 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.370
 Quiet thing that says what site looks if 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.780
 right now a train has passed underneath 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.460
 of my head and I was in the bar for 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.840
 under my head for the organ of my 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.269
 feet 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.169
 look right now is happening by train 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.169
 by low avn 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:35.580
 here it is worth it if it seems that you 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.750
 move and go back to the beginning again 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.610
 so if you let watching all the time 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.060
 then reappears back a madness said 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.280
 he took off and latif and now when he sees it 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.830
 my camera 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.090
 geohot was about to hear it then look 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.750
 it bursts you, I'll stay here 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.750
 quietes 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.130
 nothing simply that they mounted us 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.020
 a train we do the diesel trick 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.390
 programmed passive we deactivate it and without 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.980
 touch nothing , only the game will be made 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.320
 so nothing then more to say 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.540
 stratus then just try it and 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.970
 Have a good time to see if you are 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.050
 able to do it in the four 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.670
 people because you can do between 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.340
 four if you put one on each corner 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:23.880
 every time the soap can be made one 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:26.490
 torete that passes companion there is no 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.180
 favorites is also a piñazo in the 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.180
 adjective face
