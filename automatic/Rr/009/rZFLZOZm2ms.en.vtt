00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
wearable and the key to releasing these

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.669 
wearable and the key to releasing these
is<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.770> make<00:01:40.920> sure<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.789> glue<00:01:42.149> is<00:01:42.179> very

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
is to make sure that that glue is very

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.649 
is to make sure that that glue is very
firmly<00:01:43.679> pressed<00:01:44.159> down<00:01:44.399> along<00:01:44.789> the<00:01:45.030> edge<00:01:45.179> and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
firmly pressed down along the edge and

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.929 
firmly pressed down along the edge and
then<00:01:46.469> you'd<00:01:46.740> peel<00:01:47.189> off<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.810> backing<00:01:49.049> and

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
then you'd peel off the backing and

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.029 
then you'd peel off the backing and
again<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.270> very<00:01:51.479> sticky<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.499> be<00:01:52.679> careful

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
again this is very sticky so be careful

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.010 
again this is very sticky so be careful
when<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.249> take<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.670> off<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:56.509> I<00:01:57.509> want<00:01:57.749> to<00:01:57.869> be

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
when you take it off and I want to be

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.899 
when you take it off and I want to be
sure<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> have<00:01:58.679> this<00:01:59.280> placed<00:01:59.609> exactly

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
sure that I have this placed exactly

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.010 
sure that I have this placed exactly
where<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.509> want<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.140> line<00:02:01.380> up
