hey this is colin dean for think
computers<00:00:03.049> I'm<00:00:04.049> showing<00:00:04.350> you<00:00:06.020> mirrors<00:00:07.020> edge

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
computers I'm showing you mirrors edge

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:18.480 
computers I'm showing you mirrors edge
on<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.370> asus<00:00:08.940> 23<00:00:09.630> inch<00:00:10.050> monitor

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.800 

it's<00:00:19.490> been<00:00:19.640> a<00:00:19.670> while<00:00:19.850> since<00:00:20.000> I<00:00:20.180> played<00:00:20.210> this<00:00:20.539> so

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
it's been a while since I played this so

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:31.930 
it's been a while since I played this so
expect<00:00:21.380> me<00:00:21.500> to<00:00:21.619> not<00:00:21.770> do<00:00:22.039> it<00:00:22.070> fairly<00:00:22.340> wonderful

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.710 

this<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.059> probably<00:00:33.210> one<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> better

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
this is probably one of the better

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.690 
this is probably one of the better
looking<00:00:33.930> games<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.650> i<00:00:34.739> own<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.250> actually

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
looking games that i own and actually

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.030 
looking games that i own and actually
play<00:00:36.000> frequently<00:00:36.570> other<00:00:36.809> than<00:00:36.989> like<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
play frequently other than like the

actual<00:00:38.720> crazy<00:00:39.720> first-person<00:00:40.410> shooters

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:53.290 

actually<00:00:44.100> looking<00:00:45.680> looking<00:00:46.680> pretty<00:00:47.720> decent

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.400 

video<00:00:54.300> cards<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.720> little<00:00:54.930> bit<00:00:55.019> old<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.290> be

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
video cards a little bit old to be

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.500 
video cards a little bit old to be
running<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:56.070> at<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.430> resolution<00:00:56.790> oh<00:00:58.129> died

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.719 

but<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:03.659> doing<00:01:04.440> and<00:01:04.640> handling<00:01:05.640> it

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
but it's doing and handling it

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.730 
but it's doing and handling it
surprisingly<00:01:06.180> well<00:01:06.470> and

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.780 

I<00:01:12.890> think<00:01:13.280> it's<00:01:13.400> my<00:01:13.520> new<00:01:13.700> any<00:01:13.850> gaming<00:01:14.119> really

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.000 

it's<00:01:20.790> very<00:01:20.940> crystal<00:01:21.659> clear<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.170> didn't<00:01:22.590> adjust

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
it's very crystal clear I didn't adjust

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.580 
it's very crystal clear I didn't adjust
the<00:01:23.220> brightness<00:01:23.400> settings<00:01:23.909> quite<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> bit

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.790 

that's<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.800> be<00:01:28.890> expected<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:30.590> lot<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.619> these

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
that's to be expected a lot of these

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.650 
that's to be expected a lot of these
things<00:01:31.860> don't<00:01:32.190> really<00:01:32.670> look<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.119> out<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
things don't really look like out of the

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:44.710 
things don't really look like out of the
box

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.930 

it's<00:01:45.260> funny<00:01:45.440> I'm<00:01:45.590> doing<00:01:46.010> this<00:01:46.130> as<00:01:46.340> a<00:01:46.370> speedrun

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
it's funny I'm doing this as a speedrun

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.540 
it's funny I'm doing this as a speedrun
on<00:01:47.090> EA<00:01:47.480> online<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.230> I'm<00:01:48.320> probably<00:01:48.800> not<00:01:49.220> going

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
on EA online and I'm probably not going

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:58.750 
on EA online and I'm probably not going
to<00:01:49.670> be<00:01:49.820> very<00:01:49.850> good<00:01:57.370> you're<00:01:58.370> probably<00:01:58.550> not

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
to be very good you're probably not

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.550 
to be very good you're probably not
really<00:01:59.030> able<00:01:59.150> to<00:01:59.330> see<00:01:59.540> a<00:01:59.570> log<00:02:00.020> what's<00:02:00.290> going<00:02:00.470> on

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
really able to see a log what's going on

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.810 
really able to see a log what's going on
you're<00:02:00.710> only<00:02:00.860> seeing<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.220> very<00:02:01.430> center<00:02:01.790> of

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
you're only seeing the very center of

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.690 
you're only seeing the very center of
the<00:02:02.000> screen<00:02:02.410> because<00:02:03.410> I'm<00:02:03.740> obviously<00:02:04.610> playing

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
the screen because I'm obviously playing

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.820 
the screen because I'm obviously playing
at<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.820> same<00:02:08.000> time<00:02:08.240> I<00:02:08.630> can't<00:02:09.229> really<00:02:09.350> hold<00:02:09.649> the

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
at the same time I can't really hold the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.660 
at the same time I can't really hold the
camera<00:02:14.560> if<00:02:15.560> you've<00:02:15.710> not<00:02:15.860> played<00:02:16.040> mirrors<00:02:16.460> as

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
camera if you've not played mirrors as

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.640 
camera if you've not played mirrors as
you<00:02:16.820> really<00:02:17.150> should<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:18.290> can<00:02:18.380> get<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.560> on

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
you really should you can get it on

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.790 
you really should you can get it on
steam<00:02:18.980> for<00:02:19.220> probably<00:02:19.580> about<00:02:19.700> six<00:02:20.180> bucks<00:02:20.800> the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
steam for probably about six bucks the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:29.620 
steam for probably about six bucks the
20<00:02:22.550> buck<00:02:22.730> stops<00:02:23.740> and<00:02:27.340> it's<00:02:28.340> very<00:02:29.300> much<00:02:29.450> worth

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
20 buck stops and it's very much worth

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.990 
20 buck stops and it's very much worth
it<00:02:29.840> it's<00:02:29.990> only<00:02:30.140> about<00:02:30.230> six<00:02:30.590> hours<00:02:30.770> long<00:02:31.220> or

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
it it's only about six hours long or

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.490 
it it's only about six hours long or
short<00:02:32.360> on<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.630> gameplay<00:02:33.170> time<00:02:33.440> but

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.970 

the<00:02:38.250> story<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:39.060> really<00:02:39.990> good<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.620> really

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
the story is really good and I really

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.560 
the story is really good and I really
wish<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.280> they<00:02:41.430> would<00:02:41.550> make<00:02:41.760> like<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.150> movie

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
wish that they would make like a movie

00:02:42.570 --> 00:03:02.140 
wish that they would make like a movie
or<00:02:42.750> something<00:02:42.780> out<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.200> it

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.459 

probably<00:03:03.150> need<00:03:03.329> a<00:03:03.390> shot<00:03:03.659> species<00:03:04.109> to<00:03:04.230> let<00:03:04.379> it

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:04.469 
probably need a shot species to let it

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:20.240 
probably need a shot species to let it
control<00:03:04.769> that<00:03:04.950> be<00:03:05.069> behind<00:03:05.400> me

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.240 

Wow<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:22.320> first<00:03:22.530> time<00:03:22.650> I've<00:03:22.740> gotten<00:03:23.100> through

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
Wow the first time I've gotten through

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:37.440 
Wow the first time I've gotten through
that<00:03:23.400> area<00:03:23.580> without<00:03:23.820> having<00:03:24.210> to<00:03:24.300> kill<00:03:24.480> them

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:04:00.300

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
qualifying I was 37 seconds too quick

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.550 
qualifying I was 37 seconds too quick
