adding<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.560> team<00:01:25.950> I'll<00:01:26.400> see<00:01:26.549> not<00:01:26.790> too

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
adding to the team I'll see not too

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.690 
adding to the team I'll see not too
unfamiliar<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.650> players<00:01:29.009> you've<00:01:29.189> been<00:01:29.430> in

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
unfamiliar to the players you've been in

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.140 
unfamiliar to the players you've been in
the<00:01:30.150> pro<00:01:30.299> 12<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.720> last<00:01:30.900> two<00:01:31.140> seasons<00:01:32.030> but<00:01:33.030> you

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
the pro 12 the last two seasons but you

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.429 
the pro 12 the last two seasons but you
step<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.479> from<00:01:33.630> zebra<00:01:33.810> who<00:01:34.020> finished<00:01:34.290> bottom

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
step in from zebra who finished bottom

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.870 
step in from zebra who finished bottom
of<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.710> Ospreys<00:01:35.070> were<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.340> playoffs

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
of the Ospreys were in the playoffs

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.030 
of the Ospreys were in the playoffs
so<00:01:36.390> that's<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.720> bit<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.110> step<00:01:37.320> up<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.619> terms<00:01:37.860> of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
so that's a bit of a step up in terms of

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.920 
so that's a bit of a step up in terms of
the<00:01:38.189> pro<00:01:38.340> 12<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.299> course<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.659> bring<00:01:39.750> in

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
the pro 12 but of course you bring in

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.990 
the pro 12 but of course you bring in
some<00:01:40.020> experience<00:01:40.560> why<00:01:40.770> did<00:01:40.979> experience<00:01:41.460> from

for<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.049> big<00:03:04.170> games<00:03:04.489> episode<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.670> think<00:03:05.849> it's

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
for the big games episode I think it's

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.089 
for the big games episode I think it's
it's<00:03:06.569> key<00:03:06.780> for<00:03:06.810> successful<00:03:07.650> teams<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.069> have

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
it's key for successful teams you have

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.000 
it's key for successful teams you have
depth<00:03:08.579> and<00:03:08.849> in<00:03:09.060> every<00:03:09.810> position<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.349> it's

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
depth and in every position and it's

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.879 
depth and in every position and it's
just<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.250> half<00:03:11.430> it's<00:03:11.639> no<00:03:12.269> different<00:03:12.630> here<00:03:12.660> so<00:03:12.959> as

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
just a half it's no different here so as

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.470 
just a half it's no different here so as
long<00:03:13.980> as<00:03:14.040> we<00:03:14.160> push<00:03:14.340> each<00:03:14.370> other<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:14.940> we<00:03:15.329> try

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
long as we push each other and we try

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.250 
long as we push each other and we try
and<00:03:15.600> help<00:03:15.660> each<00:03:15.840> other<00:03:15.989> out

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
and help each other out

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.740 
and help each other out
I<00:03:16.730> guess<00:03:17.730> Ospreys<00:03:18.209> at<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.359> end<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.540> day<00:03:18.630> will

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
I guess Ospreys at the end of day will

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.319 
I guess Ospreys at the end of day will

makes<00:03:28.319> it<00:03:28.500> even<00:03:28.889> tougher<00:03:29.010> because<00:03:29.310> he'll<00:03:29.519> be

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
makes it even tougher because he'll be

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.780 
makes it even tougher because he'll be
keen<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.819> impress<00:03:30.180> yep<00:03:30.989> so<00:03:31.200> it's<00:03:31.670> I've<00:03:32.670> been

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.520 
thinking about the last six weeks and
come<00:03:35.730> here<00:03:36.030> it's<00:03:36.180> sort<00:03:36.359> of<00:03:36.420> been<00:03:37.139> betting<00:03:37.380> a

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
come here it's sort of been betting a

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.470 
come here it's sort of been betting a
professional<00:03:38.040> team<00:03:38.340> well<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.150> last<00:03:39.269> two

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480
