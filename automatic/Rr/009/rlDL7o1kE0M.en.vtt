00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
it and basically they both have two

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.049 
it and basically they both have two
different<00:00:55.890> approaches<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.280> what<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.640> sidearm

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
different approaches to what a sidearm

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.430 
different approaches to what a sidearm
should<00:00:57.629> be<00:00:57.870> message<00:00:58.500> shied<00:00:58.829> arm<00:00:59.899> no<00:01:00.899> so

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
should be message shied arm no so

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.959 
should be message shied arm no so
basically<00:01:01.770> what<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.010> does<00:01:02.190> eagle<00:01:02.520> focus<00:01:02.850> is

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
basically what the does eagle focus is

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.299 
basically what the does eagle focus is
on<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.359> low<00:01:03.719> clip<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.260> lot<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.890> power<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
on is low clip a lot of power and

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.399 
on is low clip a lot of power and
requires<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:06.030> accurate<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.960> if<00:01:07.260> you

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
requires you to be accurate so if you

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.920 
requires you to be accurate so if you
guys<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:08.159> an<00:01:08.460> H<00:01:08.760> car<00:01:09.030> set<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.600> thing<00:01:09.780> will

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
guys have an H car set this thing will

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.179 
guys have an H car set this thing will
go<00:01:10.080> beautifully<00:01:10.680> with<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.100> is

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
go beautifully with that that is

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.210 
actually by far my favorite class right
now<00:01:12.600> because<00:01:12.930> basically<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.650> aged<00:01:13.770> car<00:01:14.040> it's

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
now because basically the aged car it's

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.920 
now because basically the aged car it's
a<00:01:14.310> very<00:01:14.580> very<00:01:14.820> powerful<00:01:15.060> assault<00:01:15.509> rifle<00:01:15.810> that

a very very powerful assault rifle that

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.789 
a very very powerful assault rifle that
has<00:01:16.110> high<00:01:16.500> power<00:01:16.740> low<00:01:17.340> clip<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.869> a<00:01:18.869> lot<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.680> a

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
has high power low clip and a lot and a

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.190 
has high power low clip and a lot and a
lot<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.040> damage<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:21.060> love<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.720> H<00:01:21.810> card<00:01:22.049> that

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
lot of damage so I love the H card that

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.560 
lot of damage so I love the H card that
does<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.500> go<00:01:22.590> pair<00:01:22.799> together<00:01:22.950> and

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
does that you go pair together and

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.719 
does that you go pair together and
basically<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.750> Glock<00:01:25.080> has<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.770> high<00:01:26.040> fire<00:01:26.549> rate

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
basically the Glock has a high fire rate

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.359 
basically the Glock has a high fire rate
high-capacity<00:01:30.860> Magneton<00:01:31.860> accuracy<00:01:32.250> because

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
high-capacity Magneton accuracy because

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.249 
high-capacity Magneton accuracy because
it<00:01:32.610> has<00:01:32.729> such<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> high<00:01:33.210> fire<00:01:33.479> rate<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.720> such<00:01:34.229> a

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
it has such a high fire rate and such a

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.539 
it has such a high fire rate and such a
low<00:01:34.500> clip<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.920> haven't<00:01:35.130> really<00:01:35.310> found<00:01:35.430> a

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
low clip and I haven't really found a

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.429 
low clip and I haven't really found a
gun<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.820> goes<00:01:36.000> perfectly<00:01:36.479> with<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.840> yet<00:01:37.049> but

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
gun that goes perfectly with it yet but

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.929 
gun that goes perfectly with it yet but
all<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.770> assault<00:01:37.979> rifles<00:01:38.310> go<00:01:38.430> really<00:01:38.790> well

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
all the assault rifles go really well

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:39.800 
all the assault rifles go really well
with<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.240> Glock

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
with the Glock

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.620 
with the Glock
now<00:01:40.380> here's<00:01:40.979> my<00:01:41.610> opinion<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:42.270> remember<00:01:42.540> this

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
now here's my opinion now remember this

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.980 
now here's my opinion now remember this
is<00:01:42.780> all<00:01:42.990> opinion<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.880> secondary<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.570> desert

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
is all opinion as a secondary the desert

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.960 
is all opinion as a secondary the desert
eagle<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.680> best<00:01:46.920> because<00:01:47.220> secondaries

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
eagle is the best because secondaries

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.700 
eagle is the best because secondaries
should<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.329> when<00:01:48.750> you've<00:01:48.990> already<00:01:49.110> shot<00:01:49.500> an

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
should be when you've already shot an

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.020 
should be when you've already shot an
enemy<00:01:49.979> or<00:01:50.189> you've<00:01:50.340> already<00:01:50.430> shot<00:01:50.670> an<00:01:50.790> enemy

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
enemy or you've already shot an enemy

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.609 
enemy or you've already shot an enemy
beside<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.479> enemy<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:51.960> have<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.170> panic

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
beside the enemy and you have to panic

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.560 
beside the enemy and you have to panic
and<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:53.070> pull<00:01:53.310> out<00:01:53.490> your<00:01:53.670> secondary<00:01:54.119> not<00:01:54.390> to

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
and to pull out your secondary not to

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.420 
and to pull out your secondary not to
run<00:01:54.689> around<00:01:54.810> with<00:01:55.079> as<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.590> main<00:01:55.829> weapon<00:01:56.040> and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
run around with as a main weapon and

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.740 
run around with as a main weapon and
basically<00:01:57.000> that's<00:01:57.149> why<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.329> desert<00:01:57.659> eagle

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
basically that's why the desert eagle

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.300 
basically that's why the desert eagle
takes<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> cake<00:01:58.320> because<00:01:58.530> let's<00:01:59.070> say<00:01:59.189> you've

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
takes the cake because let's say you've

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.620 
takes the cake because let's say you've
already<00:01:59.369> shot<00:01:59.700> another<00:01:59.880> me<00:02:00.030> twice<00:02:00.240> with<00:02:00.479> your

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
already shot another me twice with your

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.580 
already shot another me twice with your
age<00:02:00.780> car<00:02:01.020> or<00:02:01.259> twice<00:02:01.950> with<00:02:02.280> your<00:02:02.310> shotgun

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
age car or twice with your shotgun

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.380 
age car or twice with your shotgun
very<00:02:03.950> very<00:02:04.159> little<00:02:04.429> health<00:02:04.640> seekers<00:02:05.030> plugger

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
very very little health seekers plugger

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.060 
very very little health seekers plugger
does<00:02:05.539> evil<00:02:05.869> more<00:02:06.289> than<00:02:06.409> likely<00:02:06.560> shoot<00:02:06.859> them

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
does evil more than likely shoot them

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.919 
does evil more than likely shoot them
once<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:07.549> it<00:02:07.880> doesn't<00:02:08.149> have<00:02:08.269> a<00:02:08.300> slow<00:02:08.690> fire

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
once and it doesn't have a slow fire

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.389 
once and it doesn't have a slow fire
rate<00:02:08.989> so<00:02:09.379> you<00:02:09.470> can<00:02:09.619> go<00:02:09.679> on<00:02:09.769> and<00:02:09.920> maybe<00:02:10.039> if<00:02:10.280> you

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
rate so you can go on and maybe if you

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.490 
rate so you can go on and maybe if you
miss<00:02:10.640> your<00:02:10.789> first<00:02:10.910> one<00:02:11.120> hit<00:02:11.450> them<00:02:11.629> with<00:02:11.780> two<00:02:12.110> or

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
miss your first one hit them with two or

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.100 
miss your first one hit them with two or
maybe<00:02:12.590> even<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:12.980> third<00:02:13.160> shot<00:02:13.489> if<00:02:13.700> they're<00:02:13.940> bad<00:02:14.810> a

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
maybe even a third shot if they're bad a

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.000 
maybe even a third shot if they're bad a
chest<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:15.769> should<00:02:15.980> say<00:02:16.250> when<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.540> Glock<00:02:18.010> really

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
chest I should say when the Glock really

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.410 
chest I should say when the Glock really
you<00:02:19.160> can't<00:02:19.400> do<00:02:19.489> that<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.730> loft<00:02:19.940> only<00:02:20.150> on<00:02:20.209> three

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
you can't do that you loft only on three

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.729 
you can't do that you loft only on three
or<00:02:20.510> four<00:02:20.569> shots<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.049> that<00:02:21.170> gives<00:02:21.349> them<00:02:21.530> time

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
or four shots and that gives them time

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.820 
or four shots and that gives them time
to<00:02:21.980> shoot<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.610> back<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.330> also<00:02:24.290> like<00:02:24.530> I<00:02:24.620> said

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
to shoot you back and also like I said

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.339 
to shoot you back and also like I said
the<00:02:25.040> Glock<00:02:25.310> has<00:02:25.670> assault<00:02:26.120> rifles<00:02:26.480> so<00:02:26.870> if<00:02:27.140> you

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
the Glock has assault rifles so if you

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.770 
the Glock has assault rifles so if you
shoot<00:02:27.560> them<00:02:27.739> once<00:02:27.920> or<00:02:28.010> twice<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.660> then<00:02:29.660> you

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
shoot them once or twice and then you

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.970 
shoot them once or twice and then you
pull<00:02:29.930> out<00:02:29.989> your<00:02:30.170> black<00:02:30.319> it's<00:02:30.530> gonna<00:02:30.680> be<00:02:30.799> like<00:02:30.950> a

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
pull out your black it's gonna be like a

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.039 
pull out your black it's gonna be like a
two<00:02:31.220> or<00:02:31.340> three<00:02:31.580> shot<00:02:31.819> instead<00:02:32.150> of<00:02:32.299> just<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.720> one

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
two or three shot instead of just a one

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.130 
two or three shot instead of just a one
so<00:02:33.650> as<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:33.890> secondary<00:02:34.519> the<00:02:35.299> desert<00:02:35.630> eagle<00:02:35.989> is

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
so as a secondary the desert eagle is

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.350 
so as a secondary the desert eagle is
better<00:02:36.650> but<00:02:36.920> however<00:02:37.310> as<00:02:37.549> like<00:02:38.000> an<00:02:38.090> all-around

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
better but however as like an all-around

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.110 
better but however as like an all-around
gun<00:02:38.690> like<00:02:38.870> let's<00:02:39.049> say<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.530> go<00:02:39.920> into<00:02:40.220> this<00:02:40.910> game

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
gun like let's say I go into this game

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.270 
gun like let's say I go into this game
thinking<00:02:41.360> I'm<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.079> gonna<00:02:42.260> use<00:02:42.560> my<00:02:42.950> Desert

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
thinking I'm just gonna use my Desert

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.949 
thinking I'm just gonna use my Desert
Eagle<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.579> entire<00:02:43.849> match<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.510> another<00:02:44.750> kid

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
Eagle the entire match and another kid

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.589 
Eagle the entire match and another kid
says<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.470> want<00:02:45.799> to<00:02:45.860> go<00:02:45.920> into<00:02:46.040> this<00:02:46.220> game<00:02:47.030> using

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
says I want to go into this game using

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.170 
says I want to go into this game using
only<00:02:47.750> my<00:02:48.110> Glock<00:02:48.379> 17<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.310> kid<00:02:49.489> using<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.879> Glock

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
only my Glock 17 the kid using the Glock

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.509 
only my Glock 17 the kid using the Glock
17<00:02:50.209> will<00:02:50.750> do<00:02:50.900> much<00:02:51.379> much<00:02:51.799> better<00:02:52.010> because<00:02:52.250> it

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
17 will do much much better because it

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.479 
17 will do much much better because it
has<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.670> high<00:02:52.910> cliff<00:02:53.260> good<00:02:54.260> accuracy<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:55.129> a

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
has a high cliff good accuracy and a

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.250 
has a high cliff good accuracy and a
high<00:02:55.700> fire<00:02:56.000> rate<00:02:56.180> when<00:02:56.329> the<00:02:56.420> desert<00:02:56.750> eagle<00:02:56.900> has

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
high fire rate when the desert eagle has

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.930 
high fire rate when the desert eagle has
none<00:02:57.590> of<00:02:57.709> those<00:02:57.769> things<00:02:57.980> they<00:02:58.280> just<00:02:58.489> as<00:02:58.640> power

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
none of those things they just as power

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.059 
none of those things they just as power
that's<00:02:59.569> pretty<00:02:59.810> much<00:02:59.989> it<00:03:00.140> is<00:03:00.230> power<00:03:00.500> versus

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
that's pretty much it is power versus

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.339 
that's pretty much it is power versus
everything<00:03:01.790> else<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.150> like<00:03:02.840> I<00:03:02.959> said<00:03:03.019> as<00:03:03.319> a

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
everything else and like I said as a

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.199 
everything else and like I said as a
secondary<00:03:03.769> you<00:03:03.980> want<00:03:04.160> power<00:03:04.340> but<00:03:05.000> as<00:03:05.090> an

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
secondary you want power but as an

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.850 
secondary you want power but as an
all-around<00:03:05.450> gun<00:03:05.690> you<00:03:06.170> want<00:03:06.319> pretty<00:03:06.769> much

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
all-around gun you want pretty much

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
mainly having been able to hit them past

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.159 
mainly having been able to hit them past
like<00:03:31.700> a<00:03:31.730> hundred<00:03:32.180> meters<00:03:32.450> when<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:32.989> Glock

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169

like a hundred meters when the Glock
isn't<00:03:33.470> only<00:03:33.560> a<00:03:33.709> four<00:03:34.040> or<00:03:34.069> five<00:03:34.250> and<00:03:34.669> I've<00:03:34.730> even

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880

had six or seven shots with the Glock
and<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.549> is<00:03:37.669> bad<00:03:38.060> so<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.569> divers<00:03:38.810> of<00:03:38.930> Eagle

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
and that is bad so the divers of Eagle

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.259 
and that is bad so the divers of Eagle
definitely<00:03:39.919> beats<00:03:40.220> out<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.370> Glock<00:03:40.639> there<00:03:40.880> but

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269
