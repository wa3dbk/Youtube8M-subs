there<00:01:22.930> even<00:01:23.230> though<00:01:23.290> this<00:01:23.470> is<00:01:23.650> like

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
there even though this is like

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.800 
there even though this is like
polyurethane<00:01:25.120> it's<00:01:25.270> like<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.420> man-made

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
polyurethane it's like a man-made

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.800 
polyurethane it's like a man-made
synthetic<00:01:26.740> which<00:01:27.670> means<00:01:27.880> it<00:01:27.970> should<00:01:28.000> last<00:01:28.360> a

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
synthetic which means it should last a

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.420 
synthetic which means it should last a
long<00:01:29.110> time<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:31.150> is<00:01:31.600> sewn<00:01:31.960> around<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.070> edges

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
long time it is sewn around the edges

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.510 
long time it is sewn around the edges
which<00:01:34.210> I<00:01:34.360> like<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:35.040> it's<00:01:36.040> it's<00:01:36.370> actually

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
which I like the it's it's actually

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.070 
which I like the it's it's actually
surprisingly<00:01:37.360> soft<00:01:37.750> to<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.770> touch<00:01:39.870> for<00:01:40.870> being

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
surprisingly soft to the touch for being

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.790 
surprisingly soft to the touch for being
polyurethane<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:43.090> read<00:01:43.690> some<00:01:43.960> reviews<00:01:44.140> on<00:01:44.560> the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
polyurethane I read some reviews on the

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.530 
polyurethane I read some reviews on the
the<00:01:45.040> pages<00:01:45.460> sticking<00:01:45.820> together<00:01:45.970> and<00:01:46.330> I<00:01:46.390> can

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
the pages sticking together and I can

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.020 
the pages sticking together and I can
hear<00:01:46.660> them<00:01:46.750> sticking<00:01:47.250> one<00:01:48.250> way<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:48.520> break<00:01:48.850> them

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
hear them sticking one way to break them

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.030 
hear them sticking one way to break them
in<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:50.380> you'll<00:01:50.500> have<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:50.650> worry<00:01:50.770> about<00:01:50.830> ripping

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
in so you'll have to worry about ripping

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.280 
in so you'll have to worry about ripping
the<00:01:51.250> pages<00:01:51.400> take<00:01:52.270> a<00:01:52.300> section<00:01:52.840> and<00:01:52.960> just<00:01:53.020> curl

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
the pages take a section and just curl

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.780 
the pages take a section and just curl
them<00:01:53.470> up<00:01:53.560> like<00:01:53.770> this<00:01:54.010> and<00:01:54.480> fan<00:01:55.480> them<00:01:55.630> out<00:01:55.750> and

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
them up like this and fan them out and

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.570 
them up like this and fan them out and
then<00:01:57.790> do<00:01:58.060> it<00:01:58.180> in<00:01:58.330> the<00:01:58.630> opposite<00:01:59.290> direction

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
then do it in the opposite direction

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.640 
then do it in the opposite direction
it'll<00:02:00.580> break<00:02:01.390> apart<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.960> gold<00:02:02.170> gilding<00:02:02.710> and

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
it'll break apart the gold gilding and

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.190 
it'll break apart the gold gilding and
it<00:02:05.650> makes<00:02:05.830> it<00:02:05.980> a<00:02:06.040> lot<00:02:06.159> easier<00:02:06.580> to<00:02:07.050> to<00:02:08.050> go

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
it makes it a lot easier to to go

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.260
