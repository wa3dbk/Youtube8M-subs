00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 what is youtube mass to the scorpion 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.460
 Beck is starting now before you 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.799
 Comes to another gameplay coming 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.570
 in the channel people often reason one 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.920
 relatively crass half-time intermaps because 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.540
 there I have that right off the first 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.530
 Lukla made it clear what I was a whole 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.410
 beautiful was correctness 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.730
 has several short trip to the court 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.080
 really fun here and at the end 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.970
 I believe but the unscrupulous 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.449
 i was absolutely out of marseille so was me 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.949
 I think so 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.689
 In any case, but I already have it 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.119
 today seen why it will go today 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.650
 namely the cod lifestyle and then 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.289
 tell yourself what 's up 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.410
 meant so calms you I explain 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.730
 it is from the very front and it is two 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.320
 yes that all the youtubers are theirs 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.340
 own t shirts and have so on the start 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.510
 and so on and so forth I have mine 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.730
 thought that something like this can you be because 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.440
 do and you are the 1000 want to 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.480
 its a youtube but baptize t shirt 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.770
 expresses no so something else was 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.329
 something the community his 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.610
 Subscribers to the entire community shows 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.829
 I thought okay what mass 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.300
 connects us all what connects us 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.550
 all people and I thought so 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.680
 Of course, of course it's like me 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.600
 we fell from the eyes 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.770
 all people gamble we all gamble 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.180
 and who else noticed something 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.920
 a thing that much stronger 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.479
 joins as the gamble and while at 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.830
 The subscriber I was in was 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.970
 Stuttgart and Hanover and above all 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.460
 sure i noticed 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.470
 we are all damned alike people 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.250
 although the cod play that me already 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.430
 always noticed 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.350
 cod players are not loose cod players 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.509
 are not that typical lastig thing 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.860
 clichÃ© what I in wow players the the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.299
 cellar where I think so yes 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.500
 not even and also on the cellar 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.700
 but do you know that mine know 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.290
 not how strong we are all so 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.119
 hipster we all know that way 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.920
 pretty stark cairo full of many people 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.150
 All of our ex have such a hairstyle 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.829
 here, somehow, and so on 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.329
 So that is the make a hairstyle 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.619
 should there so that i have my hairstyle 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.240
 especially severe find the find 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.290
 i pretty much grass but really as 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.369
 Of course that does not mean that is mine 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.899
 Now every one of you watching the game 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.280
 have to think second division so have 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.780
 I still do not immediately obey even 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.090
 not to the movement but today and 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.320
 It's just the only thing that matters 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.280
 really that we are not victims 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.840
 Do not know a victim we dress 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.610
 actually all good so I have 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.259
 have not seen a subscriber at the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.610
 the entire subscribers meet the 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.780
 for me now as full as such a victim was 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.030
 Honestly we are all really 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.590
 pretty blatantly I thought there 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.969
 should you still start marcel there should 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.439
 that ' s why I have it for me 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.719
 think about it but then I come to that 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.280
 First of all , he already has his office 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.929
 seen times and that the whole thing 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.030
 The tri has us all know we are dead 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.120
 quite honestly, people connect around though 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.439
 it's the stuff like a n94 diana 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.989
 of course, today more and also here 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:22.810
 of course the sarah doing the c4 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.120
 the or be like a satellite know that 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.689
 It extremely crass on all these things 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.180
 this case 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.829
 this is just the chance that is 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.719
 so cool things she is and me 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.549
 immediately think okay that's my thing with 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:34.989
 What you have is this tri you have to 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.269
 I have developed this celebration 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.799
 I thought so people come here 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.359
 had to get out what you can make of it 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.189
 make me t shirt and somehow 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.629
 I earn money with it 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.280
 two as well as money do not make money 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.540
 but just because I thought com 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.620
 We have to move this together 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.389
 grasp but qua what I thought 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.430
 Come on, I'll show you here I have it now 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:54.250
 here once on that black with 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.900
 white print and there I have a white one 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.459
 with black print and that is today 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.230
 I thought so 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.269
 how should the whole look because there is 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.280
 yes what I'm so 1000 direction of 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.870
 any doctor so time for 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.209
 me so if I'm here what I'm sick 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.950
 with 1000 different colors I have 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.359
 thought no I think you should 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.250
 everything I can with there was 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.450
 anton the other day in nuremberg now it could be 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.979
 maybe now see the picture here 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.769
 from an animal that he is bought up 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:19.569
 on top of that for success 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.000
 that gave me a really good one 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.010
 it thought of diesel thomas l 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.269
 You should also be so modern day is you 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.010
 just take it with me so people 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.689
 I can combine everything with everything 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.979
 thought so and I've 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:32.049
 this motiv develops in this 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:33.879
 relatively large and loyal including the 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.590
 hard and I will ask now too 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.239
 am still we have no pig 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.590
 such are there you are black 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.909
 Although right now why exactly why 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.979
 because there are two 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:43.540
 different forms in 2002 the council 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:45.970
 explained yesterday and that is a try 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.139
 harder part you have the lobby 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.720
 comes to be dead and because of course 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:51.310
 We are those, too, but what I call the 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.009
 easy combination we drive 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.299
 are all two tough but three is tough 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.340
 yes, for me another such a different one 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.409
 and all goes fast gives work 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.699
 hard thranhardt tri I 've got 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.919
 even force it, I think that's just one 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:04.389
 really cool this contract with pride 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.889
 This theme of this tri has the shirt 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.150
 and I thought so and maybe 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.889
 it is also very interesting for you 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.239
 So I thought that is 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.470
 Of course Swiss also write on it 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.790
 could honestly be a t 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.189
 putting on my shirt where switzerland is on it 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.630
 Simply find the perfect mix 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:18.310
 shows attachment to me because I'm over 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.299
 my left because it is my t-shirt 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.799
 because I developed 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.690
 shows the connection to the community 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.310
 We just try everything harder are man 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.290
 when I dine in the lobbies c4 like that 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.960
 Last disturbed man because it's easy 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.730
 so love and hate to participate 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.470
 so easy to any shit easy 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.970
 people can say it quietly 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.620
 which t shirt is so appealing 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.330
 There are thousand of every variation there is 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.190
 rudi as t shirt in all colors and 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.890
 form check.de legendary like the 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.630
 description times out so the supreme and 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.640
 Of course, your idol could do it now 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.100
 not in any case so again 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.030
 to the shop people link as I said 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.380
 I really deserve it 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.400
 but is just a cool idea 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.720
 I and I would be happy if I could 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.920
 Meet it on the street 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.810
 would fan at the gamescom and 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.280
 secondly, so strong on everyone 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.960
 as powerful as the shop is 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.460
 at the very top of the description 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.260
 I think it's really great 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.190
 with really good and the first 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.270
 I have already seen day 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.500
 already relatively many, this alone 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.340
 have seen facebook already bought 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.230
 because it is really really good 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.480
 arrived is so strong in any case 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.640
 to join the truth movement people there 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.720
 I would say I've got it 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.000
 idea people i show a picture 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.320
 certain like me with a vest 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.580
 because I think you can do it too 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.380
 relatively pronounced as so municipalities the 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.610
 means you can somehow to everything 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.440
 wear and so what I have then 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.820
 considered for our community for ours 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.720
 Coach only has people if so that we 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.550
 Definitely worth it and if I have that 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.010
 jack liked the shop in the video 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:34.110
 video schwemme australia until the 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.110
 next time, bye bye
