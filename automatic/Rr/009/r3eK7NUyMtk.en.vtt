 that we did not show the recording that 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.229
 you are curious to see why place 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.700

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.270
 truth 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.369
 so we have something else 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.020
 It is also interesting that 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.299
 You can be part of the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.040

 own adventures for the series to both 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.180
 using the map as the source of 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.920
 inspiration and mike ticket you get the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.750
 map and make some type modifications

 Exactly guys so I know you have 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.159
 many people who end up commenting are about 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.500
 the fact that we should use more 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.520
 It's the team's factory that should be what the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.500
 people will do from now or 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.540
 Be it you can download the map

 adventure that is located in some 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.790
 new session of miracles or even in

 venturing out the staff ran through this 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.489

 description of the video we see yes athletes 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.830
 two surprises as it was in the last video 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.500
 Enthusiastic you will like 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.420

 women in the Arctic is with their 11 has no 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.560
 nothing to lose no episode is another one 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.890
 Notice about us out 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.990
 Fifty was we will make reforms 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.300
 music girl to spend another episode 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.340
 What are you guys going to do next? 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.200
 does not spend much time average is because 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.970
 type it does not have multiple sessions equal to 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.100
 another who had their food and are 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.930
 different from feeling everything else to us 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.390
 intends to make lexus luxury renovations 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.590
 integrating every business is exactly the 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.820
 guys because they no longer use many 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.650
 women is for this reason other 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.180
 reasons is also that building 1,600 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.890
 new to do and participate in 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.840
 adventures every day here in 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.980
 women is a very tiring job and 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.590
 tone is much better 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.820
 is we got a map is in the separate case 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.380
 to make these constructions even because 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.850
 if I were to do it this way I would have 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.500
 how many episodes women per week 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.600
 two or three at most until it gathers 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.310
 a team here they think of a model 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.990
 design that makes sense to a fable that 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.700
 building a scenario here is 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.590
 complicated then it is easier for us to 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.180
 we want to visit the gta dimension 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.410
 simply go through the portal then 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.000
 these are the ideas of the portal and have 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.130
 many people ask but the idea of 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.080
 movie is simply has moto show case 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.459
 differently this idea is not 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.620
 very well the idea of ​​ores the idea 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.390
 of miracles is to give meaning and 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.800
 interesting thing with the use of 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.630
 of the dead and you can see that everything 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.550
 that we do it as simple or as 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.310
 hidden we are we have to 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.470
 makes sense mogi eg getat 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.300
 in their mode fans have cars 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.290
 the cnps that we always fought with 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.360
 they're the gut I just did not think of 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.060
 region a peoa had existed even 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.890
 Little boy and his brother and look there look that 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.750
 no, no 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.670
 but it is for these and other reasons 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.230
 people always use each episode a 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.540
 mold is sure you do not end up 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.280
 realizing the same but every episode 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.620
 fashions and modes are placed and there is evidence 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.900
 in the case and we give a sense and 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.730
 a greater reason for them was the 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.200
 idea and this is the idea of ​​the lightweight film 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.880
 but anyway the guys at 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.860
 description of the video has the link down and there 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.360
 have fun visit a map a region 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.489
 I highly recommend that you sit down and 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.709
 that we never showed her is the region 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.169
 of the galleon rooms of each builder 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.150
 had the right to make a room with the 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.880
 theme and the artistic freedom that they 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.050
 I understood it was so easy when they try 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.449
 Dwarf aquino background 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.680
 Fitch is very nice of the room and I 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.120
 even though the problems with the top scorer 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.159
 have to take a look then the 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.449
 cuts the boys if it was revealed that until 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:38.280
 an easter egg in that room here what 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.050
 leads to another region also are not 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.460
 several and several easter eggs some 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.400
 some message boards that 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.800
 jacinto pinto is a prisoner can go there and 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.860
 denounce view has multiple 16gb beck was 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.400
 I know it's the name of the person to whom 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.500
 sold the preview has several and is on 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.360
 part of which is a prostitute who 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.440
 ball but has several various havoc 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.970
 you can explore the galley 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.620
 especially here in quartz zone 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.930
 I do not know how to witness what was 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.539
 built here I never explored that 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.520
 with all kind I think no pilot 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.979
 this area of the school has to speak 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.900
 Then then, there you go and talk now. 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.610
 Are you passionate about exploring yourself? 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.530
 Speak thus, I like a thousandth 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.509
 missing the theme will be luxury zombie invasion 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.669
 laboratory-type lexus with the 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:22.139
 experiments that went wrong can we 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.150
 record the evil that you went through to 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.080
 people upload the low and middle people 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.759

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.650
 Exactly so people can 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.659
 go through several readings that you 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.099
 themselves created ok then in the description of the 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:34.139
 video has an email where you can flip 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.389
 a map with some images in a brief 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.949
 explanation of how this new 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.529

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.090
 I want you to know what it is. 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.500

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.210

 You get, want you, you're good, then.

 I tried to be quiet if I told you 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.919

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:19.469
 I was going to tell the mark left so I'm going 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.550
 count but the next one she hopes will not 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:22.620
 to be a thing is going to take a long time maybe 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.690
 next week for a maximum of one week 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.039
 people are going to show this other secret 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.539
 surprise that we have prepared a 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:29.789
 much of the time he told me 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:31.379
 really cool is one thing I think 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:34.110
 who will change the team light forever 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:35.669
 together with the assembly will have 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:39.089
 also the retirement that will make 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:41.039
 exciting other teams construction 

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:41.820
 Maybe we 'll get her too. 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:44.520
 independent 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.620
 and it is also necessary to expand this broad 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.360
 It's also exactly what we were 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.100
 making you leave as a download 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.860
 the version number 1 logo the version number 1 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.210
 does not have the team to lose you 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.040
 stay because nobody knows that place 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.450
 Where we fall 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.090
 Do you know where we are? 

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:02.340
 Decreases bizarre phrase but it 's session 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.290
 here the people that have here I think assad 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.430
 for us as element is of 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.950
 gather to be able to enter 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.960
 of furniture do not have and this session here 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:11.790
 where the portals do not have the portals 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.460
 it is simply an empty room because the 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.360
 initial version of this map had no 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.320
 these sessions that we finish 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.120
 building over time so too 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.560
 such as minor modifications that do not 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.180
 I know if they're too easy to be 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.530
 observed but any way to 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.300
 structure of the map is 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.520
 available entire business you can 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.380
 download and play now but this is a video 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.580
 just to show you this 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.110
 incredible said the map is 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.670
 finally downloading is something that 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.860
 You always wanted to zoom in. 

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.780
 she has the ability to deliver you 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.250

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.750
 liked this favorite video drawing and 

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.640
 You can rest assured that today we will have 

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.650
 then another very interesting video time 

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.240
 take it back to normal tomorrow with new 

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:49.160
