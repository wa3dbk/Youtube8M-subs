00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 speaks guys are all very welcome to 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.600
 cleaner and black from ac paulo paim e 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.240
 Look at this first kill guy face. 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.240
 came to me with a knife or me 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.860
 They give it a shot head ended up screwing of 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.759
 green and yellow is very cool when 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.740
 that happens 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.750
 good people basically this video was 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.310
 brought on because of the lulz idea 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.010
 of this game player to have brought 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.740
 sub 10 and how it was in a 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.810
 on YouTube you ended up releasing the 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.310
 video and a lot of people I watched the video 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.349
 did not give me time to work again 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.730
 without anyone seeing and one of the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.649
 that I had placed was that this 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.480
 video could not be posted on channel 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.540
 enact in state or in private 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.770
 unfortunately released and I finally good 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.660
 also have some ideas of not 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.160
 bring the marker already wanted to bring in 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.590
 channel I think a match well 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.000
 I'm sorry you're sorry 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.559
 watch here 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.360
 It is obvious that in the Adolf 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.059
 much larger view 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.010
 but it would help to publicize the channel 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.750
 but also has fine problem was not 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.160
 I hope you like the game was 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.129
 a very nice match is not talking 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.989
 to take the countries to you is a 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.850
 double shock playing in the yard 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.590
 So stay to the end it's worth it. 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.210
 very worth watching 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.700
 Good, I'm using you as you already 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.350
 have realized more than 70 this is my 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.460
 lucky golden island does not hurt the others 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.750
 because you do not have much patience to 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.729
 play with the other weapons 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.560
 the other chances I really like her 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.270
 I will bring you gold is already bringing a 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.150
 Diamond I'm already doing beyond dan 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.650
 of the other great ones but until then 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.350
 made no challenge from the others 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.540
 totaled r 70 but soon saw a video 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.820
 with them in diamond also already has 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.880
 Enough video of her from Diamond Diamond 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.430
 diamond but she looked very beautiful 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.250
 it 's worth bringing the galley basically 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.479
 all in it a laser sight and the long barrel 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.860
 are two athletes that I think 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.710
 fundamental for use in any type 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.810
 shock and looks great with two 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.680
 annexes that have combined very well for 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.780
 and of course have no other types of 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.390
 diabetes but that they would also work 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.399
 I prefer to play that way I think 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.960
 that way any type of 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.670
 shot and you have a distance greater than 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.469
 the long pipe in hitting the enemy 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.780
 this helps very costly mainly 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.149
 because you really need to have this 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.430
 advantage against the enemy because he 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.810
 is with sng or is it with the url going 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.280
 get you killed 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.840
 in the first than in the first 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.640
 I actually waited for the guy to come near 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.440
 me because I knew I knew that if I 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.569
 move yours if I tried to give a 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.880
 I shot him before the drought I was 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.410
 could die me and I would stand 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.910
 that I knew he was going to kill me easily 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.069
 I realized it when he arrived 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.569
 very close did nothing I tasted I would have 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.830
 that keeping me in the face I think this 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.099
 dude will not play more things in life 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.160
 but ultimately it 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.239
 so this is a good tip for using aa 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.480
 Luck is not 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.550
 another interesting tip that is important 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.959
 in fact is when you are using a 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.630
 short on your drive has to be 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.130
 different point this everyone knows 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.080
 now how well it moves with a 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.910
 especially on a small 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.630
 a mortal when you have an attack 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.890
 very large 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.370
 lack of movement also has to be 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.510
 very clever indeed very much 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.410
 and that has a life a little more 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.180
 intelligent 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.310
 now never such a small example 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.840
 You can have a little bit of rushing. 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.019
 you can face the enemy a little 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.730
 more with a little more certainty than 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.450
 will kill because it is the most 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.160
 intense 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.440
 Of course if you are very close to 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.480
 enemy think I do not know why she 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.670
 loses some of her strength she finishes 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.980
 do not be so easy so enemy so 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.230
 and and if you miss a shot at me too 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.549
 next you will miss what the why 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.130
 he will kill you if he has like 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.709
 any other type of weapon pdw one 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.299
 seal a limit it will achieve 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.040
 kill you because he will take he has 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.109
 more bullet to shoot you while 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.549
 You already took an etar reloading 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.410
 to reach the second 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.030
 so be very careful you tried 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.230
 move more by the side I always 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.049
 I say this in the damn videos. 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.880
 side drive is the game won 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.040
 The face moved well then 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.480
 map not through the conflict zone 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.970
 that in the middle of the map 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.709
 so the movement says martin you 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.480
 will be able to play well with any 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.840
 type of weapon not only with the 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.540
 especially with the shorts at the then 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.910
 so do not be crazy do not leave the 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.400
 chamdo around the chamdo in roshan version 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.950
 The car chance did not go around running around. 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.799
 because obviously you're going to end up having 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.380
 a huge huge disadvantage 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.260
 another idea that is also is this idea of 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.359
 rush is actually quite complicated because 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.860
 a lot of people think tea is coming out 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.139
 running the map created a logo 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.289
 shooting at any time 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.789
 I in my opinion do not take it for granted. 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.349
 this side I think is not quite right 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.520
 Of course he runs away and shoots and 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.009
 killing everyone is in front of you 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.810
 It is even more beautiful to see but it is 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.279
 playing with running intelligence 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.889
 intelligence as it is what they try to do 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:42.439
 in this video in that match is actually 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:45.340
 is also a form of rock 'of 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:47.870
 rock todavia paulo rock galileo is xuxa 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.370
 so it's purple with a little more 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.569
 of intelligence has to run up 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.069
 of the enemy with a little more 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:54.020
 intelligence in this match 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:55.610
 specific spe the guys came over to 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.620
 me because I'm playing a game too 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.120
 mode that allows me to stay 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.759
 more time in the place because I 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.409
 I need to get a capture of the bomb as 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.509
 It was like this but now you have to 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:07.969
 wait the crowd comes close to power 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:10.789
 have the advantage of killing them with a 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:12.289
 shot here is much easier then take 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:16.580
 Watch out for running around 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:17.539
 do not go there were some crazy booters to 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.710
 to kill 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.839
 Have a little more patience a little 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.879
 more intelligence try to find m1 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:24.469
 a certain advantage of the back side 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:26.029
 because then you will have, for example, this 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:28.099
 time the guy came the band 's show was in 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:29.000
 cantinho there if champion of nba banda 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:30.710
 ended up hurting 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.659
 I think it 's just as lucky as it was in that 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.919
 Throw luck now you have to tell your 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:37.039
 The side has to be a bit lucky. 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:41.149
 mainly from 170 to have luck 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:42.830
 catching not-so- strong enemies and 

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:46.219
 face on the pitch in time you will shoot 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.169
 then it has to be very strong and 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:51.169
 ends up being a good thing this time 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:53.629
 I get mine from the good swarm that got 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.889
 very cool for the channel I think I give 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:56.990
 flame of r 70 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:06:02.599
 it's very difficult for you to see enough a and b 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:04.370
 wp7 now taking buchan and r 70 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:06.620
 it's not every time that people 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.909
 Can play the video is coming 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.020
 In the end, I hope you liked it. 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:14.240
 of the video to comment leave their homes 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.180
 what a favorite if you liked it 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.729
 will help a lot to publicize the channel 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:22.550
 how much would we go up day 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:24.529
