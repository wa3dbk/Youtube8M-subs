00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
plastic seal oh I'm not sure like I

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.699 
plastic seal oh I'm not sure like I
think<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.700> pull<00:02:28.910> ratios<00:02:29.420> with<00:02:29.720> um<00:02:29.930> these

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
think the pull ratios with um these

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.530 
think the pull ratios with um these
sorts<00:02:31.100> of<00:02:31.220> what<00:02:31.670> is<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:31.910> when<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.180> get<00:02:32.270> a<00:02:32.300> full

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
sorts of what is it when you get a full

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.540 
sorts of what is it when you get a full
out<00:02:32.690> card<00:02:32.959> as<00:02:33.140> your<00:02:33.290> promo<00:02:33.620> I<00:02:34.040> think<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.400> full

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
out card as your promo I think the full

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.370 
out card as your promo I think the full
ratio<00:02:34.970> for<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.300> booster<00:02:35.600> packs<00:02:35.840> isn't<00:02:36.290> the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
ratio for the booster packs isn't the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.070 
ratio for the booster packs isn't the
best<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:37.459> I'm<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:37.910> guess<00:02:38.120> we<00:02:38.239> can<00:02:38.360> only<00:02:38.480> hope<00:02:38.750> now

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
best so I'm I guess we can only hope now

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.809 
best so I'm I guess we can only hope now
these<00:02:39.560> things<00:02:39.800> are<00:02:39.980> always<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.370> pain<00:02:40.670> in<00:02:40.790> the

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
these things are always a pain in the

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.120 
these things are always a pain in the
butt<00:02:41.090> open<00:02:41.569> because<00:02:41.989> I<00:02:42.170> feel<00:02:42.500> like<00:02:42.530> I'm<00:02:42.860> only

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
butt open because I feel like I'm only

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.890 
butt open because I feel like I'm only
three<00:02:43.489> years<00:02:43.550> old<00:02:43.880> so<00:02:44.150> open<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:44.600> one<00:02:44.750> like

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
three years old so open this one like

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.460 
three years old so open this one like
that<00:02:45.310> pull<00:02:46.310> out<00:02:46.430> that<00:02:46.820> one<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.959> think<00:02:48.350> we're

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
that pull out that one and I think we're

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.000

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
I think that's all we need to do that

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.070 
I think that's all we need to do that
look<00:02:51.739> there<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.850> yet<00:02:53.120> it's<00:02:53.269> all<00:02:53.420> nicely<00:02:53.690> set

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080
