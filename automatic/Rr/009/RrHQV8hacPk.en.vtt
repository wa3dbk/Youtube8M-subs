 the Argentine wanted he could push but 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.140
 he could never decipher the riddle that 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.790
 had in front the hand never reached 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.790
 prodigious that gave him the triumph

 for his part mayweather jr went out to do 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.730
 what he knows best how to paste and what does not 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.950

 mayweather jr started the fight to the 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.190
 offensive took the reins of the battle 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.469
 came in with the left hack as 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.870
 whip then topped with the rectum of 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.500
 right maidana did not imagine that floyd 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.500
 I was going to attack him 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.409
 and things did not change in the second 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.180
 Mooney roll dominated the actions 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.119
 he went in and out he wallowed in the 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.310
 maidana's face the third round was the 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.189
 same movie but with a different 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.990
 final when the episode was agonizing 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.409
 Chinese took a right wing blown that 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.970
 moved all ideas to mayweather jr 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.840
 who took two false steps before 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.840
 get to your corner 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.469
 mayweather jr back to his bases 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.539
 walk in the ring enter and exit 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:36.240
 when the Chinese pressed him 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.920
 moored the boxing of the American was 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.689
 higher 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.210
 the Argentine gave sample of 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.830
 despair in the eighth round when 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.920
 kenny bayless separated him shot a 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.259
 bite to mayweather glove jr 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.450
 who complained copiously the referee did not 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.619
 he saw the action so he did not take away a 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.619
 point to the South American 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.400
 maidana wanted but could not despite 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.030
 and to know the style of his rival never 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.340
 could impose his boxing on the 10th roll the 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.350
 Argentine pushed Floyd so the 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.040
 third on the surface it reduced a 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.040
 point to chinese 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.879
 in the last two episodes mayweather 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.819
 jr pulled out the whole experience gave him ball 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.470
 to maidana road around the ring he let go 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.870
 blows when he had to do it and he 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.180
 defended well in the end the Argentine not 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.189
 could achieve the feat 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:35.230
 and the judges saw 115-112 and 116-111 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.450
 twice for the still champion of 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.290
