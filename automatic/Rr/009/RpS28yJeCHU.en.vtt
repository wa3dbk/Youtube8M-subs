00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.800
 creeps and if there are several of these worms 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.310
 they come across from time to time you 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.460
 should be pleased as an elephant like this 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:35.130

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:38.129
 animals in the berries means you bought the fruit 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.120
