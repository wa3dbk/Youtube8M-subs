Krypton<00:01:33.399> so<00:01:34.240> that's<00:01:35.109> gonna<00:01:36.509> keep<00:01:37.509> us<00:01:37.659> from

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
Krypton so that's gonna keep us from

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.499 
Krypton so that's gonna keep us from
having<00:01:38.020> heat<00:01:38.469> loss<00:01:38.709> about<00:01:39.609> that<00:01:39.909> window<00:01:40.270> and

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
having heat loss about that window and

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.260 
having heat loss about that window and
then<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.889> windows<00:01:42.249> not<00:01:42.399> worth<00:01:42.639> a<00:01:42.759> darn<00:01:42.939> if<00:01:43.149> it

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
then the windows not worth a darn if it

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.359 
then the windows not worth a darn if it
doesn't<00:01:43.600> have<00:01:43.779> good<00:01:44.109> weather<00:01:44.829> stripping

doesn't have good weather stripping

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.550 
doesn't have good weather stripping
because<00:01:45.579> you<00:01:45.729> need<00:01:45.909> insulating<00:01:46.659> value<00:01:46.689> and

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
because you need insulating value and

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.239 
because you need insulating value and
you<00:01:48.100> need<00:01:48.249> air<00:01:48.490> tightness<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:53.049> a<00:01:53.200> farcical<00:01:53.619> C
