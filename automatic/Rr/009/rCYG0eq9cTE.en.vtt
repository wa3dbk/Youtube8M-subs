 First I see mostly two problems 1 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.190
 problems are getting traffic 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.789
 This topic is very interesting to me 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.980
 I am constantly digging it up myself right now I 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.539
 I organize for example a conference on 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.660

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.329
 I personally can help you this traffic with 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.080
 youtube video traffic but also traffic 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.350
 social networks 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.700

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.920
 why I will gladly teach you 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.890
 the next topic which I am sure of all 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.110
 big problems this topic is sales rather 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.520
 not that a problem is needed 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:25.710

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.170
 and I will tell you honestly and very 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.840
 cool sales when the amount of well 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.630

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.790

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.720

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.149
