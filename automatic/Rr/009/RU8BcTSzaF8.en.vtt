00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.910
 Hi everybody 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.980
 before winter sdk known 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.510
 many motorists problems begin 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.510
 with battery 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:20.640
 last year I bought this 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.900
 charger and 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.699
 lay your all all sat down 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.119
 battery 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:33.660
 at home I regained the density rose 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.910
 in almost all the jars to the optimum 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.400
 meanings and I'm leaving on it yet 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:45.170
 the rest of the remaining winter spring summer 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.269
 autumn and winter has come again 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.290
 I decided to recharge the battery 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.770
 right at home 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:57.840
 the garage without removing it from the car 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:01.050
 means well, there are some guidelines 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.770
 First, it is desirable to fully include 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:09.520
 sever the kremlin 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:11.380
 the positive ones are different and here they are 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.460
 red as you see i have disconnected 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:18.560
 and minus 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.560
 which goes to the body over here 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:27.860
 charger set desirable 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.610
 automatic mode it allows not 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.610
 boil the battery 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:40.580
 prevent strongly gas emission and not 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.580
 God forbid it to explode 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.650
 the machine controls me 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.700
 the voltage of the 14 symbol itself is the principle 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.750
 many will think 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:00.180
 how is the battery so much more than 14 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:04.390
 4 serve and desirable but I will tell you 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:08.710
 he doesn't boil for him 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.120
 ammeter shows about 2 amps you 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.500
 I already had a little battery 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:16.620
 discharged since I basically drive by 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.620
 the city 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.230
 short distance 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.000
 He does not have time to charge as well 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.990
 it is now dark cold the stove is on 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.350
 headlights 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.470
 the wipers are working the weather we have already 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:39.330
 filmed so the battery does not have time 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:42.210
 therefore, I recommend to purchase 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.240
 simple charger and 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.730
 during the winter at least once or twice 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.420
 charge up to 90 to 100 percent your 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.140
 battery 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:57.730
 In this way he will serve you as much as possible 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.180
 long will not let the most inappropriate 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.180
 moment 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.550
 such advice is so small 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.550
 video all bye
