 eggs a cup of water and half a cup of

 our desserts and cookies always 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.870
 let's use vegetable oil 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.540

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.510
 condensed milk a can of milk 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.490
 evaporated and half a cup of sour cream or 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.440
 Taste front tailor would be our arrow 

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:09.020
 We are going to use three teaspoons of 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.800
 instant field four in a cup and 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.870
 twelve notes 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.540
 We're going to need a teaspoon of 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.430
 warm water and cream to spread 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.780
 desserts that is frozen but 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.909
 fully defrost 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.200
 once we have all our 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.909
 ingredients we will proceed to make 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.010
 our parties when the 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.659
 package but first of all let's 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.130
 Preheat our oven to 350 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.710
 fahrenheit 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.480
 to 180 degrees Celsius here I leave you the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.170
 conversion board 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.540
 well in a vessel we mix the flour 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.620
 of our box with water and 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.210
 oil at an average low speed and the 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.920
 we mix all until it is well 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.230
 dissolved the flour in the water and the 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.570
 oil this we can beat for 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.370
 around 30 seconds or more if it's 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.520
 necessary we can not have anything left 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.470
 white no water and oils out there loose 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.660
 or if only 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.970
 once well stirred in our flour 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.909
 we proceed to throw 11 eggs 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.039
 beating well after each 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.230
 when all the ingredients are well 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.510
 mixed we keep beating for 2 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.459
 minutes at the same speed and this is 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.500
 makes our cake take more 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.500
 oxygen and we grow a little more 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.060
 after our two minutes simply 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.060
 we leave stir 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.200
 and does not know what to give something 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.570
 you have to oil our bag I have 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.490
 this because from your legs simply 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.130
 follow the instructions of baked 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.320
 package once entered in our 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.690
 mold we proceed to place all our 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.910
 mix in it and when everything is ready and 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.100
 put and fixed in the mold we are in the 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.840
 processes in the bottom immobilized 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.280
 uniformly so that everything is even 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.170
 when our oven is hot 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.820
 we immediately proceed to bake myself 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.200
 I have to bake 30 minutes but 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.900
 depending on your mold you can bake 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.000
 more or less 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.360
 and while the 30 minutes pass and it 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.489
 bakes or makes our favorite 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.680
 we proceed to tailor mix distances and 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.680
 like the areas if in a blender 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.180
 it also evaporates gives the taste we can 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:18.850
 burn already the four coffee crops 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:21.980
 instantaneous and all this we make laws 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.010
 and once everything is well stirred 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.840
 we let act and we will have something 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.180
 I eat more 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.920
 and that this cubito the tres leches 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.319
 We reserve a little until our 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.599
 come out, remember what you have in 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.459
 condensed milk evaporated from magic and 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:41.800
 things teaspoons of coffee rest 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.800
 all this as just book 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.540
 when the 30 minutes have passed 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.389
 to your profile by state 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.389
 we put a knife or a stick and what 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:55.909
 we put in half hot oil 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.230
 clean or dry because many pills 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.599
 let's put a grid and we're going to 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.560
 have our half and there we go to 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.560
 place our recipes 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:25.759
 so that the cake can absorb all 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.860
 the milk does not know how to look something like 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.930
 who make up our milk that 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.840
 we had booked and we are going to deposit 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.669
 on top of all the factor all our 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.710
 laws all our books have to 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:39.110
 fit inside the paper for that are the 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.160
 holes if you think you need more 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.620
 many points 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.810
 feel free of the ovens when 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.060
 we have all our milk and have it 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.910
 deposited on top of the cake we are going to 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.910
 take our pylon paper and now 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.040
 so that our 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.770
 paper has to look like this more or less when 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.770
 we have finished deposits all of them 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.380
 while our cake stays in the 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.060
 fridge absorbing all the demands of 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.980
 your little bit more let's make our 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.750
 coverage for our cake our 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.120
 coverage is obviously going to be tetamen 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.820
 so let's take a teaspoon of 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.320
 warm water and we're going to mix it together 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.660
 with the two teaspoons of coffee 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.360
 instantaneous that we had separately we're going 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:30.170
 to mix very well and does not know how to 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:33.640
 mix more or less thickens this well and 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.930
 let's take a cup of the cover 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.090
 frozen that we had totally is 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.180
 frozen and we're going to put it in the 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.610
 cachito already this coverage we are going to 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:49.060
 put all our our coffee 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:52.060
 very strong and this army very well 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.060
 white 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.280
 and when we already have all very well two 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.930
 trajectories you have to give a little something 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.900
 similar to knowing them and the intention 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.030
 commercial and this we will use for 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.580
 past cultural use we are going to 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.530
 check a plate and already our cake 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.740
 has already left the fridge and we are going to 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.319
 take our little plate 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.810
 and we're going to put it on top of our 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:22.199
 but the little dish is going to infect you 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.360
 more or less like this not very flat 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:27.419
 nor is very deep a monarchist 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.970
 normal and we're going to put it on top of 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:32.550
 our mold of our cake and let's 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:36.440
 to give it a quick spin and we're going to 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.440
 tap it with the sides 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:42.370
 so let us dedicate our cake 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.009
 and once in our case we proceed to 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.930
 find him still 

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:47.930
 let's put it on top 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:07:01.460
 and because I hope you like it I hope 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.969
 delight and everyone is engaged in jobs and 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.969
 the symptoms 

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:16.399
 good
