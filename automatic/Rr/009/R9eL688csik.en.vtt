00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.140
 good to see this is very good and this 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.800
 friend is the one who has diarrhea they do not see 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.800
 here champion 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.750
 good that you feed him normally 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.340
 we give dog food the one that touches him 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.070
 but sometimes we also give 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.869
 leftovers from those that go to meals 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.700
 well there may be the problem is that 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.140
 we tend to think that what 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.000
 that we do well to us too them 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.040
 goes well to them but each species has 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.690
 your specific needs to have 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.220
 adequate nutrition but so much 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.410
 difference there is between dogs and 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.210
 we the truth is that if you look at 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.400
 humans are true omnivores is 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.350
 say we eat all the cats are 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.810
 strict carnivores eat only 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.550
 meat and instead the dogs are 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.070
 facultative carnivores that is to say that 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.200
 his diet is based a lot on meat but 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.300
 they also eat other things then of course 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.369
 all this with good entails that the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.550
 nutritional needs and diet be 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.290
 different 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.090
 also the same as what happens with people 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.460
 It is not the same diet that needs a 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.230
 puppy that diet that needs a 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.300
 Elderly dog ​​that the diet he needs 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.000
 a pregnant female clear all this 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.620
 leads to different diets yes I see 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.900
 Of course, the truth makes sense 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.700
 you say yes therefore if you do not give 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.980
 a proper diet can have problems 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.780
 of health since the ideal is that you give it a 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.760
 already specific diet for animals that 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.950
 It would be very studied to satisfy 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.990
 all your nutritional requirements but 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.790
 I understand but give him some leftovers 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.890
 although they are few, it would not be so 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.710
 Severe not have the problem of getting 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.990
 leftovers has two problems one is that 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.720
 will eat less of your food therefore 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.950
 the diet will not be so balanced and the 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.900
 another is that it can give you problems 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.590
 digestive can vomit and can 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.590
 give him diarrhea 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.390
 that's why he has 10 days effectively and 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.830
 you also have to watch a lot because 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.650
 there are foods from people who are 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.200
 toxic to toxic animals I do not 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.840
 say what are you then look at the onion 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.700
 for example they can be anemia 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.410
 milk to both dogs and cats 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.110
 of cow's milk can give them diarrhea 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.700
 grapes and raisins are also toxic 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.800
 chocolate sometimes feel bad 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.260
 there's also a lot of food there 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.600
 they are toxic or they feel bad because 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.010
 do not digest them well it's better to follow us 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.540
 because you are already beginning to 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:33.270
 scare your name do not be scared of 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.800
 all ways to be calm and that 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.800
 you know that they have a balanced diet 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.560
 and healthy then it is better to use a food 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.450
 specific not for dog and for according to 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.450
 age that they have the exercise they do 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.530
 and you to me
