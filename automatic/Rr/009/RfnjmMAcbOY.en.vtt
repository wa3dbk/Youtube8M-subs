thing<00:01:28.850> about<00:01:28.940> this<00:01:29.240> fan<00:01:29.600> is<00:01:29.630> I<00:01:30.350> have<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.710> door

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
thing about this fan is I have the door

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.480 
thing about this fan is I have the door
I<00:01:31.720> pretty<00:01:32.720> much<00:01:32.840> to<00:01:33.020> solve<00:01:33.290> this<00:01:33.470> lock<00:01:33.770> it's

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
I pretty much to solve this lock it's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.490 
I pretty much to solve this lock it's
not<00:01:34.640> one<00:01:34.850> of<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.060> industrial<00:01:35.870> sized<00:01:36.080> locks

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
not one of the industrial sized locks

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.010 
not one of the industrial sized locks
but<00:01:36.770> I<00:01:36.800> mean<00:01:36.979> it'll<00:01:37.130> pretty<00:01:37.400> much<00:01:37.490> keep<00:01:38.020> people

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
but I mean it'll pretty much keep people

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.980 
but I mean it'll pretty much keep people
out<00:01:39.140> in<00:01:39.350> too<00:01:39.530> good<00:01:39.680> a<00:01:39.740> Brinks<00:01:40.520> lock<00:01:40.930> so<00:01:41.930> you

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
out in too good a Brinks lock so you

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.270 
out in too good a Brinks lock so you
don't<00:01:42.110> have<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.320> worry<00:01:42.470> about<00:01:42.560> people<00:01:42.800> gyming

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
don't have to worry about people gyming

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.800 
don't have to worry about people gyming

the cargo gate so it's secure on the
inside<00:04:38.440> let's<00:04:39.440> pop<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:39.800> engine

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.409 
inside let's pop the engine
