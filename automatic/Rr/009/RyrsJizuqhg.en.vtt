head a headphone port or a
three-and-a-half<00:02:06.630> millimeter<00:02:07.220> headset<00:02:08.220> jack

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
three-and-a-half millimeter headset jack

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.359 
three-and-a-half millimeter headset jack
so<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.729> can<00:02:08.849> use<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.090> for<00:02:09.239> microphone<00:02:09.720> at

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
so you can use it for microphone at

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.030 
so you can use it for microphone at
like<00:02:11.360> I<00:02:11.450> said<00:02:11.510> this<00:02:11.720> is<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.900> convertible<00:02:12.620> laptop

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
like I said this is a convertible laptop

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.399 
like I said this is a convertible laptop
so<00:02:14.110> not<00:02:15.110> only<00:02:15.319> can<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:15.830> be<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.040> laptop<00:02:16.580> but<00:02:17.409> it

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
so not only can it be a laptop but it

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.280 
so not only can it be a laptop but it
can<00:02:18.530> also<00:02:18.620> function<00:02:19.190> as<00:02:19.519> a<00:02:19.580> tablet<00:02:20.049> it's<00:02:21.049> it's

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
can also function as a tablet it's it's

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.720 
can also function as a tablet it's it's
a<00:02:21.470> really<00:02:21.709> beautiful<00:02:21.950> display<00:02:22.610> this

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
a really beautiful display this

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.640 
a really beautiful display this
particular<00:02:23.060> model<00:02:23.390> is<00:02:23.599> a<00:02:23.659> 1080p<00:02:24.080> display<00:02:24.590> you

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
particular model is a 1080p display you

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.770 
particular model is a 1080p display you
can<00:02:24.830> get<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.099> in<00:02:25.159> higher<00:02:25.340> resolution<00:02:26.030> but<00:02:26.659> of

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
can get it in higher resolution but of

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.360 
can get it in higher resolution but of
course<00:02:26.989> you'd<00:02:27.110> have<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.349> pay<00:02:27.500> for<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:27.860> on<00:02:28.190> the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
course you'd have to pay for that on the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.580 
course you'd have to pay for that on the
13.3<00:02:29.030> inch<00:02:29.299> display<00:02:29.690> though<00:02:29.840> I<00:02:29.870> really<00:02:30.200> really

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
13.3 inch display though I really really

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.920 
13.3 inch display though I really really
like<00:02:30.829> the<00:02:31.069> 1080p<00:02:31.489> display<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.120> think<00:02:32.450> it's<00:02:32.690> fine

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
like the 1080p display I think it's fine

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.069 
like the 1080p display I think it's fine
on<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.260> 13.3<00:02:33.860> inch<00:02:34.129> screen<00:02:34.870> windows<00:02:35.870> 10

really great laptop should less you're
really<00:03:40.730> a<00:03:40.760> long<00:03:40.940> time<00:03:41.290> comes<00:03:42.290> in<00:03:42.440> either<00:03:42.530> a

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
really a long time comes in either a

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.729 
really a long time comes in either a
core<00:03:42.949> i5<00:03:43.400> or<00:03:43.699> core<00:03:43.760> i7<00:03:44.720> this<00:03:44.930> particular<00:03:45.410> model

core i5 or core i7 this particular model

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.460 
core i5 or core i7 this particular model
is<00:03:45.829> an<00:03:45.949> i7<00:03:46.599> for<00:03:47.599> most<00:03:47.750> people<00:03:48.049> that<00:03:48.079> I<00:03:48.199> think<00:03:48.230> an

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
is an i7 for most people that I think an

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.439 
is an i7 for most people that I think an
i5<00:03:48.799> should<00:03:49.040> be<00:03:49.129> fine<00:03:49.400> but<00:03:49.910> definitely<00:03:50.299> go<00:03:50.419> for

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:50.449 
i5 should be fine but definitely go for

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:52.990 
i5 should be fine but definitely go for
the<00:03:50.660> eight<00:03:50.810> gigabytes<00:03:51.290> of<00:03:51.470> RAM<00:03:51.709> only<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:52.609> most
