00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
come to here this is where the glitch is

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.819 
come to here this is where the glitch is
going<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.939> actually<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:01.320> once<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.680> would

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
going to actually be just once I would

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.090 
going to actually be just once I would
tuck<00:02:02.009> jump<00:02:02.310> onto<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.880> ledge<00:02:03.290> now<00:02:04.290> then<00:02:04.860> just

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
tuck jump onto this ledge now then just

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.690 
tuck jump onto this ledge now then just
watch<00:02:05.310> go<00:02:06.210> like<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.890> go<00:02:07.890> up<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.250> then<00:02:08.459> what<00:02:08.670> I

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
watch go like that go up and then what I

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.020 
watch go like that go up and then what I
do<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.720> just<00:02:10.009> single<00:02:11.009> jump<00:02:11.250> backwards<00:02:11.849> and

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
do is I just single jump backwards and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.520 
do is I just single jump backwards and
then<00:02:12.120> DoubleTap<00:02:12.569> jump<00:02:12.989> up

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
then DoubleTap jump up

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.330 
then DoubleTap jump up
so<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:15.420> then<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.630> do<00:02:15.780> an<00:02:16.050> extra<00:02:16.440> dash<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:17.040> do<00:02:17.190> the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
so and then I do an extra dash to do the
