that's about it for everything that I've
I<00:06:50.479> mean<00:06:51.050> I<00:06:51.139> got<00:06:51.500> like<00:06:51.680> a<00:06:51.710> bunch<00:06:51.949> of<00:06:52.069> clothes<00:06:52.250> but

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.800 
I mean I got like a bunch of clothes but

later<00:06:54.020> just<00:06:54.439> because<00:06:54.800> that<00:06:55.789> would<00:06:55.909> probably

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.180 
later just because that would probably

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.200 
later just because that would probably
take<00:06:56.409> quite<00:06:57.409> a<00:06:57.469> bit<00:06:57.590> of<00:06:57.650> time<00:06:57.860> also<00:06:58.550> i<00:06:58.789> do<00:06:58.909> have

make use of that Channel and maybe it

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:19.480
