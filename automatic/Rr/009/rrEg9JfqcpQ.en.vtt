00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.030
 the goal pieters what demands heitinga of the wheel in the rear than the 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.600
 inspector strootman and van bommel koek sneijder and vanie behind the deep 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.490
 striker klaas jan huntelaar who has fallen into shape 0 4 and wants to score a lot 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.600
 but that goes for more players against with extremely weak san marino and all 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:21.160
 six minutes 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.800
 is it for the first time hit 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.169
 Robin van Persie 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.210
 as specified by mark van bommel 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.060
 that is 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.060
 Chronicle of an announced monster score 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.430
 and certainly the opening phase of the Netherlands 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.180
 give hope in that regard 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.180
 Wesley Sneijder a beautiful swipe 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.350
 after just over fifteen minutes, that already becomes 3 0 at the cross of dirk 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.350
 excellent header live johnny heitinga 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.000
 san marino 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.900
 is reduced 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.000
 team barely touches the ball 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 it is not for nothing that it is a number 203 of the world ranking 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.260
 traveled along with the goal numbers 0 for a 33 against to Eindhoven but is now 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.410
 close to a goal 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.810
 from numerous supplier andy silva not even that far apart 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.030
 still in the first half the chances of robin van persie 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.820
 Assisted by Wesley Sneijder 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.340
 but this time 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.070
 venlo 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.640
 in the second half, the netherlands remains hungry 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.510
 van persie robben huntelaar and there is calf 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.110
 beautifully played out 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.280
 and then there is no more keeping to the word san marino 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.750
 pace brought up again by the netherlands the would like double digits 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:48.170
 to win 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.240
 that means 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.400
 a 9 0 scored twice 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.620
 on Finland and Norway 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.900
 but never with 10 0 or more huntelaar 5 0 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.160
 I understand map and is here falls 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
 this the 6 0 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:10.869
 he no longer puts a brake on two minutes later 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.970
 animal attack from the netherlands with sneijder at the huntelaar elementary school one more 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.259
 times if someone doesn't upset you 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:19.059
 the 7 0 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:23.590
 now the san marino goal figures are the qualifying pool 0 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.590
 for 40 against and that in 0 40 

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.039
 it does not stop there at 8 0 on the way strostman 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.929
 huntelaar 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:38.499
 the double digits are forthcoming that feel said that the players are also feeling on 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:39.210
 the field 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.210
 Grab your straw man 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:44.030
 van persie with 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.240
 Weighers are fourth in the evening and then there are more than ten minutes to play 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:53.089
 the team also wants to come but who will make it 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.089
 the honor of being wesley sneijder 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.809
 so it is a special evening and also a historical evening 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:05.059
 because with such a can thick numbers 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:08.879
 won the netherlands to be allowed to open the still a bit of joy at the 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.379
 aldi 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.379
 laurens vanthoor 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.969
 you can hear it well 11 0 music from the other results in the group of 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:23.340
 the netherlands was also favorable for orange hungary's of sweeney 2 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.760
 a ciman you have to drop here by more than 3 6 points ahead of the 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.890
 number two sweden 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.560
 the world cup in poland and ukraine is now also close to what group winners are placing 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.980
 of course anyway and the Netherlands was allowed to fall to second place then 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.780
 the chance is huge that orange is the best number two and is not allowed either 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.770
 to the world cup the other numbers two you can play
