00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hello friends today enough 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.850
 the weather is bright and it's great for 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.710
 to tell you how it works 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.840
 hdr mode and 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.820
 to demonstrate we decided 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.559
 come to one of the most cultural places 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.559
 Moscow Kremlin Izmailovo 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.110
 actually inside spanish itself 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.850
 the Kremlin is not as interesting as I thought 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.280
 especially cool 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.160
 tent right in the middle of the Kremlin to spoil 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.510
 all the old Russian flavor but here next 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.510
 there is a flea market let's go for it there 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.489
 hdr is a very useful feature which 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.050
 is in all modern smartphones but 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.450
 many people don't know how to use it 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.670
 thats the easiest to explain with an example we 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.260
 long thought how to show that 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.240
 more clearly in the end decided to make 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.140
 photo under the bridge that we found 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.930
 right on the market 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.820
 The fact is that the cover of the phone can not 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.010
 taking pictures of both dark and 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.020
 light areas ie photos 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.730
 will it be seen by the fact that under the bridge 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.580
 the rest will be lit or vice versa 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.250
 but waiting solves this problem and gives us 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.740
 how would the mean in the end we have on 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.320
 photos you can see it as under the bridge and 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.020
 everything else and in the end all new york they 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.670
 dark things as it should without light or 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.810
 dark spots most often this technique 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.340
 used when needed 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.350
 take a picture against the bright 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.690
 light source for example in dark 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.790
 a room against a window or in a tunnel 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.250
 or maybe from cooking we chose not 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.500
 very beautiful place but it is completely 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.440
 shake the meaning of hdr here in this photo 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.970
 for example, I can't be seen at all, but I'm there 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.850
 there is because here in this photo 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.810
 I can see but the left will be great 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.649
 lighted spot 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.490
 and here is a snapshot of hdr as you can see 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:14.130
 and the exit of the tunnel and me and the wall and 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.060
 in general all the impurities of the tunnel yes she 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.920
 was actually pick up 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.930
 some place for painting her 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.030
 Old Russian blacksmiths we have masters on 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.250
 all hands and could even chop down 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.130
 but she herself to make a successful hail 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.670
 here we have such ropes 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.670
 program- 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.740
 In general, such a problem was formed 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.690
 this thing is long with macheto ship 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.290
 hire what does this weight mean this 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.500
 shorter sticking out shorter 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.370
 In the frame it does not fit I would play 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.360
 she completely 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.360
 doesn't fit here 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.719
 the floor so fit 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.460
 we are in the shower keeping perfectly visible swarm 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.530
 if you click on the anchor to be seen 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.630
 we all sky turns white 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.180
 but there really is some clouds if 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.070
 on them poke them there they can be seen and here 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.730
 weak at the same time could be seen and anchor 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.770
 clouds we turn on chieftain mode 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.940
 tune in to the brightest spot and 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.940
 take a picture 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.159
 but something tells me that days 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.159
 of these 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.470
 So 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.470
 here 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.940
 the last time hdr is often used 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.530
 not intended to use it 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.989
 as a tool for creating creative 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.879
 pictures and now applies even in those 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.890
 when he is not needed at all but 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.409
 in rare exceptions it looks 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.780
 rather unusually the best effect 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.220
 achieved in the application snape seed all 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.989
 what you need is download here 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.540
 photo and select filter 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.190
 order the program then do everything yourself 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.530
 you will only pick up the brightness by 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.410
 taste and save your photo 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.090
 Well, that's basically all the photo with 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.250
 creative effect your dear made 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.289
 right on your phone download and in 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.180
 instagram with each C major also this 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.710
 The effect can be obtained in Photoshop here 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.199
 there is a special function who is called 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.030
 toning order here everything is very simple 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.260
 to figure out how everything works 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.780
 just enough at random 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.500
 twist different sliders and literally 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.449
 after a couple of attempts you get 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.520
 interesting picture is the coolest thing 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.320
 apply this effect can be everywhere 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.449
 that is, if you think that the photo 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.520
 turned out too boring and just 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.520
 make her your dear
