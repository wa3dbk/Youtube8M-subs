give you a very quick explanation what
has<00:00:43.649> been<00:00:43.890> happening<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.399> low<00:00:45.090> pressure

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
has been happening is low pressure

has been happening is low pressure
sitting<00:00:46.079> offshore<00:00:46.350> see<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> isobars<00:00:47.340> dipping

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
sitting offshore see the isobars dipping

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.729 
sitting offshore see the isobars dipping
down<00:00:47.969> then<00:00:48.360> coming<00:00:48.660> back<00:00:48.690> up<00:00:48.989> look<00:00:49.500> at<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
down then coming back up look at the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.189 
down then coming back up look at the
source<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.250> our<00:00:50.370> air<00:00:50.640> if<00:00:50.879> wind<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.690> flowing

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
source of our air if wind is flowing

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.709 
source of our air if wind is flowing
along<00:00:52.620> these<00:00:52.949> lines<00:00:53.010> which<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.789> does<00:00:54.000> then<00:00:54.570> our

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
along these lines which it does then our

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.450 
along these lines which it does then our
source<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.260> air<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.620> coming<00:00:55.800> up<00:00:56.070> from<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
source of air is coming up from the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.340 
source of air is coming up from the
south<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.090> west<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.480> low<00:00:57.629> pressures<00:00:58.050> off<00:00:58.199> to

south and west with low pressures off to
the<00:00:58.440> west<00:00:58.850> we<00:00:59.850> get<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.090> predominant<00:01:00.660> southwest

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
the west we get a predominant southwest

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.439 
the west we get a predominant southwest
wind<00:01:01.710> flow<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.399> will<00:01:02.550> bring<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.760> storms<00:01:03.239> but

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
wind flow that will bring in storms but

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.000 
wind flow that will bring in storms but
it's<00:01:03.600> also<00:01:03.750> going<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.080> keep<00:01:04.260> us<00:01:04.439> milder<00:01:04.979> than

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
it's also going to keep us milder than

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.770 
it's also going to keep us milder than
normal<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.060> what<00:01:06.299> has<00:01:06.450> been<00:01:06.630> happening

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780
