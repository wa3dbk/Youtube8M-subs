00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
chicken or shrimp to the dish and I had

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.920 
chicken or shrimp to the dish and I had
a<00:00:16.529> suggestion<00:00:16.890> from<00:00:17.220> burn<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.880> Sanae<00:00:18.240> who<00:00:18.690> said

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930

of<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> dish<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.810> think<00:00:22.199> that's<00:00:22.289> what<00:00:22.439> he<00:00:22.500> said

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650

of the dish I think that's what he said
um<00:00:23.330> you<00:00:24.330> could<00:00:24.449> do<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.600> that's<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.080> great<00:00:25.230> way

um you could do that that's a great way

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.320

to use up leftover cooked chicken or
shrimp<00:00:27.359> or<00:00:27.840> seafood<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.439> if<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.220> had<00:00:29.400> raw

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.400

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
meat that you wanted to add in what i

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.990

would<00:00:31.590> do<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:32.130> cut<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.610> up<00:00:32.700> really<00:00:32.880> small

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
would do is cut it up really small

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.240 
would do is cut it up really small
bite-sized<00:00:33.600> pieces<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.260> then<00:00:34.710> sauté<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.130> with
