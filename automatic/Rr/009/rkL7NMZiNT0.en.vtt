00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.849
 I am an angel fallen from God I know the 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:14.849
 word 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.290
 Martin is one of many people who 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.050
 although they claim to be Christian they know that 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.060
 They go to hell if they die as best 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.369
 we can do for them is to go and 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.650
 explain the gospel we should 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.369
 make them see that their need is urgent 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.369
 of salvation 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.870
 what do you think happens when people 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:44.839
 dies where his soul goes to hell all 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.510
 the one who does not accept god from his heart 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:51.949
 you are a Christian I am a fallen angel of 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.760
 god I know the word because when 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.760
 you are God's servant 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.000
 I observed god I was a preacher 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.000
 also and I fell 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.040
 you consider yourself a good person 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.390
 morally 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.390
 There is no taste 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.180
 have you ever told a lie 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.000
 then those of us who say lies as 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.700
 how are we called liars some 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.550
 they have stolen if then you want to put 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.920
 stolen robber then you are a shoplifter and 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.630
 true liar ever admires a 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.520
 woman with lust jesus said that if one 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.420
 does that adulterous with her in the heart 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.420
 yes 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.340
 Martin looks now there is a problem you 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.640
 admitted that you are a liar and a thief 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.289
 adulterous at heart but at least 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.600
 you need when you die you will face 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.829
 to God on the day of judgment despite 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.450
 that you were in a church was a 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.579
 time does not make any difference 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.619
 until you reach the day of judgment if you die 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.179
 today and God judges you by these laws 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.159
 do you think it would be if I do not feel guilty of 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.159
 break them I'm guilty 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.229
 fable iii that we deserved guilty is a 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.479
 punishment or a reward a punishment like 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.360
 it is called the punishment of god hell 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.890
 how is hell I have no notion but 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.720
 I think it's going to be something terrible like 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.400
 is in the scriptures and scriptures 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.560
 they talk about it being a place of punishment and 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.200
 darkness I do not want you to go there 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.840
 but the fire that does not go dark 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.720
 of torment you will be alone without water 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.540
 without food without rest and from there will go 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.580
 God is punishing people there 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.080
 someone god up write the presence 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.019
 of God but God in your life is 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.400
 punishing there and god the that as a 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.400
 testimony those who break their laws 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.930
 what can you do to save yourself martÃ­n 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.599
 accept God in my heart is the only 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.310
 way that means that because you 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.720
 I explain this in life there is no 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.340
 place that says that I can do to 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.140
 goodbye, on the contrary, we are sinners 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.280
 guilty that we need him to us 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.569
 accept that he save us from the heart as 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.670
 functionalities imagine that I am a 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.830
 I take your wallet and I go out 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.380
 running and then the judge catches me 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.180
 I apologize to the judge this judge here 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.180
 on earth I would forgive myself 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.810
 not now because it would be unfair pipes and 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.810
 oscar 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.470
 Send him to jail because prison 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.630
 God is terrible and his justice is 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.400
 true good then with only 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.400
 ask for forgiveness we can not save ourselves 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.220
 What we need is for someone to pay 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.410
 for the fine that we owe 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.180
 jesus christ jesus wine he died in the 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.680
 cross suffering the anger that we do not 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.680
 we deserve resurrected 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.420
 and now he sends all the men who are 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.459
 repent of your sins and put your 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.109
 faith alone in Jesus Christ his confidence in 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.930
 Jesus Christ as if it were a parachute and 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:04:01.060
 you're going to jump out of an airplane ok 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.060
 You need to know how to do that, Martin 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.890
 you 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.390
 Martin when you are not going to die 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.890
 it could be that you die today you can do 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.810
 that it is the last time that we see ourselves in 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.000
 the life that you die what I die and 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.620
 He wants to tell you, God does not want to give you 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.900
 that punishment god did something amazing 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.210
 to save you, you need to submit to him 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.980

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.410
 heart with new wishes and then 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.910
 You can meet your Christian 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.580

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.620
