00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the sounds of the jam pedals ripple this

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.609 
the sounds of the jam pedals ripple this
is<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> smooth<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.510> sweet<00:01:03.719> analog<00:01:04.290> phaser

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
is a smooth and sweet analog phaser

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.310 
is a smooth and sweet analog phaser
inspired<00:01:05.549> by<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.820> original<00:01:06.150> classic<00:01:06.780> mxr

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320

phase<00:01:07.350> 45<00:01:08.330> jam<00:01:09.330> pedals<00:01:09.659> made<00:01:09.840> some

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
phase 45 jam pedals made some

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.600 
phase 45 jam pedals made some
modifications<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> original<00:01:11.250> circuit

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
modifications to the original circuit

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.670 
modifications to the original circuit
resulting<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.270> truly<00:01:12.450> original<00:01:12.840> Jam<00:01:13.320> pedal

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
resulting in a truly original Jam pedal

00:01:13.680 --> 00:02:02.430 
resulting in a truly original Jam pedal
design<00:01:14.070> with<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> great<00:01:15.000> vintage<00:01:15.299> tone

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.740 

and<00:02:03.440> just<00:02:03.710> like<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:03.980> original<00:02:04.430> mxr<00:02:04.910> face<00:02:05.150> 45

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
and just like the original mxr face 45

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.109 
and just like the original mxr face 45
it<00:02:05.960> just<00:02:06.140> has<00:02:06.260> one<00:02:06.530> simple<00:02:06.860> control<00:02:07.400> for<00:02:07.700> speed

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
it just has one simple control for speed

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.450 
it just has one simple control for speed
which<00:02:08.899> is<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.320> rate<00:02:09.590> at<00:02:09.830> which<00:02:09.860> it<00:02:10.160> goes<00:02:10.250> in

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
which is the rate at which it goes in

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.190 
which is the rate at which it goes in
and<00:02:10.610> out<00:02:10.670> of<00:02:10.820> phase<00:02:11.060> we're<00:02:11.360> going<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.870> increase

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
and out of phase we're going to increase

00:02:12.200 --> 00:03:45.940 
and out of phase we're going to increase
that<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.500> little<00:02:12.590> bit<00:02:12.860> right<00:02:12.890> now

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.130 

in<00:03:46.950> my<00:03:47.670> opinion<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.209> simple<00:03:48.510> phaser<00:03:48.720> like<00:03:48.959> this

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
in my opinion a simple phaser like this

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.869 
in my opinion a simple phaser like this
really<00:03:49.379> sounds<00:03:49.739> great<00:03:49.890> with<00:03:50.040> anything<00:03:50.609> be<00:03:50.849> it

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
really sounds great with anything be it

00:03:50.879 --> 00:04:15.659 
really sounds great with anything be it
rhythm<00:03:51.269> or<00:03:51.390> lead<00:03:51.569> distorted<00:03:52.260> or<00:03:52.410> clean
