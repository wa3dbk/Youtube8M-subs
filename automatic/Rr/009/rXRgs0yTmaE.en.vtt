00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
two games have been on pretty poor form

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.709 
two games have been on pretty poor form
as<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.309> say<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.550> live<00:00:51.030> poor<00:00:51.210> defense<00:00:51.480> wish<00:00:51.690> to

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
as you say the live poor defense wish to

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.830 
as you say the live poor defense wish to
be<00:00:52.320> fares<00:00:52.760> been<00:00:53.760> playing<00:00:54.000> pretty<00:00:54.090> well<00:00:54.420> or

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
five and as a sailor for defense can be

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.490 
five and as a sailor for defense can be
shaky<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.420> their<00:01:33.420> attack<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.079> certainly<00:01:34.439> very

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
good their taste against this West and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.270 
good their taste against this West and
defense<00:01:36.720> should<00:01:37.409> stretch<00:01:37.740> them<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.130> suit

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.280 
defense should stretch them and suit
should<00:01:38.790> cause<00:01:39.060> what<00:01:39.270> some<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.200> other

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
should cause what some of the other

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.690 
should cause what some of the other
problems<00:01:40.590> are<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.740> back<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.400> which<00:01:41.549> i<00:01:41.640> think

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
problems are the back in which i think

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.149 
problems are the back in which i think
lipil<00:01:42.000> will<00:01:42.150> score<00:01:42.360> quite<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> few<00:01:42.750> okay<00:01:43.649> well

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
lipil will score quite a few okay well

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.920 
lipil will score quite a few okay well
yet<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> value<00:01:45.149> gets<00:01:45.329> going<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.720> over

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
