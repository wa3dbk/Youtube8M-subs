00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
another Eddie Van Halen harmonic this is

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.639 
another Eddie Van Halen harmonic this is
from<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.730> Panama<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.930> lies<00:00:34.200> at<00:00:34.620> the

from the the Panama the lies at the
Tokyo<00:00:35.070> Dome<00:00:35.250> 1989<00:00:36.239> video<00:00:36.750> if<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.710> if<00:00:37.950> anyone

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
Tokyo Dome 1989 video if you if anyone

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.470 
Tokyo Dome 1989 video if you if anyone
has<00:00:38.399> seen<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:39.200> there's<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.260> part<00:00:40.559> at<00:00:41.329> in<00:00:42.329> this

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
has seen that there's a part at in this

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.080 
has seen that there's a part at in this
video<00:00:42.750> anyway<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.950> version<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.550> three

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
video anyway this version of it three

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.840 
video anyway this version of it three
minutes<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.660> 17<00:00:46.260> seconds<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.309> harmonic

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
minutes and 17 seconds this harmonic

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.940 
minutes and 17 seconds this harmonic
thing<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.360> Eddie<00:00:48.510> does<00:00:48.780> while<00:00:49.649> him<00:00:49.920> and

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
thing that Eddie does while him and

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.630 
thing that Eddie does while him and
Sammy<00:00:50.340> are<00:00:51.829> trading<00:00:52.829> off<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:54.059> song<00:00:54.270> and

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
Sammy are trading off in the song and

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.389 
Sammy are trading off in the song and
basically<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.030> all<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:58.010> you<00:00:59.010> hit<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
basically this is all it is you hit the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.920 
basically this is all it is you hit the
third<00:00:59.879> string<00:01:00.829> right<00:01:02.270> you<00:01:03.270> can<00:01:03.420> use<00:01:03.570> your<00:01:03.690> pick

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
third string right you can use your pick

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.440 
third string right you can use your pick
although<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> lot<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.070> times<00:01:05.220> Eddie<00:01:05.460> just<00:01:05.729> just

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.780 

just<00:01:09.450> does<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:12.170> anyway<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.400> part<00:01:14.640> that's

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
just does that anyway so the part that's

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.870 
just does that anyway so the part that's
in<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.000> video<00:01:15.240> I'll<00:01:15.509> show<00:01:15.810> you

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.560 

I<00:01:24.030> think<00:01:25.030> that's<00:01:25.210> it

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
I think that's it

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.590 
I think that's it
I<00:01:25.600> think<00:01:26.259> that's<00:01:26.469> what<00:01:26.590> it<00:01:26.680> was<00:01:26.799> and<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:28.479> way

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
I think that's what it was and the way

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.630 
I think that's what it was and the way
you<00:01:28.659> do<00:01:28.810> that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
you do that

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.969 
you do that
basically<00:01:30.640> it's<00:01:30.970> just<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.240> third<00:01:31.479> string<00:01:31.979> like

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
basically it's just a third string like

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.300 
basically it's just a third string like
a<00:01:33.009> pull<00:01:33.280> off<00:01:33.429> and<00:01:34.770> then<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:35.890> want<00:01:36.039> to<00:01:36.100> hit<00:01:36.189> the

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
a pull off and then you want to hit the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.609 
a pull off and then you want to hit the
harmonic<00:01:36.820> at<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.060> fifth<00:01:37.299> fret<00:01:37.600> on<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:37.960> third

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
harmonic at the fifth fret on the third

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:50.639 
harmonic at the fifth fret on the third
string<00:01:38.649> so<00:01:39.610> it<00:01:39.729> sounds<00:01:39.939> like<00:01:40.000> this<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:49.500> know<00:01:50.500> I'm

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
string so it sounds like this I know I'm

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.080 
string so it sounds like this I know I'm
getting<00:01:50.770> some<00:01:51.009> weird<00:01:51.099> overtones<00:01:51.580> there<00:01:51.880> but

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
getting some weird overtones there but

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.120 
getting some weird overtones there but
it<00:01:53.020> doesn't<00:01:53.319> matter<00:01:53.439> when<00:01:53.740> you<00:01:53.799> use<00:01:53.920> in<00:01:54.069> the

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
it doesn't matter when you use in the

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.580 
it doesn't matter when you use in the
bar

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.130 

so<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:59.100> like<00:01:59.280> slow<00:01:59.790> motion<00:02:00.210> oh<00:02:00.650> sorry<00:02:01.650> my<00:02:03.140> my

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
so it's like slow motion oh sorry my my

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.480 
so it's like slow motion oh sorry my my
witty<00:02:04.650> call<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:05.070> came<00:02:05.159> on

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
witty call just came on

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:15.530 
witty call just came on
let<00:02:05.640> me<00:02:05.700> turn<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:05.909> off<00:02:06.030> hang<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.360> what's<00:02:06.540> that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.820 

it's<00:02:16.540> faster<00:02:16.990> if<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.140> do<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.440> than<00:02:17.620> if<00:02:17.710> I<00:02:17.800> just

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
it's faster if I do that than if I just

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.480 
it's faster if I do that than if I just
restart<00:02:18.460> the<00:02:18.730> video<00:02:19.590> my<00:02:20.590> air<00:02:21.100> conditioning

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
restart the video my air conditioning

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.110 
restart the video my air conditioning
that's<00:02:21.670> what<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:21.820> was

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
that's what it was

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:34.100 
that's what it was
so<00:02:22.660> anyway<00:02:22.930> slow<00:02:23.770> motion<00:02:24.190> it's<00:02:24.430> like<00:02:24.670> this<00:02:32.820> so

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
so anyway slow motion it's like this so

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.860 
so anyway slow motion it's like this so
what<00:02:35.110> he<00:02:35.170> does<00:02:35.350> is<00:02:35.680> he<00:02:35.770> hits<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.450> string<00:02:37.450> hits

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
what he does is he hits the string hits

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.920 
what he does is he hits the string hits
the<00:02:38.020> harmonic<00:02:39.300> through<00:02:40.300> his<00:02:40.450> six<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.750> bar

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
the harmonic through his six the bar

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.710 
the harmonic through his six the bar
down<00:02:41.200> brings<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.770> bar<00:02:41.980> back<00:02:42.250> up<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:43.540> in<00:02:43.630> the

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
down brings the bar back up and in the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.850 
down brings the bar back up and in the
video<00:02:43.930> if<00:02:43.990> you<00:02:44.050> see<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.290> video<00:02:44.410> he's<00:02:44.710> like

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
video if you see the video he's like

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.240 
video if you see the video he's like
moving<00:02:45.100> his<00:02:45.280> guitar<00:02:45.610> around<00:02:45.880> like<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:47.250> like

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
moving his guitar around like this like

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.920 
moving his guitar around like this like
he's<00:02:48.400> moving<00:02:48.550> her<00:02:48.820> around<00:02:48.850> with<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.660> sound

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
he's moving her around with the sound

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:59.130 
he's moving her around with the sound
that<00:02:50.080> he's<00:02:50.200> making<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:52.060> it's<00:02:52.180> like<00:02:58.020> then<00:02:59.020> when
