00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 good kids how are you and today 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.620
 we have a video that I suppose will not be the 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.359
 what to expect is a day like today I say 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.980
 because for many youtubers these days 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.690
 and maybe a few days before but in general 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.370
 these days are the appropriate ones to do 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.509
 the typical annual balance of the channel and the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.429
 truth is that this one usually goes over your 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.350
 progress in a video and in fact not 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.940
 I remember 71 last year but this one does not 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.430
 I feel like too much since recently 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.050
 we did a semi special and talking about 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.250
 I hope that in a short time I will have the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.410
 materials needed to do the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.789
 special 30,000 really but good 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.109
 let's stop with preambles and let's go 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.490
 direct to the video that as you will already have 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.660
 seen by the title will deal with the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.340
 absence in harlem of weapons 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.200
 preferred of many machine guns 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.700
 light that like the weapons of the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.070
 kind of support should give way the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.149
 battle or combat rifles I do not know well 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.790
 how will they translate it since the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.379
 translations are quite liberal but 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.579
 well they should also give way to 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.920
 Shotguns to happen to be 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.629
 exclusively pickups and good since 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.280
 we were talking a while ago about the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.300
 pick up if in fact I will leave the link 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.739
 the description just in case 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.170
 you lost by the dates on which 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.550
 we are and all that in fact I have the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.520
 feeling that I should also 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.989
 to be taking a break is more 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.170
 piro kids we'll see you in a week or 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.170
 A) Yes 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.350
 plus 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.149
 luckily for you and unfortunately 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.430
 for me I'm too born with not going down 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.780
 the social media blade the end let's continue with 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.039
 the issue that occupies us the truth is that 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.630
 one of the reasons why I do the 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.979
 video is because I know that many 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.689
 Interested in the subject given that you have 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.579
 said many times in other videos 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.960
 as by twitter I basically what 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.210
 you have said by all means that 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.220
 you have to tell me what the majority 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.960
 has told me is that obviously not 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.000
 like change and for those who say that 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.679
 I do not say anything negative about harlem to me 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.060
 I do not like this change of fact 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.710
 I think the partial loss of these 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.630
 weapons since as I said we can 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.189
 catch being pickups is pretty serious 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.619
 since I've always liked to play with 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.330
 they now well understand that there are people 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.979
 who likes to change as they 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.539
 change is worth the redundancy of 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.130
 light we are going to give one in quotes 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.140
 new class of weapons that I told you 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.000
 before the combat rifles that are going to 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.069
 be caliber rifles as a result 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.959
 high damage low recoil cadence 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.549
 elevated and you will forgive me for saying 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.229
 this but in the only thing that changes 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.599
 regarding a slight one is that instead 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.789
 of having 100 or 200 bullets these will have 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.530
 20 or 30 like a lot but it falls 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.150
 that does not matter what makes special to 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.340
 the light ones are that they have many bullets 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.959
 It is true that you want me to tell you 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.150
 battle rifle can replace a 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.630
 light as such but in the end if 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.670
 we look 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.840
 the good side if we try to look through 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.700
 the good side at least we can 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.770
 recover the gt3 as you saw in the first 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.180
 forge line as we know this will come 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.860
 accompanied by others for which I have 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.450
 pretty curious how to check a 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.070
 pretty cool rifle that we could see in 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.560
 action in youtube videos is English 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.090
 and it had a lot of recoil but it seemed 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.410
 that hit very hard apart from that 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.330
 we would have lashkar that we already have 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.920
 enjoying two games in a row and another 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.750
 that as you know the ones that you carry the most 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.480
 the channel had been wanting a lot of time 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.070
 the lack in short in theory there is a 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.630
 bad side and a good side and each one 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.340
 You can have your previous opinion about it 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.140
 I know for the moment I prefer to wait for the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.300
 imminent second beta and simply 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.740
 judge with what we play in it and 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.660
 good guarantees that would be all for the 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.100
 today's video the truth is that about this 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.840
 there was not much to explain but still 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.730
 so I wanted to ask you about it and well 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.350
 If someone did not know it, he already knows 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.420
 leave me as always all your 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.050
 opinions are in the sense that they are 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.740
 so nothing said this I say goodbye 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.740
 goodbye kids
