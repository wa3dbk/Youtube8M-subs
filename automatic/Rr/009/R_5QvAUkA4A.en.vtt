Soundcraft<00:00:03.120> Delta<00:00:03.810> 32<00:00:04.410> this<00:00:05.339> came<00:00:05.609> in<00:00:05.640> the

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
Soundcraft Delta 32 this came in the

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.030 
Soundcraft Delta 32 this came in the
complaint<00:00:06.390> is<00:00:06.620> two<00:00:07.620> things

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
complaint is two things

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.680 
complaint is two things
several<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.580> channels<00:00:09.050> had

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
several of the channels had

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.879 
several of the channels had
intermittence<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.990> sound<00:00:13.290> would<00:00:13.530> come<00:00:13.559> and

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
intermittence the sound would come and

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.049 
intermittence the sound would come and
go<00:00:14.040> some<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.519> them<00:00:14.639> were<00:00:14.730> actually

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
go some of them were actually

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.090 
go some of them were actually
mechanically<00:00:15.509> intermittent<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.139> tap<00:00:16.890> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
mechanically intermittent you tap the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.910 
mechanically intermittent you tap the
chassis<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.820> goes<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.300> out<00:00:18.920> several

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
chassis and it goes in and out several

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.800 
chassis and it goes in and out several
of<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.039> other<00:00:20.189> channels<00:00:20.520> acted<00:00:21.270> weird<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
of the other channels acted weird in the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.250 
of the other channels acted weird in the
sense<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:23.150> you<00:00:24.150> can<00:00:24.300> see<00:00:24.510> if<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.779> rotated

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
sense that you can see if you rotated

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.679 
sense that you can see if you rotated
the<00:00:25.529> gangue<00:00:25.890> pot<00:00:26.369> up<00:00:26.789> near<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.240> top<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
the gangue pot up near the top of the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.460 
the gangue pot up near the top of the
strip<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:29.099> sounded<00:00:29.640> very<00:00:30.179> noisy<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.050> then

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
strip it it sounded very noisy and then

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.860 
strip it it sounded very noisy and then
when<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.740> got<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.219> top<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:33.510> channel

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
when you got to the top the channel

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.840 
when you got to the top the channel
actually<00:00:34.020> cut<00:00:34.350> out<00:00:34.380> for<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> second<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.460> wasn't

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
actually cut out for a second it wasn't

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.240 
actually cut out for a second it wasn't
like<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> switch<00:00:36.840> but<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.170> would<00:00:37.350> sounded<00:00:38.160> like

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
like a switch but it would sounded like

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.790 
like a switch but it would sounded like
it<00:00:38.430> had<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.610> lot<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.850> DC<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:39.930> acting<00:00:40.649> real

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
it had a lot of DC on it and acting real

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.740 
it had a lot of DC on it and acting real
weird<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.280> went<00:00:41.910> looking<00:00:42.149> for<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.329> problems

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
weird so went looking for the problems

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.299 
weird so went looking for the problems
and<00:00:44.600> found<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.020> back<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.469> each<00:00:46.590> strip

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
and found this on the back of each strip

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.029 
and found this on the back of each strip
our<00:00:48.059> three<00:00:48.570> jacks<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.200> them<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.469> an<00:00:49.620> insert

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
our three jacks one of them is an insert

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.110 
our three jacks one of them is an insert
which<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> normalling<00:00:51.210> type<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:52.260> jack<00:00:53.120> has

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
which is a normalling type that jack has

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.610 
which is a normalling type that jack has
some<00:00:54.329> contacts<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.260> need<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.500> be

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
some contacts on it that need to be

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.160 
some contacts on it that need to be
closed<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.489> signal<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.480> pass<00:00:57.690> through<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
closed for signal to pass through the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.280 
closed for signal to pass through the
strip<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.879> so<00:01:01.399> those<00:01:02.399> insert<00:01:03.110> connectors<00:01:04.110> on

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
strip and so those insert connectors on

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.929 
strip and so those insert connectors on
the<00:01:04.470> back<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.949> each<00:01:05.070> channel<00:01:05.519> need<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.790> be

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
the back of each channel need to be

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.630 
the back of each channel need to be
cleaned<00:01:06.470> spray<00:01:07.470> some<00:01:07.740> cleaner<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.280> there<00:01:08.460> and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
cleaned spray some cleaner in there and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.120 
cleaned spray some cleaner in there and
then<00:01:08.760> run<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.060> plug<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.570> another<00:01:09.659> 25<00:01:10.530> times<00:01:10.890> or

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
then run a plug in another 25 times or

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.920 
then run a plug in another 25 times or
so<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.939> addition<00:01:13.520> all<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.909> cantos<00:01:15.689> odder

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
so in addition all the cantos odder

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.670 
so in addition all the cantos odder
joints<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> back<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.159> all<00:01:17.280> three<00:01:18.680> Jack's

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
joints on the back of all three Jack's

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.289 
joints on the back of all three Jack's
on<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> back<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.340> each<00:01:20.460> strip<00:01:20.790> need<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.180> be

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
on the back of each strip need to be

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.200 
on the back of each strip need to be
refloat<00:01:22.100> because<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.369> jacks<00:01:23.640> are<00:01:23.820> mounted

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
refloat because the jacks are mounted

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.880 
refloat because the jacks are mounted
mechanically<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> chassis<00:01:25.229> every<00:01:25.650> time

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
mechanically to the chassis every time

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.410 
mechanically to the chassis every time
the<00:01:26.130> thing<00:01:26.460> gets<00:01:26.640> moved<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> chassis

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
the thing gets moved to the chassis

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.890 
the thing gets moved to the chassis
flexes<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.650> flexes<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.310> jacks<00:01:29.820> relative<00:01:30.780> to

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
flexes it flexes the jacks relative to

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.030 
flexes it flexes the jacks relative to
the<00:01:31.020> PC<00:01:31.350> board<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.680> little<00:01:31.740> bit

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the PC board a little bit

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.359 
the PC board a little bit
and<00:01:32.630> over<00:01:33.630> time<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.079> cracks<00:01:34.380> those<00:01:34.650> joints<00:01:35.159> so

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
and over time it cracks those joints so

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.840 
and over time it cracks those joints so
there's<00:01:36.229> three<00:01:37.229> joints<00:01:37.740> for<00:01:37.890> every<00:01:38.280> Jack<00:01:38.579> and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
there's three joints for every Jack and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.120 
there's three joints for every Jack and
you<00:01:38.909> need<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.150> go<00:01:39.270> over<00:01:39.570> each<00:01:39.960> one<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.829> took

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
you need to go over each one that took

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.389 
you need to go over each one that took
care<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:42.390> intermittent<00:01:42.899> problem

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
care of the intermittent problem

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.359 
care of the intermittent problem
remaining<00:01:44.399> was<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.530> crazy<00:01:46.530> acting<00:01:47.130> game

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
remaining was the crazy acting game

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.270 
remaining was the crazy acting game
controls<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.630> sounded<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.590> dirty<00:01:49.860> pop<00:01:50.100> but

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
controls it sounded like a dirty pop but

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.149 
controls it sounded like a dirty pop but
it<00:01:50.369> wasn't<00:01:50.759> what<00:01:51.479> was<00:01:51.659> happening<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.229> one<00:01:53.070> of

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
it wasn't what was happening is one of

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.789 
it wasn't what was happening is one of
the<00:01:53.250> caps<00:01:54.110> in<00:01:55.310> in<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:57.299> mic<00:01:57.630> preamp<00:01:58.110> was<00:01:58.320> leaky

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
the caps in in the mic preamp was leaky

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.340 
the caps in in the mic preamp was leaky
and<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.159> was<00:01:59.280> allowing<00:01:59.820> DC<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.630> go<00:02:01.079> someplace

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
and it was allowing DC to go someplace

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.760 
and it was allowing DC to go someplace
where<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.799> wasn't<00:02:01.950> supposed<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.369> be<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:04.460> so

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
where it wasn't supposed to be and so

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.340 
where it wasn't supposed to be and so
it<00:02:07.770> turns<00:02:08.130> out<00:02:08.660> that<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:11.550> problem<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.420> all<00:02:13.050> of

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
it turns out that the problem on all of

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.670 
it turns out that the problem on all of
the<00:02:13.500> jacks<00:02:14.220> or<00:02:14.490> all<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.970> channels<00:02:15.960> was<00:02:16.350> one

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
the jacks or all of the channels was one

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.780 
the jacks or all of the channels was one
of<00:02:16.830> these<00:02:17.460> two<00:02:17.790> caps<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:19.250> on<00:02:20.250> some<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.730> the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
of these two caps and on some of the

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.250 
of these two caps and on some of the
channels<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.360> was<00:02:21.480> this<00:02:21.660> one<00:02:21.900> on<00:02:22.050> other

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
channels it was this one on other

channels it was this one on other
channels<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.860> was<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.160> one<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:24.270> way<00:02:24.420> to

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
channels it was this one and the way to

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.880 
channels it was this one and the way to
find<00:02:24.870> out<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.530> run<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.220> thing<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:27.890> thread

find out is to run the thing and thread

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.320 
find out is to run the thing and thread
it<00:02:28.950> on<00:02:29.100> fix<00:02:29.460> it<00:02:29.550> up<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:29.820> can<00:02:29.940> hear<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.180> main

and<00:02:33.180> listen<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.810> noise<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.470> then<00:02:34.850> lift

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
and listen to the noise and then lift

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.199 
and listen to the noise and then lift
one<00:02:36.660> side<00:02:36.990> of<00:02:37.230> these<00:02:37.380> caps<00:02:37.920> one<00:02:38.370> at<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.550> time<00:02:38.820> and

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
one side of these caps one at a time and

one side of these caps one at a time and
one<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.230> them<00:02:40.380> in<00:02:40.590> all<00:02:41.130> my<00:02:41.310> channels<00:02:41.670> fix<00:02:42.240> the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
one of them in all my channels fix the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.060 
one of them in all my channels fix the
problem<00:02:42.930> or<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.200> noise<00:02:43.350> went<00:02:43.650> away<00:02:43.740> when<00:02:44.040> I

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
problem or the noise went away when I

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.760 
problem or the noise went away when I
lifted<00:02:44.489> it<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:45.450> was<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.840> cap<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.709> I

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
lifted it and that was the cap that I

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.030 
lifted it and that was the cap that I
had<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.100> be<00:02:47.190> replaced<00:02:47.610> placed<00:02:48.600> these<00:02:48.810> are<00:02:49.040> 220

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
had to be replaced placed these are 220

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.900 
had to be replaced placed these are 220
mics<00:02:50.360> at<00:02:51.360> six<00:02:52.260> point<00:02:52.470> three<00:02:52.530> volts<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:53.250> put<00:02:53.790> in

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
mics at six point three volts I put in

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.810 
mics at six point three volts I put in
slightly<00:02:54.330> higher<00:02:54.540> voltage<00:02:55.140> ones<00:02:55.790> when<00:02:56.790> I

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
slightly higher voltage ones when I

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.820 
slightly higher voltage ones when I
replaced<00:02:57.300> them<00:02:57.510> could<00:02:58.200> be<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.440> might<00:02:58.560> not<00:02:58.709> be<00:02:58.800> a

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
replaced them could be it might not be a

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.440 
replaced them could be it might not be a
bad<00:02:58.980> idea<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.340> replace<00:02:59.459> both<00:02:59.910> of<00:02:59.940> those<00:03:00.209> but<00:03:00.420> I

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
bad idea to replace both of those but I

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.930 
bad idea to replace both of those but I
didn't<00:03:00.840> so<00:03:03.560> what<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.590> nice<00:03:05.220> thing<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.489> do<00:03:05.700> is<00:03:05.850> to

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
didn't so what a nice thing to do is to

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.880 
didn't so what a nice thing to do is to
take<00:03:06.120> out<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.480> first<00:03:06.690> three<00:03:06.989> channel<00:03:07.500> strips

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
take out the first three channel strips

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.050 
take out the first three channel strips
so<00:03:08.820> that<00:03:09.020> you<00:03:10.020> have<00:03:10.260> some<00:03:10.590> length<00:03:11.400> here<00:03:11.670> on<00:03:11.850> the

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
so that you have some length here on the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.449 
so that you have some length here on the
ribbon<00:03:12.269> cable<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:12.959> now<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.560> can<00:03:13.920> plug<00:03:14.220> the

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
ribbon cable and now you can plug the

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.820 
ribbon cable and now you can plug the
end<00:03:14.519> of<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.700> ribbon<00:03:14.850> cable<00:03:15.269> into<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.830> strip

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
end of the ribbon cable into the strip

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.250 
end of the ribbon cable into the strip
you're<00:03:17.010> working<00:03:17.370> on<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.700> actually<00:03:18.110> run<00:03:19.110> it

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
you're working on and actually run it

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.479 
you're working on and actually run it
easily<00:03:19.590> while<00:03:19.920> you're<00:03:20.070> working<00:03:20.400> on<00:03:20.430> I

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
easily while you're working on I

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.580 
easily while you're working on I
actually<00:03:20.790> soldered<00:03:21.480> on<00:03:21.600> this<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.049> lifted<00:03:22.440> the

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
actually soldered on this and lifted the

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.410 
actually soldered on this and lifted the
capacitor<00:03:23.430> legs<00:03:23.670> while<00:03:23.880> this<00:03:24.090> thing<00:03:24.120> was

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
capacitor legs while this thing was

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.509 
capacitor legs while this thing was
powered<00:03:24.750> up<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.049> well<00:03:25.200> was<00:03:25.470> hooked<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.220> an<00:03:26.340> amp

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
powered up and well was hooked to an amp

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.070 
powered up and well was hooked to an amp
where<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:26.760> could<00:03:26.970> hear<00:03:27.239> it<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:28.370> then<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.870> put<00:03:30.870> it

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
where I could hear it and then I put it

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.710 
where I could hear it and then I put it
all<00:03:31.170> back<00:03:31.290> together<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:32.570> everything<00:03:33.570> was

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
all back together and everything was

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.780 
all back together and everything was
fixed<00:03:34.200> I<00:03:34.290> bet<00:03:34.500> it's<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.709> common<00:03:35.130> problem<00:03:35.610> and

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
fixed I bet it's a common problem and

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.650 
fixed I bet it's a common problem and
I'll<00:03:35.910> bet<00:03:38.000> you<00:03:39.000> know<00:03:39.090> if<00:03:39.180> I<00:03:39.269> was<00:03:39.420> really<00:03:39.510> doing

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
I'll bet you know if I was really doing

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.960 
I'll bet you know if I was really doing
a<00:03:39.930> good<00:03:40.080> job<00:03:40.140> I<00:03:40.500> might<00:03:40.709> replace<00:03:41.580> those<00:03:41.910> two

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
a good job I might replace those two

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.900 
a good job I might replace those two
caps<00:03:42.510> on<00:03:42.750> every<00:03:43.080> strip<00:03:43.470> but<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.280> customer<00:03:44.760> is

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
caps on every strip but the customer is

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.640 
caps on every strip but the customer is
not<00:03:45.180> paying<00:03:45.480> that<00:03:45.600> kind<00:03:45.870> of<00:03:45.989> money<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:46.470> we're

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
not paying that kind of money so we're

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.920 
not paying that kind of money so we're
just<00:03:46.680> fixing<00:03:47.130> what's<00:03:47.340> wrong<00:03:47.519> with<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.930> but

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
just fixing what's wrong with it but

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.449 
just fixing what's wrong with it but
there<00:03:49.170> you<00:03:49.290> have<00:03:49.350> it<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.680> hope<00:03:49.860> that<00:03:50.040> helps<00:03:50.340> if

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
there you have it I hope that helps if

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.400 
there you have it I hope that helps if
you<00:03:50.549> get<00:03:50.700> one<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:50.910> these<00:03:51.060> in<00:03:51.330> it<00:03:51.480> could<00:03:51.600> be<00:03:51.660> it

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
you get one of these in it could be it

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.470 
you get one of these in it could be it
could<00:03:52.470> be<00:03:52.799> common<00:03:53.310> to<00:03:53.340> smaller<00:03:54.209> or<00:03:54.450> bigger

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
could be common to smaller or bigger

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.930 
could be common to smaller or bigger
boards<00:03:55.080> two<00:03:55.380> of<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.130> Delta<00:03:56.700> series<00:03:57.140> so<00:03:58.940> there

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
boards two of the Delta series so there

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.990 
boards two of the Delta series so there
