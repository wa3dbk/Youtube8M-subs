00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.999 

this<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> standard<00:01:18.180> cap<00:01:18.830> you<00:01:19.830> can

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
this is just the standard cap you can

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.370 
this is just the standard cap you can
get<00:01:20.220> some<00:01:20.670> pretty<00:01:21.090> thin<00:01:22.080> lines<00:01:22.350> with<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:24.350> do<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
get some pretty thin lines with it do a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.459 
get some pretty thin lines with it do a
little<00:01:25.650> square<00:01:25.890> for<00:01:26.220> you

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:36.730 

the<00:01:34.469> pressure<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.890> fairly<00:01:35.249> low<00:01:35.579> for<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.450> can

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
the pressure is fairly low for the can

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.309 
the pressure is fairly low for the can
this<00:01:37.740> one's<00:01:37.979> almost<00:01:38.670> empty<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:39.780> running<00:01:40.170> low

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
this one's almost empty it's running low

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:43.639 
this one's almost empty it's running low
but<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.310> found<00:01:42.119> after<00:01:42.450> using<00:01:42.630> other<00:01:42.899> caps<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.500> it

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
but I found after using other caps on it

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.459 
but I found after using other caps on it
as<00:01:43.799> well<00:01:44.450> it's<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.569> pretty<00:01:45.750> consistent<00:01:46.229> size<00:01:47.189> so

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
as well it's a pretty consistent size so

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.770 
as well it's a pretty consistent size so
it<00:01:49.469> really<00:01:49.649> doesn't<00:01:49.859> matter<00:01:50.069> what<00:01:50.369> cans<00:01:50.909> I

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
it really doesn't matter what cans I

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.300 
it really doesn't matter what cans I
mean<00:01:52.289> what<00:01:52.469> caps<00:01:52.709> you<00:01:52.920> use<00:01:53.130> with<00:01:53.789> the<00:01:53.939> cans<00:01:55.310> and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
mean what caps you use with the cans and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.120 
mean what caps you use with the cans and
one<00:01:56.459> last<00:01:56.670> thing<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.149> with<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.890> same

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
one last thing is that with the same

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.510 
one last thing is that with the same
color<00:01:59.459> I<00:01:59.789> know<00:02:00.270> for<00:02:00.780> flirt<00:02:01.109> that<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.490> a

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
color I know for flirt that this is a

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.240 
color I know for flirt that this is a
matte<00:02:02.789> finish<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.599> is<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.810> gloss<00:02:04.109> so<00:02:04.859> if

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
matte finish and this is a gloss so if

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.150 
matte finish and this is a gloss so if
you're<00:02:05.520> gonna<00:02:05.640> try<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.270> mix<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.629> two<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:07.619> a

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
you're gonna try and mix the two in a

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.960 
you're gonna try and mix the two in a
piece<00:02:08.640> or<00:02:08.849> whatnot<00:02:09.170> I'm<00:02:10.170> pretty<00:02:10.410> sure<00:02:10.500> the

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
piece or whatnot I'm pretty sure the

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.640 
piece or whatnot I'm pretty sure the
finish<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.540> colors<00:02:12.810> will<00:02:13.019> be<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> tad<00:02:13.470> bit

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
finish on the colors will be a tad bit

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.350 
finish on the colors will be a tad bit
different<00:02:13.980> just<00:02:14.129> because<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.819> little<00:02:15.060> AK<00:02:15.180> is

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
different just because the little AK is

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.500 
different just because the little AK is
a<00:02:15.390> gloss<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.549> just<00:02:17.549> be<00:02:17.700> careful<00:02:17.879> then<00:02:18.269> make

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
a gloss so just be careful then make

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.000 
a gloss so just be careful then make
sure<00:02:18.629> you<00:02:18.750> test<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.170> before<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.560> go<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:19.829> use

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
sure you test it before you go and use

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:32.100 
sure you test it before you go and use
it<00:02:20.810> that's<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:22.430> calm<00:02:23.430> rate<00:02:23.579> subscribe<00:02:23.879> peace

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110
