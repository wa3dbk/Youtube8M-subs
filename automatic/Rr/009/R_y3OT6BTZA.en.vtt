00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
quality build and construction that I've

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.850 
quality build and construction that I've
been<00:01:07.300> finding<00:01:07.750> is<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.200> case<00:01:08.380> with<00:01:08.619> pretty

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
been finding is the case with pretty

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.730 
been finding is the case with pretty
much<00:01:09.009> every<00:01:09.490> product<00:01:09.759> from<00:01:10.060> Lowepro

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
much every product from Lowepro

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.520 
much every product from Lowepro
in<00:01:11.740> other<00:01:11.920> words<00:01:12.160> it's<00:01:12.640> really<00:01:13.000> well-made

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
in other words it's really well-made

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.639 
in other words it's really well-made
there<00:01:14.530> are<00:01:15.390> two<00:01:16.390> d-rings<00:01:16.630> one<00:01:17.320> on<00:01:17.409> either<00:01:17.530> side

there are two d-rings one on either side

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.710 
there are two d-rings one on either side
so<00:01:18.070> you<00:01:18.159> can<00:01:18.310> actually<00:01:18.460> use<00:01:18.820> this<00:01:19.300> shoulder

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
so you can actually use this shoulder

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.050 
so you can actually use this shoulder
strap<00:01:19.990> but<00:01:20.860> there's<00:01:21.100> also<00:01:21.369> the<00:01:21.789> ability<00:01:22.000> to

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
strap but there's also the ability to

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.760 
strap but there's also the ability to
put<00:01:25.060> it<00:01:25.149> on<00:01:25.239> your<00:01:25.360> belt<00:01:25.569> and<00:01:26.170> what<00:01:26.319> I<00:01:26.349> really

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
put it on your belt and what I really

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.650 
put it on your belt and what I really
like<00:01:26.979> and<00:01:27.280> again<00:01:27.640> this<00:01:27.759> is<00:01:27.910> pretty<00:01:28.090> typical<00:01:28.300> of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
like and again this is pretty typical of

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.400 
like and again this is pretty typical of
this<00:01:28.840> company

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
this company

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.350 
this company
is<00:01:29.470> that<00:01:30.099> when<00:01:30.280> you<00:01:30.369> close<00:01:30.729> it<00:01:30.759> around<00:01:31.179> your

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
is that when you close it around your

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.839 
is that when you close it around your
belt<00:01:31.599> there's<00:01:32.080> another<00:01:32.560> tab<00:01:33.009> with<00:01:33.459> velcro

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:33.849 
belt there's another tab with velcro

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:35.309 
belt there's another tab with velcro
that<00:01:34.000> goes<00:01:34.179> over<00:01:34.569> it<00:01:34.599> so<00:01:34.899> that<00:01:35.020> you've<00:01:35.140> got<00:01:35.170> a

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
that goes over it so that you've got a

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:38.940 
that goes over it so that you've got a
doubly<00:01:36.099> secure<00:01:36.720> catch<00:01:37.720> which<00:01:38.500> is<00:01:38.679> really

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
doubly secure catch which is really

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.949 
doubly secure catch which is really
important<00:01:39.399> because<00:01:39.459> of<00:01:39.880> what<00:01:40.239> this<00:01:40.450> is<00:01:40.599> for<00:01:40.810> in

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:40.959 
important because of what this is for in

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:42.990 
important because of what this is for in
the<00:01:41.050> first<00:01:41.259> place<00:01:41.440> so<00:01:41.979> here's<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:42.610> scenario

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
the first place so here's the scenario

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.719

put<00:02:05.410> the<00:02:05.920> new<00:02:06.069> lens<00:02:06.310> on<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:06.670> camera<00:02:06.929> usually

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
put the new lens on the camera usually

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.080 
put the new lens on the camera usually
that<00:02:08.110> means<00:02:08.140> taking<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:09.160> putting<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:09.879> down<00:02:10.030> on

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
that means taking it putting it down on

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.059 
that means taking it putting it down on
the<00:02:10.300> ground<00:02:10.360> putting<00:02:11.349> it<00:02:11.440> down<00:02:11.560> on<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.920> table

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
the ground putting it down on the table

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.190 
the ground putting it down on the table
putting<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.879> down<00:02:13.000> on<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.270> desk<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.750> it's<00:02:14.140> a

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
putting it down on a desk and it's a

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.009 
putting it down on a desk and it's a
long<00:02:14.349> process<00:02:14.560> that's<00:02:15.280> fine<00:02:15.700> when<00:02:16.300> you've<00:02:16.720> got

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
long process that's fine when you've got

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.680 
long process that's fine when you've got
that<00:02:17.260> flexibility<00:02:18.069> not<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:19.120> fine<00:02:19.390> when<00:02:19.569> you're

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
that flexibility not so fine when you're

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.860 
that flexibility not so fine when you're
on<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.930> go<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:20.800> for<00:02:20.950> example<00:02:21.569> 99%<00:02:22.569> of<00:02:22.599> the<00:02:22.690> time

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
on the go so for example 99% of the time

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.470 
on the go so for example 99% of the time
I<00:02:22.900> think<00:02:23.110> I'm<00:02:23.560> going<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:23.830> be<00:02:23.980> using<00:02:24.310> my<00:02:24.670> kit

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
I think I'm going to be using my kit

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.080 
I think I'm going to be using my kit
lens<00:02:25.750> when<00:02:26.319> I'm<00:02:26.410> at<00:02:26.530> CES<00:02:26.800> in<00:02:26.860> January<00:02:27.090> but

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
lens when I'm at CES in January but

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.520 
lens when I'm at CES in January but
there<00:02:28.300> may<00:02:28.390> be<00:02:28.420> some<00:02:28.720> times<00:02:28.960> where<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.200> want<00:02:29.470> to

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
there may be some times where I want to

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.860 
there may be some times where I want to
use<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.830> telephoto<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:31.270> question<00:02:31.600> is<00:02:31.690> how<00:02:31.810> do

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
use the telephoto the question is how do

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.940 
use the telephoto the question is how do
I<00:02:31.930> swap<00:02:32.170> out<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.410> lenses

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
I swap out the lenses

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.380 
I swap out the lenses
that's<00:02:33.129> where<00:02:33.370> this<00:02:33.489> comes<00:02:33.760> into<00:02:33.910> play<00:02:34.120> so

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
that's where this comes into play so

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.210 
that's where this comes into play so
this<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:35.050> basically<00:02:35.349> what<00:02:35.470> happens<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:35.920> have

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
this is basically what happens you have

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.339 
this is basically what happens you have
the<00:02:36.790> ability<00:02:37.150> if<00:02:37.269> this<00:02:37.480> imagine<00:02:38.050> that<00:02:38.170> this<00:02:38.290> is

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
the ability if this imagine that this is

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.009 
the ability if this imagine that this is
sitting<00:02:38.709> on<00:02:38.800> my<00:02:38.920> waist<00:02:39.099> I<00:02:39.370> can<00:02:40.209> unsnap<00:02:40.569> this

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
sitting on my waist I can unsnap this

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.460 
sitting on my waist I can unsnap this
and<00:02:41.319> then<00:02:41.560> with<00:02:41.709> one<00:02:41.950> hand<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:42.400> can<00:02:42.640> open<00:02:42.910> it<00:02:43.000> up

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
and then with one hand I can open it up

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.380 
and then with one hand I can open it up
so<00:02:44.470> that's<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.310> unusual<00:02:45.700> design<00:02:45.970> here<00:02:46.209> is

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
so that's the unusual design here is

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.229 
so that's the unusual design here is
that<00:02:46.709> one<00:02:47.709> hand<00:02:48.069> pulls<00:02:48.430> two<00:02:48.700> zippers<00:02:49.030> at<00:02:49.150> the

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
that one hand pulls two zippers at the

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.710 
that one hand pulls two zippers at the
same<00:02:49.420> time<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:50.910> when<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.030> do<00:02:52.209> that<00:02:52.420> it

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
same time and when you do that it

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.759 
same time and when you do that it
accordions<00:02:53.319> open<00:02:54.150> now<00:02:55.150> if<00:02:55.239> you<00:02:55.360> look<00:02:55.540> inside

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
accordions open now if you look inside

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.920 
accordions open now if you look inside
there<00:02:56.769> is<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.250> lens<00:02:57.550> here<00:02:58.000> but<00:02:58.540> this<00:02:58.690> one's

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
there is a lens here but this one's

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.410 
there is a lens here but this one's
empty<00:02:59.110> so<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.040> idea<00:03:00.340> with<00:03:00.519> this<00:03:00.730> is<00:03:00.970> that<00:03:01.330> you

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
empty so the idea with this is that you

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.289 
empty so the idea with this is that you
take<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.870> lens<00:03:02.049> that<00:03:02.290> you<00:03:02.500> have<00:03:02.739> been<00:03:02.950> using

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
put it in there take this lens take off

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.120 
put it in there take this lens take off
