00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:51.940 

to<00:06:33.770> some<00:06:34.490> paper<00:06:49.990> you<00:06:50.990> can<00:06:51.140> see<00:06:51.350> because<00:06:51.680> it

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:51.950 
to some paper you can see because it

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.510 
to some paper you can see because it
says<00:06:52.130> they're<00:06:52.900> Wi-Fi<00:06:53.900> and<00:06:54.140> Ethernet<00:06:54.520> means

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
says they're Wi-Fi and Ethernet means

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:13.330 
says they're Wi-Fi and Ethernet means
it's<00:06:55.670> a<00:06:55.700> network<00:06:56.030> printer<00:06:58.030> that<00:07:11.440> yeah<00:07:12.440> it's

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340 
it's a network printer that yeah it's

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.610 
it's a network printer that yeah it's
like<00:07:13.460> that<00:07:13.490> so<00:07:13.790> it's<00:07:13.940> easier<00:07:14.180> to<00:07:14.210> look<00:07:14.620> for

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:15.620 
like that so it's easier to look for

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:37.380 
like that so it's easier to look for
