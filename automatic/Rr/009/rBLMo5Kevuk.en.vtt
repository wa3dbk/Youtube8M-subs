and generally accepted that to me

indicates that we have a problem within

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.460 
indicates that we have a problem within
a<00:02:49.790> program<00:02:50.060> that<00:02:50.599> we<00:02:50.780> need<00:02:50.989> to<00:02:51.140> correct

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
a program that we need to correct

a program that we need to correct
because<00:02:51.739> that<00:02:51.890> is<00:02:52.250> not<00:02:52.489> consistent<00:02:53.090> with<00:02:53.450> our

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
because that is not consistent with our

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.619 
because that is not consistent with our
culture<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.909> think<00:02:56.180> this<00:02:56.360> is<00:02:56.510> an

culture and I think this is an

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.890 
culture and I think this is an
opportunity<00:02:57.200> for<00:02:57.379> us<00:02:57.739> to<00:02:57.769> execute<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.640> reset<00:02:59.120> to

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
opportunity for us to execute a reset to

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.680 
opportunity for us to execute a reset to
refocus<00:03:00.349> back<00:03:00.860> on<00:03:01.159> the<00:03:01.700> full<00:03:02.000> meaning<00:03:02.239> of<00:03:02.540> our

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
refocus back on the full meaning of our

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.410 
refocus back on the full meaning of our
priorities<00:03:03.319> to<00:03:03.560> make<00:03:03.590> sure<00:03:04.069> that<00:03:04.549> no<00:03:04.879> student

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
priorities to make sure that no student

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.570

where they may have to wait a year or
