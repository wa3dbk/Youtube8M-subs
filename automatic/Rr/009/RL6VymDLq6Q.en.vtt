00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.759 
our whole story on the box actually
that's<00:00:26.970> how<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.119> know<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.510> um<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.289> then<00:00:28.680> in

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
that's how I know this um and then in

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.710 
that's how I know this um and then in
1947<00:00:29.250> they<00:00:29.730> had<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.119> lot<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.390> knowledge<00:00:30.599> about

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
1947 they had a lot of knowledge about

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.260 
1947 they had a lot of knowledge about
canvas<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.590> leather<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.940> they<00:00:33.030> use<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
canvas and leather so they use the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.220 
canvas and leather so they use the
vulcanized<00:00:33.600> rubber<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.930> they<00:00:34.050> made<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
vulcanized rubber that they made the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.780 
vulcanized rubber that they made the
tires<00:00:34.410> out<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:35.040> make<00:00:35.130> boot<00:00:35.370> soles<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.590> so

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
tires out of to make boot soles and so

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.950 
tires out of to make boot soles and so
they've<00:00:38.790> been<00:00:38.910> used<00:00:39.090> all<00:00:39.239> over<00:00:39.270> France<00:00:39.690> and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
even by the French Foreign Legion and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.740 
even by the French Foreign Legion and
now<00:00:41.610> they're<00:00:41.760> making<00:00:41.879> some<00:00:42.239> stylish<00:00:42.570> ones

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750

style for functionality which I love um

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.789 
style for functionality which I love um
so<00:01:07.560> let's<00:01:07.890> see<00:01:08.070> these<00:01:08.330> right<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.659> now<00:01:09.930> one<00:01:10.740> of

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
so let's see these right so now one of

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.160 
so let's see these right so now one of
the<00:01:10.890> key<00:01:11.040> features<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:12.270> palladium<00:01:12.960> boots

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
the key features of the palladium boots

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.840 
the key features of the palladium boots
a<00:01:13.380> signature<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:13.890> almost<00:01:14.130> all<00:01:14.280> their<00:01:14.430> boots<00:01:14.640> is

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
a signature on almost all their boots is

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.179 
a signature on almost all their boots is
that<00:01:15.119> they<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.479> fold<00:01:15.720> down<00:01:16.159> with<00:01:17.159> a

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
that they have a fold down with a

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.859 
that they have a fold down with a
different<00:01:17.520> kind<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.700> material<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.659> fold

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
different kind of material on the fold

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.570 
different kind of material on the fold
down<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.560> pretty<00:01:19.890> much<00:01:20.009> what<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.189> means<00:01:20.460> is

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
down so pretty much what that means is

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.100 
down so pretty much what that means is
that<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> sweater<00:01:21.390> material<00:01:21.509> very

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
that you have a sweater material very

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.090 
that you have a sweater material very
similar<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> cardigan<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.860> I'm<00:01:22.979> wearing
