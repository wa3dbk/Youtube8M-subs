00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
it's so much faster can it be

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.610 
it's so much faster can it be
do-it-yourself<00:04:55.360> people<00:04:55.660> like<00:04:55.750> ah<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.470> then

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
do-it-yourself people like ah and then

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.990 
do-it-yourself people like ah and then
one<00:04:56.770> starter<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:57.220> they'll<00:04:57.490> take<00:04:57.669> so<00:04:57.940> much

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
one starter and they'll take so much

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.700 
one starter and they'll take so much
longer<00:04:58.450> you<00:04:58.600> gotta<00:04:58.750> pee<00:04:58.900> at<00:04:59.020> our<00:04:59.200> barn<00:04:59.560> it's

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.370 
longer you gotta pee at our barn it's
done<00:04:59.940> this<00:05:00.940> is<00:05:01.090> so<00:05:01.240> much<00:05:01.390> faster<00:05:01.539> but<00:05:02.050> my

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
done this is so much faster but my

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.510 
done this is so much faster but my
wisdom<00:05:03.180> really<00:05:04.180> we<00:05:04.300> crossed<00:05:04.630> actually<00:05:05.520> but

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
wisdom really we crossed actually but

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.100 
wisdom really we crossed actually but
yeah<00:05:06.630> it's<00:05:07.630> not<00:05:07.750> like<00:05:07.780> I<00:05:07.960> didn't<00:05:08.289> buy
