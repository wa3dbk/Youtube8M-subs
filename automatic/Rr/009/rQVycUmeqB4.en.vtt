00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
that's when we came up with the idea of

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.829 
that's when we came up with the idea of
using<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.190> connect<00:00:48.489> platform<00:00:48.610> to<00:00:49.210> engage

with<00:01:06.939> this<00:01:07.000> experience<00:01:07.659> is<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:07.930> make<00:01:08.049> it<00:01:08.140> very

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
with this experience is to make it very

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.920 
with this experience is to make it very
natural<00:01:08.830> and<00:01:09.280> intuitive<00:01:09.580> so<00:01:10.540> about<00:01:10.630> a<00:01:10.689> six

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
technology made us all look great and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.460 
technology made us all look great and
look<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:05.039> winners<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.640> our<00:02:05.819> consumers

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
we've been able to create something that

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.250 
we've been able to create something that
no<00:02:16.950> one<00:02:17.280> has<00:02:17.840> Microsoft<00:02:18.840> has<00:02:18.989> clearly

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
no one has Microsoft has clearly

continuing<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.650> innovate<00:02:22.769> and<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.519> we<00:02:23.940> see<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
continuing to innovate and so we see the

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.970 
continuing to innovate and so we see the
future<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:24.660> being<00:02:24.840> limitless<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.680> terms<00:02:25.860> of

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
future is being limitless in terms of

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.740 
future is being limitless in terms of
the<00:02:26.040> possibilities<00:02:26.700> building<00:02:27.150> applications

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
the possibilities building applications

the possibilities building applications
on<00:02:27.900> Kinect<00:02:28.200> for<00:02:28.320> Windows<00:02:28.380> I<00:02:28.799> can<00:02:29.610> envision<00:02:29.850> a

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
on Kinect for Windows I can envision a

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.729 
on Kinect for Windows I can envision a
time<00:02:30.269> when<00:02:30.540> Kinect<00:02:30.870> for<00:02:30.989> Windows<00:02:31.049> technology

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
time when Kinect for Windows technology

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.920 
time when Kinect for Windows technology
is<00:02:31.860> used<00:02:32.100> at<00:02:32.760> our<00:02:32.790> 1,100<00:02:33.480> dealerships

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
is used at our 1,100 dealerships

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.470 
is used at our 1,100 dealerships
nationwide<00:02:34.500> as<00:02:35.489> a<00:02:35.549> way<00:02:35.760> for<00:02:35.940> consumers<00:02:36.209> to

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
nationwide as a way for consumers to

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.819 
nationwide as a way for consumers to
experience<00:02:36.930> our<00:02:37.079> vehicles<00:02:37.440> in<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.590> way<00:02:37.680> they've

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
experience our vehicles in a way they've

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.740 
experience our vehicles in a way they've
never<00:02:38.010> done<00:02:38.220> before<00:02:38.280> what<00:02:39.269> I<00:02:39.299> love<00:02:39.630> about

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
never done before what I love about

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.500 
never done before what I love about
Kinect<00:02:40.350> for<00:02:40.500> Windows<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.790> gives<00:02:42.000> us<00:02:42.209> a

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
Kinect for Windows is that it gives us a

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.690 
Kinect for Windows is that it gives us a
platform<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.829> allows<00:02:44.070> us<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.489> envision

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
platform that allows us to envision

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.509 
platform that allows us to envision
brand<00:02:45.329> new<00:02:45.510> application<00:02:45.799> experiences<00:02:46.799> that

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
brand new application experiences that

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.580 
brand new application experiences that
were<00:02:47.700> not<00:02:47.850> previously<00:02:48.150> possible<00:02:48.590> Pathfinder

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
were not previously possible Pathfinder

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.160 
were not previously possible Pathfinder
is<00:02:49.709> silver<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.970> game<00:02:51.180> has<00:02:51.359> changed<00:02:51.390> into

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
is silver and the game has changed into

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.250 
is silver and the game has changed into
gesture<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.010> voice<00:02:53.549> which<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.450> very

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
gesture and voice which is very

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.710 
gesture and voice which is very
interesting<00:02:55.560> territory<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.549> believe<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:57.269> is<00:02:57.450> a

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
interesting territory I believe it is a

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.750 
interesting territory I believe it is a
technology<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.650> will<00:02:59.190> be<00:02:59.340> used<00:02:59.579> and

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
technology that will be used and

technology that will be used and
leveraged
