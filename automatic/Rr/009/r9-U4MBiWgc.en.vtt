important as playing the objective and
having<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.960> good<00:00:19.140> score<00:00:19.470> now<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.039> true

that is very true you could have all the
bomb<00:00:22.590> plants<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.490> your<00:00:23.640> team<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.060> have<00:00:24.689> zero

have a good kill death ratio so there

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.900 
have a good kill death ratio so there
are<00:00:34.110> definitely<00:00:34.500> instances<00:00:34.980> where<00:00:35.610> having<00:00:35.850> a

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910

are definitely instances where having a
good<00:00:36.090> kill<00:00:36.390> death<00:00:36.570> ratio<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:37.260> important<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
good kill death ratio is important and

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.560 
good kill death ratio is important and

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
also if you are playing the objective

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.630 
also if you are playing the objective
and<00:00:40.050> doing<00:00:40.320> well<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:41.010> might<00:00:41.219> as<00:00:41.370> well<00:00:41.399> get

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
and doing well you might as well get

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.830 
and doing well you might as well get
some<00:00:41.820> kills<00:00:42.030> while<00:00:42.239> you're<00:00:42.329> at<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.480> because

is frustrating so having a good kill
death<00:00:52.530> ratio<00:00:52.649> as<00:00:53.129> its<00:00:53.460> not<00:00:53.699> really<00:00:53.940> important

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
death ratio as its not really important

situations where you're most likely
going<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.200> die<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.680> say<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:16.920> example<00:01:17.490> you're

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
going to die so say for example you're

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.700 
going to die so say for example you're
chasing<00:01:18.119> an<00:01:18.270> enemy<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.810> he<00:01:19.290> runs<00:01:19.439> around<00:01:19.560> a

it<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.810> be<00:01:21.900> extremely<00:01:22.470> tempting<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.979> just<00:01:23.159> run

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
it can be extremely tempting to just run

it can be extremely tempting to just run
around<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.610> corner<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.030> try<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.270> finish<00:01:24.479> him

there you haven't died you haven't

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.109 
there you haven't died you haven't
gained<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.680> kill<00:01:40.890> your<00:01:41.250> score<00:01:41.579> hasn't<00:01:42.000> been

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
gained a kill your score hasn't been

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.910 
gained a kill your score hasn't been
affected<00:01:42.540> at<00:01:42.659> all<00:01:42.780> now<00:01:43.049> if<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.350> did<00:01:43.619> chase

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
affected at all now if you did chase

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.310 
affected at all now if you did chase
after<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.399> enemy<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.119> say<00:01:45.720> there's<00:01:46.110> two

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
after that enemy and say there's two

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.600 
after that enemy and say there's two
enemies<00:01:46.680> around<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.950> corner<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.399> kill

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
enemies around the corner and you kill

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.609 
enemies around the corner and you kill
one<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.030> then<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.570> die<00:01:48.720> that's<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.079> kill<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.500> a

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
one and then you die that's a kill and a

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.740 
one and then you die that's a kill and a
death<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.159> really<00:01:50.549> cancels<00:01:51.060> itself<00:01:51.240> out

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
death so that really cancels itself out

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.719 
death so that really cancels itself out
and<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.110> really<00:01:52.350> isn't<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.890> wise<00:01:53.460> decision

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
and it really isn't a wise decision

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.190 
and it really isn't a wise decision
because<00:01:54.030> then<00:01:54.450> you're<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:54.689> dying<00:01:54.930> you're

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
because then you're just dying you're

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.959 
because then you're just dying you're
taking<00:01:55.470> yourself<00:01:55.560> out<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> action<00:01:56.490> so

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
taking yourself out of the action so

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.539 
taking yourself out of the action so
overall<00:01:57.299> chasing<00:01:58.170> enemies<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.799> get<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> kill<00:01:59.280> if

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
overall chasing enemies to get a kill if

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.249 
overall chasing enemies to get a kill if
you<00:01:59.579> know<00:01:59.969> you'll<00:02:00.149> die<00:02:00.180> or<00:02:00.689> even<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.079> think

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
you know you'll die or even you think

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.109 
you know you'll die or even you think
you<00:02:01.439> won't<00:02:01.560> die<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.430> just<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.759> risky

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
you won't die but it's just a risky

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.389 
you won't die but it's just a risky
situation<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.930> urge<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:04.920> not<00:02:05.159> do

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399

running<00:02:16.020> around<00:02:16.200> corners<00:02:16.710> when<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.100> don't

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
running around corners when you don't

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.830 
running around corners when you don't
even<00:02:17.400> know<00:02:17.550> how<00:02:17.880> many<00:02:17.940> enemies<00:02:18.390> are<00:02:18.420> going<00:02:18.720> to

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.600 
even know how many enemies are going to
be<00:02:18.990> there<00:02:19.200> now<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.620> next<00:02:19.980> step<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.250> something

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
be there now the next step is something

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.850 
be there now the next step is something
that<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:20.820> actually<00:02:21.000> suffer<00:02:21.630> from<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:22.260> lot<00:02:22.530> and

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
that I actually suffer from a lot and

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.190 
that I actually suffer from a lot and
that<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.010> holding<00:02:23.850> your<00:02:24.180> reload<00:02:24.630> after<00:02:25.020> almost

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
that is holding your reload after almost

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.230 
that is holding your reload after almost
every<00:02:25.410> kill<00:02:25.800> for<00:02:26.340> whatever<00:02:26.520> reason<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.210> just

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
every kill for whatever reason I just

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.420 
every kill for whatever reason I just
instinctively<00:02:28.080> reloaded<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:28.890> think<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.160> lot<00:02:29.310> of

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
instinctively reloaded I think a lot of

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.490 
instinctively reloaded I think a lot of
players<00:02:29.580> do<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.810> has<00:02:30.990> got<00:02:31.200> me<00:02:31.350> into

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
players do this and this has got me into

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.080 
players do this and this has got me into
a<00:02:31.530> lot<00:02:31.710> of<00:02:31.770> bad<00:02:32.010> situations<00:02:32.730> where<00:02:32.940> there's

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
a lot of bad situations where there's

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.970 
a lot of bad situations where there's
two<00:02:33.270> enemies<00:02:33.660> or<00:02:33.960> there's<00:02:34.440> two<00:02:34.590> enemies<00:02:34.890> I

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
two enemies or there's two enemies I

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.410 
two enemies or there's two enemies I
didn't<00:02:35.220> actually<00:02:35.310> even<00:02:35.460> see<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.940> second<00:02:36.300> one

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
didn't actually even see the second one

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.840 
didn't actually even see the second one
and<00:02:36.960> I<00:02:37.050> kill<00:02:37.260> one<00:02:37.500> start<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.370> reload<00:02:38.670> the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
and I kill one start the reload the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:39.940 
and I kill one start the reload the
second<00:02:39.150> enemy<00:02:39.390> comes<00:02:39.600> around<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.870> corner

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
second enemy comes around the corner

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.930 
second enemy comes around the corner
finishes<00:02:40.950> me<00:02:41.070> off<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.430> I'm<00:02:41.490> just<00:02:41.520> sitting

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
finishes me off and I'm just sitting

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.390 
finishes me off and I'm just sitting
there<00:02:41.970> with<00:02:42.330> noclip<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:43.140> my<00:02:43.290> gun<00:02:43.500> now<00:02:43.740> this<00:02:44.250> is

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
there with noclip in my gun now this is

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.040 
there with noclip in my gun now this is
really<00:02:44.610> frustrating<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.480> need<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.750> work<00:02:45.870> on

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
really frustrating and I need to work on

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.990 
really frustrating and I need to work on
this<00:02:46.200> but<00:02:46.410> for<00:02:46.620> whatever<00:02:46.770> reason<00:02:46.950> it's<00:02:47.670> hard

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
this but for whatever reason it's hard

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.280 
this but for whatever reason it's hard
so<00:02:48.240> this<00:02:48.360> these<00:02:48.600> are<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.810> kind<00:02:49.020> of<00:02:49.050> things

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
so this these are the kind of things

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.080 
so this these are the kind of things
that<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:49.920> just<00:02:49.950> need<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.340> constantly<00:02:50.730> be

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
reminding yourself just hold the reload

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.370 
reminding yourself just hold the reload

you run out of ammunition instead of

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.580 
you run out of ammunition instead of
waiting<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.730> reload<00:03:15.060> before<00:03:15.270> taking<00:03:15.780> down<00:03:15.990> the

waiting to reload before taking down the

waiting to reload before taking down the
third<00:03:16.860> guy<00:03:17.100> you<00:03:17.760> can<00:03:17.940> much<00:03:18.150> more<00:03:18.180> quickly

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
third guy you can much more quickly

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.270 
third guy you can much more quickly
switch<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.140> your<00:03:19.380> pistol<00:03:19.770> than<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.010> would<00:03:20.130> take

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
switch to your pistol than it would take

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.070 
switch to your pistol than it would take
to<00:03:20.340> reload<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:20.970> if<00:03:21.450> you're<00:03:21.630> good<00:03:21.870> with<00:03:22.050> your

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
to reload and if you're good with your

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.260 
to reload and if you're good with your
pistol<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:23.010> can<00:03:23.160> most<00:03:23.340> likely<00:03:23.460> take<00:03:23.940> out<00:03:24.120> the

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
pistol you can most likely take out the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.940 
pistol you can most likely take out the
third<00:03:24.510> enemy<00:03:24.960> now<00:03:25.110> this<00:03:25.290> is<00:03:25.440> another<00:03:25.740> good

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
third enemy now this is another good

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.700 
third enemy now this is another good
reason<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.370> actually<00:03:26.940> use<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.840> pistol<00:03:28.350> that<00:03:28.590> you

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
reason to actually use a pistol that you

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.560 
reason to actually use a pistol that you
enjoy<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.040> actually<00:03:29.490> unlock<00:03:29.850> attachments

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
for your pistol now I just went to a

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.070

pistols<00:03:32.700> only<00:03:32.790> match<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.390> do<00:03:33.510> this<00:03:33.630> because<00:03:33.960> it

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
pistols only match to do this because it

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.780 
pistols only match to do this because it
does<00:03:34.230> actually<00:03:34.410> take<00:03:34.590> quite<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.280> lot<00:03:35.460> of<00:03:35.580> kills

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
does actually take quite a lot of kills

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.520 
does actually take quite a lot of kills
to<00:03:36.030> do<00:03:36.360> it<00:03:36.480> normally<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:36.960> remember<00:03:37.320> that<00:03:37.350> you

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
to do it normally so remember that you

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.040 
to do it normally so remember that you

have that sidearm my sidearm has saved
me<00:03:40.230> in<00:03:40.380> a<00:03:40.440> lot<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:40.650> situations<00:03:40.920> that<00:03:41.370> I've<00:03:41.550> got

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
me in a lot of situations that I've got

me in a lot of situations that I've got
a<00:03:41.760> lot<00:03:41.940> better<00:03:42.120> at<00:03:42.600> remembering<00:03:43.170> that<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.410> have

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
one and it's much more effective to it

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.830 
one and it's much more effective to it
just<00:03:46.800> quickly<00:03:47.430> swap<00:03:47.730> weapons<00:03:47.940> rather<00:03:48.600> than

just quickly swap weapons rather than

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.780 
just quickly swap weapons rather than

waiting for your two second reload to
complete<00:03:51.120> now<00:03:51.510> probably<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.260> most<00:03:52.530> important

every time you set up a position
anywhere<00:05:03.330> you<00:05:03.870> always<00:05:04.320> want<00:05:04.530> to<00:05:04.590> be<00:05:04.650> aware<00:05:04.800> of

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
anywhere you always want to be aware of

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
your angles of exposure when I say

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.860 
your angles of exposure when I say
angles<00:05:07.650> of<00:05:07.740> exposure<00:05:08.160> I<00:05:08.460> mean<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.240> sides<00:05:09.630> of

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
angles of exposure I mean the sides of

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.839 
angles of exposure I mean the sides of
you<00:05:10.020> that<00:05:10.199> are<00:05:10.289> exposed<00:05:10.770> to<00:05:11.009> potential<00:05:11.639> fire

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
you that are exposed to potential fire

from<00:05:12.210> any<00:05:12.389> given<00:05:12.810> direction<00:05:12.990> now<00:05:13.500> a<00:05:13.740> lot<00:05:14.160> of

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
from any given direction now a lot of

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.860 
from any given direction now a lot of
this<00:05:14.430> really<00:05:14.669> comes<00:05:14.880> down<00:05:14.970> to<00:05:15.120> just<00:05:15.419> knowing

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
this really comes down to just knowing

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.050 
this really comes down to just knowing
the<00:05:15.990> map<00:05:16.199> and<00:05:16.470> comes<00:05:17.009> down<00:05:17.070> to<00:05:17.280> practice<00:05:17.759> and<00:05:18.000> I

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
the map and comes down to practice and I

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.580 
the map and comes down to practice and I
still<00:05:18.389> find<00:05:18.599> this<00:05:18.690> a<00:05:18.750> lot<00:05:18.990> of<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.169> time<00:05:19.380> or

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
still find this a lot of the time or

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.230 
still find this a lot of the time or
I'll<00:05:19.770> know<00:05:20.220> the<00:05:20.400> map<00:05:20.610> I<00:05:20.789> just<00:05:20.820> won't<00:05:21.150> even

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
I'll know the map I just won't even

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.820 
I'll know the map I just won't even
think<00:05:21.449> about<00:05:21.750> it<00:05:21.870> I'll<00:05:22.020> just<00:05:22.050> tunnel<00:05:22.590> vision

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
think about it I'll just tunnel vision

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.100 
think about it I'll just tunnel vision
on<00:05:22.919> a<00:05:22.949> guy<00:05:23.159> and<00:05:23.460> I'll<00:05:23.940> get<00:05:24.060> shot<00:05:24.300> from<00:05:24.960> the

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
on a guy and I'll get shot from the

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.719 
on a guy and I'll get shot from the
right<00:05:25.289> and<00:05:25.500> I'll<00:05:25.620> be<00:05:25.650> like<00:05:25.979> where<00:05:26.280> was<00:05:26.699> that

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
right and I'll be like where was that

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.670 
right and I'll be like where was that
guy<00:05:27.300> and<00:05:27.569> I'll<00:05:27.659> look<00:05:27.870> in<00:05:28.080> it<00:05:28.199> just<00:05:28.470> I'm

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
guy and I'll look in it just I'm

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.920 
guy and I'll look in it just I'm
completely<00:05:29.550> out<00:05:29.699> in<00:05:29.909> the<00:05:30.030> open<00:05:30.330> completely

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
completely out in the open completely

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.570 
completely out in the open completely
exposed<00:05:31.530> and<00:05:31.830> then<00:05:31.919> I<00:05:31.949> just<00:05:32.159> kind<00:05:32.340> of<00:05:32.370> feel

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
exposed and then I just kind of feel

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.149 
exposed and then I just kind of feel
like<00:05:32.789> an<00:05:33.360> idiot<00:05:33.509> and<00:05:33.900> as<00:05:34.020> I<00:05:34.229> said<00:05:34.289> this<00:05:34.949> isn't

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
like an idiot and as I said this isn't

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:36.680 
like an idiot and as I said this isn't
something<00:05:35.490> that<00:05:35.669> just<00:05:35.820> kind<00:05:36.090> of<00:05:36.180> comes<00:05:36.449> by

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
something that just kind of comes by

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.210 
something that just kind of comes by
nature<00:05:37.050> this<00:05:37.229> is<00:05:37.289> the<00:05:37.500> kind<00:05:37.710> of<00:05:37.770> thing<00:05:37.979> that

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
nature this is the kind of thing that

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.219 
nature this is the kind of thing that
you<00:05:38.550> need<00:05:38.699> to<00:05:38.729> constantly<00:05:39.240> remind<00:05:39.780> yourself

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
a game where you can just run and gun

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.080

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.659 
chances are you aren't gonna do very
well<00:06:09.690> and<00:06:09.960> maybe<00:06:10.169> you'll<00:06:10.740> get<00:06:10.889> super<00:06:11.310> lucky

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669

streak<00:06:13.949> but<00:06:14.099> that<00:06:14.280> is<00:06:14.430> not<00:06:14.699> something<00:06:15.570> that

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659 
streak but that is not something that

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.450 
streak but that is not something that
happens<00:06:16.020> a<00:06:16.139> lot<00:06:16.169> of<00:06:16.349> the<00:06:16.380> time<00:06:16.650> and<00:06:16.889> to<00:06:16.919> really
