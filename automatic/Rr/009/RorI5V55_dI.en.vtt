to<00:01:07.229> see<00:01:07.350> at<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.619> well<00:01:08.250> at<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> price<00:01:08.880> point<00:01:08.909> I

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
to see at that well at the price point I

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.730 
to see at that well at the price point I
think<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.540> get<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> lot<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.900> performance<00:01:10.470> I

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
think you get a lot of performance I

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.530 
think you get a lot of performance I
think<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.159> about<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.580> two<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> half<00:01:12.180> mark

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
think it's about the two and a half mark

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.649 
think it's about the two and a half mark
maybe<00:01:12.750> 250<00:01:13.140> area<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.000> you've<00:01:15.000> got<00:01:15.119> 2.4

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659

corner you're like no way I got upgrade
the<00:02:41.460> servo<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.790> can't<00:02:42.090> even<00:02:42.180> turn<00:02:42.530> um<00:02:43.530> but<00:02:44.400> the

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
the servo I can't even turn um but the

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.400 
the servo I can't even turn um but the
but<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:44.940> would<00:02:45.150> probably<00:02:45.630> go<00:02:46.020> with<00:02:46.110> like<00:02:46.350> a

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
but I would probably go with like a

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.890 
but I would probably go with like a
little<00:02:46.650> bit<00:02:46.770> better<00:02:46.890> tires<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:48.660> don't<00:02:48.840> know

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
little bit better tires and I don't know

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.170 
little bit better tires and I don't know
other<00:02:49.260> than<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.730> waterproofing<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.940> think

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
other than that waterproofing I think

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.210 
other than that waterproofing I think
the<00:02:51.270> ESC<00:02:51.600> is<00:02:51.660> also<00:02:51.960> waterproof<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.650> like<00:02:53.010> are

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
the ESC is also waterproof to like are

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.150 
the ESC is also waterproof to like are
resistant<00:02:54.060> yeah<00:02:54.390> sorry<00:02:54.990> this<00:02:55.710> is<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.010> one

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
resistant yeah sorry this is the one

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.550
