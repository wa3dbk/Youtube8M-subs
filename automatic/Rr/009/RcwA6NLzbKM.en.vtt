next<00:02:52.609> step<00:02:52.819> here<00:02:53.120> is<00:02:53.180> in<00:02:53.659> order<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:53.989> be<00:02:54.109> able<00:02:54.200> to

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
next step here is in order to be able to

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.459 
next step here is in order to be able to
work<00:02:54.530> with<00:02:54.769> this<00:02:54.950> text<00:02:56.230> you'll<00:02:57.230> note<00:02:57.439> that

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:57.469 
work with this text you'll note that

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.580 
work with this text you'll note that
there's<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.889> blue<00:02:58.340> border<00:02:58.579> around<00:02:59.230> our<00:03:00.230> text

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
there's a blue border around our text

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.129 
there's a blue border around our text
object<00:03:00.950> means<00:03:01.519> it's<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:02.000> currently<00:03:02.599> assemble

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:03.139 
object means it's a currently assemble

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.589 
object means it's a currently assemble
and<00:03:03.730> we<00:03:04.730> won't<00:03:04.909> be<00:03:05.030> able<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.239> work<00:03:05.389> with<00:03:05.569> that

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
and we won't be able to work with that

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.059 
and we won't be able to work with that
so<00:03:06.019> we're<00:03:06.199> going<00:03:06.319> to<00:03:06.409> have<00:03:06.500> to<00:03:06.560> break<00:03:06.739> it<00:03:06.919> down

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
so we're going to have to break it down

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.670 
so we're going to have to break it down
into<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:07.400> vector<00:03:07.639> graphic<00:03:08.269> in<00:03:09.199> order<00:03:09.439> to<00:03:09.530> do

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
into a vector graphic in order to do

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.280 
into a vector graphic in order to do
this<00:03:09.859> we<00:03:09.919> can<00:03:10.069> use<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.519> control<00:03:11.120> be<00:03:11.659> key

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
this we can use the control be key

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.170 
this we can use the control be key
combination<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.219> we'd<00:03:13.609> have<00:03:13.639> to<00:03:13.879> do<00:03:13.969> that

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
combination and we'd have to do that

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.689 
combination and we'd have to do that
twice<00:03:14.540> or<00:03:14.840> from<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.349> menu<00:03:15.530> select<00:03:16.219> modify

break<00:03:17.659> apart<00:03:17.989> and<00:03:18.199> once<00:03:18.859> again<00:03:19.010> modify<00:03:19.879> break

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
break apart and once again modify break

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.250 
break apart and once again modify break
apart<00:03:20.650> now<00:03:21.650> we<00:03:21.709> have<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:22.239> now<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:23.959> next<00:03:24.109> step

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
apart now we have it now the next step

there we have it this is a preview of

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:30.189 
there we have it this is a preview of
our<00:04:28.219> gradient<00:04:28.690> to<00:04:29.690> apply<00:04:29.870> it<00:04:29.930> to<00:04:30.110> the

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
our gradient to apply it to the

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.170 
our gradient to apply it to the
lettering<00:04:30.530> if<00:04:30.860> I<00:04:31.039> simply<00:04:31.370> click<00:04:31.610> once<00:04:31.909> in<00:04:32.120> a

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
lettering if I simply click once in a

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.230 
lettering if I simply click once in a
letter<00:04:32.389> the<00:04:33.110> gradient<00:04:33.500> applies<00:04:33.740> itself<00:04:34.240> okay

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
letter the gradient applies itself okay

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.620 
letter the gradient applies itself okay
but<00:04:35.690> vertically<00:04:36.669> if<00:04:37.669> I<00:04:37.849> want<00:04:38.029> to<00:04:38.120> change<00:04:38.180> the

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
but vertically if I want to change the

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
but vertically if I want to change the
direction<00:04:38.960> of<00:04:39.349> the

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
direction of the

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.129 
direction of the
gradient<00:04:40.070> I<00:04:40.220> simply<00:04:40.940> have<00:04:41.060> to<00:04:41.210> hold<00:04:41.389> down<00:04:41.570> the

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
gradient I simply have to hold down the

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.340 
gradient I simply have to hold down the
shift<00:04:42.169> key<00:04:42.620> on<00:04:42.860> my<00:04:43.009> keyboard<00:04:43.220> and<00:04:44.050> hold<00:04:45.050> down

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
the left mouse button on my mouse and

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.510 
the left mouse button on my mouse and
slide<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.680> bucket<00:04:48.860> tool<00:04:50.650> upwards<00:04:51.650> in<00:04:51.949> a

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
slide the bucket tool upwards in a

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.360 
slide the bucket tool upwards in a
letter<00:04:52.759> I<00:04:53.410> repeat<00:04:54.410> that<00:04:54.440> for<00:04:54.889> each<00:04:55.039> of<00:04:55.280> the

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
letter I repeat that for each of the

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:05.890 
letter I repeat that for each of the
letters<00:04:56.229> and<00:05:00.610> there's<00:05:01.610> our<00:05:01.820> effect<00:05:03.220> okay<00:05:04.900> you

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
letters and there's our effect okay you

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.460 
letters and there's our effect okay you
can<00:05:06.080> adjust<00:05:06.169> the<00:05:06.699> amount<00:05:07.699> of<00:05:07.970> grey<00:05:08.240> by<00:05:08.479> varying

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
can adjust the amount of grey by varying

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:18.240 
can adjust the amount of grey by varying
where<00:05:10.250> you're<00:05:10.400> clicking<00:05:10.639> inside<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:11.360> letter

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.750 

now<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.639> next<00:05:19.669> step<00:05:19.940> here<00:05:20.360> is<00:05:20.479> to<00:05:21.400> achieve<00:05:22.400> the

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
now the next step here is to achieve the

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.340 
now the next step here is to achieve the
reflected<00:05:23.270> text<00:05:23.600> effect<00:05:23.900> we're<00:05:24.080> going<00:05:24.260> to

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
reflected text effect we're going to

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.700 
reflected text effect we're going to
have<00:05:24.440> to<00:05:24.680> copy<00:05:25.840> the<00:05:26.840> existing<00:05:27.260> text<00:05:27.500> that

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
have to copy the existing text that

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.650 
have to copy the existing text that
we've<00:05:27.830> just<00:05:28.100> created<00:05:28.280> but<00:05:29.060> before<00:05:29.330> we<00:05:29.449> do<00:05:29.630> that

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
we've just created but before we do that

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.990 
we've just created but before we do that
we're<00:05:29.960> going<00:05:30.050> to<00:05:30.110> have<00:05:30.229> to<00:05:30.289> create<00:05:30.500> a<00:05:31.000> blank

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
we're going to have to create a blank

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.450 
we're going to have to create a blank
layer<00:05:32.300> or<00:05:32.599> a<00:05:32.660> new<00:05:32.870> layer<00:05:33.080> so<00:05:33.919> from<00:05:34.130> the<00:05:34.220> tools

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.860 
layer or a new layer so from the tools
menu<00:05:34.610> we're<00:05:35.000> going<00:05:35.120> to<00:05:35.180> select<00:05:35.300> selection
