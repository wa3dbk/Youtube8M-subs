00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.980
 German rink rode the magicians 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.090
 the ball 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.160
 I certainly did not expect such a shock, but I think 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.620
 what was it yesterday 100 historical match 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.839
 this probably already going to tell 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.820
 my grandchildren when I'm gray-haired old man 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.980
 as much as this one 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.710
 the first goal and was confused that even 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.900
 it is not clear whether the goalkeeper is worth everything 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.930
 were drop-downs anywhere were missing 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.519
 on the field, all share of thoughts is absolutely not about 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.000
 tom and teams what was not 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.750
 similar very unexpectedly became especially with 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.680
 19 to 25 minutes so play there three goals 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.770
 in a row then or four then in shock were 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:49.370
 no one expected but you were glad 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:52.559
 because the Germans were sick of the unexpected 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.730
 Denmark fireworks on unexpectedly I, too, already on 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.010
 30 it took us 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.290
 thank you so tuned for this evening 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.320
 thought the whole power unit 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.449
 but something to say is all about the word case 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.780
 slide down to the side and feel sorry in the section 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.660
 but the Germans are great too but you are not married either 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.080
 Well, it just amazes me how really 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.700
 would two players decide the course of the whole team then 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.930
 Well, what kind of team is that 2 players? 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.890
 and they of course well done starvation goal 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.670
 Grand Princess 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.100
 in the general championship such teams 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.100
 lose who should not lose 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.100
 German 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:40.110
 we rooted for brazil and at the very beginning it 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:46.330
 it was something I probably would not have 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:48.750
 the channel has reached comrades such that it is not 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.820
 that ebook juices 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.760
 well I was late I turned on the match late 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.920
 when he left and I was shocked but who 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.940
 loves in the world expected here you saw a lioness 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.940
 Brazilians people are depressed who are dejected 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.390
 cried that but germany stis rejoice 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.490
 not even true what can we be 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.920
 all consider our Brazil country taste 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.400
 hunger from learn or what's to agree 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.970
 pigtail teams took lexie and it would not 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.860
 treat like a gorgeous machine game 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.630
 scary for the dutch or zagron sensa in 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.840
 the future 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.610
 not that there is just Germany much 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.040
 stronger asked just like that somehow 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.530
 so coincidence was beaten there 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.720
 second goal Brazilians a little bit on purpose but 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.480
 and just at this time for riveting three more 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.370
 Well, there already is how to do so very quickly 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.300
 all very unexpected self-conceit 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.300
 always relaxing 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.650
 advertising was such that we 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.650
 and we will 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.650
 Champions 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.770
 means and 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.430
 Brazil lost on business played poorly 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.650
 shocked 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.990
 the problem is I'm late for the first 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.750
 20 minutes for the first 20 minutes, just the same 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.860
 scored four years in general miss 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.470
 The most interesting 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.170
 but I was shocked and to be honest here but 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.940
 basically played great run 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.460
 really hit ran brazil 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.540
 it would seem years oh how not to eat boar 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.540
 teams .
