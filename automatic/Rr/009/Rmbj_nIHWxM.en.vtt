foot actually sits in the sole not on
top<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.710> what<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.039> does<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.579> gives

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
top of it so what that does is it gives

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.420 
top of it so what that does is it gives
us<00:00:53.969> our<00:00:54.180> ankle<00:00:54.539> roll<00:00:54.750> stop<00:00:55.050> capability<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.280> as

us our ankle roll stop capability so as

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.310 
us our ankle roll stop capability so as
you<00:00:56.550> look<00:00:56.730> at<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.000> boot<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.809> twist<00:00:58.140> it

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you look at the boot and you twist it

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.770 
you look at the boot and you twist it
there<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.070> no<00:00:59.280> twist<00:00:59.340> so<00:01:00.000> with<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> boot<00:01:00.539> that

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
there is no twist so with the boot that

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.720 
there is no twist so with the boot that
has<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.230> heel<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.770> which<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.280> does<00:01:02.520> not

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
has a heel on it which this does not

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.240 
has a heel on it which this does not
it's<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.539> very<00:01:03.750> ergonomic<00:01:04.439> boot<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> boot

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
it's a very ergonomic boot but a boot

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.520 
it's a very ergonomic boot but a boot
with<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.430> heel<00:01:05.760> has<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.720> tendency<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.470> snap

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
with the heel has a tendency to snap

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.050 
with the heel has a tendency to snap
whether<00:01:08.100> you're<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.700> mountainside

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
whether you're in a mountainside

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.450 
whether you're in a mountainside
stepping<00:01:09.990> off<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> curb<00:01:10.470> or<00:01:10.979> anything<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.430> that

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
stepping off a curb or anything of that

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.230 
stepping off a curb or anything of that
nature<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.659> particular<00:01:13.020> sole<00:01:14.240> doesn't

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
nature so this particular sole doesn't

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.030 
nature so this particular sole doesn't
allow<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.689> do<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.290> stops<00:01:16.560> ankle

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
allow you to do that so it stops ankle

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.010 
allow you to do that so it stops ankle
roll<00:01:17.250> which<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.970> one<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.420> largest

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
roll which is one of the largest

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.560 
roll which is one of the largest
casualty-producing<00:01:20.030> injuries<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> army

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
casualty-producing injuries in the army

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.830 
casualty-producing injuries in the army
and<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.500> other<00:01:22.619> forces<00:01:23.009> as<00:01:23.310> well<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.840> exceeds

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
and the other forces as well it exceeds

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.749 
and the other forces as well it exceeds
the<00:01:24.990> military<00:01:25.409> standard<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:25.979> slip<00:01:26.250> resistance

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
the military standard on slip resistance

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.670 
the military standard on slip resistance
so<00:01:26.939> if<00:01:27.060> you're<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> room<00:01:27.509> clearing<00:01:28.140> scenario

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
so if you're in a room clearing scenario

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.289 
so if you're in a room clearing scenario
or<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.979> hangar<00:01:29.310> scenario<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.000> excellent

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
or in a hangar scenario it's excellent

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.899 
or in a hangar scenario it's excellent
in<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.600> regard<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.740> glued<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.579> sewed

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
in that regard it's a glued on and sewed

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.330 
in that regard it's a glued on and sewed
on<00:01:33.090> bottom<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.020> won't<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:34.409> separation<00:01:34.979> at

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
on bottom so you won't get separation at

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.120 
on bottom so you won't get separation at
the<00:01:35.460> front<00:01:35.759> or<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.450> back<00:01:36.619> it's<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:37.950> very

the front or the back it's it's very

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.609 
the front or the back it's it's very
good<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.570> regard<00:01:39.750> it's<00:01:40.409> got

good in that in that regard it's got

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.499 
good in that in that regard it's got
bumpers<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.340> toe<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.180> you're<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.420> a

proof<00:02:30.640> what<00:02:31.640> we<00:02:31.730> did<00:02:31.940> we<00:02:32.510> designed<00:02:33.050> that<00:02:33.170> to

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
proof what we did we designed that to

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.400 
proof what we did we designed that to
put<00:02:33.710> it<00:02:33.740> in<00:02:33.890> there<00:02:34.100> for<00:02:34.130> fast<00:02:34.610> roping<00:02:35.090> and

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
put it in there for fast roping and

so it's an outstanding feature in that

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.730 
so it's an outstanding feature in that
regard<00:02:46.520> it's<00:02:47.030> speed<00:02:47.420> laced<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:48.320> you<00:02:48.410> pull<00:02:48.650> it

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
regard it's speed laced so you pull it

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.530 
regard it's speed laced so you pull it
on<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:49.040> pull<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.340> right<00:02:49.490> here<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:49.940> at<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.510> top

can swell and the boot accommodates at
it<00:03:07.610> fits<00:03:08.000> true<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.270> size<00:03:08.570> so<00:03:09.350> if<00:03:09.470> your<00:03:09.620> size<00:03:09.890> 7

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
it fits true to size so if your size 7

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.700 
it fits true to size so if your size 7
you<00:03:10.640> wear<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.820> 7<00:03:11.150> if<00:03:11.390> you're<00:03:11.570> 11<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.080> wear<00:03:12.230> an<00:03:12.350> 11

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
padded with dry Lexx on the inside so

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.640
