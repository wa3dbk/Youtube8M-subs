part of the school you actually kind of
make<00:00:33.090> your<00:00:33.239> own<00:00:33.390> program<00:00:33.809> there's<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.380> like

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
make your own program there's just like

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.040 
make your own program there's just like
a<00:00:34.530> really<00:00:34.800> strong<00:00:35.190> network<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.910> people<00:00:36.180> that's

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
a really strong network of people that's

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.319 
a really strong network of people that's
like<00:00:37.260> huge<00:00:37.530> for<00:00:38.040> being<00:00:38.460> an<00:00:38.550> artist<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:39.030> another

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
like huge for being an artist is another

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.590 
like huge for being an artist is another
network<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:40.520> think<00:00:41.520> people<00:00:41.820> who<00:00:42.239> live<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
network I think people who live the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.830 
network I think people who live the
program<00:00:43.100> begin<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.370> expect<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.239> certain<00:00:45.600> type

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
program begin to expect a certain type

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.049 
program begin to expect a certain type
of<00:00:46.050> person<00:00:46.739> that's<00:00:46.890> coming<00:00:47.160> from<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.640> school

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
of person that's coming from that school

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.080 
of person that's coming from that school
in<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.270> way<00:00:48.390> that's<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:48.870> like<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.680> been

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
in a way that's just like it's been

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.029 
in a way that's just like it's been
challenged<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.239> lot<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:51.840> hopefully<00:00:52.050> you

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
challenged a lot and it's hopefully you

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.560 
challenged a lot and it's hopefully you
know<00:00:53.160> been<00:00:53.309> thinking<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.760> lot<00:00:53.789> about<00:00:54.030> what<00:00:54.270> they

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
know been thinking a lot about what they

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.290 
know been thinking a lot about what they
do<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.140> why<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.920> think<00:00:56.370> that's<00:00:56.640> why<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.910> wanted

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
do and why I think that's why I wanted

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.670 
do and why I think that's why I wanted
to<00:00:57.420> come<00:00:57.600> here<00:00:57.780> because<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.260> there's

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
to come here because that there's

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.240 
to come here because that there's
definitely<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.489> push<00:00:59.850> their<00:01:00.180> ideas<00:01:01.250> okay

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
definitely that push their ideas okay

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.889 
definitely that push their ideas okay
now<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.489> know<00:01:02.850> how<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.120> make<00:01:03.359> something<00:01:03.780> but

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
now you know how to make something but

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.050 
now you know how to make something but
why<00:01:04.080> are<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.379> making<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.920> definitely<00:01:05.790> just

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
why are you making it definitely just

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.690 
why are you making it definitely just
like<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.360> time<00:01:06.659> being<00:01:06.930> around<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.619> bunch<00:01:08.280> of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
like the time being around a bunch of

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.929 
like the time being around a bunch of
other<00:01:08.939> people<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.950> are<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.010> as<00:01:11.490> driven<00:01:11.760> as

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
other people that are just as driven as

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.179 
other people that are just as driven as
creative<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:13.350> being<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.799> environment

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
creative just being in that environment

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.050 
creative just being in that environment
is<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:15.240> really<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:16.020> think<00:01:16.229> unique<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.979> special

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.730 

diversity<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.420> social<00:01:21.810> practice<00:01:22.229> program

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
diversity of the social practice program

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.100 
diversity of the social practice program
has<00:01:23.010> been<00:01:23.369> really<00:01:23.670> really<00:01:24.030> productive<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:24.780> me

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
has been really really productive for me

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.070 
has been really really productive for me
because<00:01:25.619> I'm<00:01:26.520> not<00:01:26.850> necessarily<00:01:27.080> entrenched

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
because I'm not necessarily entrenched

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.550 
because I'm not necessarily entrenched
in<00:01:28.229> one<00:01:28.409> particular<00:01:28.740> way<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.700> approaching

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
in one particular way of approaching

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.560 
in one particular way of approaching
working<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:31.710> people<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.369> don't<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.360> make

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
working with people I don't just make

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.050 
working with people I don't just make
sculpture<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.409> don't<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.830> do<00:01:35.070> generosity

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
sculpture I don't just do generosity

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.790 
sculpture I don't just do generosity
projects<00:01:36.540> they<00:01:36.690> don't<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:37.050> do<00:01:37.170> intervention

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
projects they don't just do intervention

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.920 
projects they don't just do intervention
I<00:01:37.979> think<00:01:38.460> sort<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.000> jump<00:01:39.330> in<00:01:39.450> between<00:01:39.750> all

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
I think sort of jump in between all

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.170 
I think sort of jump in between all
those<00:01:40.140> different<00:01:40.500> spaces<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.759> being<00:01:42.090> able

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
those different spaces and so being able

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.840 
those different spaces and so being able
to<00:01:42.300> have<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> peer<00:01:42.780> group<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.740> also<00:01:43.950> inhabits

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
to have a peer group that also inhabits

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.880 
to have a peer group that also inhabits
different<00:01:45.240> kinds<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.540> ways<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:46.140> making<00:01:46.200> and

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
different kinds of ways of making and

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.700 
different kinds of ways of making and
working<00:01:47.790> with<00:01:47.970> people<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.750> public<00:01:49.050> space<00:01:49.440> and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
working with people and public space and

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.710 
working with people and public space and
social<00:01:50.100> space<00:01:50.190> has<00:01:51.149> been<00:01:51.330> really<00:01:51.539> great

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
social space has been really great

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.210 
social space has been really great
because<00:01:51.750> there's<00:01:52.200> different<00:01:52.920> things<00:01:53.039> that

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
because there's different things that

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.859 
because there's different things that
all<00:01:53.429> all<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.030> other<00:01:54.149> students<00:01:54.479> bring<00:01:54.690> to<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
all all the other students bring to the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.440 
all all the other students bring to the
table<00:01:55.050> so<00:01:55.440> it's<00:01:55.860> really<00:01:56.100> easy<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.759> build<00:01:57.300> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
table so it's really easy to build a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.270 
table so it's really easy to build a
community<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.899> people<00:01:58.259> here<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.830> have

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
community of people here that have

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.650 
community of people here that have
totally<00:01:59.520> different<00:01:59.789> perspectives<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
totally different perspectives and

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.779 
totally different perspectives and
objectives<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.410> have<00:02:01.530> really<00:02:01.789> intense

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
objectives and have really intense

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:10.820 
objectives and have really intense
conversations<00:02:03.479> but<00:02:03.750> every<00:02:04.110> time<00:02:04.289> I<00:02:09.619> come<00:02:10.619> in

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
conversations but every time I come in

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.979 
conversations but every time I come in
not<00:02:11.550> thinking<00:02:11.850> I<00:02:11.910> want<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.120> find<00:02:12.330> myself<00:02:12.510> I

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
not thinking I want to find myself I

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.780 
not thinking I want to find myself I
came<00:02:13.320> in<00:02:13.739> thinking<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.459> something<00:02:14.640> I

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
came in thinking this is something I

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.949 
came in thinking this is something I
want<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.000> do<00:02:15.060> as<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.209> career<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:15.750> want<00:02:15.900> to

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
want to do as a career and I want to

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.960 
want to do as a career and I want to
figure<00:02:16.110> out<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.380> tools<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:16.769> need<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:17.580> order<00:02:17.670> to

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
figure out the tools I need in order to

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.120 
figure out the tools I need in order to
make<00:02:18.300> that<00:02:18.390> career<00:02:18.630> possible<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.290> also<00:02:19.739> really

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
make that career possible I also really

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.920 
make that career possible I also really
important<00:02:20.519> faculty<00:02:21.030> they<00:02:21.600> have<00:02:21.750> good

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
important faculty they have good

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.479 
important faculty they have good
connections<00:02:22.470> but<00:02:22.739> I<00:02:22.800> think<00:02:23.040> it's<00:02:23.160> because

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
connections but I think it's because
