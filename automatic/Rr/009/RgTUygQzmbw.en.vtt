straps<00:02:11.370> are<00:02:11.489> really<00:02:11.550> stiff

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
keep the piping clean as much as

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.550

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.820 
possible
I<00:02:49.880> bought<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:50.910> leather<00:02:51.209> conditioner<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:52.650> get

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
I bought a leather conditioner and I get

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.670 
I bought a leather conditioner and I get
some<00:02:53.040> cotton<00:02:53.280> wool<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:53.880> just<00:02:54.120> wiped<00:02:54.390> them

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
some cotton wool and I just wiped them

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.830 
some cotton wool and I just wiped them
just<00:02:55.680> once<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.310> month<00:02:56.340> or<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:57.630> really

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
just once a month or so and that really

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.810 
just once a month or so and that really
helps<00:02:58.230> protect<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.860> keep<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.250> clean<00:02:59.489> because

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
helps protect and keep it clean because

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.630 
helps protect and keep it clean because
they<00:02:59.940> do<00:03:00.000> get<00:03:00.660> dirty<00:03:00.930> after<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> while<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.550> I

think that same with the piping on the

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.449
