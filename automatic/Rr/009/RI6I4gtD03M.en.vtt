00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.660
 yes, here I can sleep 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:09.980
 because you wake up and think at the moment 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:15.379
 Actually, what does one do? 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.970
 actually with beans everyone say like 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.509
 they look like they are already 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.539
 full 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:22.160
 yes , it was doing well now 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.480
 of course say oh what do you want 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.130
 with so much to say but the jokes ripped 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.249
 many do not even know you thought about it 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.160
 I'm really great here always 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:36.590
 to ripen in there is 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:44.930
 slight layer of forehead big robe 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:48.410
 on just makes so then slightly 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.210
 look so you see they are not yet 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.760
 done that need a little bit of 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.660
 but if they are afterwards 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.460
 so are beginning to rustling then they are 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.260
 finished and then the whole thing looks like that 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.690
 out 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.400
 so and now tell you they are out 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:10.070
 how widespread is the joke 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.600
 or ground many know yes 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.400
 do not think the white beans are 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.880
 Private very special and one 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.240
 special kind are break ground at jack 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.600
 shear normal bar beans or even 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.820
 bush beans and those are but then from 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.540

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.800

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.210

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.370
