basically<00:00:09.559> there's<00:00:09.740> not<00:00:10.040> a<00:00:10.070> lot<00:00:10.460> of

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
basically there's not a lot of

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.420 
basically there's not a lot of
difference<00:00:11.059> I<00:00:11.540> usually<00:00:12.530> end<00:00:12.769> up<00:00:12.980> doing<00:00:13.340> a

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
difference I usually end up doing a

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.520 
difference I usually end up doing a
little<00:00:13.639> bit<00:00:13.849> less<00:00:14.059> trailer<00:00:14.480> a<00:00:14.690> favor<00:00:15.230> wait

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
little bit less trailer a favor wait

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.590 
little bit less trailer a favor wait
that<00:00:15.770> sort<00:00:16.070> of<00:00:16.100> thing<00:00:16.189> but<00:00:16.880> that<00:00:17.180> could<00:00:17.420> go<00:00:17.539> to

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
that sort of thing but that could go to

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.700 
that sort of thing but that could go to
Iraq<00:00:17.930> is<00:00:18.050> I'm<00:00:18.170> smaller<00:00:19.869> I<00:00:20.869> don't<00:00:21.230> sweat<00:00:21.470> to<00:00:21.680> a

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
Iraq is I'm smaller I don't sweat to a

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.960 
Iraq is I'm smaller I don't sweat to a
box<00:00:22.039> as<00:00:22.310> much<00:00:22.580> I<00:00:23.710> would<00:00:24.710> you<00:00:24.860> know<00:00:24.970> two

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
box as much I would you know two

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.550 
box as much I would you know two
different<00:00:26.330> accessories<00:00:26.750> but<00:00:27.170> then<00:00:27.350> it's

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
different accessories but then it's

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.050 
different accessories but then it's
always<00:00:27.890> going<00:00:28.160> to<00:00:28.220> be<00:00:28.280> an<00:00:28.400> individual<00:00:28.880> thing

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
always going to be an individual thing

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.390 
always going to be an individual thing
no<00:00:29.240> matter<00:00:29.360> what<00:00:29.720> so<00:00:30.110> I<00:00:30.440> just<00:00:30.770> working<00:00:31.250> my

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
no matter what so I just working my

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.679 
no matter what so I just working my
weaknesses<00:00:31.940> which<00:00:32.210> are<00:00:32.360> going<00:00:32.480> to<00:00:32.539> be<00:00:32.660> a

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
weaknesses which are going to be a

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:33.939 
weaknesses which are going to be a
little<00:00:33.050> bit<00:00:33.260> different<00:00:33.620> than<00:00:33.739> somebody

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:33.949 
little bit different than somebody

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:40.580 
little bit different than somebody
that's<00:00:34.250> in<00:00:34.370> here

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.890 

I<00:00:40.680> would<00:00:41.460> say<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.760> more<00:00:41.850> important<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
I would say it's more important the

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.990 
I would say it's more important the
lighter<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.470> are<00:00:43.680> if<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.520> see<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> lot<00:00:44.970> of

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
lighter you are if you see a lot of

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.690 
lighter you are if you see a lot of
little<00:00:45.240> lighter<00:00:45.630> lighter<00:00:46.470> being<00:00:46.830> like<00:00:47.100> 220<00:00:47.610> in

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
little lighter lighter being like 220 in

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.450 
little lighter lighter being like 220 in
lighter<00:00:47.940> bench<00:00:48.750> guys<00:00:48.989> top<00:00:49.560> most<00:00:50.040> of<00:00:50.220> them<00:00:50.309> have

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
lighter bench guys top most of them have

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.030 
lighter bench guys top most of them have
a<00:00:50.489> pretty<00:00:50.820> big<00:00:51.000> arch<00:00:51.239> as<00:00:51.570> guys<00:00:52.350> get<00:00:52.650> heavier

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
a pretty big arch as guys get heavier

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.799 
a pretty big arch as guys get heavier
you<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.520> more<00:00:53.730> natural<00:00:54.180> thickness<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
you have more natural thickness and the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.950 
you have more natural thickness and the
arch<00:00:55.020> isn't<00:00:55.410> quite<00:00:55.680> as<00:00:55.920> critical<00:00:56.489> um<00:00:56.809> but<00:00:57.809> it's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
arch isn't quite as critical um but it's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.360 
arch isn't quite as critical um but it's
definitely<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.530> huge<00:00:58.800> advantage<00:00:59.070> because

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
definitely it's a huge advantage because

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.280 
definitely it's a huge advantage because
it<00:00:59.550> reduces<00:00:59.670> your<00:01:00.059> range<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.390> motion

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.550 

one<00:01:06.290> way<00:01:06.470> is<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:07.340> simple<00:01:07.760> PVC<00:01:07.970> pipe<00:01:08.570> so<00:01:09.410> what

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
one way is the simple PVC pipe so what

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.350 
one way is the simple PVC pipe so what
you<00:01:09.650> want<00:01:09.860> to<00:01:09.920> do<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.550> match<00:01:10.790> start<00:01:11.240> the

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
you want to do the match start the

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.970 
you want to do the match start the
smaller<00:01:11.720> plate<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:12.740> means<00:01:13.040> set<00:01:13.400> up

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.810 

you<00:01:17.520> are<00:01:17.670> practice<00:01:18.210> arching<00:01:18.690> over<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.020> fight

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
you are practice arching over the fight

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.070 
you are practice arching over the fight
and<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.940> want<00:01:21.120> to<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.300> so<00:01:21.480> you<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.600> hold<00:01:21.900> your

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
and you want to get so you can hold your

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.560 
and you want to get so you can hold your
arch<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:23.220> then<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.670> someone<00:01:23.940> pull<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> pipe

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
arch and then have someone pull the pipe

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.910 
arch and then have someone pull the pipe
out<00:01:25.430> and<00:01:26.570> now<00:01:27.570> how<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.680> think<00:01:28.800> a

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
out and now how this is I think a

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.830 
out and now how this is I think a
four-inch<00:01:29.280> pipe<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:30.150> might<00:01:30.330> want<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> start

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
four-inch pipe you might want to start

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.530 
four-inch pipe you might want to start
with<00:01:30.930> 2<00:01:31.230> inch<00:01:31.410> or<00:01:31.620> whatever<00:01:32.420> what<00:01:33.420> I've

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
with 2 inch or whatever what I've

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.800 
with 2 inch or whatever what I've
noticed<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:34.220> tight<00:01:35.220> hip<00:01:35.460> flexors<00:01:35.660> make<00:01:36.660> it

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
noticed is tight hip flexors make it

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.410 
noticed is tight hip flexors make it
like<00:01:37.020> hard<00:01:37.230> to<00:01:37.320> arch<00:01:37.880> good<00:01:38.880> way<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.090> stretch

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
like hard to arch good way to stretch

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.230 
like hard to arch good way to stretch
those<00:01:39.690> or<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.380> lean<00:01:40.620> in<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.520> lean<00:01:42.000> back

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
those or just lean in and lean back

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.780 
those or just lean in and lean back
because<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.440> watch<00:01:43.620> anyone<00:01:44.190> that<00:01:44.370> arch<00:01:44.580> as

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
because if you watch anyone that arch as

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.920 
because if you watch anyone that arch as
well<00:01:45.440> whether<00:01:46.440> feet<00:01:46.890> are<00:01:47.010> out<00:01:47.100> front<00:01:47.400> and<00:01:47.550> back

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
well whether feet are out front and back

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.100 
well whether feet are out front and back
they<00:01:48.930> really<00:01:49.230> get<00:01:49.410> their<00:01:49.650> leg<00:01:50.190> angle<00:01:50.610> down

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
they really get their leg angle down

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.750 
they really get their leg angle down
their<00:01:52.110> legs<00:01:52.410> their<00:01:52.980> knees<00:01:53.220> plan<00:01:53.490> will

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
their legs their knees plan will

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.180 
their legs their knees plan will
straight<00:01:54.180> down<00:01:54.450> that's<00:01:55.110> impossible<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.950> do

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
straight down that's impossible to do

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.820 
straight down that's impossible to do
who<00:01:56.490> type<00:01:56.820> hip<00:01:57.030> flexors<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.380> other<00:01:58.530> key

you just want to work on a lot of things

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.270 
you just want to work on a lot of things
to<00:02:03.030> stretch<00:02:03.480> your<00:02:03.660> fund<00:02:03.960> out<00:02:04.140> your<00:02:04.320> pack<00:02:04.650> so

just spam the funds that that's no good
what<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.860> lot<00:02:49.040> of<00:02:49.070> people<00:02:49.190> do<00:02:49.870> especially

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
what a lot of people do especially

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.780 
what a lot of people do especially

cheat and they kind of like rock forward

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.070 
cheat and they kind of like rock forward
really<00:02:55.280> bad<00:02:55.580> so<00:02:56.240> you<00:02:56.330> can<00:02:56.450> get<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.690> lead<00:02:56.840> into

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
really bad so you can get the lead into

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.020 
really bad so you can get the lead into
their<00:02:57.230> quads<00:02:57.530> and<00:02:58.310> we<00:02:58.400> have<00:02:58.550> to<00:02:58.730> watch<00:02:59.000> for

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
their quads and we have to watch for

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.600 
their quads and we have to watch for
their<00:02:59.630> is<00:02:59.840> they'll<00:03:00.410> get<00:03:00.620> going<00:03:00.920> forward<00:03:01.460> and

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
their is they'll get going forward and

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.370 
their is they'll get going forward and
the<00:03:02.000> dunk<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:02.480> blow<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.870> bottom<00:03:03.140> of<00:03:03.260> their

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
the dunk and blow the bottom of their

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.830 
the dunk and blow the bottom of their
hat<00:03:03.590> another<00:03:04.550> thing<00:03:04.820> to<00:03:04.910> watch<00:03:05.090> for<00:03:05.120> is<00:03:05.630> when

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
hat another thing to watch for is when

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.990 
hat another thing to watch for is when
your<00:03:05.990> squatty<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.980> bar<00:03:07.220> rolling<00:03:07.700> down<00:03:07.850> the

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
your squatty the bar rolling down the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.580 
your squatty the bar rolling down the
person's<00:03:08.420> back<00:03:08.690> they<00:03:09.020> don't<00:03:09.170> have<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.410> bar

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
person's back they don't have the bar

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.010 
person's back they don't have the bar
set<00:03:09.920> right<00:03:10.160> well<00:03:10.400> that's<00:03:11.090> really<00:03:11.780> dangerous

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
set right well that's really dangerous

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.990 
set right well that's really dangerous
for<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.560> back<00:03:12.770> spotter<00:03:13.220> I<00:03:13.520> think<00:03:13.760> those<00:03:13.970> are

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
for the back spotter I think those are

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.710 
for the back spotter I think those are
the<00:03:14.350> big<00:03:15.350> issues<00:03:15.410> with<00:03:16.210> wanting<00:03:17.210> and<00:03:17.390> what<00:03:17.600> to

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
the big issues with wanting and what to

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.180 
the big issues with wanting and what to
watch<00:03:17.840> for

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.190 

I<00:03:22.280> think<00:03:22.910> a<00:03:22.970> lot<00:03:23.000> of<00:03:23.180> this<00:03:23.300> has<00:03:23.360> to<00:03:23.570> do<00:03:23.900> with

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
I think a lot of this has to do with

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.860 
I think a lot of this has to do with
your<00:03:24.830> natural<00:03:25.040> flexibility<00:03:25.970> your<00:03:26.570> glutes

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
your natural flexibility your glutes

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.600 
your natural flexibility your glutes
strength<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.590> your<00:03:27.680> hamstring<00:03:28.250> strength

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
strength and your hamstring strength

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.550 
strength and your hamstring strength
because<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:29.000> wider<00:03:29.270> you<00:03:29.510> get<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:30.350> more

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
because the wider you get the more

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.170 
because the wider you get the more
emphasis<00:03:31.130> you're<00:03:31.310> going<00:03:31.460> to<00:03:31.520> put<00:03:31.760> on<00:03:32.000> your

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
emphasis you're going to put on your

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.510 
emphasis you're going to put on your
glutes<00:03:32.570> and<00:03:32.780> your<00:03:32.840> hamstrings<00:03:33.470> so<00:03:34.250> if<00:03:34.340> your

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
glutes and your hamstrings so if your

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.220 
glutes and your hamstrings so if your
glutes<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:34.910> hamstrings<00:03:35.510> are<00:03:35.720> weak<00:03:35.990> and

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
glutes and hamstrings are weak and

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.910 
glutes and hamstrings are weak and
lagging<00:03:36.500> if<00:03:37.220> you<00:03:37.430> try<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:37.700> go<00:03:37.970> up<00:03:38.000> heavy<00:03:38.450> wide

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
lagging if you try to go up heavy wide

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.470 
lagging if you try to go up heavy wide
that's<00:03:39.920> going<00:03:40.100> to<00:03:40.160> be<00:03:40.250> problematic<00:03:41.030> it's

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
that's going to be problematic it's

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.210 
that's going to be problematic it's
probably<00:03:41.630> best<00:03:42.020> to<00:03:42.200> save<00:03:42.290> that<00:03:42.770> for<00:03:43.160> an

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
probably best to save that for an

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.970 
probably best to save that for an
accessory<00:03:43.850> and<00:03:43.970> do<00:03:44.120> it<00:03:44.270> afterwards<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.410> go<00:03:45.950> a

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
accessory and do it afterwards and go a

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.730 
accessory and do it afterwards and go a
little<00:03:46.220> lighter<00:03:46.580> and<00:03:47.030> use<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:47.750> rob<00:03:48.260> movement

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
little lighter and use that rob movement

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.340 
little lighter and use that rob movement
just<00:03:48.950> two<00:03:49.100> more<00:03:49.520> for<00:03:49.970> hypertrophy<00:03:50.750> and<00:03:50.900> you

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
just two more for hypertrophy and you

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.540 
just two more for hypertrophy and you
develop<00:03:51.710> your<00:03:51.890> glute<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.490> hamstring

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
develop your glute and hamstring

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.810 
develop your glute and hamstring
strength<00:03:53.800> personally<00:03:54.800> it's<00:03:55.340> taking<00:03:55.700> me<00:03:55.790> a

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
strength personally it's taking me a

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.610 
strength personally it's taking me a
while<00:03:55.880> to<00:03:56.030> get<00:03:56.240> to<00:03:56.300> this<00:03:56.480> point<00:03:56.570> when<00:03:57.080> I<00:03:57.110> swap

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
while to get to this point when I swap

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.920 
while to get to this point when I swap
raw<00:03:57.890> and<00:03:58.100> training<00:03:58.520> I<00:03:58.670> go<00:03:59.330> just<00:03:59.570> as<00:03:59.750> why

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
raw and training I go just as why

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.380 
raw and training I go just as why
because<00:04:00.590> I<00:04:00.770> want<00:04:01.250> to<00:04:01.340> emphasis<00:04:01.940> on<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.120> glue

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
because I want to emphasis on the glue

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.020 
because I want to emphasis on the glue
to<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.540> hamstrings<00:04:03.430> it's<00:04:04.430> definitely<00:04:04.910> not

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
to the hamstrings it's definitely not

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.790 
to the hamstrings it's definitely not
forever

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.860 

Oh
