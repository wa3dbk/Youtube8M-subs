scoping clips I don't know why I was
even<00:02:34.410> planning<00:02:34.530> on<00:02:34.770> making<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:35.040> montage<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.610> I

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
even planning on making a montage and I

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.150 
even planning on making a montage and I
got<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.180> 360<00:02:36.959> no<00:02:37.080> scope<00:02:37.350> off<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.709> crane<00:02:37.980> and

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
got a 360 no scope off the crane and

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.520 
got a 360 no scope off the crane and
this<00:02:38.280> was<00:02:38.430> before<00:02:38.989> trickshotting<00:02:39.989> was<00:02:40.170> huge

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
this was before trickshotting was huge

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.630 
this was before trickshotting was huge
so<00:02:40.680> no<00:02:40.860> one<00:02:40.950> was<00:02:41.100> sending<00:02:41.370> up<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.610> just

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
so no one was sending up it just

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.030 
so no one was sending up it just
happened<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:42.870> that's<00:02:43.050> just<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.410> little<00:02:43.860> side

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
happened so that's just a little side

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.090 
happened so that's just a little side
