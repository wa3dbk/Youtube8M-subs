00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
good not good enough so into the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.220 
good not good enough so into the
implicit<00:03:14.880> imaginative<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:15.959> might<00:03:16.079> be

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
implicit imaginative you might be

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.170 
implicit imaginative you might be
suitable<00:03:16.440> we're<00:03:17.370> not<00:03:17.519> allowed<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.760> be<00:03:17.910> plant

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180

barrington deficits and impurity war

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.670 
barrington deficits and impurity war
isn't<00:03:33.359> any<00:03:33.630> of<00:03:33.750> that<00:03:33.840> conservative<00:03:34.470> view<00:03:34.590> of

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
isn't any of that conservative view of

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.670 
isn't any of that conservative view of
the<00:03:34.769> team<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.790> think<00:03:36.690> I'll<00:03:36.810> bc<00:03:37.079> securities<00:03:37.290> a

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
the team I think I'll bc securities a

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.080 
the team I think I'll bc securities a
huge<00:03:37.920> issue<00:03:38.069> because<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.549> what's<00:03:38.700> going<00:03:38.730> on<00:03:39.000> in

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
huge issue because of what's going on in

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.670 
huge issue because of what's going on in
the<00:03:39.150> world<00:03:39.180> right<00:03:39.359> now<00:03:39.480> but<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.500> amazing

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
the world right now but the amazing

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.500 
the world right now but the amazing
thing<00:03:40.920> about<00:03:41.100> China<00:03:41.579> is<00:03:41.819> that<00:03:41.970> nothing<00:03:42.150> just

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
thing about China is that nothing just

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.569 
thing about China is that nothing just
nothing<00:03:42.660> gets<00:03:43.109> by<00:03:43.290> them<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.709> I<00:03:43.799> think<00:03:43.859> that<00:03:44.250> I

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
nothing gets by them and I think that I

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.400 
nothing gets by them and I think that I
feel<00:03:44.910> very<00:03:45.269> very<00:03:45.510> safe<00:03:45.810> going<00:03:46.049> into<00:03:46.290> these
