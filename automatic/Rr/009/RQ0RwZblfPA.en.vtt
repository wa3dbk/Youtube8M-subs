basically if you don't own an NVIDIA
Tegra<00:00:14.790> 3<00:00:15.150> processor<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:16.070> it's<00:00:17.070> pretty<00:00:17.310> much<00:00:17.490> a

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
Tegra 3 processor is it's pretty much a

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.080 
Tegra 3 processor is it's pretty much a
fast<00:00:18.300> very<00:00:18.779> very<00:00:19.199> fast<00:00:19.529> processor<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:21.029> a

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
fast very very fast processor it's a

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.990 
fast very very fast processor it's a
quad-core<00:00:21.480> 1.5<00:00:22.439> gigahertz<00:00:22.859> slightly<00:00:23.670> under

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
stand is somewhere in there that's

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.140

obviously a camera and some warranty

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.420 
obviously a camera and some warranty
stuff<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.450> yes<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.770> packaging<00:01:29.310> I

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
stuff I yes this is the packaging I

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.010 
stuff I yes this is the packaging I
would<00:01:29.549> assume<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.150> Chinese<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.780> can't

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
would assume it's in Chinese so I can't

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.249 
would assume it's in Chinese so I can't
read<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.380> other<00:01:31.710> than<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.700> fact<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.750> says

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
read it other than the fact that it says

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.179 
read it other than the fact that it says
it<00:01:34.530> has<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:35.030> wxga<00:01:36.030> screen<00:01:36.619> so<00:01:37.619> i<00:01:37.650> guess<00:01:37.920> that's

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
it has a wxga screen so i guess that's

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.940 
it has a wxga screen so i guess that's
decent<00:01:38.900> honeycomb<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.110> know<00:01:40.200> obviously<00:01:40.380> oh

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
decent honeycomb you know obviously oh

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.520 
decent honeycomb you know obviously oh
it<00:01:41.490> does<00:01:41.640> support<00:01:41.820> 1080p<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:42.960> that's<00:01:43.320> kind

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
it does support 1080p is so that's kind

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.370 
it does support 1080p is so that's kind
of<00:01:43.560> nice<00:01:43.740> um<00:01:44.659> yes<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.840> will<00:01:45.960> see<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.200> all

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
of nice um yes you will see this all

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.020 
of nice um yes you will see this all
turns<00:01:46.649> out<00:01:46.740> because<00:01:47.040> frankly<00:01:47.490> I'm<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.850> only

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.060 
turns out because frankly I'm the only
I'm<00:01:48.390> device<00:01:48.780> we've<00:01:49.049> seen<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.470> far<00:01:49.680> within<00:01:49.920> the
