most likely that's because you woke up
perfectly<00:02:28.590> at<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.040> end<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.310> sleep<00:02:29.520> cycle

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
perfectly at the end of a sleep cycle

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.820 
perfectly at the end of a sleep cycle
had<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.630> gotten<00:02:31.020> up

had you gotten up
started<00:02:32.160> your<00:02:32.280> day<00:02:32.310> then<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.880> would<00:02:33.030> have<00:02:33.060> had

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
started your day then you would have had

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
optimal energy all day long the fact

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.700 
optimal energy all day long the fact
that<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.210> went<00:02:36.330> back<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.630> sleep<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:37.440> probably

that you went back to sleep you probably

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.370 
that you went back to sleep you probably
began<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.190> sleep<00:02:38.580> cycle<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.210> woke<00:02:39.720> up<00:02:39.840> later<00:02:40.080> on

into the house granted that does not

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.570 
into the house granted that does not
mean<00:03:56.580> we<00:03:56.610> are<00:03:56.790> nearly<00:03:57.060> done<00:03:57.420> moving<00:03:58.080> in<00:03:58.430> as<00:03:59.430> you

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:43.940 

you

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.860 

ah

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:05:16.769 

ah

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:16.779 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:19.209 

so<00:05:17.779> deadlift<00:05:18.289> time<00:05:18.499> today<00:05:18.710> is<00:05:18.919> lighter

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:19.219 
so deadlift time today is lighter

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.730 
so deadlift time today is lighter
deadlifts<00:05:19.849> and<00:05:19.969> that's<00:05:20.929> because<00:05:21.080> friday<00:05:21.559> is

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
deadlifts and that's because friday is

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.469 
deadlifts and that's because friday is
going<00:05:21.979> to<00:05:22.039> be<00:05:22.129> a<00:05:22.159> heavier<00:05:22.459> death<00:05:22.639> day<00:05:22.969> so<00:05:23.449> i

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
going to be a heavier death day so i

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:24.579 
going to be a heavier death day so i
took<00:05:23.569> advantage<00:05:23.839> of<00:05:24.080> this<00:05:24.199> and<00:05:24.259> really

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:24.589 
took advantage of this and really

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:26.769 
took advantage of this and really
practice<00:05:25.009> the<00:05:25.219> technique<00:05:25.699> now<00:05:26.270> in<00:05:26.479> my<00:05:26.569> last

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:26.779 
practice the technique now in my last

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:29.260 
practice the technique now in my last
video<00:05:27.020> attention<00:05:27.830> to<00:05:27.889> detail<00:05:27.949> in<00:05:28.550> which<00:05:29.089> i

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
video attention to detail in which i

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.999 
video attention to detail in which i
explained<00:05:30.139> how<00:05:30.289> i<00:05:30.319> was<00:05:30.529> switching<00:05:30.679> back

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009 
explained how i was switching back

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.260 
explained how i was switching back
conventionals<00:05:31.789> because<00:05:31.999> there<00:05:32.149> simply

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
conventionals because there simply

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.570 
conventionals because there simply
stronger<00:05:32.839> for<00:05:32.990> me<00:05:33.080> but<00:05:33.319> how<00:05:33.499> i<00:05:33.529> also<00:05:33.860> wanted<00:05:34.339> to

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
stronger for me but how i also wanted to

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.489 
stronger for me but how i also wanted to
really<00:05:35.089> clean<00:05:35.300> up<00:05:35.419> my<00:05:35.539> technique<00:05:35.899> in<00:05:35.990> form<00:05:36.259> and

00:05:36.489 --> 00:05:36.499

to neutralize my spine more now keeping

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.549

your head down to keep a neutral spine

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:00.579 
your head down to keep a neutral spine
is<00:05:57.949> only<00:05:58.939> an<00:05:59.300> option<00:05:59.899> there<00:06:00.080> are<00:06:00.229> variations

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:00.589 
is only an option there are variations

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:02.139 
is only an option there are variations
of<00:06:00.919> dead<00:06:01.069> lifting<00:06:01.309> in<00:06:01.459> which<00:06:01.610> jamming<00:06:02.089> your

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:02.149

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:03.909 
of dead lifting in which jamming your
head<00:06:02.300> back<00:06:02.539> into<00:06:02.779> your<00:06:02.930> trap<00:06:03.169> like<00:06:03.409> Dave<00:06:03.589> takes

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
head back into your trap like Dave takes

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.769 
head back into your trap like Dave takes
has<00:06:04.099> to<00:06:04.189> do<00:06:04.339> can't<00:06:04.849> work<00:06:05.089> so<00:06:05.419> it's<00:06:05.569> all

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:05.779 
has to do can't work so it's all

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:07.749 
has to do can't work so it's all
basically<00:06:06.050> depending<00:06:06.649> on<00:06:06.800> your<00:06:06.889> build<00:06:07.159> but<00:06:07.729> a

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 
basically depending on your build but a

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:09.189 
basically depending on your build but a
lot<00:06:07.909> of<00:06:07.939> them<00:06:08.119> told<00:06:08.330> me<00:06:08.389> that<00:06:08.449> just<00:06:08.899> the<00:06:09.019> looks

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
lot of them told me that just the looks

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:10.839 
lot of them told me that just the looks
of<00:06:09.289> my<00:06:09.409> build<00:06:09.679> I<00:06:09.919> should<00:06:10.309> really<00:06:10.490> focus<00:06:10.639> on

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:10.849 
of my build I should really focus on

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:12.549 
of my build I should really focus on
keeping<00:06:10.999> the<00:06:11.179> muscle<00:06:11.419> neutral<00:06:11.779> spine<00:06:12.080> so<00:06:12.529> I

00:06:12.549 --> 00:06:12.559 
keeping the muscle neutral spine so I

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:14.259 
keeping the muscle neutral spine so I
did<00:06:12.800> just<00:06:12.830> that<00:06:13.099> on<00:06:13.429> top<00:06:13.669> of<00:06:13.729> that<00:06:13.999> I<00:06:14.029> also

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:14.269 
did just that on top of that I also

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:16.239 
did just that on top of that I also
focus<00:06:14.659> on<00:06:14.749> tucking<00:06:15.080> my<00:06:15.259> lats<00:06:15.559> more<00:06:15.889> to<00:06:16.009> be<00:06:16.099> able

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:16.249 
focus on tucking my lats more to be able

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:18.070 
focus on tucking my lats more to be able
to<00:06:16.309> get<00:06:16.430> my<00:06:16.519> hips<00:06:16.759> closer<00:06:16.969> to<00:06:17.149> the<00:06:17.269> bar<00:06:17.509> so
