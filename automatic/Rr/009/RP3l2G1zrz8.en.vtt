00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
us thinking how can we make this more

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.359 
us thinking how can we make this more
sustainable<00:00:28.560> for<00:00:28.740> them<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.070> then<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
sustainable for them and then on the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.349 
sustainable for them and then on the
flip<00:00:29.519> side<00:00:29.550> how<00:00:29.760> can<00:00:29.880> we<00:00:29.939> make<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.150> actually

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
flip side how can we make it actually

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.450 
flip side how can we make it actually
easier<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.779> get<00:00:30.990> their<00:00:31.170> food<00:00:34.040> the<00:00:35.040> mission<00:00:35.309> of
