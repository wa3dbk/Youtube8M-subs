00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:09.710
 good night there's not much soccer in 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.980
 this moment the confederations cup 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.440
 Brazil passing machines to Spain 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.019
 neymar approaching the level of 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.699
 great of history is still missing 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.679
 obviously before being cataloged but 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.060
 but it is the performance of the cup 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.310
 confederations a player much more 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.619
 complete but the topic in nth chile 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.689
 at this moment it is not that way 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.570
 obvious but the sub-20 and the question of 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.840
 you play so bad the super is badly located 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.510
 angelo henriquez nicolás maturana el 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.699
 team is very schematic in short 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.980
 was wrong for example mario rooms to 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.720
 put so many substitutes that were not 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.670
 so much but some substitutes against irak 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.200
 when there is no football like now there is no 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.600
 professional football on weekends not 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.420
 there are liberators, in short, no 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.400
 there is in football usual and it is only 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.430
 playing sub-20 obviously he 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.000
 we put all the whole focus the sub-20 we 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.000
 Talk about another thing 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.680
 The truth is that at this moment Chile 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.270
 he was second the group is going to face 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.780
 a team like croatia that is very strong 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.790
 and on the contrary what happened two years ago 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.430
 weeks where chile appeared in sixth 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.400
 place among bettors now with the 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.430
 pessimism the feeling this that 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.820
 to beat croatia is very difficult 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.380
 we go up and down we know one day we are 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.080
 the best another day we are the worst 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.390
 that happens to a football that really 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.520
 has never gained anything very important 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.590
 trophies out there but it really is not 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.990
 a football of d 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.820
 world dominant level no less 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.899
 South American will look for a cup america 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.090
 a youth from america nor a 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.729
 South American sub-17 those are details 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.179
 important good always taste da vinci 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.340
 - plays very rigid schematized very 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:54.149
 attached to the script the team is without 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.270
 spark the computer does not appear at 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.909
 transitions are slow is a team that 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.179
 One thing is speech and another thing is 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.700
 the reality the team does not play well not 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.380
 convinces not full even becomes 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.399
 for boring moment and you get to play 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.010
 very slow 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.379
 everyone asks rooms to change that 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.329
 put two men in the castle area 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.709
 and enríquez and leave maturana net hook 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:21.189
 remember that it will not be vary for 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.700
 the one who passes that makes halls does not 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:26.349
 make case 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.680
 let's see if he loses his way he kills him if 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:32.470
 loses with another's he kills if he wins 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.970
 with his he is saved but if he wins with the 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.709
 of another is going to have to put up with 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.109
 you won because you paid attention to the 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.879
 comments other technicians to the networks 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:42.840
 social and etcetera is already in a 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:45.030
 complicated position sea ​​and salt 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.550
 room says flashy things in any case 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.190
 speaks of rebellion what I know and why 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:54.060
 example against england noted that it 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.010
 they generated 17 chances of goal 17 the 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.709
 truth is that it says one against a count 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.920
 and they were not more than six or seven and 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.660
 some we gave the condition of occasion 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.010
 of goal being that it is far from being 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.110
 vocation of what was an arrival 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.090
 I just do not know where he got the numbers 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.340
 when they tell salt access that the 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.190
 equipment is schematized or slow it looks very 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.620
 moored that appears to tell us that the 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.180
 rebellion the explosion the clear speed 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.250
 there is one thing that is speech and another 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.790
 thing that is the objective what happens in 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.790
 the court 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.610
 touches social touch until after you 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.800
 renewed contract 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.020
 there is one thing that obviously is not 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.580
 fault of several alak but that is of the 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.170
 players the individual performance of 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.880
 the players has not been the expected by 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.580
 example martínez they have to play 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.350
 much more the same angelo henriquez said 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.500
 now it's been a while since maybe there was 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.770
 they looked less at some rivals that 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.470
 is part of the guilt of the 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.480
 players the truth is that before we 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.030
 we settle with classifying the 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.220
 world now after passing the 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.650
 second round now with the parameter of 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.310
 2007 or any third place and that already 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.500
 complicates things 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.150
 what's going to happen, nobody has an idea 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.220
 team I do not like but it's 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.569
 classified in one of those appears the 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.220
 Wednesday and they give croatia the hand 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.920
 it's complicated 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.019
 I hope we do well this is football and 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.920
 other is let's have roberto 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.049
 hernandez who is going to talk about this 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.970
 selection and from claudio borghi things very 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.400
 interesting about the output of 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.130
 coach of the Chilean national team comes 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.020
 jorge jews with important issues 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.550
 the triangulation of the players in 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.260
 Argentina are scandal in Chile still 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.050
 does not transcend and mess with some 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.050
 sports federations soccer and others
