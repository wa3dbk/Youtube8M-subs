some time to sit back and reflect and I

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.880 
some time to sit back and reflect and I
know<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.920> hilarity<00:00:23.490> Clinton<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.180> running<00:00:24.890> so

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
I was trying to study her and kind of

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.229 
I was trying to study her and kind of
figure<00:00:28.830> out<00:00:29.070> if<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:30.029> could<00:00:30.359> do<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:30.779> too<00:00:32.239> and

figure out if I could do this too and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.020 
figure out if I could do this too and
honestly<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.840> think<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.350> could<00:00:34.760> she<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.000> are

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.030 
honestly I think I could she and I are
really<00:00:36.480> like<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.559> same<00:00:37.829> woman<00:00:38.280> but<00:00:39.800> not<00:00:40.800> at

really like the same woman but not at

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.200 
really like the same woman but not at
all<00:00:41.250> but<00:00:41.610> we're<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> lot<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:43.340> she's<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.820> woman

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
all but we're a lot like she's a woman

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.160 
all but we're a lot like she's a woman
like<00:00:45.719> me<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.500> she<00:00:46.920> has<00:00:47.270> really<00:00:48.270> great

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.260 
like me and she has really great
eyebrows<00:00:49.770> which<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.250> don't<00:00:50.309> understand<00:00:51.090> why<00:00:51.210> no

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
eyebrows which I don't understand why no

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.299 
eyebrows which I don't understand why no
one's<00:00:51.510> talking<00:00:51.809> about<00:00:52.230> have<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.860> seen<00:00:53.129> her

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
one's talking about have you seen her

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.500 
one's talking about have you seen her
eyebrows<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.680> she's<00:00:55.680> also<00:00:55.860> got<00:00:56.219> really<00:00:56.550> big

expressive<00:00:58.170> eyes<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.890> think<00:00:59.219> that's

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
expressive eyes and I think that's

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.729 
expressive eyes and I think that's
working<00:00:59.850> for<00:00:59.879> her<00:01:00.149> because<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.840> honestly<00:01:01.350> can't

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
figure out why else she's made it as far

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.270 
figure out why else she's made it as far
as<00:01:05.129> she<00:01:05.309> has<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:08.210> also<00:01:09.260> believe<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.500> keeping<00:01:10.979> my
