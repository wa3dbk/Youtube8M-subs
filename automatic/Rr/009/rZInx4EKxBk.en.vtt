00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
millimeter bolts and so we couldn't have

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.360 
millimeter bolts and so we couldn't have
a<00:04:09.389> good<00:04:09.540> torque<00:04:09.810> wrench<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:10.290> torque<00:04:11.099> things

this<00:04:11.519> back<00:04:12.079> make<00:04:13.079> sure<00:04:13.290> that<00:04:13.440> they're<00:04:13.730> never

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
this back make sure that they're never

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.310 
this back make sure that they're never
going<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.030> come<00:04:15.090> out<00:04:15.359> unless<00:04:15.720> you<00:04:15.870> want<00:04:16.169> them

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
going to come out unless you want them

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.160 
going to come out unless you want them
to<00:04:16.470> you

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.390 

the<00:04:23.170> next<00:04:23.380> step<00:04:23.560> is<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:23.830> install<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.250> power

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
the next step is to install the power

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.310 
the next step is to install the power
steering<00:04:24.730> pump<00:04:24.850> the<00:04:25.660> first<00:04:25.900> thing<00:04:26.110> to<00:04:26.230> do

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
steering pump the first thing to do

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.260 
steering pump the first thing to do
there<00:04:26.590> is<00:04:26.620> take<00:04:27.190> this<00:04:27.340> little<00:04:27.400> reinforcing

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
there is take this little reinforcing

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.920 
there is take this little reinforcing
bracket<00:04:28.390> and<00:04:28.810> slide<00:04:29.560> it<00:04:29.890> onto<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.340> pump<00:04:30.930> and

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
bracket and slide it onto the pump and

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.710 
bracket and slide it onto the pump and
then<00:04:32.770> we<00:04:33.130> need<00:04:33.280> to<00:04:33.400> install<00:04:33.790> a<00:04:34.000> short<00:04:34.360> bolt

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
then we need to install a short bolt

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.740 
then we need to install a short bolt
through<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.590> side<00:04:35.830> there<00:04:36.480> after<00:04:37.480> that<00:04:37.600> we're

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
through the side there after that we're

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.360 
through the side there after that we're
going<00:04:37.900> to<00:04:38.020> put<00:04:38.320> anti-seize<00:04:38.800> on<00:04:38.920> the<00:04:39.040> longer

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
going to put anti-seize on the longer

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.360 
going to put anti-seize on the longer
bolts<00:04:39.670> and<00:04:39.940> drop<00:04:40.300> them<00:04:40.510> through<00:04:40.540> the<00:04:40.900> pump

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.900 

we're<00:04:45.370> going<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:45.580> go<00:04:45.640> hang<00:04:45.850> this<00:04:46.060> on<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.420> car

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
we're going to go hang this on the car

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.670 
we're going to go hang this on the car
and<00:04:48.910> I'll<00:04:49.000> take<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.300> last<00:04:49.540> short<00:04:50.110> bolt<00:04:50.440> and

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
and I'll take the last short bolt and

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.470 
and I'll take the last short bolt and
install<00:04:51.100> it<00:04:51.220> through<00:04:51.460> that<00:04:51.670> reinforcing

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
install it through that reinforcing

00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:00.750 
install it through that reinforcing
bracket<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:53.020> into<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:53.890> main<00:04:54.070> bracket
