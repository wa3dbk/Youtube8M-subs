well<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.529> performed<00:00:29.070> we<00:00:29.820> used<00:00:30.060> strictly

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
well it performed we used strictly

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.500 
well it performed we used strictly
circle<00:00:31.140> hooks<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:32.189> fact<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.820> got<00:00:32.969> one<00:00:33.149> still<00:00:33.390> on

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
circle hooks in fact I got one still on

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.930 
circle hooks in fact I got one still on
here<00:00:33.719> but<00:00:33.870> it's<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.230> don't<00:00:34.559> know<00:00:34.649> probably<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.640> 6

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
here but it's I don't know probably a 6

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.310 
here but it's I don't know probably a 6
6<00:00:36.420> SOT<00:00:36.690> I'm<00:00:37.260> guessing<00:00:37.649> 5<00:00:37.829> or<00:00:37.980> 6<00:00:38.160> s<00:00:38.840> and<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.200> all

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
6 SOT I'm guessing 5 or 6 s and it's all

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.660 
6 SOT I'm guessing 5 or 6 s and it's all
barbless<00:00:40.710> up<00:00:40.920> there<00:00:41.100> but<00:00:41.219> anyways<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.640> point

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
barbless up there but anyways the point

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.779 
barbless up there but anyways the point
is<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.930> was<00:00:43.110> all<00:00:43.260> circle<00:00:43.680> hooks<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.370> know<00:00:44.399> just

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
is it was all circle hooks you know just

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.729 
is it was all circle hooks you know just
dead<00:00:45.000> sticking<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:47.550> action<00:00:48.090> allowed

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
dead sticking so the action allowed

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.860 
dead sticking so the action allowed
lauda<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.980> hook<00:00:50.160> up<00:00:50.340> real<00:00:50.579> well<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.629> still

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
lauda to hook up real well and it still

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.689 
lauda to hook up real well and it still
offered<00:00:52.469> enough<00:00:52.710> backbone<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.219> fight<00:00:53.520> these

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
offered enough backbone to fight these

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.029 
offered enough backbone to fight these
bigger<00:00:53.969> fish<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> current<00:00:54.930> when<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.860> say

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
bigger fish in the current when I say

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.950 
bigger fish in the current when I say
bigger<00:00:56.250> fish<00:00:56.579> they<00:00:56.879> were<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.510> know<00:00:57.539> upwards

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
bigger fish they were you know upwards

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.130 
bigger fish they were you know upwards
of<00:00:58.050> 25<00:00:58.469> pounds<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.390> we<00:01:00.390> didn't<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.870> know<00:01:00.960> they

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
of 25 pounds but we didn't you know they

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.630 
of 25 pounds but we didn't you know they
don't<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.379> any<00:01:01.559> flat<00:01:01.829> heads<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.219> there<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.520> we

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
don't have any flat heads up there so we

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.920 
don't have any flat heads up there so we
didn't<00:01:02.879> get<00:01:02.940> anything<00:01:03.180> into<00:01:03.420> real<00:01:03.690> big<00:01:03.899> you

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
didn't get anything into real big you

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.679 
didn't get anything into real big you
know<00:01:04.170> 50<00:01:04.830> 60<00:01:05.159> pounds<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:06.119> did<00:01:06.270> put<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> lot

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
know 50 60 pounds but we did put a lot

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.219 
know 50 60 pounds but we did put a lot
of<00:01:06.840> fish<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.229> boat<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:08.360> I<00:01:09.360> got<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> good<00:01:09.960> feel

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
of fish in the boat so I got a good feel

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.620 
of fish in the boat so I got a good feel
of<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.710> action<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.760> how<00:01:11.939> well<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.299> fought<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
of the action and how well it fought the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.230 
of the action and how well it fought the
fish<00:01:13.040> but<00:01:14.040> anyways<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:14.520> want<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.909> say<00:01:15.090> that

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
fish but anyways I just want to say that

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.140 
fish but anyways I just want to say that
this<00:01:15.390> rod<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.750> definitely<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> win<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.150> one

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
this rod is definitely a win and one

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.270 
this rod is definitely a win and one
thing<00:01:18.330> I'm<00:01:18.450> looking<00:01:18.570> forward<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.350> getting

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
thing I'm looking forward to is getting

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.070 
thing I'm looking forward to is getting
this<00:01:20.490> out<00:01:20.700> sturgeon<00:01:21.390> fishing<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.900> think

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
this out sturgeon fishing so I think

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.330 
this out sturgeon fishing so I think
it's<00:01:22.170> really<00:01:22.380> going<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.560> work<00:01:22.619> well<00:01:22.950> let<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
it's really going to work well let the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.940 
it's really going to work well let the
tip<00:01:23.490> action<00:01:23.970> for<00:01:24.450> detecting<00:01:24.960> light<00:01:25.439> bites<00:01:25.710> you

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
tip action for detecting light bites you

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.679 
tip action for detecting light bites you
know<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> small<00:01:26.700> taps<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.180> sturgeon

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
know that the small taps that sturgeon

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.480 
know that the small taps that sturgeon
do<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.049> think<00:01:28.770> it's<00:01:29.009> really<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.400> work

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
do I think it's really going to work

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.630 
do I think it's really going to work
well<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.740> but<00:01:31.740> again<00:01:31.860> still<00:01:32.189> has<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
well for that but again still has the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.190 
well for that but again still has the
backbone<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.180> fight<00:01:33.390> these<00:01:33.600> hard<00:01:33.900> fighting

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
backbone to fight these hard fighting

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.530 
backbone to fight these hard fighting
fish<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.799> if<00:01:35.159> you're<00:01:35.520> looking<00:01:35.759> for<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.000> rod<00:01:36.210> I
