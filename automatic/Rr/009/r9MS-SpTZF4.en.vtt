00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:27.329
 today he knows how the compact disc is made 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.160
 are of metal or plastic glass in 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.710
 truth all three are used 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.690
 these materials we will show you in that 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.850
 so the mozzarella cheese this a 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.309
 relatively new element in the diet 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.199
 but it has become a basic ingredient for 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.010
 pizza and sandwiches 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:49.199
 but as is done on an industrial scale i 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.059
 pantyhose how can something 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.899
 notoriously delicate to be produced in 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.899
 mass in a factory 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.740
 the fluorescent tubes we are witnessing 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.500
 precision choreography that uses 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:10.660
 of mercury phosphorus and oxyhydrogen flame 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.790
 but first in 1991 some scientists 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.430
 Japanese and German invented a 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.450
 device destined to revolutionize the 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.630
 music world 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.490
 the compact disc today this ingenious 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.460
 device contains millions and millions 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.690
 of data bits in offices or case studies 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.310
 archives the cd has become indispensable 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.860
 the production of compact discs and must 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.960
 take place in an ultra sterile environment 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.390
 just a few dust particles per 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.550
 damaging the process I pity you 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.780
 are copies made from a disc 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:46.090
 original glass sample starts on 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.460
 I work a thin sheet of glass 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.100
 possesses the necessary information in 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.729
 this musical case stored with a 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.729
 laser beam 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.290
 the transfer is complete 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.720
 applied two chemicals the primer 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.720
 and a durable photo coating 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.140
 the disc is gently extracted 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.940
 from the appliance then the photo layer 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.380
 resistant is made to dry in a 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.380
 oven for 30 minutes 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.870
 this detector with two spouts 1 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.060
 apply deionized water and the other 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.459
 vaporises a solution to develop i 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.409
 data printed on the glass now 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.409
 the information is engraved on the disc 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.290
 the disk is positioned on this 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:54.090
 metal cover machine 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.769
 the next phase consists 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.430
 in the application of a thin layer 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.739
 of nickel and vanadium this process 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.439
 electro forming applies to the disc 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.150
 sample will be obtained from which the cd 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.519
 etched glass is immersed in one 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.560
 chemical solution for 70 minutes 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.349
 end this will be the cd master from which 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.209
 You will perform the various copies of the 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.040
 mold is pressed to get the 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.959
 desired shape while the material in 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.959
 excess is recovered and recycled 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.010
 the cd master is ready a technician takes off 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.080
 the film that protected the data 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.610
 imprinted on the mold 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.980
 the latter after a visual inspection 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.600
 is sent to the molding department 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.270
 where the mold comes gently 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.400
 installed in the matrix that will form the 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:07.890
 compact the disks are made of one 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.660
 special plastic called polycarbonate 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.520
 the matrix is ​​closed and the 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.980
 liquid polycarbonate is injected 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.730
 in the mold it comes out like a disk 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.380
 small hard and translucent now comes 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:24.990
 covered with metal so it can 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.670
 be read by a cd player one arm 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.590
 automatic lifts the disc from the 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.590
 matrix the opposition on these supports 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.980
 this metallization process 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.930
 extremely fast and simple consists 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:46.030
 in covering the plastic disk with 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.030
 a very thin layer of aluminum 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:04.430
 this is the interior of the matrix in which 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.430
 the aluminum layer is applied 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.100
 in a process almost totally 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:20.100
 an automated industry can produce 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:22.110
 over 100,000 compact discs a day is 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.600
 essential to protect the surface of the 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.100
 disk then one is distributed 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.900
 enamel layer that facilitates 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:33.169
 the application of screen printing on 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:37.729
 disc of ultraviolet lamps 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.729
 they quickly dry the enamel 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.120
 and here in the printing department comes 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.160
 realized the label in 60 seconds 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.260
 70 discs are printed 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.700
 once the operation is completed, the CDs 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:06:00.340
 they are ready for packaging 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:06:00.340
 simple no soon
