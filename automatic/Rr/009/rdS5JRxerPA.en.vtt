00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.480
 hello everyone with you crazy ted and welcome 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.370
 to the new heading quick 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.410
 mechanism where am i for two minutes 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.670
 I will try to explain to you what it is 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.650
 mechanism and how it is built went so 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.440
 as you might guess it 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.090
 some kind of cargo carrier who 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.730
 It looks like this here in the form of 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.830
 running trolleys and let's for a second 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.809
 let's imagine that from this side we 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.510
 is your wheat farm 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.699
 Well, from this side of course your home 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.600
 and you don't want let's go every 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.909
 times to the farm 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.769
 collect this good to bring it to your 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:43.489
 the house for this is actually made this 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.000
 mechanism 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.589
 so let's assume this is your harvest and 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.780
 as you can see with us 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.850
 the trolley stops at it 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.280
 load the entire drop 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.930
 thus when he is completely 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.210
 booted as you can see the chest is absolutely 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.549
 empty he comes here also 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.949
 stops and loads already this 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:06.260
 the chest is such an unusual one 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.659
 mechanism and let's move on to his 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.549
 construction first we naturally 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.320
 paving the way what we need 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.049
 lengths and then put 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.880
 ordinary rails and naturally energy 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.119
 rails on which we need to put 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.780
 the funnel next we take the block set here 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.289
 there's also a comparator and another block 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.350
 here 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.640
 sticky follower 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.579
 and red block 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.399
 all one part is ready further 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:37.549
 set up a funnel like this here 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.490
 Well of course here is your own chest 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.189
 there will be or another funnel in the same place as 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.369
 want also lay the rails on 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.859
 the funnel itself using shift further here 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.799
 set the block here red block 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:54.679
 sticky piston torch set like this 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.140
 red block and here is another block to 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.390
 trolley we had not gone anywhere, and well 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.850
 accordingly, we put the cart itself on 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.560
 these rails, in general, that's all 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.270
 thanks for watching subscribe to
