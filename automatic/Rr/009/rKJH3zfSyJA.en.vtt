00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.360 
for two dollars and I was like well I
don't<00:00:39.840> really<00:00:40.110> need<00:00:40.380> in<00:00:40.530> my<00:00:40.650> home<00:00:40.829> but<00:00:41.070> for<00:00:41.100> two

don't really need in my home but for two
bucks<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.880> thought<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.329> they're<00:00:42.720> worth<00:00:42.900> by

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
bucks I thought like they're worth by

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.110 
bucks I thought like they're worth by
him<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.590> see<00:00:44.280> what<00:00:44.520> i<00:00:44.550> could<00:00:44.700> do<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:44.880> them

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
him and see what i could do with them

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.229 
him and see what i could do with them
anyway<00:00:46.110> basically<00:00:46.380> this<00:00:47.190> boils<00:00:47.730> off<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.149> then

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
anyway basically this boils off and then

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.520 
anyway basically this boils off and then
you've<00:00:48.270> got<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.660> little<00:00:48.870> lemon<00:00:49.290> and<00:00:49.410> I

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
you've got this little lemon and I

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.500 
you've got this little lemon and I
played<00:00:49.890> around<00:00:50.040> with<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.460> indoors<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.239> see<00:00:51.420> if

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
played around with it indoors to see if

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.540 
played around with it indoors to see if
I<00:00:51.570> could<00:00:51.690> make<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.930> little<00:00:52.200> layout<00:00:52.380> of<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.890> it

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
I could make a little layout of it it

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.060 
I could make a little layout of it it
just<00:00:53.820> screws<00:00:54.060> out<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:55.110> then<00:00:55.500> once<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.920> pull

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
just screws out and then once you pull

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.090 
just screws out and then once you pull
that<00:00:56.190> take<00:00:56.430> out<00:00:56.640> there<00:00:57.620> they<00:00:58.620> actually<00:00:58.829> will

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
that take out there they actually will

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.389 
that take out there they actually will
then<00:00:59.309> start<00:00:59.489> charging<00:01:00.380> with<00:01:01.380> the<00:01:01.530> solar<00:01:01.770> panel

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
then start charging with the solar panel

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.560 
then start charging with the solar panel
just<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:02.899> so<00:01:04.700> so<00:01:05.700> thinking<00:01:06.030> what<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.299> could<00:01:06.450> do

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570

you is an experiment I've just done it's

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
you is an experiment I've just done it's
another<00:04:07.040> typical<00:04:07.880> me<00:04:08.299> crazy<00:04:08.750> experiment<00:04:09.620> but

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
another typical me crazy experiment but

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.539 
another typical me crazy experiment but
as<00:04:10.609> you<00:04:11.090> can<00:04:11.180> see<00:04:11.419> here<00:04:11.810> all<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:12.980> lights<00:04:13.250> in

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
as you can see here all the lights in

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:14.090 
as you can see here all the lights in
the<00:04:13.700> bag

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
the bag

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.670 
the bag
and<00:04:14.460> I<00:04:15.300> just<00:04:15.480> cut<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.780> holes<00:04:15.960> out<00:04:16.170> this<00:04:16.410> his

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
and I just cut the holes out this his

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.890 
and I just cut the holes out this his
cardboard<00:04:17.040> is<00:04:17.370> measured<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.330> fit<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.600> top<00:04:18.780> of

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
cardboard is measured to fit the top of

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.610 
cardboard is measured to fit the top of
my<00:04:19.020> lamp<00:04:19.290> and<00:04:20.600> so<00:04:21.600> I<00:04:21.630> set<00:04:21.930> this<00:04:22.050> on<00:04:22.230> the<00:04:22.320> top<00:04:22.500> of

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
my lamp and so I set this on the top of

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.490 
my lamp and so I set this on the top of
my<00:04:22.710> lamb<00:04:22.890> during<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.340> day<00:04:23.960> angled<00:04:24.960> towards

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
my lamb during the day angled towards

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.180 
my lamb during the day angled towards
the<00:04:25.710> Sun<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:27.080> just<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.320> ambient<00:04:28.740> light<00:04:28.950> in

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
the Sun and just the ambient light in

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.370 
the Sun and just the ambient light in
the<00:04:29.310> room<00:04:29.340> not<00:04:29.940> direct<00:04:30.390> next<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.840> a<00:04:30.870> window<00:04:31.170> or

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
the room not direct next to a window or

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.920 
the room not direct next to a window or
anything<00:04:31.830> is<00:04:32.040> enough<00:04:32.670> to<00:04:32.850> charge<00:04:33.060> that<00:04:33.420> up<00:04:33.630> and

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
anything is enough to charge that up and

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
anything is enough to charge that up and
give<00:04:34.470> me<00:04:34.740> a<00:04:35.010> really<00:04:35.460> nice<00:04:36.290> ambient<00:04:37.290> glow<00:04:37.350> from

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
give me a really nice ambient glow from

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.040 
give me a really nice ambient glow from
a<00:04:38.070> nightlight<00:04:38.580> it's<00:04:39.060> not<00:04:39.330> enough<00:04:39.660> to<00:04:39.690> make<00:04:40.020> it

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
a nightlight it's not enough to make it

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.930 
a nightlight it's not enough to make it
a<00:04:40.230> reading<00:04:40.620> lamp<00:04:40.770> but<00:04:41.310> it<00:04:41.430> certainly<00:04:41.700> is

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
a reading lamp but it certainly is

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.620 
a reading lamp but it certainly is
enough<00:04:42.360> to<00:04:42.540> make<00:04:42.570> a<00:04:42.750> nice<00:04:43.790> like<00:04:44.790> atmosphere<00:04:45.030> in

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
enough to make a nice like atmosphere in

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.230 
enough to make a nice like atmosphere in
a<00:04:45.690> lounge<00:04:45.930> with<00:04:46.380> ivette<00:04:47.130> but<00:04:47.400> I<00:04:47.610> mean<00:04:48.150> that's

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
a lounge with ivette but I mean that's

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.290 
a lounge with ivette but I mean that's
just<00:04:48.510> another<00:04:49.160> crazy<00:04:50.160> idea<00:04:50.670> I<00:04:50.700> come<00:04:51.000> up<00:04:51.150> with

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
just another crazy idea I come up with

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.450 
just another crazy idea I come up with
it<00:04:51.450> again<00:04:52.170> these<00:04:52.560> are<00:04:52.620> two<00:04:52.920> bucks<00:04:53.220> each

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
it again these are two bucks each

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.490 
it again these are two bucks each
there's<00:04:53.910> nine<00:04:54.630> of<00:04:54.660> them<00:04:54.930> on<00:04:55.050> this<00:04:55.230> about

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
there's nine of them on this about

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.000 
there's nine of them on this about
eighteen<00:04:55.950> dollars<00:04:56.220> I've<00:04:56.580> got<00:04:56.700> myself<00:04:56.880> tell<00:04:58.010> so

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
eighteen dollars I've got myself tell so

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.210 
eighteen dollars I've got myself tell so
good<00:04:59.220> lamp<00:04:59.570> so<00:05:00.570> yeah<00:05:01.410> and<00:05:01.530> we<00:05:01.710> just<00:05:01.920> wanted<00:05:02.100> to

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
good lamp so yeah and we just wanted to

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.150 
good lamp so yeah and we just wanted to
share<00:05:02.430> those<00:05:02.670> with<00:05:02.700> you<00:05:03.740> what<00:05:04.740> you<00:05:04.830> can<00:05:04.980> do<00:05:05.130> for

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
share those with you what you can do for

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.390 
share those with you what you can do for
a<00:05:05.730> two<00:05:06.060> dollar<00:05:06.090> investment<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:08.190> fact

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
a two dollar investment and the fact

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.850 
a two dollar investment and the fact
that<00:05:08.490> it<00:05:08.670> does<00:05:08.880> have<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.240> battery<00:05:09.420> inside<00:05:10.020> and

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
that it does have the battery inside and

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.470 
that it does have the battery inside and
I<00:05:11.010> think<00:05:11.070> it<00:05:11.310> makes<00:05:11.460> a<00:05:11.610> great<00:05:11.730> addition<00:05:12.120> to<00:05:12.300> a

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
I think it makes a great addition to a

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.990 
I think it makes a great addition to a
bug-out<00:05:12.900> bag<00:05:13.170> or<00:05:13.710> even<00:05:14.250> just<00:05:14.280> a<00:05:14.580> home<00:05:14.820> to

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
bug-out bag or even just a home to

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.370 
bug-out bag or even just a home to

as you can see it's not near a window
and<00:05:33.110> what<00:05:34.110> I've<00:05:34.230> just<00:05:34.260> done<00:05:34.530> is<00:05:34.770> cut<00:05:35.010> the

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
and what I've just done is cut the

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.510 
and what I've just done is cut the
cardboard<00:05:36.000> out<00:05:36.240> the<00:05:36.780> size<00:05:37.050> of<00:05:37.260> my<00:05:37.350> lamb<00:05:37.560> put<00:05:38.400> as

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
cardboard out the size of my lamb put as

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.640 
cardboard out the size of my lamb put as
many<00:05:38.700> of<00:05:38.910> the<00:05:39.000> little<00:05:39.270> solar<00:05:39.840> lamps<00:05:40.260> in<00:05:40.410> there

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
many of the little solar lamps in there

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.490 
many of the little solar lamps in there
and<00:05:40.830> then<00:05:41.430> at<00:05:41.580> nighttime<00:05:42.050> well<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.260> during

and then at nighttime well the during

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.200 
and then at nighttime well the during
the<00:05:43.590> day<00:05:43.740> is<00:05:43.950> charging<00:05:44.550> with<00:05:44.790> the<00:05:44.880> ambient

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
the day is charging with the ambient

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.330 
the day is charging with the ambient
light<00:05:45.390> in<00:05:45.570> the<00:05:45.690> room<00:05:45.720> and<00:05:46.140> it's<00:05:46.830> enough<00:05:47.130> to

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
light in the room and it's enough to

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.190 
light in the room and it's enough to
keep<00:05:47.370> these<00:05:47.730> slight<00:05:48.090> goin<00:05:48.450> all<00:05:48.660> night<00:05:48.690> long

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
keep these slight goin all night long

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.860 
keep these slight goin all night long
but<00:05:49.650> it's<00:05:49.980> not<00:05:50.310> over<00:05:50.790> bright<00:05:51.060> I<00:05:51.300> mean<00:05:51.480> it's<00:05:51.630> a

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
but it's not over bright I mean it's a

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.970 
but it's not over bright I mean it's a
it<00:05:52.770> creates<00:05:53.310> a<00:05:53.370> nice<00:05:53.520> light<00:05:54.440> ambience<00:05:55.440> but<00:05:55.740> not

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
it creates a nice light ambience but not

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.230 
it creates a nice light ambience but not
a<00:05:56.010> reason<00:05:56.400> like<00:05:56.520> you<00:05:56.670> wouldn't<00:05:56.880> be<00:05:56.940> out<00:05:57.030> read

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
a reason like you wouldn't be out read

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.680 
a reason like you wouldn't be out read
with<00:05:57.450> it<00:05:57.600> but<00:05:58.110> it's<00:05:58.730> just<00:05:59.730> another<00:06:00.000> experiment

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
with it but it's just another experiment

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.610 
with it but it's just another experiment
and<00:06:00.870> I<00:06:01.530> would<00:06:01.980> love<00:06:02.100> to<00:06:02.280> make<00:06:02.400> every<00:06:02.850> appliance

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
and I would love to make every appliance

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.080 
and I would love to make every appliance
stand<00:06:04.620> alone<00:06:04.920> rather<00:06:05.160> than<00:06:05.430> having<00:06:05.700> solar

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
stand alone rather than having solar

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.390 
stand alone rather than having solar
panels<00:06:06.540> all<00:06:06.720> over<00:06:07.080> the<00:06:07.550> roof<00:06:08.550> or<00:06:08.970> wherever<00:06:09.720> and

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
panels all over the roof or wherever and

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.920 
panels all over the roof or wherever and
I'd<00:06:11.400> like<00:06:11.550> to<00:06:11.610> make<00:06:11.880> each<00:06:12.030> individual<00:06:12.930> item

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
I'd like to make each individual item

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.300 
I'd like to make each individual item
self-sustained<00:06:15.930> with<00:06:16.500> its<00:06:16.680> own<00:06:16.860> built-in

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
self-sustained with its own built-in

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.510 
self-sustained with its own built-in
solar<00:06:18.050> so<00:06:19.050> that<00:06:19.230> you<00:06:19.350> didn't<00:06:19.650> reliable<00:06:20.310> tied

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
solar so that you didn't reliable tied

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.580 
solar so that you didn't reliable tied
in<00:06:20.730> with<00:06:20.760> greed<00:06:21.150> every<00:06:21.600> item<00:06:21.780> wherever<00:06:22.350> it<00:06:22.440> was

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
in with greed every item wherever it was

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.610 
in with greed every item wherever it was
put<00:06:22.860> was<00:06:23.100> so<00:06:23.340> run<00:06:23.700> that<00:06:23.729> would<00:06:24.030> be<00:06:24.150> awesome<00:06:24.620> ok

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
put was so run that would be awesome ok

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:35.860 
put was so run that would be awesome ok
well<00:06:25.919> just<00:06:26.190> wanted<00:06:26.880> to<00:06:26.970> share<00:06:27.120> that<00:06:27.180> with<00:06:27.360> you

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870
