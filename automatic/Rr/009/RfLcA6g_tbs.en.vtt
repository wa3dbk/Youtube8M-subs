00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
though they kind of purposely try to

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.709 
though they kind of purposely try to
make<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.629> look<00:00:39.809> bad<00:00:40.250> you<00:00:41.250> run<00:00:41.399> around<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.910> any

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
make it look bad you run around in any

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.500 
make it look bad you run around in any
ghosts<00:00:43.320> for<00:00:44.190> vast<00:00:44.550> numbers<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.000> points

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:56.480 

it<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.720> prettier<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.320> get<00:00:49.500> more<00:00:49.800> dots<00:00:55.250> it<00:00:56.250> gets

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.490 
it is prettier you get more dots it gets

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.950 
it is prettier you get more dots it gets
kind<00:00:56.700> of<00:00:56.760> faster<00:00:57.120> as<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.240> go<00:00:57.390> along<00:00:57.480> but<00:00:57.900> I

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
kind of faster as you go along but I

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.730 
kind of faster as you go along but I
don't<00:00:58.230> see<00:00:58.380> the<00:00:58.500> point<00:00:58.650> but<00:01:00.440> you<00:01:01.440> just<00:01:01.620> keep

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.740 
don't see the point but you just keep

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.350 
don't see the point but you just keep
following<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> same<00:01:02.340> set<00:01:02.610> path<00:01:02.880> over<00:01:03.240> and

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
following the same set path over and

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.550 
following the same set path over and
over<00:01:04.160> because<00:01:05.160> it's<00:01:05.309> not<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> complicated<00:01:05.970> game

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.719 

what<00:01:10.560> else<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:10.920> said<00:01:10.979> about<00:01:11.130> pac-man<00:01:11.460> you

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
what else can be said about pac-man you

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.460 
what else can be said about pac-man you
weren't<00:01:11.880> around<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.180> redox<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.229> just

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
weren't around to redox this is just

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.100 
weren't around to redox this is just
like<00:01:13.530> our<00:01:13.800> last<00:01:13.920> pac-man<00:01:14.430> review<00:01:14.850> what<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:15.990> do

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
like our last pac-man review what we do

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.330 
like our last pac-man review what we do
change<00:01:16.440> it

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.160 

I<00:01:19.429> think<00:01:20.210> this<00:01:20.299> game<00:01:20.479> is<00:01:20.539> based<00:01:20.869> on<00:01:21.049> the

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
I think this game is based on the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.709 
I think this game is based on the
Turkish<00:01:21.469> genocide<00:01:23.950> because<00:01:25.479> you<00:01:26.479> keep

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
Turkish genocide because you keep

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.300 
Turkish genocide because you keep
killing<00:01:27.109> the<00:01:27.259> same<00:01:27.469> dots<00:01:27.740> over<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.219> over

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
killing the same dots over and over

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.219 
killing the same dots over and over
again<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:28.819> there<00:01:29.479> you're<00:01:29.659> just<00:01:29.869> constantly

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
again and there you're just constantly

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.120 
again and there you're just constantly
given<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.770> weapons<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.340> eat<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.579> ghosts<00:01:33.130> like

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
given the weapons to eat the ghosts like

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.980 
given the weapons to eat the ghosts like
that<00:01:34.670> makes<00:01:34.880> no<00:01:35.060> sense<00:01:35.090> why<00:01:35.689> would<00:01:35.869> you

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
that makes no sense why would you

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.529 
that makes no sense why would you
possibly<00:01:36.459> wipes<00:01:37.459> first<00:01:37.819> off<00:01:38.000> why<00:01:38.179> is<00:01:38.209> pac-man

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
possibly wipes first off why is pac-man

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.730 
possibly wipes first off why is pac-man
eating<00:01:39.049> darts<00:01:39.350> when<00:01:40.009> he<00:01:40.100> has<00:01:40.219> fruits<00:01:40.549> around

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
eating darts when he has fruits around

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.959 
eating darts when he has fruits around

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
I'd know what else to say about this

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.580 
I'd know what else to say about this

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
this is like fast pac-man but boring

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.290 
this is like fast pac-man but boring
because<00:02:19.069> it's<00:02:19.340> just<00:02:19.400> like<00:02:19.700> pac-man<00:02:19.940> if<00:02:20.209> you

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
because it's just like pac-man if you

because it's just like pac-man if you
like<00:02:20.450> pac-man<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:21.590> like<00:02:21.800> this<00:02:22.040> didn't<00:02:22.489> like
