00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
advantage to the RAM mount is that you

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.930 
advantage to the RAM mount is that you
can<00:01:25.119> move<00:01:26.119> it<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.420> any<00:01:26.600> angle<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.940> then

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
can move it to any angle and then

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.609 
can move it to any angle and then
tighten<00:01:29.360> it<00:01:29.420> again<00:01:32.080> you<00:01:33.080> can<00:01:33.229> do<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.409> same

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
tighten it again you can do the same

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.370 
tighten it again you can do the same
thing<00:01:33.890> with<00:01:34.040> a<00:01:34.070> flex<00:01:34.460> mount<00:01:34.750> but<00:01:35.750> your<00:01:36.080> footage

is going to be a little bit more shaky
you<00:01:40.009> can<00:01:40.159> see<00:01:41.229> this<00:01:42.229> is<00:01:42.380> pretty<00:01:42.619> tight<00:01:43.899> back

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
another advantage to the RAM mount is

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.920 
another advantage to the RAM mount is
that<00:02:04.250> your<00:02:05.030> footage<00:02:05.480> is<00:02:05.600> going<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:05.840> be<00:02:05.900> a

little less shaky than if you put it on

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.969 
little less shaky than if you put it on
your<00:02:07.700> head<00:02:08.080> put<00:02:09.080> it<00:02:09.140> on<00:02:09.320> your<00:02:09.500> head<00:02:09.649> you're

time you hit a jump this is a little bit

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.680 
time you hit a jump this is a little bit
more<00:02:14.150> secure<00:02:15.640> one<00:02:16.640> word<00:02:16.850> of<00:02:17.000> advice<00:02:17.090> as<00:02:17.570> you

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
more secure one word of advice as you

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.260 
more secure one word of advice as you
set<00:02:17.930> up<00:02:18.050> your<00:02:18.170> RAM<00:02:18.350> mount<00:02:18.560> system<00:02:19.100> I<00:02:19.280> strongly

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
set up your RAM mount system I strongly

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.900 
set up your RAM mount system I strongly
recommend<00:02:20.540> that<00:02:21.020> you<00:02:21.140> do<00:02:21.440> not<00:02:21.740> I<00:02:22.190> repeat<00:02:22.370> do

recommend that you do not I repeat do

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
recommend that you do not I repeat do
not<00:02:23.230> wear<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.440> CPU<00:02:24.920> unit<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.600> then<00:02:26.600> attach

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
not wear the CPU unit and then attach

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.220 
not wear the CPU unit and then attach
your<00:02:27.890> POV<00:02:28.220> unit<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:28.940> RAM<00:02:29.120> mount<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:29.960> the

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
your POV unit to the RAM mount and the

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.150 
your POV unit to the RAM mount and the
reason<00:02:30.560> is<00:02:30.740> is<00:02:31.070> if<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.730> fall<00:02:32.140> then<00:02:33.160> your

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
reason is is if you fall then your

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.380 
reason is is if you fall then your
mountain<00:02:34.459> bikes<00:02:34.610> going<00:02:34.850> to<00:02:34.940> go<00:02:35.120> in<00:02:35.240> one

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
mountain bikes going to go in one

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.030 
mountain bikes going to go in one
direction<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:36.020> you<00:02:36.260> are<00:02:36.440> going<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.770> go<00:02:36.920> in

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
direction and you are going to go in

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.480 
direction and you are going to go in
another<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:38.530> that<00:02:39.530> cord<00:02:40.100> is<00:02:40.160> going<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.370> get

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
another and that cord is going to get

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.640 
another and that cord is going to get
stretched<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:41.060> cause<00:02:41.270> you<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.540> crash<00:02:42.320> even

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
stretched and cause you to crash even

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.370 
stretched and cause you to crash even
worse<00:02:42.860> maybe<00:02:43.790> even<00:02:44.209> possibly<00:02:44.630> ruin<00:02:44.959> your<00:02:45.110> POV

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
worse maybe even possibly ruin your POV

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:53.110 
worse maybe even possibly ruin your POV
and<00:02:48.190> that's<00:02:49.190> why<00:02:49.459> I<00:02:49.820> have<00:02:50.750> my<00:02:51.020> POV<00:02:51.950> inside<00:02:52.850> this

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
and that's why I have my POV inside this

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.100 
and that's why I have my POV inside this
Trek<00:02:53.420> bag<00:02:53.800> it's<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:54.920> twelve<00:02:55.340> dollar<00:02:55.370> bag<00:02:56.110> that

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
Trek bag it's a twelve dollar bag that
