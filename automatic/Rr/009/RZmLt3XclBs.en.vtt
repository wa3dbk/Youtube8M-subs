00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.330
 since 2000 Kant really no one has to close their eyes 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.070
 Things seen news it will be winter until the time has come 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.449
 Seeing and ponds are frozen it will probably take some time hoping 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.949
 Anyway, Andreas Dittmar in Heide is still the old town 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:17.839
 cohesion 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:20.989
 and the best there is the end of the project the ascent 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:24.579
 connecting a shopping spree Daimler Vetter tells you how to do it 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.689
 Liz swiftly gliding over past ice skating is on 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.480
 classic winter black 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.230
 the special thing about this skating rink 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.230
 A few days ago it still looked like this 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Ice skating on the market square in Heide becomes possible 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.280
 Thomas makes fine 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.900
 first step 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.420
 out of 32 heavy loads put together with his team the underground 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.879
 the 46-year-old has been saving his spare since 1997 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.710
 originally wanted to become a theologian 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.909
 with a beer mood 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.210
 started his political career 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.250
 that's why he meant it when he considered Gabriele Stauner what can one do 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.510
 spectacular in a small town on the edge of the Ruhr area 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.210
 said okay 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.220
 the Valais in the marketplace Bohl soloist is as well 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.220
 we have to be ready to recruit customers 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.549
 a laser spirit level ensures that 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.549
 that the plates are absolutely straight 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.870
 The next to some the same specialists with folk songs 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.300
 too often a problem on the last disc 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.590
 she is half a meter too far ahead 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.770
 and this place was actually needed for the cooling technology 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.340
 Heinz Team moss improvise 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.320
 that we just above the ground plants in a little bit late 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.740
 and let stand and then close may 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.300
 for herbs 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.190
 the staff problems continue if the content was where we are now 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.720
 is called brittle and now help explain that is support of 1 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.049
 then a little slope has advised the paper 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.589
 The wooden floor is initially laid over the waterproof film 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:15.409
 on top of that come heavy coolant hoses 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.429
 altogether almost never 10 km 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:21.789
 his very much elaborate work of her most sensitive opened 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:29.249
 there is said Erfurt Rolfes decide the quality of life of many 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:32.049
 later 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.029
 Three cooling units each with 35 kilowatts of power provide the necessary cooling 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.879
 overnight, they lower the temperature of the soil slowly Profen minus 12 degrees 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.879
 from 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:49.259
 the next morning 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:52.929
 gentle drizzle has already carried a very thin layer of ice on the head 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:54.839
 Grow hoses 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:58.139
 the grubby weather makes the work on the ice paradise a bit uncomfortable 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.709
 but also easier 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:08.599
 that's one thing that really tastes he's never even the speaker raining and raining 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.199
 This creates the ice surface as if by itself 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:12.209
 since waived 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.189
 $ Beginning to contract 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.440
 or there a strong crowd like that 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.640
 puts a ball then that would all that the people has replicated 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.019
 actually dare to go again 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.559
 the weather stays stable 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:25.530
 but suddenly 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.530
 fails one of the cooling units 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:33.409
 small problem in heath since Peter Wiedemeier 100er glued together 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.009
 the world is accumulating all the time now i arrive and sell one 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:42.319
 for many, there seems to be somewhere in the next to the device 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.969
 Thomas Hein tries by all means 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:47.969
 to get the stubby machine going again 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.169
 in vain 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.010
 So I can not do the damage myself 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.800
 the service technician is not sustainable anymore Altintop was with two 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.029
 Weapons made it easy for them to continue as author Walter 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:06.509
 and indeed 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:09.760
 by no millimeter per hour does the ice grow more and more 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.899
 so wear slowly 

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:13.140
 if it does not rain 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.140
 the water comes from a fire hose 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:20.180
 after three days the time has come 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.180
 the ice cream is thick enough a trial run 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.520
 Thomas Hein prefers to leave this test to others 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:36.319
 dapd for a reason I can not skate 

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:39.449
 and want to be 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.060
 If I want to build a rink in the winter I would like to try and in the summer 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:46.550
 but nobody knows so I stay on my shoes 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.849
 for all who can run fast 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.830
 The ice rink on the Christmas market is just around the corner 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.819
 Open Christmas Eve
