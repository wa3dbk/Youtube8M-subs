00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.289 
coaches and we said like you got it
toughen<00:03:30.890> up<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.250> just<00:03:31.670> play<00:03:31.849> bass<00:03:32.060> defense

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
toughen up and just play bass defense

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.449 
toughen up and just play bass defense
against<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.870> run<00:03:33.049> and<00:03:33.230> I<00:03:33.680> started<00:03:34.220> playing<00:03:34.340> a

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
against the run and I started playing a

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.789 
against the run and I started playing a
little<00:03:34.549> more<00:03:34.790> this<00:03:35.450> lab<00:03:35.659> you<00:03:36.079> know<00:03:36.379> do<00:03:36.620> your

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
little more this lab you know do your

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.699 
little more this lab you know do your
111<00:03:37.400> and<00:03:37.720> you<00:03:38.720> know<00:03:38.810> you<00:03:38.900> don't<00:03:39.319> try<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.530> do

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
111 and you know you don't try to do

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.199 
111 and you know you don't try to do
other<00:03:39.859> people's<00:03:40.190> job<00:03:40.430> just<00:03:40.700> take<00:03:40.849> care<00:03:41.090> of

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
other people's job just take care of

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.000 
other people's job just take care of
your<00:03:41.299> own<00:03:41.329> you<00:03:41.870> know<00:03:41.989> it<00:03:42.200> plays<00:03:42.409> the<00:03:42.440> unit<00:03:42.889> and

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
your own you know it plays the unit and

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.649 
your own you know it plays the unit and
I<00:03:43.310> think<00:03:43.790> we<00:03:43.879> did<00:03:43.970> that<00:03:44.030> for<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.359> most<00:03:44.510> part

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
I think we did that for the most part

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.080 
I think we did that for the most part
today<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.260> so<00:03:46.220> I<00:03:46.250> would<00:03:46.459> I'm<00:03:46.819> not<00:03:47.030> sure

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
today and so I would I'm not sure

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.520 
today and so I would I'm not sure
exactly<00:03:47.659> how<00:03:47.780> many<00:03:47.840> yards<00:03:48.049> they<00:03:48.200> had<00:03:48.349> but<00:03:48.500> I

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
exactly how many yards they had but I

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.589 
exactly how many yards they had but I
think<00:03:48.769> we<00:03:48.859> stopped<00:03:49.760> them<00:03:49.940> pretty<00:03:50.120> shutting

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
think we stopped them pretty shutting

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.479 
think we stopped them pretty shutting
down<00:03:50.689> pretty<00:03:50.989> well<00:03:51.109> I<00:03:51.439> think<00:03:51.680> it's<00:03:52.010> our<00:03:52.159> d-line

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
down pretty well I think it's our d-line

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.479 
down pretty well I think it's our d-line
linebackers<00:03:53.239> like<00:03:53.389> every<00:03:53.780> week<00:03:53.959> they<00:03:54.200> just

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
linebackers like every week they just

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.009 
linebackers like every week they just
get<00:03:55.489> into<00:03:55.639> the<00:03:55.700> ball<00:03:55.849> we're<00:03:56.209> all<00:03:56.389> everyone

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
get into the ball we're all everyone

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.330 
get into the ball we're all everyone
else<00:03:57.109> is<00:03:57.200> just<00:03:57.260> rallying<00:03:57.769> to<00:03:57.829> the<00:03:57.889> ball<00:03:58.069> so

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
else is just rallying to the ball so

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.800 
else is just rallying to the ball so
whenever<00:03:58.970> they<00:03:59.090> stepped<00:03:59.329> on<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.540> run<00:03:59.689> you

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
whenever they stepped on the run you

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.539 
whenever they stepped on the run you
know<00:04:00.019> that<00:04:00.530> pass<00:04:00.709> is<00:04:00.829> coming<00:04:01.129> sooner<00:04:01.370> up<00:04:01.459> to

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
know that pass is coming sooner up to

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.190 
know that pass is coming sooner up to
repress<00:04:01.909> to<00:04:02.060> run<00:04:02.209> as<00:04:02.329> much<00:04:02.510> and<00:04:02.780> you<00:04:02.870> can<00:04:03.019> just

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
repress to run as much and you can just

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.199 
repress to run as much and you can just
start<00:04:03.859> back<00:04:04.069> though<00:04:04.280> instead<00:04:04.639> of<00:04:04.700> bouncing

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
start back though instead of bouncing

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.270 
start back though instead of bouncing
and<00:04:05.299> reading<00:04:05.629> so<00:04:05.870> it's<00:04:06.139> easier<00:04:06.470> it's<00:04:07.099> nice

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
and reading so it's easier it's nice

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.619 
and reading so it's easier it's nice
when<00:04:07.430> they<00:04:07.519> get<00:04:07.609> back<00:04:07.730> up<00:04:07.939> into<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.180> corner<00:04:08.450> net

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
when they get back up into a corner net

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.390 
when they get back up into a corner net

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
the pump from their own end zone defense

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.979 
the pump from their own end zone defense
does<00:04:10.549> it<00:04:10.699> a<00:04:10.760> lot<00:04:10.790> and<00:04:10.910> easy<00:04:11.540> to<00:04:11.629> be<00:04:11.750> get<00:04:11.870> big

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
does it a lot and easy to be get big

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.170 
does it a lot and easy to be get big
