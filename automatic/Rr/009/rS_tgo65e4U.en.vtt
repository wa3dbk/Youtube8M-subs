okay it's gonna give me a quick
run-through<00:00:02.340> of<00:00:02.580> what<00:00:02.700> the<00:00:02.879> controls<00:00:03.149> are

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
run-through of what the controls are

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.930 
run-through of what the controls are
here<00:00:03.560> clean<00:00:04.560> there's<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.220> bright<00:00:05.400> switch<00:00:05.609> it's

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
here clean there's a bright switch it's

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.870 
here clean there's a bright switch it's
in<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.240> there's<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.990> low<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.290> high<00:00:07.880> input

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
in the there's the low and high input

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.000 
in the there's the low and high input
and<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.599> high<00:00:09.780> seems<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.320> be<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.469> bit<00:00:10.590> brighter

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
and the high seems to be a bit brighter

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.240 
and the high seems to be a bit brighter
salmon<00:00:11.370> can<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.360> valium<00:00:12.799> overdrive<00:00:13.799> control

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
salmon can you valium overdrive control

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.970 
salmon can you valium overdrive control
so<00:00:14.490> drive<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.330> drive<00:00:15.660> volume<00:00:16.139> that's<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
so drive and drive volume that's the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.250 
so drive and drive volume that's the
switch<00:00:17.160> for<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.400> drive<00:00:17.609> channel<00:00:18.180> baseman<00:00:19.109> in

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
switch for the drive channel baseman in

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.640 
switch for the drive channel baseman in
treble<00:00:19.550> reverb<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.789> tone<00:00:21.510> tone<00:00:22.289> kind<00:00:22.529> of

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
treble reverb and tone tone kind of

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.730 
treble reverb and tone tone kind of
works<00:00:22.800> like<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.980> treble<00:00:23.430> roll-off<00:00:23.880> more<00:00:24.210> sorts

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
works like a treble roll-off more sorts

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.290 
works like a treble roll-off more sorts
like<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:26.460> seems<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.760> be<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.939> when<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:27.150> all

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
like it seems to be the when it's all

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.910 
like it seems to be the when it's all
the<00:00:27.330> way<00:00:27.390> up<00:00:27.510> it's<00:00:27.810> kind<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.140> bypassed

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the way up it's kind of bypassed

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.099 
the way up it's kind of bypassed
essentially<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.550> then<00:00:29.670> rolls<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.630> treble

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
essentially and then rolls the treble

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.319 
essentially and then rolls the treble
off<00:00:31.260> as<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.890> roll<00:00:32.040> down

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
off as you roll down

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.370 
off as you roll down
Ronin<00:00:33.329> standby<00:00:33.690> switch<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> power

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
Ronin standby switch and the power

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.389 
Ronin standby switch and the power
switch<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.770> back<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.820> just<00:00:35.969> wanna<00:00:37.399> give

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
switch in the back so I just wanna give

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.209 
switch in the back so I just wanna give
you<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.550> quick<00:00:38.820> run<00:00:39.030> through<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> few<00:00:39.360> sounds<00:00:40.219> so

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
you a quick run through a few sounds so

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.150 
you a quick run through a few sounds so
volumes<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.090> about<00:00:42.690> two<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> half<00:00:43.160> using

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
volumes on about two and a half using

00:00:44.160 --> 00:01:01.220 
volumes on about two and a half using
Telecaster<00:00:46.940> I<00:00:59.300> found<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.480> bright<00:01:00.719> switch<00:01:00.989> on

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
Telecaster I found the bright switch on

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.070 
Telecaster I found the bright switch on
seems<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.920> really<00:01:02.600> bring<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.660> bit<00:01:03.809> more<00:01:03.930> life

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
seems to really bring a bit more life

00:01:04.080 --> 00:02:24.309 
seems to really bring a bit more life
into<00:01:04.290> them

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.020 

the<00:02:25.319> reverb<00:02:25.620> annoys<00:02:26.069> even<00:02:26.340> as<00:02:26.459> you<00:02:26.550> get<00:02:26.700> pasta

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
the reverb annoys even as you get pasta

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:41.390 
the reverb annoys even as you get pasta
tube<00:02:27.480> driven<00:02:27.750> reverb<00:02:30.620> 5<00:02:31.620> or<00:02:31.770> 6<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:40.400> really

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
tube driven reverb 5 or 6 it really

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.150 
tube driven reverb 5 or 6 it really
kicks<00:02:41.580> in<00:02:41.730> straightaway

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.520 

you

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:56.059 

you

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.759 

is<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.299> it<00:02:57.719> seems<00:02:57.959> one<00:02:58.109> I<00:02:58.140> guess<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.409> tan<00:02:58.620> as

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
is that it seems one I guess to tan as

00:02:58.769 --> 00:02:59.989 
is that it seems one I guess to tan as
well<00:02:58.799> there's<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.040> bit<00:02:59.159> of<00:02:59.189> like<00:02:59.519> a<00:02:59.549> small

00:02:59.989 --> 00:02:59.999 
well there's a bit of like a small

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:09.559 
well there's a bit of like a small
volume<00:03:05.840> it's<00:03:06.840> really<00:03:07.170> activating<00:03:08.209> I<00:03:09.209> kind<00:03:09.540> of

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
volume it's really activating I kind of

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:17.990 
volume it's really activating I kind of
leaving<00:03:09.749> it<00:03:09.840> up<00:03:09.959> there<00:03:10.969> you<00:03:11.969> see<00:03:15.290> base<00:03:17.000> okay

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
leaving it up there you see base okay

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.149 
leaving it up there you see base okay
I've<00:03:18.180> still<00:03:18.329> got<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.480> few<00:03:18.540> petals<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:19.079> have

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.540 
peddle zero and I put the delays on
along<00:04:30.280> today<00:04:31.770> kind<00:04:32.770> of<00:04:32.830> a<00:04:32.920> sure<00:04:33.070> slap<00:04:33.340> back

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550
