to<00:01:27.159> go<00:01:27.280> with<00:01:27.399> this<00:01:27.579> because<00:01:27.969> it's<00:01:28.179> a<00:01:28.270> classic

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569

because hashtag the classics for the win
and<00:01:31.359> I<00:01:31.960> just<00:01:32.229> find<00:01:32.409> it<00:01:32.530> easier<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:32.829> kill<00:01:33.039> with

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
and I just find it easier to kill with

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.980 
and I just find it easier to kill with
this<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.579> battle<00:01:33.729> rifle<00:01:33.939> has<00:01:34.209> lots<00:01:34.450> of<00:01:34.569> recoil

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
this the battle rifle has lots of recoil

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.989 
this the battle rifle has lots of recoil
and<00:01:35.200> takes<00:01:35.499> forever<00:01:35.709> to<00:01:35.859> reload<00:01:36.249> but<00:01:36.729> I<00:01:36.759> just

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:36.999 
and takes forever to reload but I just

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:38.819 
and takes forever to reload but I just
find<00:01:37.119> it<00:01:37.299> better<00:01:37.450> than<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.689> DMR<00:01:38.020> I<00:01:38.289> use<00:01:38.709> the

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
find it better than the DMR I use the

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:40.649 
find it better than the DMR I use the
DMR<00:01:39.189> and<00:01:39.399> it<00:01:39.459> feels<00:01:39.670> pretty<00:01:39.880> clunky<00:01:40.179> to<00:01:40.389> me<00:01:40.479> for

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
DMR and it feels pretty clunky to me for

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.749 
DMR and it feels pretty clunky to me for
some<00:01:40.810> reason<00:01:40.840> that<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:42.069> I<00:01:42.189> like<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:42.549> square

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
some reason that and I like the square

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.309 
some reason that and I like the square
zoom<00:01:43.030> on<00:01:43.179> battle<00:01:43.450> rifles<00:01:43.719> because<00:01:43.840> I<00:01:43.990> can<00:01:44.139> see

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
zoom on battle rifles because I can see

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.050 
zoom on battle rifles because I can see
more<00:01:44.469> enemies<00:01:44.799> with<00:01:44.950> it<00:01:45.100> than<00:01:45.219> the<00:01:45.310> DMR<00:01:45.639> circle

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
more enemies with it than the DMR circle
