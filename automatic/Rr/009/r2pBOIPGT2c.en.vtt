00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.639
 3 weeks and sick that bad 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.710
 they do not go twice I get sick like that 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.929
 in the year but one thing I can do 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.080
 say the past almost two weeks without 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.970
 sleep for the flu yucca and one of the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.140
 most exasperating things that exist is 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.320
 be sick on the night of last night one 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.880
 not to sleep two try at night three 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.670
 Nobody was sleeping in your house 4 happened put 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.290
 the next day to be from May to the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.570
 night is one thing that can be given to you and not 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.090
 they'll let you sleep in the night 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.510
 Stomach pain not a toothache 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.579
 but undoubtedly gold medal for 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.000
 train and make you impossible in the 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.000
 night 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:59.550
 flu and it's even worse when they give me 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.990
 it is always totally exasperating to be 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.990
 all night of the style 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.880
 or else wake up in the middle of the night 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:22.409
 that you do not stop both the girls 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:25.319
 he spends his night shouting very much in death 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.319
 I've spent a week with fever that 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:30.750
 It gives you heat that gives you cold and data that 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:36.140
 they are doubts that you get a fever that takes away 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.140
 the fever of this planet 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.599
 the heat but we have had fever not 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.159
 we have fan power and it forces me 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.859
 they are forcing all the holy day 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.240
 being sick I told myself I 'm going to 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:55.890
 stay in the house I will have the 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.530
 opportunity of the movies that I have not 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.289
 seen if you fall asleep in the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.270
 first 15 minutes and the worst when 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.789
 you can not stand the flu sugar you make 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.950
 go to spend consultation where a doctor and 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.140
 obviously there are two ways we pensÃ¡s 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.849
 only consultations with that and I cured myself 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.730
 look to ask doctor's questions is 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.950
 all a torture and everything starts from 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.269
 that comes to spend consultation and they tell you 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.790
 that you have to stop doctor because 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.719
 obviously it's busy past 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.719
 all the style 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.050
 sitting in the doctor's office 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.350
 Doctor felt that by going to happen 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.350
 all 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.780
 you can not always save all 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.459
 patients in half the consultation of the 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.709
 Doctor tells you that he is going to have to give you 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.080
 some treatment and when the doctor 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.580
 say do not worry this 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.580
 procedure does not hurt 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.180
 he says something to you as if I have to 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.050
 procedure that we are going to make you hurt 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.390
 I'm going to die better with the flu 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.700
 definitely one of the worst things 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.800
 what can happen to you but since a week 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.380
 I was with the flu I discovered something that was not 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.310
 I knew and it was how to do to get us 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.310
 the fight 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.650
 I did not know until now I realized and 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.230
 if any of you did not know it, 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.680
 I'm going to tell you a shit out of the 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.680
 court 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.150
 23 years and until today 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.400
 I hope you liked having no 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.470
 comment they met another disease and 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.520
 They are mad for you 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.760
 definitely when I have the flu 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.010
