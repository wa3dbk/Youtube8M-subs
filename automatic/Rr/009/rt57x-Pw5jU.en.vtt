problem there and that doesn't that
that's<00:03:39.410> that's<00:03:39.680> quite<00:03:39.860> an<00:03:40.040> interesting<00:03:40.160> bit

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
that's that's quite an interesting bit

three itself that gorgeous v12 had
brought<00:03:47.600> in<00:03:47.870> well<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:49.130> funny<00:03:49.370> thing<00:03:49.670> is<00:03:49.700> is

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
brought in well the funny thing is is

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.560 
brought in well the funny thing is is
that<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.840> series<00:03:51.110> one<00:03:51.760> with<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:52.910> 3.8

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
that the the series one with the 3.8

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.680 
that the the series one with the 3.8
liter<00:03:53.890> had<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.070> higher<00:03:55.280> top<00:03:55.700> speed<00:03:56.060> but

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
liter had the higher top speed but

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.780 
liter had the higher top speed but
that's<00:03:56.870> not<00:03:57.050> the<00:03:57.200> idea<00:03:57.560> with<00:03:57.800> the<00:03:57.980> 12<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.610> 12

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
that's not the idea with the 12 the 12

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.360 
that's not the idea with the 12 the 12
cylinder<00:03:59.420> engine<00:03:59.780> is<00:03:59.930> effortless<00:04:00.440> power<00:04:00.980> and

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
cylinder engine is effortless power and

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.710 
cylinder engine is effortless power and
I<00:04:02.300> must<00:04:02.690> say<00:04:02.960> I've<00:04:03.470> been<00:04:04.040> behind<00:04:04.490> a<00:04:04.760> v12<00:04:05.210> series

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
I must say I've been behind a v12 series

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.870 
I must say I've been behind a v12 series
three<00:04:06.020> Jaguar<00:04:06.620> and<00:04:06.770> that<00:04:07.040> rumble<00:04:07.700> of<00:04:07.820> the

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
three Jaguar and that rumble of the

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.060 
three Jaguar and that rumble of the
engine<00:04:08.030> there's<00:04:08.959> nothing<00:04:09.560> like<00:04:09.770> it

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
engine there's nothing like it

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.270 
engine there's nothing like it
and<00:04:10.570> in<00:04:11.570> my<00:04:12.080> opinion<00:04:12.260> there<00:04:12.800> I<00:04:12.830> think<00:04:13.190> the

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
and in my opinion there I think the

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.870 
and in my opinion there I think the
series<00:04:13.670> 3<00:04:14.030> was<00:04:14.780> a<00:04:14.860> great<00:04:15.860> end<00:04:16.160> to<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.580> the

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
series 3 was a great end to the the

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.789 
series 3 was a great end to the the
e-type<00:04:17.330> dynasty<00:04:18.049> and<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.989> series<00:04:21.470> 3

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
e-type dynasty and the the series 3

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.220 
e-type dynasty and the the series 3
roadster<00:04:22.310> is<00:04:22.490> a<00:04:22.520> very<00:04:23.030> desirable<00:04:23.479> car

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
roadster is a very desirable car

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.770
