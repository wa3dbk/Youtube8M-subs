00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.610
This ice cream has been sitting out for several
hours so it is soft and runny.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:29.050
And we are going to pour the ice cream on
the Glock and put the Glock in the freezer.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:59.000
There we go.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.170
Ice Cream Glock.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.510
Check that shit out.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.510
MMMM.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.510
Tasty.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.230
Yeah, there's a Glock in there.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:18.650
See the recoil spring, frame, front and rear
sights.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.740
Here's our barrel.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.770
Same barrel.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.970
Not a trick barrel.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.820
ON the right out here we got a little bit
of

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.950
melt action.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.149
I'm confident in this one.

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:40.990
This ice cream is pretty soft.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.060
It's melting.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.299
What's that.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.939
Recoil spring.

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:06.880
There's our slide.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:19.590
I'm a 
little bit distracted.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:27.670
There's some operators in the area in a helicopter.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:35.950
There's the slide assembled.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:57.750
Let's do it this way.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:11.549
Oh yeah.

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:25.360
Ah yeah.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:47.040
Get our protective shield on.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:04:00.799
Syran wrap.

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.629
Gun operates fine.

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.829
Awesome.

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:06.829
Ice cream.

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:13.050
You can operate in an ice cream environment.
