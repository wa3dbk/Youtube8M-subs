pretty<00:00:33.750> well<00:00:33.989> especially<00:00:34.800> an<00:00:35.160> attack<00:00:35.489> what<00:00:35.940> is

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
pretty well especially an attack what is

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.970 
pretty well especially an attack what is

talented<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.710> know<00:00:49.739> they<00:00:49.890> get<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> ball

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
talented you know they get on the ball

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.220 
talented you know they get on the ball

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
they don't really hold their position

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.709 
they don't really hold their position
too<00:00:52.410> much<00:00:52.649> which<00:00:52.920> creates<00:00:53.420> problems<00:00:54.420> or<00:00:54.539> left

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
too much which creates problems or left

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.270 
too much which creates problems or left
where<00:00:54.840> comes<00:00:55.440> inside<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.890> right<00:00:56.039> winger

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
where comes inside the right winger

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.729 
where comes inside the right winger
comes<00:00:56.489> inside<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.059> know<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:58.140> causes<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.530> little

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
comes inside you know it causes a little

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.939 
comes inside you know it causes a little
bit<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.920> chaos<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.699> they're<00:00:59.820> so<00:00:59.940> talented<00:01:00.180> so

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
bit of chaos and they're so talented so

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.160 
bit of chaos and they're so talented so
and<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.010> will<00:01:02.160> have<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.340> have<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> good<00:01:02.699> base

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
and I will have to have a good base

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.539 
and I will have to have a good base
start<00:01:04.170> starting<00:01:04.530> base<00:01:04.710> defensively<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:05.489> I

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
start starting base defensively but I

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.980 
start starting base defensively but I
also<00:01:05.670> think<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.150> do<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> better<00:01:06.479> job<00:01:06.540> of

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
also think we can do a better job of

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.880 
also think we can do a better job of
pressing<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.010> ball<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.520> situations<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
pressing the ball and situations and and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.859 
pressing the ball and situations and and
recognizing<00:01:11.150> what<00:01:12.150> those<00:01:12.330> triggers<00:01:12.510> are

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
recognizing what those triggers are

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:13.940 
recognizing what those triggers are
because<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.200> can't<00:01:13.350> press<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.619> whole<00:01:13.740> game

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
because you can't press the whole game

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.080 
because you can't press the whole game
but<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.220> also<00:01:14.340> can't<00:01:14.549> sit<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> whole<00:01:14.970> game

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
but you also can't sit in the whole game

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.120 
but you also can't sit in the whole game
so<00:01:15.360> no<00:01:15.840> there's<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.380> little<00:01:16.470> bit<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.770> balance

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
so no there's a little bit of a balance

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.350 
so no there's a little bit of a balance
and<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.280> think<00:01:17.460> against<00:01:17.820> Germany<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:18.270> could

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and I think against Germany we could

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.510 
and I think against Germany we could
probably<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.689> gotten<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.860> right<00:01:20.100> so

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
probably have gotten that that right so

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.289 
probably have gotten that that right so
we'll<00:01:20.970> try<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.180> do<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:22.790> team<00:01:23.790> hello<00:01:24.119> I'm

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
we'll try and do that team hello I'm

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.940 
we'll try and do that team hello I'm
from<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.600> Belgian<00:01:24.869> press<00:01:25.259> I'm<00:01:25.560> here

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.260 
from the Belgian press I'm here
did<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.850> err<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.259> Romelu<00:01:28.259> Lukaku<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.860> a

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
did you err that Romelu Lukaku is a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.020 
did you err that Romelu Lukaku is a
difficult<00:01:30.350> tournament<00:01:31.350> until<00:01:31.619> today<00:01:32.490> did<00:01:32.909> you

brilliant for us at Everton he went

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.469 
brilliant for us at Everton he went
through<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:49.259> spell<00:01:49.950> at<00:01:50.100> one<00:01:50.250> point<00:01:50.460> where<00:01:50.729> he

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
through a spell at one point where he

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.789 
through a spell at one point where he
wasn't<00:01:51.750> scoring<00:01:52.079> every<00:01:52.320> game<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.619> then<00:01:52.710> all

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
of a sudden he called fire again so I

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.289 
of a sudden he called fire again so I
wouldn't<00:01:56.219> read<00:01:56.369> too<00:01:56.399> much<00:01:56.670> into<00:01:56.880> that

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.569

team's approach the game change when you

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.749 
team's approach the game change when you
know<00:02:07.990> that<00:02:08.170> one<00:02:08.379> two<00:02:08.800> mistakes<00:02:09.190> can<00:02:09.519> be<00:02:09.550> the

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
know that one two mistakes can be the

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.100 
know that one two mistakes can be the
difference<00:02:09.879> I<00:02:10.179> mean<00:02:10.330> does<00:02:10.509> it<00:02:10.629> does<00:02:10.840> it<00:02:10.869> make

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
difference I mean does it does it make

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.600 
difference I mean does it does it make
for<00:02:11.349> a<00:02:11.379> more<00:02:11.560> cautious<00:02:11.769> game<00:02:12.129> in<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.340> knockout

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
for a more cautious game in the knockout

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.670 
for a more cautious game in the knockout
round<00:02:12.819> of<00:02:12.940> teams<00:02:13.150> play<00:02:13.810> more<00:02:14.050> carefully<00:02:14.260> will

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
round of teams play more carefully will

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.259 
round of teams play more carefully will
you<00:02:14.800> guys<00:02:14.980> play<00:02:15.220> more<00:02:15.400> carefully<00:02:15.519> no<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.120> don't

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
you guys play more carefully no I don't

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.520 
you guys play more carefully no I don't
think<00:02:16.300> so<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.569> think<00:02:16.660> this<00:02:16.840> should<00:02:17.050> be<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.290> better

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
think so I think this should be a better

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.300 
think so I think this should be a better
game

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
game

you know the Germany game had a lot of

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.680 
you know the Germany game had a lot of
different<00:02:21.489> scenarios<00:02:21.640> right<00:02:22.120> like<00:02:22.420> what

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
different scenarios right like what

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.089

lose how many can we lose by if we win
we<00:02:25.690> go<00:02:25.810> through<00:02:26.200> his<00:02:26.319> group<00:02:26.470> winners<00:02:26.739> where<00:02:27.489> as

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
we go through his group winners where as

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.339 
we go through his group winners where as
I<00:02:27.790> mentioned<00:02:28.360> us<00:02:28.450> after<00:02:28.629> the<00:02:28.720> game<00:02:28.750> the

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
I mentioned us after the game the

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.570 
I mentioned us after the game the
Belgium<00:02:29.680> game<00:02:29.830> there's<00:02:30.010> only<00:02:30.099> one<00:02:30.250> result

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
Belgium game there's only one result

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.460 
Belgium game there's only one result
that<00:02:30.760> matters<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.239> know<00:02:31.330> there's<00:02:31.569> nothing

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
that matters you know there's nothing

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.830 
that matters you know there's nothing
else<00:02:32.650> so<00:02:32.950> well<00:02:33.519> I<00:02:33.700> mean<00:02:33.880> hopefully<00:02:34.420> we<00:02:34.690> don't

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
else so well I mean hopefully we don't

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.330 
else so well I mean hopefully we don't
play<00:02:35.019> too<00:02:35.079> tight<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:35.709> know<00:02:35.829> the<00:02:35.950> moment

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
play too tight and you know the moment

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.759 
play too tight and you know the moment
and<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.579> enormity<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.470> situations<00:02:38.470> sometimes

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
and the enormity of situations sometimes

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.710 
and the enormity of situations sometimes
puts<00:02:39.579> a<00:02:39.610> lot<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:39.730> pressure<00:02:39.880> on<00:02:40.090> players<00:02:40.390> and

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
puts a lot of pressure on players and

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.509 
puts a lot of pressure on players and
just<00:02:40.930> depends<00:02:41.769> how<00:02:41.799> we<00:02:41.890> handle<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.370> but<00:02:42.459> I

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
just depends how we handle it but I

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.420 
just depends how we handle it but I
think<00:02:42.790> we<00:02:42.910> we've<00:02:43.239> been<00:02:43.420> really<00:02:43.569> loose<00:02:43.870> and

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
think we we've been really loose and

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.740 
think we we've been really loose and
enjoyed<00:02:45.430> our<00:02:45.579> training<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.120> around<00:02:46.690> the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
enjoyed our training and around the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.830 
enjoyed our training and around the
hotel<00:02:46.900> things<00:02:47.380> have<00:02:47.590> been<00:02:48.480> not<00:02:49.480> too<00:02:49.690> uptight

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
hotel things have been not too uptight

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.690 
hotel things have been not too uptight
so<00:02:50.349> I<00:02:50.380> think<00:02:50.620> we'll<00:02:51.040> be<00:02:51.130> able<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.310> handle<00:02:51.549> the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
so I think we'll be able to handle the

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.050 
so I think we'll be able to handle the
pressure

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
pressure

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.809 
pressure
oh<00:02:52.150> listen<00:02:55.079> mistakes<00:02:56.079> in<00:02:56.829> soccer<00:02:57.130> there's<00:02:57.760> a

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
oh listen mistakes in soccer there's a

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.190 
oh listen mistakes in soccer there's a

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
mistake every couple minutes you know

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.550 
mistake every couple minutes you know
depending<00:03:00.040> on<00:03:00.129> how<00:03:00.250> you<00:03:00.310> look<00:03:00.519> at<00:03:00.640> it<00:03:00.670> so

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
depending on how you look at it so

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.960 
depending on how you look at it so
hopefully<00:03:02.560> we'll<00:03:02.680> be<00:03:02.829> prepared<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.700> there

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
hopefully we'll be prepared and there

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.240 
hopefully we'll be prepared and there
and<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.480> moment<00:03:04.660> won't<00:03:04.870> be<00:03:05.019> too<00:03:05.200> big<00:03:05.319> for<00:03:05.350> us

becoming<00:04:04.569> fullbacks<00:04:04.900> I<00:04:05.049> just<00:04:05.260> think<00:04:05.410> it's<00:04:05.680> a

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
becoming fullbacks I just think it's a

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.819 
becoming fullbacks I just think it's a
natural<00:04:06.160> progression<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:07.720> once<00:04:08.109> he<00:04:08.290> you<00:04:08.739> know

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
natural progression and once he you know

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.499 
natural progression and once he you know
I<00:04:08.859> think<00:04:09.010> he<00:04:09.160> at<00:04:09.579> the<00:04:09.729> beginning<00:04:10.030> he<00:04:10.180> wasn't

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:10.509 
I think he at the beginning he wasn't

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:12.719 
I think he at the beginning he wasn't
overjoyed<00:04:11.410> by<00:04:11.590> it<00:04:11.650> but<00:04:12.100> you<00:04:12.370> know<00:04:12.430> once<00:04:12.639> he

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:12.729 
overjoyed by it but you know once he

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:13.980 
overjoyed by it but you know once he
grasped<00:04:13.120> it<00:04:13.329> he<00:04:13.419> was

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
grasped it he was

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.620 
grasped it he was
brilliant<00:04:14.410> I<00:04:14.500> really<00:04:14.860> think<00:04:15.070> he's<00:04:15.220> been

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.030 
brilliant I really think he's been
fantastic<00:04:16.630> and<00:04:17.230> we<00:04:17.320> tease<00:04:17.500> him<00:04:17.650> about<00:04:17.680> being
