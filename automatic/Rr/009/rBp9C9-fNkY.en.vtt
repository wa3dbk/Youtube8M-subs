00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:38.570
 we have here million of anta this is 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.030
 like a drop so it expands but it's 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.940
 an effect also very pleasant and therefore 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.890
 the best effects come in this 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.900
 case we have the crystal effect that 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.430
 also that is a very very effect 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.810
 flashy ok 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.960
 Well, here we have what is the 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.320
 crystal effect if they realize 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.540
 it's a very very nice effect that 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.490
 I also know that they will like it and so 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.430
 finally we have the effect of 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.520
 particles that this is the effect 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.070
 that has been added to this update 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.710
 Well, if we have and they realize we have 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:16.670
 the particle effect that is therefore a 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:19.970
 effect very very very very very nice since 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.710

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.250
 nice that in this case they are 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.830
 particles that are created is I'm 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.770
 I decide what is the screen of the lg 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.320
 optimus but we can also add 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.210
 like the accesses to shortcuts here 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.190
 in the bottom where telcel says 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.200
 at the bottom it 's a matter of which 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.480
 your 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.640
 check it in and do not move 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.260
 to your tastes but good this application 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.230
