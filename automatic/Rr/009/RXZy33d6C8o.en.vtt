00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.810
 info 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:33.820
 a at the web 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.960
 tee 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:46.649
 It is Yasutaka Gomi of so much Hello motor journalist 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:53.010
 This is a new type of Harrier for this car 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:57.300
 In understanding this car, cars are just like anything but to some extent we know history 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:01.570
 I think that I would like to reconsider this for a while as I can understand it more deeply 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:06.310
 Especially this Harrier has a very deep history 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:10.660
 It has a great influence on the car society in the world 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:15.430
 Is such suv through the true concrete jungle even though mountain road I know another 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:18.340
 Running wasn't quite in our time, but at the beginning such a car runs 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.560
 I like running somewhere out of place 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.890
 Just like that, for example, a luxury hotel 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:30.409
 I even had such an impression that I would go somewhere on earth 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:33.730
 It is there to cast a rock but is it was a car called the Harrier it luxury sedan 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:39.160
 A certain meaning suv This kind of car 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:45.190
 It can be said that we pioneered such a genre called crossover called fusion 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:50.290
 Do not double it, it will be more in the last few years, including foreigners 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:56.650
 On the other the truth I think we have popular I car Tokkakari 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:02:00.399
 The future appeared in the year 1997 and that time is also true that those who were vomited 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.310
 So we hit the whether or not I do not know so say the market is not known whether there really 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:07.270
 It might have been a model of grooving 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.160
 It was because I knew that there was a market for the second generation 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:14.990
 It was attacked and there was a school there 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.770
 Hi-Hybrid High Power Hybrid This model has also been introduced 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.020
 is 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:25.400
 Though it is this new Harrier of the third generation that came out after ten years 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:30.180
 There are three keywords, one is high-grade 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:35.129
 There is this too Harrier seems to be fused with such a high-end sedan 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.439
 After all, luxury cars also look at whether the cross-over is by it because this design on, including 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:42.840
 It is powerful for 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:45.480
 I think the importance of a sense of presence voice That kind of appearance just a little different from others 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.290
 The atmosphere is also exhilarating 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:56.310
 And further evolution is also a keyword 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:59.460
 More specifically, the car size may be smaller and the car may be smaller. 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.390
 Is also easy to handle 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.350
 So I've made the downsizing body a bit easier to handle 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:13.300
 Is the point and 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:17.590
 New This is It is the third last of the key word this is a variety of safety using the now state-of-the-art 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:22.890
 Many of Toyota's first devices that contain devices 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.890
 I think that I want to explain in detail from now on 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:31.300
 How is it that meat model Elegance? 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:36.820
 In terms of grade, it is the second from the bottom 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.630
 It is this No. 1 fabric even if it sees this sheet, but also stitch is included in it 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.860
 I know 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.130
 This kind of dashboard also has blood in it , so it's also very good. 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.410
 Upscale 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:54.200
 Furthermore, per this kind of center console in calms down and riding it is you I float 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:04:01.670
 There is more luster than black like this, and after all this is a little gorgeous feeling 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:03.120
 Even if there is even a high grade this back monitor looks at the car from above 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:08.670
 Panoramic 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.450
 It will be called a view monitor Let us know that people and natural cars have come from the left and right 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:15.239
 Give me 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:20.790
 Such player technology of right and left confirmation support is also attached, say more on the basis 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:23.110
 If even in long does not touch or it is also this was the bodyｰｰｰｰ touched by this electrostatic was knowledge 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.970
 It's a pit reaction. 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:31.120
 Also say that the operability is good 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:36.940
 There are many other new equipment that can be called high class, for example, an arm 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.840
 Depending on the grade when opening the rest, it can be charged simply by placing the mobile phone . 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.900
 Charge only 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.169
 These are also attached 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:48.850
 The body is referred to in the full width and 10mm 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:52.539
 It became short, but the room has expanded to the contrary 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:58.930
 This makes it possible for these eight people to ride comfortably 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:05:00.289
 Practicality of per saying, it also also equipped with comfort just luxury to appropriate all of the 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.500
 Element is 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:10.440
 It can be said that this room is also clogged 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:12.000
 At first it opens electrically by one touch, but this is actually the second generation Harrier hybrid north 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.030
 Though I had it 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.620
 This It was a great sensational at that time 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:24.840
 And the attraction of this time is the size of this luggage space 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:28.979
 Also in this rear seat is not in the state this to sit 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:34.800
 There are 456 liters, and if it is defeated by the rear seat turn 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:40.229
 There are 992 liters, so it's China further here 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:42.300
 There is a floor under the floor, and when it comes to hybrids, the battery shuts off. 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:45.930
 Quite narrow and gone 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:52.260
 There is such a thing , but compared with the gasoline model, the loading ability is absolutely 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:58.500
 I think that it is a big attraction that there is no such inferiority this time 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:06:04.590
 Furthermore, it was not at the time of the second generation of this, but set the height of this opening and closing arbitrarily 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:09.750
 Also raised and set in the ceiling, for example, barely ounce who by that I I can be 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:12.830
 I could not use it at home, but this was not the second generation of Sendai, but such places are close 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:18.290
 It is attractive that selfishness has improved 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:23.030
 In this time and the two of you are prepared powertrain One is First Click here for in-line four-cylinder This 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:27.710
 The fuel consumption is 16.0, which makes it a liter engine 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:32.820
 This is called transmission super cvt i to be combined 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:38.880
 It has a euphoria of rotation I be a fairly pleasant cvt and to this 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:40.639
 There are drive systems to two 94 and one more 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:45.889
 Yes 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:49.849
 A hybrid is also available. As a high power hybrid at this second generation 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:53.409
 It appeared in Harrier but it was v6 this time 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:59.949
 Directly below is 2.5-liter in-line four-cylinder 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:07:05.679
 It will be 197hp in terms of the system maximum output including the motor 

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:09.110
 It is 21.8 when it says in terms of fuel consumption I think whether it is very attractive as suv 

00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:12.800
 The rear is a dedicated motor first 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:19.570
 We have adopted such a special four-wheel drive system 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:19.570
 Also tell a variety at the market, including say whether about how this acceleration force 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.800
 The 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:36.990
 I was able to confirm this space with a sense of luxury and luxury 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.990
 Then I will go check it from now on how it runs 

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:39.289
 Hmm 

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.290
 Half
