00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.030
 we are behind the blue curtain of the Palais Omnisports of Paris-bercy and I 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.750
 am in the company of the one who made a good performance on what is a 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.880
 second alban preaubert then german third at skate america 

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:19.329
 friends if we compare to instances in the top ten world this is a 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:22.630
 thing acquired solo mano just climb the ladder one by one 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.489
 the emotion is a very very good start to the season for me 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.579
 even confirms 8th place and shantel of the world 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.579
 last week was still even better since 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.080
 well to qualify for the grand prix final which brings together 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.080
 six world best so 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.370
 allah is archi and it's great that's what we expected not to do as well 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.109
 then a very particular style a rustic summary hadith 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:52.709
 so we think when we see you necessarily for those who follow the 

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:54.680
 skating lorente belges including 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.320
 Still, it's a style where it's hard to get out of it for example 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.570
 I do not think so 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.560
 but I'm pretty new to them on the circuit so 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.110
 we mainly know inc 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.430
 with this register that funny and original and 5 hours 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.180
 a service that is important to me I feel really comfortable 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.800
 Chief Warrant Officer I like 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.330
 to make people smile 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.340
 aware that long-term heart rates 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.680
 so I feel really comfortable in his programs 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.490
 but it seems to work well with the hogsheads 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.370
 re-connecting the bleachers and it's rather pleasant when we 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.420
 when one is just android would be incomplete without even knowing post 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.810
 to let go 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.510
 the magisterium show 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.200
 over the next few years that I can also be 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.200
 we can more diversified in the shadows he assured that I'm not 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.200
 made to do the classic 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.480
 it is already a weight in less size a little atypical 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.600
 my big size and a little 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.230
 or even more disordered of times like this 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.010
 so it's true that the classic does not wish for me but I can do 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.250
 also of closer 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.800
 but I hope to show later 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.610
 now wish you good luck in any case an approval pro b a second 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.530
 in men the limit
