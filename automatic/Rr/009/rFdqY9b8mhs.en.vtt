00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.659
 ah 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.750
 and 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.150
 Cystic fibrosis is a disease 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.250
 genetics is a hereditary disease and 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.380
 they have to deal with numerous 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.450
 antibiotics and especially with a 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.189
 heavyweight photography this is very 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.770
 important that children of ages 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.570
 early begin to train and 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.219
 control both inspiratory flows 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.530
 as an expiratory because that's going to be the 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.180
 basis of all the exercises all the 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.100
 physiotherapy techniques that are going to 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.710
 have to develop when they are adults 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.050
 in a small child this inspiration of 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.969
 inspiration for even explain it 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.380
 he is not good to make him the arsenal 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.790
 therapeutic or the games with which 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.070
 we have seen the guidelines for 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.430
 teach the control of volume and 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.140
 respiratory flow in children who 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.820
 quite limited and rudimentary as 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.760
 part of treatments recommend us 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.230
 do therapy every day at home and for 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.270
 that we have specific exercises 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.670
 but they also advise us to make games 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.619
 As the bubbles blow ink balls 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.060
 or accept confetti but the truth that 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.490
 the resources fall short and 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.990
 It would be nice to have more tools like 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.610
 games that make physiotherapy is 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.760
 something fun and it would be easier 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.110
 do the treatment every day at home the 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.350
 clear problem 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.820
 how to teach a 15- year-old child how to 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.820
 make that expiration of that aspiration 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.200
 and we want to make my carnival 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.540
 to give you another option more with which 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.760
 these children can learn to control 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.710
 the software the game will use a 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.140
 conventional pc microphone for 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.330
 detect inspiration and aspiration 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.760
 of the child and it will be distributed 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.770
 free online can be a 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.230
 tool even more important than 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.380
 these games sent by physiotherapists 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.490
 because it gives the possibility to adjust the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.650
 game 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.890
 to the abilities of the child in each 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.100
 moment with what may result 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.360
 motivating the child and not getting bored of him 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.860
 how can they go with the other games 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.990
 that are always the same 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.780
 the game is aimed at children and 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.820
 girls between 3 and 6 years old is important 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.980
 keep in mind that at these ages 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.990
 children learn by playing with which 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.660
 we must present the video game as 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.120
 strikingly possible in order to make it 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.370
 pleasant and the child repeat these behaviors 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.470
 voluntarily being thus a 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.380
 meaningful learning for this base 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.330
 since 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.550
 of learning all the techniques 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.920
 and a domain without assuming flow 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.320
 for it a load more in his day to day 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.270
 will be in English and Spanish and 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.520
 will have configuration options for 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.590
 that the child can enjoy the game 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.840
 adequately as are the level of 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.300
 difficulty and speed of the game 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.300
 the video game my carnival because it's going to 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.060
 be a very effective instrument for 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.880
 we teach the child to control their 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.770
 Breathing very early age if 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.810
 we got that my carnival follows 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.420
 go ahead or you get this has come 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.400
 project is going to involve a drastic change 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.590
 respect to the classic game because it's going to 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.080
 suppose motivation challenge the association 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.910
 Andalusian cystic fibrosis is going to 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.520
 fully support the project because it does not 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.830
 we have interesting is already more necessary 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.960
 for the children but the baby we need 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.600
 help to carry the traits because 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.370
 economically we are an NGO and not 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.530
 we have no pressure effect for 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.300
 support so interesting project on 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.830
 everything like this 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.230
 my carnival will be a tool 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.270
 free from which they can benefit 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.160
 in the future many children with 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.500
 cystic fibrosis but now 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.150
 we need your help to be able 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.120
 face the development of this novelty 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.500
 therapeutic instrument please with 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.630
 now for this project to be a 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.950
 Actually, any contribution will be 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.950
 great help thanks
