00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
that they have in these things so you

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.350 
that they have in these things so you
can<00:00:37.559> sort<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.160> look<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.760> see<00:00:38.910> what<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.180> have

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
can sort of look and see what you have

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.270

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
figure out what's a matter if it's the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.049 
figure out what's a matter if it's the
start<00:00:43.379> or<00:00:43.590> if<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.920> bell<00:00:44.100> housing<00:00:44.309> or<00:00:44.730> whatever

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
was a starter how to open nose cone on

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.710 
was a starter how to open nose cone on
it<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.799> end<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> starter<00:01:06.180> ran<00:01:06.420> into

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
it the the end of the starter ran into

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.649 
it the the end of the starter ran into
pushing<00:01:07.110> into<00:01:07.350> flywheel<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.659> only

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
pushing into flywheel the only

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.170 
pushing into flywheel the only
electrical<00:01:10.439> terminal<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> stud

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
electrical terminal on it is a stud

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.350 
electrical terminal on it is a stud
sticking<00:01:12.659> out<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.960> top<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:14.240> usually<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
sticking out the top and usually the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.440 
sticking out the top and usually the
starter<00:01:15.810> numbers<00:01:16.229> were<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.610> band<00:01:17.970> that

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
starter numbers were on the band that

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.109 
starter numbers were on the band that
covered<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.290> brushes<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.490> many<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.000> these

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
covered the brushes so many of these

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.910 
covered the brushes so many of these
starters<00:01:21.780> don't<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> little<00:01:22.409> number<00:01:22.530> tags

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
starters don't have a little number tags

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.380 
starters don't have a little number tags
on<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.570> so<00:01:24.570> just<00:01:25.310> by<00:01:26.310> looking<00:01:26.340> at<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.909> starter

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
on it so just by looking at the starter

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.330 
on it so just by looking at the starter
you<00:01:28.049> know<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.259> can<00:01:28.500> tell<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.130> have

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
you know you can tell that you have

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.429 
you know you can tell that you have
which<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:30.079> even<00:01:31.079> if<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.259> don't

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
which one you have even if you don't

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.490 
which one you have even if you don't
have<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.710> tag<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:33.229> all<00:01:34.229> these

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
have the tag on it and all these

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.340 
have the tag on it and all these
starters<00:01:34.979> here<00:01:35.700> there<00:01:36.390> were<00:01:36.509> nine<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.840> ten

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
starters here there were nine and ten

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.649 
starters here there were nine and ten
two<00:01:37.590> started<00:01:38.130> drives<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.579> these<00:01:38.700> things<00:01:39.000> but

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
two started drives in these things but

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.350 
two started drives in these things but
they'll<00:01:39.930> both<00:01:40.500> work<00:01:41.009> because<00:01:41.909> there's<00:01:42.060> enough

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
they'll both work because there's enough

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.240 
they'll both work because there's enough
slop<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.990> gears<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.530> though<00:01:43.770> they'll

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
slop in the gears that though they'll

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.020 
slop in the gears that though they'll
work<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.610> either<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:46.310> these<00:01:47.310> two<00:01:47.549> ways<00:01:47.729> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
work on either one these two ways and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.440 
work on either one these two ways and
embiez<00:01:48.329> had<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.659> 97<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.799> thrinng<00:01:50.189> gear<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
embiez had a 97 to thrinng gear and the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.889 
embiez had a 97 to thrinng gear and the
97<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.229> 3<00:01:52.500> year<00:01:52.799> went<00:01:53.040> with<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.490> mp40<00:01:54.210> 113

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
97 to 3 year went with the mp40 113

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.959 
97 to 3 year went with the mp40 113
