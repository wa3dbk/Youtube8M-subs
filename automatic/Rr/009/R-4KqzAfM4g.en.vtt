00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
what the scoring is going to be like

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.820 
what the scoring is going to be like
okay<00:04:03.930> so<00:04:04.019> I'm<00:04:04.140> doing<00:04:04.320> it<00:04:04.410> now<00:04:04.440> because<00:04:04.530> I<00:04:04.769> have

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
okay so I'm doing it now because I have

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.400

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
20 games left on my list so if you guess

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.460 
20 games left on my list so if you guess
a<00:04:07.440> game<00:04:07.709> that<00:04:07.920> is<00:04:08.130> on<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.790> list<00:04:09.000> still<00:04:09.510> there's

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
a 50-50 chance of it being in my top

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.979 
a 50-50 chance of it being in my top
five<00:04:12.320> if<00:04:13.320> you<00:04:13.380> guess<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:13.680> game<00:04:13.950> let's<00:04:14.580> say<00:04:14.989> okay

five if you guess a game let's say okay

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.240 
five if you guess a game let's say okay
I'm<00:04:16.080> gonna<00:04:16.169> use<00:04:16.320> examples<00:04:16.590> here<00:04:16.890> let's<00:04:17.130> say

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
I'm gonna use examples here let's say

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.210 
I'm gonna use examples here let's say
you<00:04:17.310> guess<00:04:18.440> fable<00:04:19.440> which<00:04:19.650> obviously<00:04:19.950> wouldn't

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
you guess fable which obviously wouldn't

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.469 
you guess fable which obviously wouldn't
be<00:04:20.400> in<00:04:20.729> there<00:04:20.910> because<00:04:21.000> it's<00:04:21.180> already<00:04:21.299> be<00:04:21.450> on

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
be in there because it's already be on

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:22.820 
be in there because it's already be on
the<00:04:21.600> list<00:04:21.720> so<00:04:21.989> I'm<00:04:22.049> just<00:04:22.169> going<00:04:22.289> to<00:04:22.350> use<00:04:22.500> games

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
the list so I'm just going to use games

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.020 
the list so I'm just going to use games
of<00:04:22.979> arbonne<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.310> list<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.610> not<00:04:23.729> give<00:04:23.880> you<00:04:24.000> any

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
of arbonne the list to not give you any

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.810 
of arbonne the list to not give you any
ideas

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
ideas

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.750 
ideas
let's<00:04:25.810> say<00:04:25.960> you<00:04:26.020> guessed<00:04:26.410> fable<00:04:26.920> at<00:04:27.070> number<00:04:27.400> at

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
let's say you guessed fable at number at

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.000 
let's say you guessed fable at number at
number<00:04:28.510> nine<00:04:28.660> spot<00:04:28.690> but<00:04:29.140> it's<00:04:29.260> only<00:04:29.380> number<00:04:29.620> 15

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
number nine spot but it's only number 15

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.100 
number nine spot but it's only number 15
well<00:04:30.670> you<00:04:30.880> put<00:04:31.030> it<00:04:31.090> in<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.210> top<00:04:31.390> ten<00:04:31.870> but<00:04:32.020> it

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
well you put it in the top ten but it

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.420 
well you put it in the top ten but it
was<00:04:32.230> actually<00:04:32.350> in<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.590> top<00:04:32.770> it<00:04:33.190> was<00:04:33.340> actually

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
was actually in the top it was actually

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.240 
was actually in the top it was actually
from<00:04:33.640> twenty<00:04:34.000> to<00:04:34.030> eleven<00:04:34.620> so<00:04:35.620> from<00:04:35.770> ten<00:04:35.950> to<00:04:35.980> one

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
from twenty to eleven so from ten to one

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.010 
from twenty to eleven so from ten to one
so<00:04:36.790> that's<00:04:36.940> one<00:04:37.150> point<00:04:37.360> so<00:04:37.570> if<00:04:37.690> you<00:04:37.780> guess<00:04:37.990> a

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
so that's one point so if you guess a

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.410 
so that's one point so if you guess a
game<00:04:38.350> and<00:04:38.620> put<00:04:38.860> it<00:04:38.920> in<00:04:38.980> my<00:04:39.040> top<00:04:39.220> ten<00:04:39.460> I<00:04:39.670> don't

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
game and put it in my top ten I don't

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.730 
game and put it in my top ten I don't
remember<00:04:40.510> don't<00:04:40.810> semi<00:04:40.960> 20<00:04:41.170> games<00:04:41.350> just<00:04:41.590> send

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
already been on this list so don't get

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.060 
already been on this list so don't get
any<00:05:12.820> ideas<00:05:13.590> because<00:05:14.590> it's<00:05:14.710> not<00:05:14.800> going<00:05:14.920> to<00:05:15.010> be

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
any ideas because it's not going to be

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.650 
any ideas because it's not going to be
there<00:05:15.220> uh<00:05:17.040> and<00:05:18.040> if<00:05:18.310> you<00:05:18.400> guess<00:05:18.550> a<00:05:18.580> game<00:05:18.940> in<00:05:19.180> the

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
there uh and if you guess a game in the

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.590 
there uh and if you guess a game in the
correct<00:05:20.020> spot<00:05:20.320> on<00:05:20.890> my<00:05:21.100> top<00:05:21.340> 10<00:05:21.580> list<00:05:21.610> then<00:05:22.480> you

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
correct spot on my top 10 list then you

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.300 
correct spot on my top 10 list then you
get<00:05:22.720> three<00:05:23.050> points<00:05:23.260> so<00:05:23.680> for<00:05:23.920> example<00:05:23.980> let's

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
get three points so for example let's

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.460 
get three points so for example let's
say<00:05:24.610> but<00:05:25.210> mega<00:05:25.420> man<00:05:25.600> 2<00:05:25.750> which<00:05:26.050> has<00:05:26.170> only<00:05:26.290> been

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
say but mega man 2 which has only been

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.040 
say but mega man 2 which has only been
on<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:26.890> list<00:05:27.040> at<00:05:27.250> my<00:05:27.940> number<00:05:28.270> two<00:05:28.480> game<00:05:28.720> ever

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
on the list at my number two game ever

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.800 
on the list at my number two game ever
and<00:05:29.610> it<00:05:30.610> is<00:05:30.700> my<00:05:30.910> number<00:05:31.120> two<00:05:31.270> game<00:05:31.450> ever<00:05:31.630> you

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
and it is my number two game ever you

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.120 
and it is my number two game ever you
get<00:05:31.960> three<00:05:32.260> points<00:05:32.440> for<00:05:32.650> that<00:05:32.740> guess<00:05:32.890> so<00:05:33.010> that

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
get three points for that guess so that

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.840 
get three points for that guess so that
means<00:05:33.310> a<00:05:33.430> perfect<00:05:33.910> score<00:05:34.210> would<00:05:34.810> be<00:05:34.870> 30<00:05:35.850> if

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
means a perfect score would be 30 if

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.790 
means a perfect score would be 30 if
anybody<00:05:37.120> scores<00:05:37.510> a<00:05:37.570> 30<00:05:37.930> on<00:05:38.110> this<00:05:38.260> competition
