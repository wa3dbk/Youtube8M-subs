00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:13.640 
motorcycle thing happening too late to
the<00:00:12.299> module<00:00:12.600> is<00:00:12.660> finally<00:00:13.049> in<00:00:13.170> production<00:00:13.559> from

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
the module is finally in production from

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.199 
the module is finally in production from
this<00:00:13.860> particular<00:00:14.010> one<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.549> wearing<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.879> racing

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.950 
paint job that's not going to be in
production<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.699> think<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.539> other<00:00:18.690> motorcycle

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
production I think the other motorcycle

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.450 
production I think the other motorcycle
which<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.440> not<00:00:19.560> on<00:00:19.680> screen<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> simple<00:00:20.340> black

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
which is not on screen is a simple black

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.249 
which is not on screen is a simple black
motorcycle<00:00:20.789> but<00:00:21.210> what<00:00:21.720> they've<00:00:21.869> done<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.230> a

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:22.259 
motorcycle but what they've done is a

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.109 
motorcycle but what they've done is a
lot<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.800> work<00:00:22.949> on<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.160> styling<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.669> feedback

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119

in certain lines but overall it's a nice
big<00:00:48.450> hefty<00:00:48.780> looking<00:00:49.200> thing<00:00:49.380> what<00:00:49.950> we<00:00:50.100> know<00:00:50.310> is

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
big hefty looking thing what we know is

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.850 
big hefty looking thing what we know is
that's<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.760> 300cc<00:00:51.330> fuel-injected<00:00:52.050> four-valve

that's a 300cc fuel-injected four-valve
liquid-cooled<00:00:53.010> engine<00:00:53.880> we're<00:00:54.450> not<00:00:54.660> sure

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
liquid-cooled engine we're not sure

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.690 
liquid-cooled engine we're not sure
about<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.260> power<00:00:55.470> but<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.890> had<00:00:56.040> to<00:00:56.070> guess<00:00:56.460> I

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
about the power but if I had to guess I

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.040 
about the power but if I had to guess I
would<00:00:56.880> get<00:00:57.240> that<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.540> thing<00:00:57.750> would<00:00:57.840> make

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
would get that this thing would make

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.100 
would get that this thing would make
about<00:00:58.200> 30<00:00:58.650> bhp<00:00:59.300> Pioli<00:01:00.300> folks<00:01:00.660> there<00:01:00.990> any

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
about 30 bhp Pioli folks there any

exhaust so of course I had to ask my
Indra<00:01:10.439> if<00:01:10.590> they<00:01:10.710> were<00:01:10.799> going<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.039> put<00:01:11.189> all<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
Indra if they were going to put all the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.459 
Indra if they were going to put all the
gizmos<00:01:11.700> from<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.149> century<00:01:12.509> on<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.810> because<00:01:13.049> if

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 
gizmos from the century on it because if

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:14.929 
gizmos from the century on it because if
you<00:01:13.619> are<00:01:13.710> smallest<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.189> guess<00:01:14.369> remote<00:01:14.640> locking

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
you are smallest I guess remote locking

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.789 
you are smallest I guess remote locking
in<00:01:15.030> addition<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> big<00:01:15.539> bike<00:01:15.689> get<00:01:15.869> one<00:01:16.049> all<00:01:16.229> so

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
in addition to a big bike get one all so

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.230 
in addition to a big bike get one all so
everybody<00:01:17.189> laughs<00:01:17.399> but<00:01:17.700> they<00:01:17.820> say<00:01:17.969> yes<00:01:18.119> we

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
everybody laughs but they say yes we

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.700 
everybody laughs but they say yes we
have<00:01:18.329> the<00:01:18.420> technology<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.079> possible<00:01:19.469> to<00:01:19.499> do

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
have the technology it is possible to do

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.859 
have the technology it is possible to do
and<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.159> will<00:01:20.249> see<00:01:20.429> what<00:01:20.609> works<00:01:21.179> out<00:01:21.359> so

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
and we will see what works out so

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.230 
and we will see what works out so
overall<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.100> nice<00:01:23.369> looking<00:01:23.700> motorcycle

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
overall it's a nice looking motorcycle

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.719 
overall it's a nice looking motorcycle
that<00:01:24.390> will<00:01:24.569> come<00:01:24.749> to<00:01:24.869> India<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.439> think<00:01:25.829> we<00:01:26.609> will

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
that will come to India I think we will

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:27.980 
that will come to India I think we will
should<00:01:27.030> be<00:01:27.119> able<00:01:27.179> to<00:01:27.329> buy<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.539> another<00:01:27.749> three

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
should be able to buy it another three

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.510 
should be able to buy it another three
or<00:01:28.020> four<00:01:28.109> months<00:01:28.469> time<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.740> invalidation<00:01:29.340> a

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
or four months time it's invalidation a

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.399 
or four months time it's invalidation a
validation<00:01:30.270> gets<00:01:30.569> over<00:01:30.780> production<00:01:31.020> izing

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
validation gets over production izing

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.359 
validation gets over production izing
yeah<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.560> think<00:01:31.740> about<00:01:31.859> three<00:01:32.039> or<00:01:32.130> four<00:01:32.280> months

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
yeah I think about three or four months

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.169 
yeah I think about three or four months
time<00:01:32.609> the<00:01:33.299> price<00:01:33.799> if<00:01:34.799> mind<00:01:35.069> Roberto<00:01:35.549> set<00:01:36.030> out

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
time the price if mind Roberto set out

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.999 
time the price if mind Roberto set out
