what I've got is the tank was already
drilled<00:02:33.290> with<00:02:34.330> it's<00:02:35.330> got<00:02:35.600> to<00:02:38.799> overflow<00:02:39.799> boxes

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
drilled with it's got to overflow boxes

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.140 
drilled with it's got to overflow boxes
and<00:02:41.299> this<00:02:42.049> is<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.319> left<00:02:42.560> side<00:02:42.799> so<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.459> the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
and this is the left side so the the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.520 
and this is the left side so the the
tube<00:02:44.420> on<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.630> ride<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.900> drain<00:02:48.200> and

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
tube on the ride is the the drain and

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.789 
tube on the ride is the the drain and
the<00:02:48.709> one<00:02:48.830> on<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.010> left<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.430> clear<00:02:49.700> is<00:02:49.910> the

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
the one on the left the clear is the

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.860 
the one on the left the clear is the
return<00:02:51.799> so<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.340> actually<00:02:52.580> thought<00:02:53.360> about<00:02:53.420> it<00:02:53.720> if

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
return so I actually thought about it if

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.680 
return so I actually thought about it if
I<00:02:53.959> here<00:02:54.140> whenever<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.910> if<00:02:55.910> I<00:02:56.000> ever<00:02:56.120> have<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.390> move

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
I here whenever I if I ever have to move

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.080 
I here whenever I if I ever have to move
this<00:02:56.930> I'm<00:02:57.140> gonna<00:02:57.230> have<00:02:57.350> to<00:02:57.440> cut<00:02:57.620> that<00:02:57.769> pipe<00:02:58.090> so

this I'm gonna have to cut that pipe so

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.210 
this I'm gonna have to cut that pipe so
whenever<00:02:59.600> I<00:02:59.780> was<00:02:59.959> working<00:03:00.290> on<00:03:00.380> this<00:03:00.560> I<00:03:00.860> return

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
whenever I was working on this I return

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.920 
whenever I was working on this I return
line<00:03:01.459> that's<00:03:01.790> decided<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.510> go<00:03:02.630> with<00:03:02.750> some

line that's decided to go with some
clear<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.470> know<00:03:03.950> it'll<00:03:04.220> kind<00:03:04.430> of<00:03:04.489> get<00:03:04.580> done<00:03:05.060> all

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
med and having black in this size so I

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.880 
med and having black in this size so I
just<00:03:11.570> wanted<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:11.959> clear<00:03:12.140> for<00:03:12.380> now<00:03:12.410> to<00:03:12.530> get<00:03:12.709> up

just wanted to clear for now to get up
run<00:03:13.070> and<00:03:13.100> get<00:03:13.310> some<00:03:13.340> water<00:03:13.579> flowing<00:03:14.000> so<00:03:15.760> let's

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
run and get some water flowing so let's

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.800 
run and get some water flowing so let's
see<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.450> then<00:03:17.630> here's<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.930> other

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
see and then here's the other

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.650 
see and then here's the other
so<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:21.190> this<00:03:21.490> is<00:03:21.640> a<00:03:21.670> hump<00:03:22.450> as<00:03:22.600> a<00:03:22.630> 55<00:03:23.140> gallon

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
so so this is a hump as a 55 gallon

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.870 
so so this is a hump as a 55 gallon
aquarium<00:03:25.660> it's<00:03:26.260> definitely<00:03:26.590> homemade<00:03:26.980> the

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
aquarium it's definitely homemade the

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.800 
aquarium it's definitely homemade the
weather<00:03:28.600> ye<00:03:29.130> baffles<00:03:30.130> are<00:03:30.310> so<00:03:30.700> I've<00:03:31.570> got<00:03:31.780> my

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
weather ye baffles are so I've got my

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.530 
weather ye baffles are so I've got my
Inlet<00:03:32.590> which<00:03:33.460> goes<00:03:33.730> under<00:03:34.030> there<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.210> it's

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
Inlet which goes under there and it's

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.760 
Inlet which goes under there and it's
making<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:34.960> little<00:03:35.170> bit<00:03:35.260> of<00:03:35.320> noise<00:03:35.410> so<00:03:35.680> I'm

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
making a little bit of noise so I'm

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.380 
making a little bit of noise so I'm
thinking<00:03:36.040> about<00:03:36.100> putting<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.640> of<00:03:36.880> some<00:03:37.180> kind<00:03:37.300> of

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.530 
thinking about putting a of some kind of
a<00:03:37.540> sponge<00:03:37.900> or<00:03:38.940> something<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.060> kind<00:03:40.240> of<00:03:40.330> cut

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
very very little hum the skimmer does

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.980 
very very little hum the skimmer does
make<00:03:51.220> a<00:03:51.250> little<00:03:51.700> bit<00:03:51.820> more<00:03:51.970> noise<00:03:52.240> but<00:03:52.810> they

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
make a little bit more noise but they

make a little bit more noise but they
still<00:03:53.350> not<00:03:53.500> too<00:03:53.680> bad<00:03:53.830> especially<00:03:53.890> once<00:03:54.310> I<00:03:54.370> get

didn't<00:04:07.240> I<00:04:07.510> wasn't<00:04:08.020> really<00:04:08.110> interested<00:04:08.410> in<00:04:08.740> it

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
didn't I wasn't really interested in it

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.300 
didn't I wasn't really interested in it
after<00:04:09.010> looking<00:04:09.400> at<00:04:09.490> it<00:04:09.550> but<00:04:10.920> he<00:04:11.920> showed<00:04:12.280> me

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
after looking at it but he showed me

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.160 
after looking at it but he showed me
this<00:04:12.580> one<00:04:12.790> that<00:04:12.970> was<00:04:13.120> his<00:04:13.300> main<00:04:13.540> tank<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.080> he

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
this one that was his main tank and he

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.130 
this one that was his main tank and he
was<00:04:14.290> moving<00:04:14.590> to<00:04:14.680> a<00:04:14.710> 300-gallon<00:04:15.250> so<00:04:15.989> you<00:04:16.989> know<00:04:17.080> I

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
was moving to a 300-gallon so you know I

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.900 
was moving to a 300-gallon so you know I
he<00:04:17.470> but<00:04:17.650> he<00:04:17.739> basically<00:04:17.950> had<00:04:18.340> all<00:04:18.520> of<00:04:18.549> this

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
he but he basically had all of this

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.990 
he but he basically had all of this
exactly<00:04:19.780> set<00:04:20.049> up<00:04:20.170> the<00:04:20.470> same<00:04:20.709> way<00:04:20.970> minus<00:04:21.970> the

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
exactly set up the same way minus the

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.200 
exactly set up the same way minus the
plumbing<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:22.690> had<00:04:22.840> to<00:04:22.930> do<00:04:23.050> all<00:04:23.080> that<00:04:23.400> but<00:04:24.400> he<00:04:25.030> had

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
plumbing I had to do all that but he had

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.240 
plumbing I had to do all that but he had
this<00:04:25.390> skimmer<00:04:25.780> and<00:04:25.870> everything<00:04:26.320> if<00:04:26.740> he<00:04:27.010> can't

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
this skimmer and everything if he can't

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.440 
this skimmer and everything if he can't
even<00:04:27.340> run<00:04:27.580> a<00:04:27.610> skimmer<00:04:27.940> on<00:04:28.030> his<00:04:28.150> new<00:04:28.300> ones

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
even run a skimmer on his new ones

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.790 
even run a skimmer on his new ones
because<00:04:28.600> there's<00:04:28.930> no<00:04:29.050> room<00:04:29.260> underneath<00:04:29.530> it

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
because there's no room underneath it

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.080 
because there's no room underneath it
unfortunately<00:04:30.810> so<00:04:32.220> so<00:04:33.220> that's<00:04:33.490> basically<00:04:33.670> the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
unfortunately so so that's basically the

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.210 
unfortunately so so that's basically the
hump<00:04:34.720> I've<00:04:35.170> still<00:04:35.380> got<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:35.560> lot<00:04:35.710> of<00:04:35.770> work<00:04:35.950> to<00:04:36.100> do

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
hump I've still got a lot of work to do

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.510 
hump I've still got a lot of work to do
I've<00:04:36.430> got<00:04:36.640> a<00:04:38.070> carbon<00:04:39.070> and<00:04:39.430> gfo<00:04:39.970> reactor<00:04:40.420> coming

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
I've got a carbon and gfo reactor coming

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.610 
I've got a carbon and gfo reactor coming
got<00:04:42.520> to<00:04:42.610> get<00:04:42.700> heaters<00:04:43.240> in<00:04:43.420> here<00:04:43.690> it<00:04:44.200> did<00:04:44.410> come

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
got to get heaters in here it did come

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.010 
got to get heaters in here it did come
with<00:04:44.890> a<00:04:44.920> JV<00:04:45.670> j<00:04:46.500> arctica<00:04:47.790> titanium<00:04:49.020> chiller

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
with a JV j arctica titanium chiller

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.560 
with a JV j arctica titanium chiller
which<00:04:50.410> is<00:04:50.560> pretty<00:04:50.770> cool<00:04:51.010> on<00:04:51.850> these<00:04:52.150> things<00:04:52.390> I

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
which is pretty cool on these things I

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.090 
which is pretty cool on these things I
think<00:04:52.630> they<00:04:52.870> retail<00:04:53.230> for<00:04:53.260> around<00:04:53.530> six<00:04:53.860> hundred

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
think they retail for around six hundred

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.610 
think they retail for around six hundred
bucks<00:04:54.480> so<00:04:55.480> when<00:04:55.690> I<00:04:55.750> got<00:04:55.900> this<00:04:56.050> one<00:04:56.110> for<00:04:56.410> about

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
bucks so when I got this one for about

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.250 
bucks so when I got this one for about
200<00:04:57.100> so<00:04:57.850> I'm<00:04:58.000> not<00:04:58.150> bad<00:04:58.360> i<00:04:58.390> haven't<00:04:58.870> plumbed<00:04:59.170> it

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
200 so I'm not bad i haven't plumbed it

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.510 
200 so I'm not bad i haven't plumbed it
in<00:04:59.380> or<00:04:59.500> anything<00:04:59.560> i<00:04:59.830> don't<00:04:59.890> have<00:05:00.100> another<00:05:00.280> pump

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
in or anything i don't have another pump

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.100 
in or anything i don't have another pump
waiting<00:05:01.270> on<00:05:01.330> some<00:05:01.450> more<00:05:01.600> problems<00:05:01.780> that's<00:05:02.050> the

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
waiting on some more problems that's the

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.860 
waiting on some more problems that's the
only<00:05:02.290> one<00:05:02.440> I've<00:05:02.560> got<00:05:02.770> right<00:05:03.760> now<00:05:03.820> so<00:05:04.510> you<00:05:04.660> can

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.180 
see all my spare parts here
from<00:05:07.380> my<00:05:08.570> plumbing<00:05:09.570> here<00:05:09.810> but<00:05:10.440> it<00:05:10.889> was<00:05:11.040> real

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
from my plumbing here but it was real

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.150 
from my plumbing here but it was real
simple<00:05:11.400> to<00:05:11.610> set<00:05:11.850> up<00:05:11.880> but<00:05:12.770> can't<00:05:13.770> wait<00:05:13.889> to<00:05:14.040> get

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
simple to set up but can't wait to get

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.020 
simple to set up but can't wait to get
the<00:05:14.480> once<00:05:15.480> my<00:05:15.630> ro/di<00:05:16.110> system<00:05:16.580> comes<00:05:17.580> in<00:05:17.790> and

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
the once my ro/di system comes in and

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.120 
the once my ro/di system comes in and
all<00:05:18.120> that<00:05:18.300> I'll<00:05:18.480> have<00:05:18.720> the<00:05:18.900> I'll<00:05:19.800> get<00:05:19.980> some

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
all that I'll have the I'll get some

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.110 
all that I'll have the I'll get some
salt<00:05:20.340> water<00:05:20.490> going<00:05:20.990> and<00:05:22.850> hopefully<00:05:23.850> get<00:05:24.060> that

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
salt water going and hopefully get that

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.860 
salt water going and hopefully get that
nitrogen<00:05:24.600> cycle<00:05:25.080> in<00:05:25.860> progress<00:05:26.580> so<00:05:27.150> he

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
nitrogen cycle in progress so he

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.020 
nitrogen cycle in progress so he
actually<00:05:28.020> gave<00:05:28.320> me<00:05:28.380> three<00:05:29.100> buckets<00:05:29.490> of<00:05:29.760> live

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
actually gave me three buckets of live

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.659 
actually gave me three buckets of live
sand<00:05:30.480> as<00:05:30.660> well<00:05:30.840> with<00:05:31.110> it<00:05:31.139> so<00:05:31.500> once<00:05:32.280> I<00:05:32.400> do<00:05:32.460> get

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
sand as well with it so once I do get

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:33.980 
sand as well with it so once I do get
the<00:05:32.790> salt<00:05:33.000> water<00:05:33.120> in<00:05:33.360> I'm<00:05:33.510> going<00:05:33.630> to<00:05:33.690> dump<00:05:33.840> the

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
the salt water in I'm going to dump the

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.659 
the salt water in I'm going to dump the
sand<00:05:34.200> and<00:05:34.470> this<00:05:34.620> is<00:05:34.800> just<00:05:34.980> the<00:05:35.160> glass<00:05:35.340> bottom

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
sand and this is just the glass bottom

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.850 
sand and this is just the glass bottom
right<00:05:36.000> now<00:05:36.180> so<00:05:36.570> if<00:05:37.110> you<00:05:37.200> can<00:05:37.320> see<00:05:37.530> that<00:05:37.710> or<00:05:37.830> not

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
right now so if you can see that or not

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.040 
right now so if you can see that or not
but<00:05:40.940> that's<00:05:41.940> where<00:05:42.210> we're<00:05:42.360> at<00:05:42.390> I've<00:05:42.660> also<00:05:42.810> got

themselves what you could see that or

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.560 
themselves what you could see that or
not<00:05:50.250> but<00:05:50.370> it's<00:05:50.700> kind<00:05:50.850> of<00:05:50.880> got<00:05:51.000> a<00:05:51.030> crack<00:05:51.330> right

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570

even<00:06:01.770> the<00:06:01.830> one<00:06:01.919> I<00:06:01.979> was<00:06:02.220> looking<00:06:02.340> at<00:06:02.610> or<00:06:03.030> going

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
even the one I was looking at or going

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.060 
even the one I was looking at or going
over<00:06:03.660> to<00:06:03.780> his<00:06:03.900> house<00:06:04.020> to<00:06:04.050> look<00:06:04.290> at<00:06:04.500> but<00:06:04.680> he

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
over to his house to look at but he

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.980 
over to his house to look at but he
ended<00:06:05.160> up<00:06:05.310> give<00:06:06.120> me<00:06:06.270> a<00:06:06.300> pretty<00:06:06.510> good<00:06:06.690> deal<00:06:06.810> on

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
ended up give me a pretty good deal on

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.150 
ended up give me a pretty good deal on
it<00:06:07.020> just<00:06:07.260> to<00:06:07.350> get<00:06:07.500> it<00:06:07.590> out<00:06:07.650> of<00:06:07.710> his<00:06:07.889> living<00:06:08.130> room

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
it just to get it out of his living room

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.480 
it just to get it out of his living room
so<00:06:09.110> so<00:06:10.110> the<00:06:10.470> plan<00:06:10.650> eventually<00:06:10.919> will<00:06:11.190> be<00:06:11.250> to<00:06:11.400> get

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
so so the plan eventually will be to get

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.480 
so so the plan eventually will be to get
some<00:06:11.790> fish<00:06:12.330> after<00:06:12.630> the<00:06:12.900> tank<00:06:13.140> cycles<00:06:13.560> and<00:06:13.890> then

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
some fish after the tank cycles and then

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.540 
some fish after the tank cycles and then
start<00:06:15.770> looking<00:06:16.770> at<00:06:16.860> what<00:06:16.890> all<00:06:17.070> I<00:06:17.100> need<00:06:17.340> to<00:06:17.370> do

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
later alright I'm back this was pretty

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.770 
later alright I'm back this was pretty
quick<00:06:43.680> but<00:06:43.979> I<00:06:44.370> had<00:06:44.820> the<00:06:44.910> metal<00:06:45.150> halide<00:06:45.419> bulbs

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 
quick but I had the metal halide bulbs

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.140 
quick but I had the metal halide bulbs
on<00:06:45.930> earlier<00:06:46.320> with<00:06:46.950> the<00:06:46.979> actinic<00:06:47.340> bulbs<00:06:47.820> the

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
on earlier with the actinic bulbs the

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.690 
on earlier with the actinic bulbs the
power<00:06:48.330> compact<00:06:48.720> so<00:06:49.050> turn<00:06:49.800> out<00:06:49.950> the<00:06:50.130> halides

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.700 
power compact so turn out the halides

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.590 
power compact so turn out the halides
and<00:06:51.030> now<00:06:51.210> this<00:06:51.390> is<00:06:51.600> just<00:06:51.630> the<00:06:53.150> power<00:06:54.150> compacts

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 
and now this is just the power compacts

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.800 
and now this is just the power compacts
and<00:06:55.700> it<00:06:56.700> actually<00:06:56.850> shows<00:06:57.120> up<00:06:57.180> pretty<00:06:57.479> good<00:06:57.630> on

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
and it actually shows up pretty good on

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.210 
and it actually shows up pretty good on
this<00:06:57.930> camera<00:06:58.200> it's<00:06:58.680> a<00:06:58.770> little<00:06:58.860> more<00:06:59.070> purple<00:06:59.930> in

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.220 
this camera it's a little more purple in

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.219 
this camera it's a little more purple in
person<00:07:02.220> but<00:07:02.460> that<00:07:03.180> blue<00:07:03.630> actually<00:07:04.050> looks

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:04.229 
person but that blue actually looks

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:05.810 
person but that blue actually looks
pretty<00:07:04.350> good<00:07:04.620> we'll<00:07:05.039> see<00:07:05.190> how<00:07:05.280> it<00:07:05.310> shows<00:07:05.550> up<00:07:05.610> on

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:05.820 
pretty good we'll see how it shows up on

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.640 
pretty good we'll see how it shows up on
youtube<00:07:06.150> but<00:07:07.700> also<00:07:08.700> i'll<00:07:09.240> show<00:07:09.450> you<00:07:09.510> the<00:07:09.810> city

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:10.650 
youtube but also i'll show you the city

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.580 
youtube but also i'll show you the city
hat<00:07:10.860> leds<00:07:11.370> that<00:07:11.400> are<00:07:11.760> built<00:07:11.940> in<00:07:12.120> as<00:07:12.270> well<00:07:12.590> for

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:13.590 
hat leds that are built in as well for

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.219 
hat leds that are built in as well for
the<00:07:13.650> moonlight<00:07:14.010> which<00:07:14.220> is<00:07:14.340> pretty<00:07:14.520> cool<00:07:14.789> too

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:15.229 
the moonlight which is pretty cool too

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:17.270 
the moonlight which is pretty cool too
so<00:07:16.229> if<00:07:16.320> you<00:07:16.409> watch<00:07:16.560> the<00:07:16.710> movie<00:07:16.919> or<00:07:17.010> something

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 
so if you watch the movie or something

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.540 
so if you watch the movie or something
doesn't<00:07:17.550> drown<00:07:17.729> out<00:07:17.909> the<00:07:18.000> TV

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:18.550 
doesn't drown out the TV

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.910 
doesn't drown out the TV
but<00:07:18.840> it's<00:07:19.840> actually<00:07:20.140> a<00:07:20.170> lot<00:07:20.320> brighter<00:07:20.620> on<00:07:20.770> the

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:20.920 
but it's actually a lot brighter on the

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.160 
but it's actually a lot brighter on the
camera<00:07:21.220> than<00:07:21.370> it<00:07:21.490> is<00:07:21.610> in<00:07:21.760> person<00:07:22.180> and<00:07:22.420> I<00:07:23.020> guess

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:23.170 
camera than it is in person and I guess

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.810 
camera than it is in person and I guess
I<00:07:23.290> got<00:07:23.440> to<00:07:23.470> clean<00:07:23.740> off<00:07:23.890> these<00:07:24.040> bulbs<00:07:24.340> already

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:24.820 
I got to clean off these bulbs already

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.350 
I got to clean off these bulbs already
did<00:07:25.090> wipe<00:07:25.330> them<00:07:25.480> down<00:07:25.630> once<00:07:25.960> but<00:07:27.150> it's<00:07:28.150> a<00:07:28.210> lot

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 
did wipe them down once but it's a lot

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.760 
did wipe them down once but it's a lot
darker<00:07:28.630> on<00:07:28.960> this<00:07:29.110> side<00:07:29.290> than<00:07:29.470> it<00:07:29.500> is<00:07:29.740> over

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:29.770 
darker on this side than it is over

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.550 
darker on this side than it is over
there<00:07:30.040> as<00:07:30.160> you<00:07:30.280> can<00:07:30.430> see<00:07:30.750> but<00:07:31.750> still<00:07:32.350> really

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 
there as you can see but still really

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.200 
there as you can see but still really
cool<00:07:32.920> you<00:07:33.130> know<00:07:33.160> those<00:07:33.400> don't<00:07:33.610> suck<00:07:33.880> hardly

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:34.210 
cool you know those don't suck hardly

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:35.610 
cool you know those don't suck hardly
any<00:07:34.300> power<00:07:34.540> so<00:07:34.870> those<00:07:34.990> things<00:07:35.200> will<00:07:35.320> probably

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:35.620 
any power so those things will probably

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.940 
any power so those things will probably
be<00:07:35.740> on<00:07:36.300> you<00:07:37.300> know<00:07:37.420> all<00:07:37.660> night<00:07:38.080> or<00:07:38.620> I<00:07:38.680> haven't

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.630 
figured out what lighting schedule i'm
going<00:07:40.540> to<00:07:40.600> do<00:07:40.660> probably<00:07:40.960> do<00:07:41.200> the<00:07:41.640> power

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:42.640 
going to do probably do the power

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.820 
going to do probably do the power
compacts<00:07:43.090> that<00:07:43.270> or<00:07:43.450> i'm<00:07:43.660> sorry<00:07:43.870> the<00:07:44.440> metal

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:44.830 
compacts that or i'm sorry the metal

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.470 
compacts that or i'm sorry the metal
halides<00:07:45.160> at<00:07:45.310> night<00:07:45.490> because<00:07:46.240> they're

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:46.480 
halides at night because they're

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.620 
halides at night because they're
annoying<00:07:47.670> to<00:07:48.670> be<00:07:48.700> on<00:07:48.970> you<00:07:49.270> know<00:07:49.390> if<00:07:49.480> you're

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:49.630 
annoying to be on you know if you're

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.200 
annoying to be on you know if you're
watching<00:07:49.960> TV<00:07:50.380> or<00:07:50.500> something<00:07:50.530> like<00:07:50.860> that<00:07:50.920> so<00:07:51.370> so

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:52.210
