00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.540 
measurement on this side to get it lined
up<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.020> I'll<00:02:10.110> show<00:02:10.320> you<00:02:10.380> on<00:02:10.800> your<00:02:11.100> side<00:02:11.340> how<00:02:11.490> to

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
up and I'll show you on your side how to

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.260 
up and I'll show you on your side how to
do<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:12.770> basically<00:02:13.770> goes<00:02:14.280> from<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.640> center<00:02:14.880> of

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
do it basically goes from the center of

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.970 
do it basically goes from the center of
our<00:02:15.750> front<00:02:15.990> bar<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.380> center<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.770> our<00:02:19.920> rear

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
our front bar to the center of our rear

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.260 
our front bar to the center of our rear
bar<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.730> measurements<00:02:21.330> 27<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:23.060> 9/16<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.180> an

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
bar this measurements 27 and 9/16 of an

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.930 
bar this measurements 27 and 9/16 of an
inch<00:02:25.040> we<00:02:26.040> do<00:02:26.190> this<00:02:26.340> measurement<00:02:26.670> on<00:02:26.880> both

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
inch we do this measurement on both

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.490 
inch we do this measurement on both
sides<00:02:27.120> just<00:02:27.630> like<00:02:27.750> we<00:02:27.900> did<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.080> one<00:02:28.260> on<00:02:28.410> the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
sides just like we did the one on the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.320 
sides just like we did the one on the
front<00:02:28.650> that's<00:02:29.430> going<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.670> make<00:02:29.820> sure<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.030> we

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
front that's going to make sure that we

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.640 
front that's going to make sure that we
have<00:02:30.510> our<00:02:30.690> feet<00:02:30.870> in<00:02:31.020> line<00:02:31.050> with<00:02:31.200> each<00:02:31.380> other

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
have our feet in line with each other

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.320 
have our feet in line with each other
but<00:02:32.070> also<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.610> our<00:02:32.640> bars<00:02:32.940> are<00:02:33.120> running

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
but also that our bars are running

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.840 
but also that our bars are running
parallel<00:02:33.770> that<00:02:34.770> becomes<00:02:35.130> important<00:02:35.610> when<00:02:35.640> we

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
parallel that becomes important when we

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.570 
parallel that becomes important when we
start<00:02:36.090> adding<00:02:36.240> accessories<00:02:37.220> down<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.370> line

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
start adding accessories down the line

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.290 
start adding accessories down the line
makes<00:02:39.090> our<00:02:39.240> lives<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.570> lot<00:02:39.750> easier<00:02:41.090> I'm<00:02:42.090> gonna

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
makes our lives a lot easier I'm gonna

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.600 
makes our lives a lot easier I'm gonna
position<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.080> where<00:02:43.110> pads<00:02:44.070> are<00:02:44.280> sitting

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
position it to where pads are sitting

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.610 
position it to where pads are sitting
right<00:02:45.209> along<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.690> contours<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.410> roof

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
right along the contours of the roof

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.100 
right along the contours of the roof
they<00:02:47.490> make<00:02:47.700> individual<00:02:48.330> pads<00:02:48.630> for<00:02:48.959> all

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
they make individual pads for all

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.100 
they make individual pads for all
different<00:02:49.350> types<00:02:49.770> of<00:02:49.950> applications<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.110> it's

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
different types of applications so it's

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.390 
different types of applications so it's
nice<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.320> it's<00:02:52.680> actually<00:02:52.950> going<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.130> fit

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
nice that it's actually going to fit

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.220 
nice that it's actually going to fit
your<00:02:53.940> vehicle<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.570> it's<00:02:54.720> not<00:02:54.870> just<00:02:55.110> a

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
your vehicle and it's not just a

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.720
